"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Rap as a whole."
"__MUSIC__ I think Rap hits home to the lower class the struggling family and mostly the kids of those families."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well a lot of what rap is about is speaking the truth and saying it in a public way."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think rap is misunderstood?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was at one point but not anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I remember the 90s when it was just becoming it's own the public thought it was wrong."
"__MUSIC__ Not the kids or the younger generation though."
"__MUSIC__ They saw it for what it really was the real world that nobody would speak about."
"__MUSIC__ I think Rap as a whole has improved our world and brought a light on the darkness that was hidden for so long."
"__MUSIC__ I can't agree more especially on police corruption and the poor life in general."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad Rap has progressed beyond what it was at first."
"__MUSIC__ I do too that was a scary time for everyone."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad it also survived and thrived."
"__MUSIC__ If it wasn't for rappers like N.W.A, Eminem, Biggie, Tupac i'm not sure if it would have."
"__MUSIC__ Tupac was iconic and not just because of his death the man preached good while speaking the truth."
"__MUSIC__ He was what Rap embodied in spirit."
"__MUSIC__ That's very true I just wish he had lived long enough to see the world now and so he could show us more of his music."
"__MUSIC__ I can only imagine what he could have created."
"__MUSIC__ He was a genius."
