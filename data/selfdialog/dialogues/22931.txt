"__DISNEY__ I got all misty eyed this morning when I was flipping channels."
"__DISNEY__ Why, what's wrong?"
"__DISNEY__ Nothing, really. Just thinking back to when the kids were small."
"__DISNEY__ I get it. Was a kid show on?"
"__DISNEY__ Winnie The Pooh and the Hundred Acre Woods."
"__DISNEY__ Your son loved Pooh, didn't he?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, we put the movie in every night at bedtime."
"__DISNEY__ He used to sing the songs didn't he?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes he did."
"__DISNEY__ I remember all the stuffed Pooh Bears in your house."
