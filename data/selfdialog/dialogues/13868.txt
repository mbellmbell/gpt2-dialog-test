"__BASKETBALL__ So I guess the finals will be Warriors vs Cavs again, huh?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess so. I can't believe how awful these conference finals have been!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Every game has been a blow out."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not only that, the Spurs and Celtics both lost their best player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah, right. Spurs haven't had Kawhi since game 1, Celtics just lost IT for the rest of the play-offs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean I'm sure the Warriors and Cavs were winning anyway, but these games aren't even competitive."
"__BASKETBALL__ It sucks, but what can you do? Guys are resting all season but you can't stop in game injuries."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly. And that whole resting thing needs to stop. Guys are going to get injured."
"__BASKETBALL__ I just hope the finals aren't the same way. One major injury could be the deciding factor."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. Both teams need to stay healthy so we can finally get a competitve series in this play-offs."
"__BASKETBALL__ So who do you got anyway? Cavs or Warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, Warriors for sure. Kevin Love won't show up for the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow, you think so? I thought he was decent last year. I'm more worried about Durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, he did kind of disappear when OKC made the finals, but he's much more mature now."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm also interested in seeing if Draymond Green can keep his hot head under control."
"__BASKETBALL__ No way. That guy is as animated as they come. I doubt he does anything for a suspension, but he WILL be loud every game."
"__BASKETBALL__ So that's your only reason? Kevin Love? You don't think the Warriors are just better?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I just don't think LeBron can handle it all on his own. Kyrie will step up but they really need Kevin Love this year now that the Warriors are even more loaded."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess so. I still don't think anyone is stopping LeBron. He will average a triple double in the finals, I guarantee it."
"__BASKETBALL__ We'll so about that."
