"__MUSIC__ Hey, who's that playing on the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ That's The Tom Thumb band"
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of them.  They're pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they really swing.  They were around in the mid 30's"
"__MUSIC__ Some of that Big Band sound.  Maybe I've heard them after all and didn't know it."
"__MUSIC__ It's that way with a lot of the bands from back then.  A lot of them sound the same at times"
"__MUSIC__ I like Jazz and Swing but the names of the bands and songs just don't stick with me."
"__MUSIC__ Some of the old greats is easy for me to pick out but there's a lot that I don't know either."
"__MUSIC__ Do you go see any jazz here in town?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah.  I've seen some good local bands like the Milk Toast orchestra and Franky and the Hoot Owls."
"__MUSIC__ I've seen Franky before.  He was with the Bluecoat's though.  Haven't seen Milk Toast though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, their great.  They are playing next Saturday at the Pole Hole.  Wanna go?"
"__MUSIC__ Really, yeah.  That would be great.  I haven't seen any live music in a while."
"__MUSIC__ Excellent.  I'll pick up four tickets and you can buy dinner.  Sound good."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, that sounds good.  The Pole Hole's got good food to go with the good music."
"__MUSIC__ Great.  The last time I saw Milk Toast was there and they played three sets.  We stayed for all three."
"__MUSIC__ Did you dance?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, you can't go listen to Milk Toast without getting happy feet."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Cindy loves to dance so that will be perfect."
"__MUSIC__ Here let me lend you their latest CD so you can play it for Cindy before we go see them."
