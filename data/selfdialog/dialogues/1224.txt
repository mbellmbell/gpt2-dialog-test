"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the news about Radiohead releasing a 20th anniversary edition of OK Computer?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, that's one of my favorite records of all time!"
"__MUSIC__ It has 3 songs that have never been released before. I'm excited to hear the song 'Lift.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's great news. They have some fantastic experimental B-sides that never made the cut for that album."
"__MUSIC__ I've already pre-ordered the vinyl. We should throw a listening party when I get it."
"__MUSIC__ Alright. Do you have a favorite Radiohead album?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm old school so my favorite is The Bends."
"__MUSIC__ I can dig that. I think my favorite is Kid A - I really like the electronic sound."
"__MUSIC__ They've certainly evolved over the years into new genres. Sometimes it gets a little too out there for my tastes."
"__MUSIC__ Another artist like that is Bjork. Here early stuff was a lot more melodic but then it just got weirder and weirder."
"__MUSIC__ I'm a fan of hers. Did you know she even recorded a duet with Thom Yorke from Radiohead?"
"__MUSIC__ I know that one. It was called 'I've Seen It All' from the soundtrack to her movie Dancer in the Dark."
"__MUSIC__ Bjork's definitely had an interesting career. I think it's hard for an artist to stay fresh and surprising over many decades."
"__MUSIC__ Her music videos have also been some of the most creative over the years. I really like the one for 'Human Behavior.'"
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of creative videos, Gorillaz is back with a new album called Humanz."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool, they are an awesome band. I love the concept of having animated characters playing their songs."
"__MUSIC__ I say there is also room for more weirdness in pop music to keep pushing back from the commercial aspect."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame David Bowie passed away - he really paved the way in terms of blurring the line between fantasy and reality with his musical persona."
"__MUSIC__ Thankfully there are new artists taking up his mantle. Some people may not like Lady Gaga but at least she is exploring the boundaries of art."
"__MUSIC__ You said it. I think the future of music is going to be an exciting journey."
