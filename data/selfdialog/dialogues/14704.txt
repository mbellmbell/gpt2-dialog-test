"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi, how are you today?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I am great, even though it's a Monday."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What did you do this weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not much, but I did go see Guardians of the Galaxy!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You mean the second one?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, it was even more retro feeling than the first.  I loved it!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Was Chris Pratt  as fantastic in this one?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, and there was a Baby Groot in the whole film.  He was adorable."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ As adorable as Chris Pratt?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not quite, but almost.  I think it was a good set up for the next movie as well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What do you mean?  Guardians of the Galaxy 3?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, either that or a huge tie in to the Avengers.  I'm just waiting for Thor to knock in at some point."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I could handle some Chris Hemsworth in a movie with Chris Pratt."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, that would be awesome.  You know how they are connected, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not really, except they are all in the same universe or something like that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There's these things called the Infinity Stones which a big bad guy called Thanos is trying to get."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh.  And the pair of Chris's are going to stop him?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, the two Chris's and about 70 other people, probably in a movie called Infinity War."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's the next Avenger's movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes.  Anyway, go see  Guardians of the Galaxy 2, you'll love it."
