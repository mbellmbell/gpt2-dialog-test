"__MUSIC__ Do you like ambient at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Somewhat, I prefer electronic ambient to the more new age ambient."
"__MUSIC__ Then you should listen to Marconi Union or Brian Eno."
"__MUSIC__ Should I listen to both, or just one?"
"__MUSIC__ I prefer Marconi Union because they incorporate jazz instrumentals into their music but Eno is great too."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really like jazz that much, what about Eno?"
"__MUSIC__ He's more traditional ambient, some even say he founded the genre."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I like musicians who are at the cutting edge."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah his music is fairly experimental."
"__MUSIC__ Does he use a synthesizer for everything?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, well he incorporates piano too but mostly that."
"__MUSIC__ It seems like he must collaborate a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he worked with Harold Budd on an album."
"__MUSIC__ What does he play?"
"__MUSIC__ He's more of a neoclassical composer, so their music together is more like classical music."
"__MUSIC__ I think I might like his music, especially the albums with Eno."
"__MUSIC__ Eno has some amazing songs like Thursday Afternoon, it's a song which is literally an entire album long."
"__MUSIC__ How could it be that long, is the album just really long?"
"__MUSIC__ No the song takes up the entire album length, it's a great piece though."
"__MUSIC__ I'll listen to it then, thanks."
