"__DISNEY__ Yes. I grew up on them, I brought my niece to most of them now I want to show her son how great they are."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean, it's a right of passage."
"__DISNEY__ I may start with 101 Dalmatians. He loves puppies."
"__DISNEY__ And Dalmatians are the cutest!"
"__DISNEY__ It's a fun movie, I'd want him to see live version with Glen Clse also, But when he's older. She was so good it was scary!"
