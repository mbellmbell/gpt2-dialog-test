"__MOVIES__ Kenny have you heard the news?"
"__MOVIES__ what news?"
"__MOVIES__ paul walker."
"__MOVIES__ oh yes man that is what we even discussing at work, its so sad"
"__MOVIES__ very sad indeed, and i heard he still had unfinished scenes on the 'fast and furious 8'."
"__MOVIES__ yes he was meant to be on set the next day before the fatal accident."
"__MOVIES__ i wonder how the movie producer would overturn this,you think they would scrap it?"
"__MOVIES__ i don't think so,my colleague here was saying his youngest brother looks very much like him, so its possible they might use him to fill in those shoot."
"__MOVIES__ that is a hard try, he cannot be like paul walker."
"__MOVIES__ very true but i think too much have been invested to scrap the movie totally as  it is said the movie was almost done."
"__MOVIES__ may be probably they would change the story line and make it seem like he went for a car race that took is life and then link it back the the original script."
"__MOVIES__ that could be a better option, although fast and furious would be nothing without paul walker on it so my guess would be that this might be the last 'Fast and furious'  we would ever see."
"__MOVIES__ i wouldn't conclude so,although i love paul walker but van diesel is the one i look forward to seeing each time a new 'fast and furious' is released."
"__MOVIES__ yes van diesel is a good actor won't even argue that, in fact the casts of fast and furious are good."
"__MOVIES__ they are, going forward they might change up the story line without Paul walker on it, but its yet to see how a future 'fast and furious' without Paul walker would be accepted."
"__MOVIES__ man that would be a big gamble though, if they can pull this one off with him missing at the end i would suggest they just end the series."
"__MOVIES__ sad though, i always look forward to every part of 'fast and furious' seen from part 1 - 8 and it never gets repetitive"
"__MOVIES__ me too i have seen all part and each part has its own twist so it doesn't come off being boring."
"__MOVIES__ well i would be anticipating to see 8 now as i want to see how they would pull it off."
"__MOVIES__ me too. oh my boss is in now,lets chat later."
