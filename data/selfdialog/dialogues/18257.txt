"__MOVIES__ Hey, what's up?  You won't believe what movie we watched last night."
"__MOVIES__ What was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Harry Potter!  I finally jumped on the bandwagon."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, I can't believe you've never seen that movie!  Which one, the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, we watched the Sorcerer's Stone but it was so good we started the next one right after it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they are truly great.  It's neat how similar they are to the books."
"__MOVIES__ I know!  That's why we wanted to see them, was to see if it was how we visualized it."
"__MOVIES__ Who'd you watch it with, your family?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, we all watched it together."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome.  I think the only disappointing thing is how much is left out of the plots."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but there's so much there's no way they could include everything."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I know.  But I still would've liked to see a lot that wasn't there."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know what you mean.  Did you think Harry and Hermione were well cast?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Hermione didn't look quite like I imagined her but Harry was dead on."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought Hermione was dead on too.  And Professor Snape was exactly how I pictured him!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh not me!  But Dumbledore was exactly as I imagined."
"__MOVIES__ Well overall they really did a good job casting the characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think so.  It must've cost a fortune to produce."
"__MOVIES__ I bet, with all the complicated scenery."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Well it sure generated enough revenue to make a profit, though!"
