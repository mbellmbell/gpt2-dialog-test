"__MOVIES__ What do you think of movies that were based on books?"
"__MOVIES__ It depends if they truly follow the book."
"__MOVIES__ The Twilight movies were based on books."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I thought the books were better though."
"__MOVIES__ They were still a good series of movies though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I agree, Twilight was a huge franchise."
"__MOVIES__ A lot of Stephen King books were made into movies as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have seen almost every movie that was based on his book."
"__MOVIES__ I agree though, his books are way better than the movies."
"__MOVIES__ I hear there is a remake of IT."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing can beat that book, even the original IT did not do so well following the book."
"__MOVIES__ It was still a great movie though. I bet the remake will be good."
"__MOVIES__ Stephen King said they did a fantastic job on the remake."
"__MOVIES__ It comes out this fall I believe, are you going to go see the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, I am excited to see how well the movie came out."
"__MOVIES__ It may be too scary for me, I do not know if I can watch it or not."
"__MOVIES__ That is what makes it so good, a movie that can scare you is a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know it is not real, but still can give me nightmares."
"__MOVIES__ It is probably best you do not watch the remake of IT then."
"__MOVIES__ I may or may not go see it."
