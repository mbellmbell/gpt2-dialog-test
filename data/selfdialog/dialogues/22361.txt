"__DISNEY__ Did you prefer Cinderella or Snow White?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow that's like choosing between my favorite children, Cinderella if forced to choose."
"__DISNEY__ Interesting, I'm firmly in the Snow White camp, why do you prefer Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess the story just seemed better, had a certain level of magic with the shoes and the the evil step sister were brilliant."
"__DISNEY__ I would argue that the seven dwarves supercede anything in Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ Don't get me wrong, they were the best part of Snow White, but still Cinderella was better."
"__DISNEY__ But if there wasn't a Snow White, there may have never been a Cinderella, so that should trump everything else."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good point, Snow White did come first, I would simply state that Disney's storytelling only got better."
"__DISNEY__ No way Snow White was the first and is still the pinnacle of the Disney Princesses."
"__DISNEY__ I would throw a curve ball of sorts and say that Sleeping Beauty is better than both."
