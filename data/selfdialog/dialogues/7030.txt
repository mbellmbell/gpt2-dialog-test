"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hey! Did you see the last playoff game between the Penguins and the Capitols?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh, yeah! The Penguins really beat the Caps bad!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know what you mean! I was really surprised the game played out the way it did."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too! The Caps just never seemed ever to get going. It was Pittsburgh's game to lose the whole night."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think you right. Maybe the Caps just didn't have it in them for another comeback."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that totally could be it. It seemed like they used up a lot of their momentum just to progress the series and get to last night."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think your right again. Pittsburgh just seemed better rested and prepared, even though the Caps played hard in the previous game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think so. Wow, the Caps must be pretty disappointed, right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ For sure! Especially when it looked like they right come from behind in the series. They seem to really struggle in the Post Season."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know what you mean. They seem to be able to reach the playoff no problem, but being a deep threat just hasn't been happening for them over the past couple seasons."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right about that. It is kind of depressing that they seem so close, and yet so far away."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ For sure! Do you think they will opt for new leadership after another disappointing post-season?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe. I'm not sure if coaching is really their problem though."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I know what you mean. They seem to have all the right pieces, they just can't get them all on the same page."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think that might be exactly it. At least the Penguins might be exciting moving forward. You think they can make the finals again?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I can't say for sure, but they sure look like they are hot right now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right about that! Ottawa's tough though, and it looks like that's who the Penguins will get next round."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's true. It could be a really awesome series!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Totally! I can't wait!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too! Let's go Pens!!!"
