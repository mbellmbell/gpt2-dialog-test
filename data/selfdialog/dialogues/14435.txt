"__HORROR__ Did you see the movie, The Babadook?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, that is probably one of the scariest movies I have ever seen."
"__HORROR__ Do you remember the part when its standing in the kitchen?"
"__HORROR__ God yes, that part freaked me out so bad. I kept thinking, why are you just staring at it lady, run!"
"__HORROR__ Haha, I know right. I would have left that house to try to get away from the memories haunting me."
"__HORROR__ That was so weird that they made a plot twist like that, even though they kind of hinted at it."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, the only thing I don't understand was the worms at the end of the movie."
"__HORROR__ I didn't really understand that either, but I think it was symbolic of them learning to feed their negative memories and keep them around, but not give in to them."
"__HORROR__ I never looked at it that way, that's a pretty interesting hypothesis."
"__HORROR__ Thanks, I actually read a lot about the movie so I didn't make that up on my own."
