"__ROCK__ Did you see that Queen is going out on tour?"
"__ROCK__ That's so strange given that half the band isn't with them."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, but at least you get to hear them playing the classics."
"__ROCK__ True, and Adam Lambert's voice works well with rock."
"__ROCK__ I'm hoping to get tickets."
"__ROCK__ Do you have a favorite Queen LP?"
