"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that George Lucas didn't originally write Luke and Leia to be twin siblings?"
"__STAR_WARS__ How do you know that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I read the script for the first Star Wars. Luke was introduced as being 20 years old, and Leia was introduced as being 16."
"__STAR_WARS__ So the love interest angle that they hinted at in Star Wars, that was the point originally."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right. It was only after the huge success of Star Wars, and the plans for a sequel, that Lucas retconned Luke and Leia into being twins."
"__STAR_WARS__ Actually, that was a really good storyline. I loved it in Empire and Return of the Jedi when Leia could sense Luke through the Force."
"__STAR_WARS__ And in Empire, we all just thought it was the Force - not that the two of them were bonded as siblings."
"__STAR_WARS__ It made for an interesting love triangle, until it was revealed that the two were siblings."
"__STAR_WARS__ Too bad Lucas didn't stop the retconning there. The way he reworked the whole mother's death part in order to do it his new stupid way in the prequel trilogy, that was really lame."
"__STAR_WARS__ You won't get any argument from me there. I much prefer the backstory Leia revealed in Return of the Jedi - better than anything in the  prequel movies, yuck."
