"__LADY_GAGA__ And what about Lady Gaga? You like her?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah. Love her. Such an amazing singer, to start with."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah. And an amazing performer as well. She looks like the real thing you know. Real intense."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She does. It's funny how someone who is all about costumes and disguises can feel so authentic at the same time."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It is, really. But I feel like a lot of her songs are clearly about her, and the way she lives her life."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes. With all the confusion, hubris and craziness it involves."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really. And she does make it real - the power trips, the crazy partying and the loneliness, and the weird way to interact with people that it all generates."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's good at craziness. Really good at showing it too. Her videos are something else."
"__LADY_GAGA__ They're so incredible! I love the video for Applause. It's mesmerizing."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know! It's insane and it's fascinating - and beautiful!"
