"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How excited are you for the Patriots this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, I am so stoked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am too! What's your prediction for their record?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they could go anywhere from 10-6 to 16-0. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're going 16-0!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have a chance! Back to back Super Bowls?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be so awesome. They've added so many players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I'm most excited about Brandin Cooks. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cooks is gonna be nasty in this offense. I'm excited about a healthy Gronk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Bennett was good in his absence last year but Gronk is the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm also stoked about our new running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I think Gillislee is going to be great. I don't know much about Burkhead though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Burkhead will be just fine. They can't keep all those backs though, who do you think gets cut?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think DJ Foster is gonna be the odd man out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I do too. I'm also excited about the secondary. Two number one cornerbacks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gilmore and Butler are going to dominate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where's the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's in Minnesota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always wanted to go to Minneapolis. If the Patriots get in, wanna go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd love to. We'll see though. Hopefully they make it."
