"__THRILLER__ I think one thriller that is slightly underrated is The Butterfly Effect with Ashton Kutcher from 2004. Have you seen it?"
"__THRILLER__ I have not seen that, honestly. Ashton Kutcher doing a thriller movie, really?"
"__THRILLER__ I was caught off guard by it, as well. But when I saw it for the first time back then, I thought it was pretty good."
"__THRILLER__ Does it still hold up after all of these years, including Kutcher's performance?"
"__THRILLER__ I still think the movie is fine if you take out the college rock music from that time period."
"__THRILLER__ What's the film about exactly?"
"__THRILLER__ A young college kid played by Kutcher, discovers he is able to travel through time and does so in attempt to make life better for he and his friends."
"__THRILLER__ That doesn't sound like too bad of a plot. Is it really Sci-Fi like?"
"__THRILLER__ Actually, no. While it is a thriller, there is also some decent drama in it."
"__THRILLER__ I am definitely interested in this movie and may just check it out sometime."
