"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Arcade Fire song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Didn't it get released yesterday?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. They released a short tease for it first."
"__MUSIC__ I love the sound. It's a nice blend of their last album the their earlier work."
"__MUSIC__ I completely agree. I felt their last album Reflektor was missing the melodies that I loved on the first three albums."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think they wanted to try something new."
"__MUSIC__ That's fair and understandable. Usually happens to artists who win Grammy's like they have."
"__MUSIC__ Right. They suddenly feel the pressure to do something bigger and better next time."
"__MUSIC__ Usually with mixed results, as in the case of Reflektor."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't really like it to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. There were a few stand out tracks, particularly the singles, but a lot of filler."
"__MUSIC__ It felt much more like a jam session than a polished album. I had become used to their high production value."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! And the shame is, it was produced by James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem."
"__MUSIC__ LCD Soundsystem is one of my all time favorite bands."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. So you would think that two of my favorite artists working together would make a really great album, but sadly, no."
"__MUSIC__ Well, we've heard new songs from both artists now and both sound great."
"__MUSIC__ I'm very excited for both the new Arcade Fire and LCD Soundsystem albums."
"__MUSIC__ I was a little worried when I heard the other Arcade Fire song that released a few months ago."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, 'I Give You Power'. I think that was a one off thing, commenting on the election."
"__MUSIC__ It's an okay track. It feels more like Gorillaz than Arcade Fire."
