"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Boba Fett died too easily in 'Return of the Jedi?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, definitely.  He is supposed to be the most dangerous Bounty Hunter in the galaxy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly.  Yet, his death was almost comical."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was very much a gag.  They built up Boba's reputation way too much for it to end that way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also, if you think about it, he really didn't get that much total screen time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Come to think of it, you're right.  In fact, Jango from the prequel series got way more screen time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish we could have seen more of Boba."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it says a lot about the iconic nature of the character, by the fact that despite his few appearances, he's so recognizable."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree.  They probably could have done so much more with the character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Perhaps we'll get a standalone Boba Fett movie one day."
