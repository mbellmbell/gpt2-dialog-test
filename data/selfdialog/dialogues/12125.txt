"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you looked at any of the NFL schedulet yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I have not. Any good matchups?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw the Cowboys and Raiders play one week.  Don't you like the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, what a good matchup base on last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, they are two up and coming teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas lost a lot on defense, but their offense is good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that the Raiders will move to Las Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there are some road blocks with the owners on the move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like what issues?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a lot has to do with the TV market in the bay area.  It's a lot larger than Las Vegas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the NFL does make tons of money from ads."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do and all of the owners know it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is probably why they let the Rams and Chargers move to Los Angeles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without a doubt.  St. Louis was a small market for an NFL team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really liked the Rams when Kurt Warner was there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The greatest show on turf!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a nice little run with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they did.  Won two Super Bowls I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now they have an empty stadium in St. Louis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully they can use it for college or high school events."
