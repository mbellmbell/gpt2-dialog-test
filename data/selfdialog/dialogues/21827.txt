"__DISNEY__ Are you going to go see Cars 3?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I've been waiting for it to come out."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! Lightning McQueen and Mater are two of my favorite characters."
"__DISNEY__ Who would have ever thought that automobile characters could be so entertaining?!"
"__DISNEY__ I was hesitant about seeing the second Cars movie because I didn't think it could be as good as the first one."
"__DISNEY__ I know I was too. Disney has a way to make sequels great too."
"__DISNEY__ That's what I love about Disney!"
"__DISNEY__ Disney definitely has a way of making great movies!"
"__DISNEY__ Do you want to go see Cars 3 together tomorrow?"
"__DISNEY__ That sounds great!"
