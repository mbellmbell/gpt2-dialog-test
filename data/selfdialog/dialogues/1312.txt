"__MUSIC__ What are some songs from your childhood?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, I listened to a lot of rap so it's hard to say"
"__MUSIC__ If you had to just pick one song for me to listen to, what would you pick?"
"__MUSIC__ I really liked Wasn't Me by Shaggy"
"__MUSIC__ What is it about?"
"__MUSIC__ It's about a guy who got caught cheating"
"__MUSIC__ That's all?"
"__MUSIC__ Well he keeps denying it despite lots of evidence that his girlfriend has"
"__MUSIC__ That's odd. You listened to it as a kid?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I didn't know what the words meant?"
"__MUSIC__ What are some funny lines from the song?"
"__MUSIC__ He sang something like 'Caught me banging in the shower, wasn't me'"
"__MUSIC__ That's funny. When did you listen to that song last?"
"__MUSIC__ Not since like 2010. I don't really like it anymore"
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Shaggy has a harsh Jamaican accent that makes it hard to understand"
"__MUSIC__ That probably helped you not understand the words when you were younger"
"__MUSIC__ That and I just didn't know what the suggestive lyrics were talking about"
"__MUSIC__ What is Shaggy up to now?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure, he hasn't made any songs for years as far as I know!"
