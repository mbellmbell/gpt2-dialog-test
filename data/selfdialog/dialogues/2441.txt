"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite current female singer?"
"__MUSIC__ Holy crap, that's touch. There's so many."
"__MUSIC__ Thoughs?"
"__MUSIC__ Sarah Bareilles, Sia, Adele, Lady Gaga..."
"__MUSIC__ Sia and Adele I can understand. Gaga is just obnoxious. And who is Sarah Bareilles?"
"__MUSIC__ Gaga's obnoxiousness is behind her and doesn't have anything to do with her talent."
"__MUSIC__ She's not that good."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to her? She can do any style and is classically trained!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah right."
"__MUSIC__ No really, she studied at Julliard. She also sings country and metal."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, still that meat dress..."
"__MUSIC__ That has nothing to do with it."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, Sarah?"
"__MUSIC__ Sarah Bareilles is a fantastic singer who usually performs just small venues."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like she's not well-known."
"__MUSIC__ No, everyone knows her music. 'Brave' was her big hit, and she has a lot on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Her concert venues sound pretty hipster."
"__MUSIC__ I like her. She doesn't need $200 million to be happy. She tours when she wants and doesn't have crazy concerts."
"__MUSIC__ I prefer Ariana Grande."
"__MUSIC__ You're 37. That's really, really weird."
