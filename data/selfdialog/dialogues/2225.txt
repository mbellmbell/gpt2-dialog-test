"__MUSIC__ Did you hear the Insyderz got back together?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I haven't listened to any new stuff of theirs."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither, I'm pretty much stuck in the 90's as far as music is concerned."
"__MUSIC__ That's when they were best! I still listen to my Fight of My Life CD."
"__MUSIC__ Ahh, man that one's good. Jigsaw gets stuck in my head all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. Which do you prefer, Fight of My Life or Motor City Ska?"
"__MUSIC__ I kind of prefer Motor City Ska. The overall sound plus is has a few of my favourite songs on it."
"__MUSIC__ Which ones?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Carnival and I say."
"__MUSIC__ I think those are some of the best written and arranged songs of theirs."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. I really admire Joe Yerke's musicianship even if his other ventures are disappointing."
"__MUSIC__ What you do mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well he became a cop, sadly. But I still like his music and listen to Motor City Ska all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to Skalleluia?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Skalleluia Too! Though I prefer the first one."
"__MUSIC__ There were a lot of good ones on that."
"__MUSIC__ I really like their rendition of 'Lord I Lift Your Name on High' and 'True of You'."
"__MUSIC__ True of You sounded a bit dark to me."
"__MUSIC__ To me too, not in a bad way."
"__MUSIC__ Gosh I love the Insyderz."
