"__LADY_GAGA__ I spent all yesterday night watching old Lady Gaga videos."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes. I was just feeling really down, and her music always makes me feel really strong."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I can see that. Any songs in particular?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love Born This Way and Applause."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Applause is my wake-up alarm song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What a good idea to wake up to something that gets you ready to meet the day!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly. I like how a lot of her songs have the theme of being yourself."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. She just owns it. She doesn't seem to follow trends."
"__LADY_GAGA__ No. Lady Gaga sets the trends."
