"__MOVIES__ I really can't wait for the new Star Wars movie, coming out soon."
"__MOVIES__ How soon is soon, though?"
"__MOVIES__ It should be coming around December of 2017."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, this year, huh? That's pretty exciting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, for sure. I really did like the last one."
"__MOVIES__ You mean, The Force Awakens?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, the last Star Wars movie was Rogue One. It wasn't part of the main series but it was great."
"__MOVIES__ I must have missed that one. It was really that good?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought so. It had a great plot and cast."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in it? Anyone I know?"
"__MOVIES__ Felicity Jones? Diego Luna?"
"__MOVIES__ Hm, that doesn't really ring any bells to me."
"__MOVIES__ How about Ben Mendelsohn?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know him actually. He's pretty good, usually."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's definately worth a watch."
"__MOVIES__ I better watch it then, before that new one comes out."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. You wanna be all caught up for December."
"__MOVIES__ I take it you're going opening day, are you?"
"__MOVIES__ Bingo. We better get ready to camp out for tickets on opening day."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, you better be kidding about that."
