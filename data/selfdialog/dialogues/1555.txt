"__MUSIC__ What's the most important part of any rock band?"
"__MUSIC__ The most important part, you mean instrument-wise?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Which instrument/part matters the most to you when you're listening."
"__MUSIC__ I'd have to say the singer. The first thing I hear when I listen to a song is the vocals."
"__MUSIC__ That's the most important?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, I mean you identify bands a lot of the time by listening to their vocals. Would Guns n' Roses be the same without Axle's voice?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I'd probably like them better without it but I see your point. Still, isn't rock music really about the beat?"
"__MUSIC__ Most music is about the beat, or has one anyway."
"__MUSIC__ So wouldn't that make the drumming the most important part? That steady 4-beat is what drives a song."
"__MUSIC__ But all of the parts are going in rhythm, not just the drums."
"__MUSIC__ True, but if one thing is the road and the other things just drive down the road which one is picking the direction?"
"__MUSIC__ Ok so maybe the drums are the beat-makers but do you ever listen to a song and ignore the rest just to hear the drums?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Keith Moon, the Who's drummer was amazing to listen to!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok but when I listen to Pinball Wizard I'm hearing the words and the lyrics. The drumming can be as excellent as it wants but it's still in the background."
"__MUSIC__ Just because something isn't the first thing you hear doesn't make it less important though."
"__MUSIC__ It does to me. When I listen to a band if I don't like the singer I don't even want to hear the rest of the band."
"__MUSIC__ Why? The band could be amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ Because if the singer's no good and their vocals are right in front of me the whole time I'm going to be too annoyed to like the rest of the band."
"__MUSIC__ So the singer really is it for you then?"
"__MUSIC__ The first thing I hear, and the thing I judge bands by. Absolutely."
