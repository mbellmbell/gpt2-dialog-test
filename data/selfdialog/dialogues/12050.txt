"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was reading the other day about Terrell Brown who plays for the St. Louis Rams. They said he weighed in at 403 pounds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right. There are some really huge players in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know some guys are that big naturally, but you just know that of lot of them have to be on steroids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, doesn't the NFL have any rules about the use of steroids?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do, and they've had them for a long time. But, you just have to believe that most of them are using steroids, and the league is just looking the other way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, there just isn't any way someone can get that big without a little help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow! Can you imagine getting hit head on by one of those guys. I'm 220 pounds, but it would still be like getting run over by a tank."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's no wonder there are so many concussions in the NFL. That's another thing they have been really good at covering up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just starting to come out now. Some of the older retired players are starting to suffer the system and are starting to talk about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of players and teams and the teams doctors knew they were playing with concussions and nobody cared."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, being a pro football player is a hard way to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. There's the pressure to be bigger, stronger and faster than the next guy. And if you don't go along with the program, you don't play and you don't make the big bucks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if I were in that position if I would decide in faver of my career, or in faver of my health."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be a tough choice. But, it's no wonder so many of the NFL players have violent episodes when their not playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Between the steroids, and the concussions, and who know what other kinds of pain killers and stimulants they're probably taking, it's a wonder any of them are sane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the NFL will ever actually start enforcing some of the rules on that type of thing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. Not as long as the fans pay to see the games. Nothing will change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your right, it's the fans that keep it going."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, by the way I've got tickets for Sundays game. You wanna go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding, I wouldn't miss it."
