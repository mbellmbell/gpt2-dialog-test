"__STAR_WARS__ So do you like Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I liked the movies okay, but I'm not like a die hard fan.  I mean, I don't buy the toys or memorize the lines or anything."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, hey, no one's perfect."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha.  Although I have to admit, some things were a bit confusing to me with the new one."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean Rogue One or The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Uh.. the one with the girl and that one black guy and the rolling ball droid."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was Force Awakens.  So, what confused you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I mean, why did that one bad guy had a cross guard on his lightsaber?  Seems like that be rather worthless."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's not explained in the film but actually, it's because the crystal he used to make his lightsaber was cracked and that caused a flaw in it's design.  Guessing he just kind of 'made it work' rather than trying it again."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ahhh... if you're too lazy to fix it, just cover it up."
