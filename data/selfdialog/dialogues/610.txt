"__MUSIC__ I can't stand today's music. Have you found anything worth listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean, everything is starting to sound like electronic garbage."
"__MUSIC__ My son thinks computer generated noise is music. I disagree."
"__MUSIC__ I miss listening to vocals AND instruments."
"__MUSIC__ Even the vocals are so distorted, I can't seem to find good actual singers."
"__MUSIC__ Surprisingly I have found a few bands and singers I like, finally."
"__MUSIC__ Please let me in on the secret, I'm sick of listening to classic rock stations."
"__MUSIC__ I absolutely love Imagine Dragons."
"__MUSIC__ What's so great about them?"
"__MUSIC__ So many of their songs sound like instant classics now, like the good old days."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have many songs though?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I seem to like everything they do. Pink is a good singer too."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really like female singers."
"__MUSIC__ Neither do I but she is really talented and writes her own songs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I like that. I know she has been around a while too."
"__MUSIC__ She is very good. If you want to listen to good pop music, Taylor Swift can be good."
"__MUSIC__ She sounds too young for me."
"__MUSIC__ I thought so too but her songs can be fun and she's another one who writes her own."
"__MUSIC__ Too often, I turn on the radio expecting rock or pop and I have to listen to hip-hop horribleness."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I am tired of it. I end up spending the whole time in the car changing the radio station."
