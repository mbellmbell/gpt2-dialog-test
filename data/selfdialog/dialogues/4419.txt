"__MUSIC__ Mom, I think you should turn the music down."
"__MUSIC__ Honey, this is Soundgarden, you can't turn it down!"
"__MUSIC__ But it's so loud!"
"__MUSIC__ It's supposed to be. This was Chris Cornell back in the 90's, his vocals were amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ Chris Cornell, the guy that died recently."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. That's why I'm listening to it, to honor his memory."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. But it's really loud."
"__MUSIC__ Wait til I get to Spoonman. I'm going to turn it up."
"__MUSIC__ Mom, no. People are looking at us at stoplights."
"__MUSIC__ Good, they are probably thinking what great music we are listening to."
"__MUSIC__ After this we'll blast some Temple of the Dog, and finish it up with Audioslave."
"__MUSIC__ I thought we were listening to that Chris guy?"
"__MUSIC__ We are, those are other bands he was in. I am the Highway by Audioslave is one of the best songs ever."
"__MUSIC__ Mom, please turn it down. People will think we're weird."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I spent the first half of my life with my parents telling me to turn it down, and now you are telling me to turn it down."
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe you should turn it down. You know, you're outvoted."
"__MUSIC__ Or maybe I should turn it up and let you get rides from Grandma everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ Grandma keeps making me listen to Bob Dylan, she says he'll change my life. But at least it's not too loud."
"__MUSIC__ It's such a burden being cooler than your kids. Oh listen, Black Hole Sun is coming up."
"__MUSIC__ I should start taking the bus."
