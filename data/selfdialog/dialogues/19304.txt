"__MOVIES__ I made a big mistake choosing a movie to watch last night."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ I took my ten year old son to watch Sausage Party."
"__MOVIES__ Sausage Party! Oh no.. that movie is NOT for children!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, tell me something I don't know. I found that out too late!"
"__MOVIES__ How far into the movie did you figure out that it wasn't for kids?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh about the time they introduced the sexy looking hotdog bun."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny but sort of horrible. Did you end up leaving the theater?"
"__MOVIES__ No way! Do you know how much movie tickets cost these days? I got my money's worth."
"__MOVIES__ Your wife must have been pretty mad at you."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's still not talking to me. Luckily my son didn't understand what was going on anyway. He just liked the funny looking talking produce."
"__MOVIES__ I actually thought it was a really funny movie. I love the character that's named after the Arab bread, Lavash."
"__MOVIES__ He was hilarious! I also love the wise old piece of gum in the wheelchair that's supposed to be Stephen Hawking."
"__MOVIES__ Seth Rogan is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood these days."
"__MOVIES__ He really is, I love most of his movies. I should have guessed this one would be an irreverant cartoon."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was pretty irreverant. Shocking, really."
"__MOVIES__ At least at the end all the food is happy and celebrating. My son liked that."
"__MOVIES__ What a feel good ending."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of made me hungry too. What do you say we throw some hot dogs on the grill?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm in!"
