"__POP__ who is your favorite pop artist?"
"__POP__ To be Honest I really like Justin Beiber as his songs are so catchy."
"__POP__ No judgement here, I realy like What Do You Mean."
"__POP__ I like that song and most of his recent work, though I am not really a fan of his early work."
"__POP__ Yeah, I am also not a fan of Baby era Beiber but he is talented."
"__POP__ Did you know he was discovered by usher?"
"__POP__ I had heard that he used to make videos on Youtube and that is how usher discovered him."
"__POP__ And then not long after that My World 2.0 was released in 2010 (not a fan of this album)."
"__POP__ I did not like that album, I was more into lady gaga and katy perry at that time."
"__POP__ They certainly dominated that year but I can see why young girls at the time fell in love with Beiber and the talent that Usher saw in him."
