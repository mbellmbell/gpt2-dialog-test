"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about all these NFL players who have been getting neurological disabilities after their careers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's really scary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's so odd how that these kind of things weren't really taken seriously."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that it was just so new considering the NFL as the sport it is today hasn't been around that long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely don't think they took stuff like concussions as serious as they do today."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it seems like back then, quarterbacks were allowed to go back into a game even after getting one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's scary to think what might happen to the quarterbacks from just even a few decades ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. You would think that they might suffer some issues."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope not. Some of them are some of my favorite players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. I hope that they're the lucky ones and don't suffer any medical issues years after their careers ended."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just glad the NFL started taking the issue seriously. Their new policies make it safer for players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I also think that they have better technology today, too, like better helmets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Some of those helmets look a lot safer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only thing I don't like is some of the new rules that they put into place when it comes to playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why don't you like it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it kind of handicaps defensive players a bit. Some of the rules seem a bit soft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can see that. But I think the NFL has too look at these players' long term health."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just wish there was a way for them to play like they used to and still have better medical resources to prevent issues later."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think that's possible but hopefully they figure out how to make the NFL safer without sacrificing the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with that."
