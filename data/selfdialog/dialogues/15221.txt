"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just realized something in Harry Potter."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What was that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That Neville Long-bottom, could have been Harry, I mean could kill Voldemort just as easily."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How do you figure that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, his parents were his enemies, Voldemort I mean."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So was most of the magical community."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, but he was also saved out of love. Just like the prophecy said would be needed."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But his parents are alive."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They are not really, they are more or less comatose.  He was able to kill Voldemort just as easily as Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wow, I just realized you are right."
