"__MUSIC__ It felt like the music in this album was so graceful!"
"__MUSIC__ It felt like the waves were actually hitting me!"
"__MUSIC__ With all of the beats and the guitar playing, heck yeah!"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, you think we can pull a stunt like this?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, we have some connections that can help us."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Platinum Records, Golden Albums, Silver songs, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Now that I think of it, we actually can!"
"__MUSIC__ It's not gonna be hard, man!"
"__MUSIC__ We just gotta practice our skills! Your bass guitar, and my drum skills will be second to none!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, we also need to find someone who can sing, play piano, and finally add some beats!"
"__MUSIC__ Nahh, I wouldn't say for sure. This is Indie-Pop, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is! What, do you think we need more?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, I think 5's a good number."
"__MUSIC__ We could use more, though!"
"__MUSIC__ For like rock, or something like Punk, maybe. Not Indie-Pop!"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmmm, you're right."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes you gotta listen for other opinions, though."
"__MUSIC__ This genre's gonna be tough, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is."
