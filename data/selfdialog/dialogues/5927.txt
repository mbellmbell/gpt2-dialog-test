"__STAR_WARS__ You know what bugged me in The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Is it something silly?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You tell me. It was Kanjiklub."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's wrong with them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's the name. It sounds like kaiju club."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like a club for Japanese monster fans?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! And they were even after Han Solu due to unpaye debts."
"__STAR_WARS__ So? What's that have to do with monsters?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was smuggling literal monsters, rathtars, across the galaxy. It makes me think that Kanjiklub is an organization of black market monster dealers."
"__STAR_WARS__ When you put it like that, it seriously does sound silly."
