"__MOVIES__ Are you planning on seeing the new Stephen King movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think that's the name."
"__MOVIES__ I really want to."
"__MOVIES__ It looks pretty good, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it looks better than the original."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it will be scarier?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah.  The clown looks a lot worse."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever read the book?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a couple times."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was pretty horrifying."
"__MOVIES__ Did the first movie follow the movie pretty well?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was okay, but this one will probably touch on some things that the first one didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, was there a lot that the first one left out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there was a good bit."
"__MOVIES__ The movie was in two parts, I didn't figure they would miss much."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the book was like 1100 pages."
"__MOVIES__ Wow.  How long did it take you to read that?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember.  Maybe a couple weeks."
