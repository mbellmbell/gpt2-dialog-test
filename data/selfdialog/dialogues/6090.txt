"__STAR_WARS__ In the Force Awakens movie, Rey seems to have such a strong natural connection to the Force. Why do you think that is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's a big mystery so far. Do you have any theories?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think she might be related to any of the Jedi's from the previous movies. They were hunted to extinction but there still might be some people who are force sensitive."
"__STAR_WARS__ But her sensitivity seems stronger than most. There must be some special reason behind that."
"__STAR_WARS__ With what has been revealed to us regarding the Force, there doesn't really have to be. Maybe they will link her to someone of importance."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think she could be linked to?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There are all kinds of theories. Some will insist that she is related to Obi-Wan, but it just doesn't add up with the timeline."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think she can hear voices when she was near Luke's lightsaber?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would attribute that to her Force sensitivity and the Force spirits having had some kind of connection with Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a possibility, I guess we will get to know more in the upcoming movie."
