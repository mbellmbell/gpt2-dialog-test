"__FASHION__ Did you see the pictures from the MET gala?"
"__FASHION__ Yes I did. There were some great outfits this year?"
"__FASHION__ Who do you think had the most creative dress?"
"__FASHION__ Rihanna's dress was really artistic and captured the theme."
"__FASHION__ I think Traci Ellis Ross had a dress by the same designer."
"__FASHION__ Yeah I think her dress was great too."
"__FASHION__ Who do you think was the worst dressed?"
"__FASHION__ Well Selena Gomez's dress was really simple and boring. It looked very off-the-rack."
"__FASHION__ I agree. I don't think any of the men's outfits were very interesting either."
"__FASHION__ Do you think high-water pants are appropriate for a tuxedo?"
"__FASHION__ You're right. I saw a lot of ill-fitting pants. With men's pants, tailoring is really important."
"__FASHION__ I know. Did you see Joe Jonas' outfit?"
"__FASHION__ Was he wearing corduroy?"
"__FASHION__ I think it was corduroy or velvet."
"__FASHION__ Well either way, it looked really silly."
"__FASHION__ He looked like a red carpet."
"__FASHION__ Ha ha ha. You're too funny. His brother's tuxedo was nice though."
"__FASHION__ I agree. Some of the designers dressed multiple people, but some celebrities looked better than others."
"__FASHION__ Like Zac Posen?"
"__FASHION__ Yes! I can't believe the dress he made for Amy Schumer. She looked like a trash bag. Meanwhile Katie Holmes looked stunning."
