"__MUSIC__ Guess what! I finally listened to the Hamilton soundtrack!"
"__MUSIC__ Yay! What did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ The hype is real. The songs are so catchy, the lyrics are well written, and the cast is incredibly talented!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, Lin-Manuel Miranda can do no wrong. What was your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ The one at the end of Act One, I think it's called 'Non-Stop'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, that's it! I like that one too. My favorite is 'The Election of 1800' in Act Two"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't listened to Act Two as much as Act One, though I suspect I will as I keep listening!"
"__MUSIC__ That was my experience too. I think people start out listening to the first act a lot because it takes a while to fully understand the plot. But once you do, Act Two becomes much more powerful and emotional"
"__MUSIC__ I can see that! I'm looking forward to getting there! I've been listening to it over and over"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I also did when I first heard it!"
"__MUSIC__ I wish there was something more to listen to though"
"__MUSIC__ You know, there is. Have you heard of the Hamilton mixtape?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's all the same Hamilton songs but sung by different artists, like real popular artists. Like The Roots, Kelly Clarkson, and such."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, really? That sounds cool! Who created it?"
"__MUSIC__ Lin-Manual Miranda did! He sings on some of them too. Some are arranged differently than they are in the play, but you can still recognize it"
"__MUSIC__ That's really interesting! I will definitely have to listen to that!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, for sure! I think it also includes some songs that he had written but that weren't included in the play. Like extra Cabinet Battles"
"__MUSIC__ Oooh, those songs were really good! That's good to know. I'm gonna go listen to it now!"
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Let me know when you have so we can discuss it some more!"
