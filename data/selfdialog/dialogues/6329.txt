"__STAR_WARS__ You know what's really messed up?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In Revenge of the Sith where Anakin kills the children."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah!  That was super messed up."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was a pretty shocking scene to even film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right.  Even though it doesn't show it, that was his true scene to show he was evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ I remember the theater freaked out about it.  Some people walked out."
"__STAR_WARS__ No one did in mind, they were just stunned."
"__STAR_WARS__ Just thinking about it makes me feel that Anakin got what he deserved."
"__STAR_WARS__ He most certainly did."
