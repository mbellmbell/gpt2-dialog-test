"__STAR_WARS__ Special Editions or the originals. Which do you prefer?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Have to be the special editions."
"__STAR_WARS__ What? Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like how updated all the effects are and all the extra creatures on Tatooine."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but Han didn't shoot second."
"__STAR_WARS__ George Lucas said he was supposed to"
"__STAR_WARS__ There's no way Han was intended to shoot second. That was a cold blooded killing."
"__STAR_WARS__ It COULD have been self defense."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, fine. It was a cold blooded killing as self defense."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait, what?"
