"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man I miss Kelly's work in the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kelly? Who's kelly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chip Kelly, he was the coach for the Ducks at UO and went on to become the head coach for the Eagles"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember him, he had a good run for a while, but sort of fell off the radar"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was best known for the up-tempo offense where he didn't worry about the clock, but instead of wearing out the opposing team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I liked that, it made the games kind of like a constant 2 minute drill with the no huddle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for a while there it looked like he might have had a really dynamic team with eagles with a rush/pass offense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know how long that was going to work, it seemed kind of gimmicky"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a return to basics and, for a while at least, he had Sproles and Murray on the team, if they'd had a rushing QB who knows"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that, but with the inside/oustide threat there any rush QB would have not been that big a threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, during the offseason at least, they had Tebow as a back-up QB and he wasn't accurate, but so much of the tempo is about pace and not making mistakes"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what doomed them a lot was Sanchez wasn't really a threat there and he did through a lot of INTs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I like the guy, but he wasn't a rush threat and a great CB made the whole affair irrelevant"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, because you just stop the rush and trust the CB to do the rest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why they did really rock as team though, the Eagles I mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why, the defense? I remember they were pretty physical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and an incredible special teams unit. If Kelly had filled in the pieces he needed, i imagine they would have been SB contender"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, maybe but against Seattle or Arizona they would have been beaten with 3 and outs and then just ground to paste by those offenses"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not saying they were unbeatable, but if the pass threat had been there you would have only heard Kelly's praises sung."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he gets another chance."
