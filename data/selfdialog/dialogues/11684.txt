"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts on J.J. Watt?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's probably the most gifted defensive player of this generation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I find him to be overrated if we're being honest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? He is a three time NFL Defensive Player of the Year and a match up nightmare for offenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but in the last two seasons that he won that award, the Texans either missed the playoffs or were blown out 30-0 in the Wild Card Round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not his fault! He's only a defensive end and can't control the game like a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I am tough on him because people always say that he should not just win the Defensive Player of the Year award, but also the regular season MVP award too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well lets examine his stats from the 2014 season. He had 20.5 sacks, 4 forced fumbles, 5 defensive touchdowns, and 3 receiving touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And his team went 7-9 and missed the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, that's not his fault. Look at those ridiculous stats and tell me that he shouldn't have been MVP that season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Aaron Rodgers threw 38 touchdowns that season with only 5 interceptions and led the Packers to first in the NFC North with a 12-4 record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rodgers was good, but was buttressed by a potent Green Bay offense. J.J. Watt was the only good defensive player on Houston that season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Brian Cushing and A.J. Bouye?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brian Cushing is decent, but he hasn't made a Pro Bowl since 2009. A.J. Bouye wasn't as good then as he is now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even putting aside the talk of the 2014 season, he's too injury prone to warrant the praise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's injury prone because he pushes himself further than most players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Please explain why the Texans advanced further last season into the playoffs with J.J. Watt on the bench due to injury than the previous five seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was because the AFC South is one of the worst divisions in the NFL and their first Wild Card Game was against the Oakland Raiders, who lost Derek Carr to injury the previous December."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair, although Houston's defense appeared to function just fine without Watt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that was largely due to the emergence of Jadeveon Clowney following two years of poor play."
