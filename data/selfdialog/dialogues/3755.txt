"__MUSIC__ I'm having a terrible time with the Debussy piece."
"__MUSIC__ Which one are you working on?"
"__MUSIC__ Estampes"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh. The whole work?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm just focusing on Jardins sous la pluie right now"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough one. What are you struggling with?"
"__MUSIC__ The cross-overs, especially. My fingers get all tangled up."
"__MUSIC__ Have you tried working hands separately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I'm fine with each alone. It's putting them together that's the challenge."
"__MUSIC__ Hrm. What about altering the rhythms to get your hands coordinated?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a good idea! I haven't tried that yet."
"__MUSIC__ I just love that lyrical part in the middle. It really does sound like little raindrops."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know! Well, it does when I play it right!"
"__MUSIC__ When I was working on that piece, that was my breathing spot."
"__MUSIC__ How long ago did you study this one?"
"__MUSIC__ It's been probably 15 years."
"__MUSIC__ I'd love to hear you play it."
"__MUSIC__ Hah, I'd have to woodshed a bit. I haven't played that one in ages."
"__MUSIC__ So maybe I could give YOU some tips on how to practice it!"
"__MUSIC__ I bet you could, now!"
