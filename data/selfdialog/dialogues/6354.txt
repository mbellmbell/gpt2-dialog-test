"__STAR_WARS__ How did you like the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it a lot, but I think the plot was so similar to A New Hope that it felt more like an homage than a new movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I thought that too a little bit, but I liked how they added so much more diversity to the cast."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was great, but I hated seeing all the internet trolls complaining about reverse racism and reverse sexism."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ugh, for sure. What is it about the internet that seems to bring out the worst in people?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the combination of the Star Wars Universe and the internet can be a bad combination sometimes."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ So many people have loved these movies for so long that they have a hard time accepting changes to their favorite childhood impressions about them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like the huge controversy over whether Han shot first, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly!"
