"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen Logan?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I thought it was hugh jackman at his very best."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think hugh jackman at his very best is probably les miserables, he was first a song and dance man after all."
"__SUPERHERO__ Fine, but finest in the role of wolverine then."
"__SUPERHERO__ On that I do agree. this was his strongest logan portrayal."
"__SUPERHERO__ I also thought the first x men movie he was also exceptionally good."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think he was great, but maybe had to do with the script and intro to him and all these cool characters."
"__SUPERHERO__ You may be right. I often find myself loving the first of any series. I think it's due to the introduction and backstory coming to life."
"__SUPERHERO__ Plus in superhero movies a lot of times you see them transform into their power which is pretty neat."
"__SUPERHERO__ I find that less true with xmen, or the very first installment but I do enjoy seeing them get strong or powers, the transformation is always interesting."
