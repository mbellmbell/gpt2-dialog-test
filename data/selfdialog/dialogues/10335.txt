"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey, so you like rap, right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not really. What made you think I liked rap?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There's that one song you were playing. It was by the guy that does Filthy Frank, right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean, I guess so. I like that, yeah, but most rap out there is just terrible."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you mean?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's like... All rappers and hip hop artists seem to do is use cheap, simple beats and only talk about drugs or alcohol or something."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah but there are artists out there that don't do that. Swimming Pools is basically criticizing that kind of culture."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Sure, yeah, that's true. But that song isn't the majority of rap and hip hop. Think about it. Who have been the biggest rappers recently?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Uh... Lil Wayne. 50 cent, but he's not as big now. Eminem puts meaning into his stuff."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but then you have Beyonce and Rihanna and others like Wayne and cent that once in a while do something good, but then they mostly just play whatever people think they're supposed to be hearing."
