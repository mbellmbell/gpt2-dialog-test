"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with the Red Hot Chili Peppers?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, they're that 90s band, right?"
"__MUSIC__ They have been making music for longer than just the 90s, but they were definitely most popular then."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard some of their music. Why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a band I really used to like when I was younger. But it's been a while since I've listened to them."
"__MUSIC__ Wondering if the music still holds up?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a little bit of that."
"__MUSIC__ I remember from the songs I heard, they seemed high energy and fun."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, that's one of their big strengths as musicans."
"__MUSIC__ It seemed a bit silly at times."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. They made a lot of jokes and said goofy, absurd stuff in their songs."
"__MUSIC__ I can see why you'd be a bit apprehensive, though. Because that kind of thing can become a bad thing very easily."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. What 15 year old me found funny and cool, 35 year old me might find goofy and lame."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's only one way to find out."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I'm going to dig out some of my old Chili Peppers CDs and give them a whirl."
"__MUSIC__ I'll be interested to hear if the music still holds up for you."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of think it will, if for no other reason than the fact that it will bring back happy memories."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, that's a part of it. Music kind of works the same way for me."
"__MUSIC__ Just hoping that I don't cringe too much and think 'what on Earth did I see in this?'"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, good luck!"
