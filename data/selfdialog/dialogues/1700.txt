"__MUSIC__ Do you have any songs that are guilty pleasures?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, c'mon. Aren't you the girl who still listens to the Spice Girls?"
"__MUSIC__ And I don't feel guilty about it!"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! They did have some good songs."
"__MUSIC__ See? Why should you feel guilty about something you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Point taken. I guess it's just that music like that doesn't get much respect."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's basically just bumble gum pop. It's not changing the world."
"__MUSIC__ Bubble gum pop. I like that."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's just music that makes you feel good. And there's nothing wrong with that."
"__MUSIC__ I think one criticism is that's it's too formulaic."
"__MUSIC__ So? Again, some songs are just about having fun."
"__MUSIC__ In other words, the formula works?"
"__MUSIC__ Right. You don't always have to try to reinvent the wheel here."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think many songs try to do that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm just saying sometimes it's cool to just have a simple beat and catchy lyric."
"__MUSIC__ Or catchy beat and simple lyric."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, that works too. Sometimes all I want to do is sing along in my car to a fun song."
"__MUSIC__ One of life's little pleasures."
"__MUSIC__ And I don't feel a bit guilty about it!"
