"__ROCK__ Name your favorite rock band."
"__ROCK__ Metallica!"
"__ROCK__ Now that's a nice choice! No Leaf Clover is probably my favorite."
"__ROCK__ That one is really good, but my favorite is Fuel."
"__ROCK__ That's quite a head banger! You don't seem like that type of person."
"__ROCK__ I sure am! The intensity of the music is gripping and I enjoy it extensively."
"__ROCK__ That is interesting. Who's your favorite band member?"
"__ROCK__ It's a mix up between James and Kirk. They're both really good."
"__ROCK__ The band wouldn't be the same without James, so I've always favored him because of that."
"__ROCK__ That's logical and I agree. It wouldn't be Metallica without him!"
