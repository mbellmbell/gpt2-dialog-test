"__STAR_WARS__ Do you feel like The Last Jedi will be a good one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's the new Star Wars, I take it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is. Do you think it'll be good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the last two films were solid, so I'd say it should be as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm curious to see what they're going to do with Leia's character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait, she's still in it? Didn't Carrie Fisher pass recently?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, she did, but she still filmed the movie beforehand. That's why I want to see what happens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh. Do you think they'll send her off somehow?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm honestly not sure what to expect."
"__STAR_WARS__ Understandable.I'll definitely watch to see what happens."
