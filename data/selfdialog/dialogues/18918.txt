"__MOVIES__ I wonder if there will be any good movies coming out this summer."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I know in previous years it seemed like there was usually a Transformer movie, or maybe a superhero movie."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, isn't there a new Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That actually came out several months ago. They're not doing one this summer."
"__MOVIES__ I bet it will be more superhero movies and stuff like that."
"__MOVIES__ Probably. I think that new Stephen King one might be coming out."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, I think I heard about that. Which one is that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's called the Gunslinger or Dark Tower. It's based on one of his Dark Tower books."
"__MOVIES__ He has had so many good stories that made for great movies."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I loved Shawshank Redemption."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! That's one of my all-time favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ It starred Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins."
"__MOVIES__ Morgan Freeman has been in so many films."
"__MOVIES__ He has, and yet I can't think of a lot of movies I've seen with Tim Robbins."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that strange? He must have been in other movies, I'm sure."
"__MOVIES__ He was. He was in some movie called The Secret Life of Words."
"__MOVIES__ I think he also did a cameo in Anchorman."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Meanwhile Morgan Freeman has been playing roles like God."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's right. Wasn't he God in movie with Jim Carrey."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Bruce Almighty."
