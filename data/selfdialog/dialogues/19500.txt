"__MOVIES__ I just recently watched Live Free or Die Hard."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was just alright, nothing special."
"__MOVIES__ Really, I thought it was the second best of all the Die Hard films."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting, what did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ While there were some things I thought were dumb, I loved the action sequences."
"__MOVIES__ Weren't they a little too ridiculous?"
"__MOVIES__ C'mon, it's die hard though! The franchise has always been over-the-top."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose that's true."
"__MOVIES__ Bruce Willis is always fun as well."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that, I always love his one-liners."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and he had some good ones in that film."
"__MOVIES__ Not quite as many memorable ones as in the first Die Hard though."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, those lines are iconic."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the antagonist?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought he was serviceable. I like the actor, Timothy Olyphant."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't really like him."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ He seemed weak compared to a lot of the other Die Hard villains."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, probably because he was a programmer rather than your typical terrorist."
