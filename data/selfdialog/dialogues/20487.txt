"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Jurassic Park movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The one with Chris Pratt?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that one. What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was great. The CGI in it was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely cool to see some Jurassic Park CGI from this era."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I missed some of the cheesiness of the older movies."
"__MOVIES__ The first one is my favorite, so I understand."
"__MOVIES__ That scene with the Jeep and the T-rex is iconic."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously though. I've seen a lot of dissection of it on the Internet."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part of the new movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked that the T-rex saved the day."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was cool to see him get in an epic fight with the mutant dinosaur."
"__MOVIES__ It was interesting that they played with the concept of 'playing God' like all the other movies do."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if it was as well done though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I miss the old man in the first movies. He was so misguided but had amazing ideas."
"__MOVIES__ What about the raptor training? That was pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was interesting to see Chris Pratt being a raptor trainer."
"__MOVIES__ And they ended up saving the day."
"__MOVIES__ People love the raptors."
"__MOVIES__ They're the best part!"
