"__ICEHOCKEY__ No! Why would you guess the Sharks?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Because the Kings are your team!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No way.  I like the Sharks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Okay, which team do you not like to see play?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Pittsburgh Penguins."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, nobody like Pittsburgh."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They are such a dirty team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree.  I would even say nothing good comes from there."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Nothing good comes from Pittsburgh?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's just a joke."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh, not very funny."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But I do not like the Penguins either."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's good enough."
