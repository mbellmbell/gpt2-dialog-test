"__MOVIES__ Have you Rough Night yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I can't wait to see it. It looks hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I haven't seen it yet, either. I saw one of the actors on Jimmy Kimmel the other night."
"__MOVIES__ Which one? You mean one of the stars of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. The guy. What's his name... Paul W. Downs."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't he write it also?"
"__MOVIES__ He co-wrote the screenplay. And he also plays Scarlett Johansson's husband."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. I really want to see it badly. I love Scarlett Johansson."
"__MOVIES__ I do, too. I've been a big fan since The Other Boleyn Girl."
"__MOVIES__ She was amazing in that. I also loved her in Lost in Translation."
"__MOVIES__ That's one of my all-time favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen anything good lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I just saw Wonder Woman. It was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ I just saw The Mummy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really? How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Good. Really good. I mean, really good in some ways. It's different from the usual basic action movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's got a historical fantasy storyline, obviously."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, of course. The ancient Egypt thing. I don't want to spoil it for you, though."
"__MOVIES__ I'd like to see that. Would you want to see it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but not for theater ticket prices. I'll probably watch it again in six months when it hits Netflix or some other streaming platform."
