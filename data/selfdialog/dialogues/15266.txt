"__HARRY_POTTER__ So why do you think the directors chose to split the Deathly Hallows book into two separate movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it's because so much happens in the book that they wanted to try to fit everything in."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you have a favorite movie between the two?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think I like the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 a little bit better. There's more action."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm on the opposite side. I like Part 1 a little bit more."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah? Why is that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think there's a lot of character development, and there's a great scene when Harry and Hermione are dancing together in the tent."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I do like that scene a lot. But I like even more at the end of the second movie when Hagrid is carrying Harry and everyone thinks he's dead, but he's actually alive."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought that part was a little bit cheesy, to be honest."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think all of the movies have been a little bit cheesy, but they're true to the books for the most part which is what matters."
