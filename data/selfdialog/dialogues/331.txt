"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that The Lumineers finally came out with a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ They did? It feels like their first came out forever ago."
"__MUSIC__ It was a long gap. The new one's called 'Cleopatra.'"
"__MUSIC__ Cleopatra? Have you listened to it yet?"
"__MUSIC__ I have."
"__MUSIC__ And? Any good?"
"__MUSIC__ I like it, but, I don't know, I think I liked their first album better."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad. Why don't you like the new one as much."
"__MUSIC__ It's not bad or anything, I think it's just that I really loved the first album."
"__MUSIC__ So what's the problem?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, my expectations were probably too high going in."
"__MUSIC__ I get that. That happened to me with the last Decemberists album."
"__MUSIC__ Right, sometimes looking forward to something for too long ruins it."
"__MUSIC__ It's really too bad."
"__MUSIC__ That said, I still think you should buy a copy."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I may have been disappointed, but I still think it was a good album."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Well, maybe I'll listen to it on Spotify or something first."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a good plan."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I'll do then."
