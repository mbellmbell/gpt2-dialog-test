"__ROCK__ Bon Scott or Brian Johnson, who's your guy?"
"__ROCK__ Has to be Brian Johnson. His voice is the best."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, but my favorite AC/DC song is It's a Long Way to the Top so I'm going with Bon Scott."
"__ROCK__ What happened to that guy anyway?"
"__ROCK__ He vomited while sleeping and choked to death."
"__ROCK__ Dude, that is tragic."
"__ROCK__ I know, it's an absolute shame how many Rock artists have died from drinking and drug related deaths."
"__ROCK__ Brian Johnson was obviously the band's saving grace."
"__ROCK__ How did Angus Young come up with that little hop he does on stage?"
"__ROCK__ Beats me, but he's been performing like that for 40 plus years now. It's awesome."
