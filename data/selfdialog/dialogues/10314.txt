"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There's a lot of underrated rappers out there."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Totally. My vote for the most underrated rapper goes to Nas."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wait. Since when is Nas underrated?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well think about it. To a lot of people, the best rappers ever are Tupac, Biggie, and Eminem, right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right. So what?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nas' 'Illmatic' was one of the best albums of it's time, and no one seems to remember it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That is true. That album is, in my opinion, the epitome of East coast rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It really is. He has the perfect voice for it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And his flow is pretty much untouchable."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He just moves with the beat like nobody else. He's still untouched."
