"__STAR_WARS__ I plan on watching the Star Wars films for the first time this weekend. Which movie should I start with?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, you're probably the only person I know that hasn't seen Star Wars before."
"__STAR_WARS__ My co-workers tease me about that all the time. I must be the only person in the world that still hasn't seen those movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Since you're new to the series, you might want to start out with Episode I: The Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait. Someone else told me that I should watch episode IV first. The one from the 70s."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't listen to that guy. Trust me, you're better off watching the prequels first."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, that's Episodes I, II, and III, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. Then you should watch the original trilogy in order."
"__STAR_WARS__ Gotcha. But when should I squeeze in Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Whenever. It's a side story, so it doesn't matter when you watch it."
