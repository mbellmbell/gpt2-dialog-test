"__MOVIES__ How is it that concession stands at a theater is so expensive? how do they justify it?"
"__MOVIES__ It goes back to the days when movie studios owned the theaters themselves."
"__MOVIES__ How does that work?"
"__MOVIES__ well the movie studios had basically a monopoly over how much to charge, where to sow the movie etc."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't explain the concession prices."
"__MOVIES__ Well it sort of does. The Supreme Court, yes the Supreme Court decided that is not fair practice and in 1948, mandated theaters and studios share the profits. 20-30% for the theaters, and rest for the studios."
"__MOVIES__ i think I know where this is going. So to make more money.."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, so to make more revenues, the theaters started charging more for their concessions, which the studios couldn't not touch at all."
"__MOVIES__ Those bastards."
"__MOVIES__ Well to be fair, 20-30% of the ticket revenue isn't going to keep a theater open. But price gouging on all them sugary, fat delicious stuff,well they kept the theaters profitable."
"__MOVIES__ Huh. Interesting. Why do you know things like that?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean why do you know things like that? It's not like a common knowledge.Is there a school that teach you this information? Why do you know that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think what you want to ask is HOW i know that, not why. Why is a query into a reason, or the cause. How is an query into the mechanism."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh. fine,. How do you know that?"
"__MOVIES__ I was curious so I looked it up the other day."
"__MOVIES__ That was so anticlimatic."
"__MOVIES__ It's the truth, and the truth ain't always so exciting."
"__MOVIES__ Another question. What's the most violent anime ever produced?"
"__MOVIES__ Violence is a word that needs some qualifying. What is violence? Language? Gore? Sexual violence? Slow violence that takes over years, quick acute violence that happens in a flash? What do you want to consider the violence to be?"
