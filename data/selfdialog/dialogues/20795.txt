"__THRILLER__ I need to watch that again."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I watched it with my boyfriend in order to prepare for The Conjuring 2!"
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, didn't that just come out on HBO?"
"__THRILLER__ Yep, we've been waiting for it to be released on there. So now we can watch it!"
"__THRILLER__ Are there any new horror movies coming out in theaters?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, there are a couple this summer and then a few more in the Fall."
