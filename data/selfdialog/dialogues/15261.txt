"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think about Ron in the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think he's a tool."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No!  He's awesome!  He introduces Harry to the wizarding world."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He is just a patsy who gets dragged into dangerous situations."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But he saves them by playing wizards chess!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's one instance. He's so unimportant that they can write him out of half of the last movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But I miss him when he's gone!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And why would Hermonine MARRY him? She can do so much better."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But they love each other!  It's a timeless love!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's a trite love.  She'd be better off with a dentist."
