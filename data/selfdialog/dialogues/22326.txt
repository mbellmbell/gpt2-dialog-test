"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the movie Inside Out?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but I didn't like it at all."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Why?"
"__DISNEY__ Sadness ruined it for me. She was always depressed and ruining things."
"__DISNEY__ That was the goal of her character."
"__DISNEY__ I understand that, but it was almost annoying how she wouldn't listen to Joy."
"__DISNEY__ That's true."
"__DISNEY__ Some of the storyline was hard to understand. How Riley's memories were stored in colorful balls."
"__DISNEY__ I think that was to represent her brain."
"__DISNEY__ True, but it didn't look like a brain to me. It was almost like a factory the way it worked. Strange."
