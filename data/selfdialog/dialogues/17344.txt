"__MOVIES__ Have you noticed they really don't make westerns anymore?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't even think of any newer movies that are westerns."
"__MOVIES__ They probably don't make enough money."
"__MOVIES__ Well, with so many other movies to choose from that have great special effects, it makes sense people wouldn't want to spend their money to see a western."
"__MOVIES__ The last western I saw was The Lone Ranger."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the Disney movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the one starring Johnny Depp."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that didn't do very well."
"__MOVIES__ It didn't."
"__MOVIES__ I also heard the ratings were bad."
"__MOVIES__ A few years back I saw one called Cowboys versus Aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig."
"__MOVIES__ If it has aliens it sounds more like science fiction to me."
"__MOVIES__ It was a combination of both."
"__MOVIES__ Did it do well at the box office?"
"__MOVIES__ It made around a hundred and seventy five million."
"__MOVIES__ Not that much, then."
"__MOVIES__ But it cost about a hundred million to make."
"__MOVIES__ Looks like making western movies just isn't worth it anymore."
