"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see Guardian's of the Galaxy 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  I can't wait."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither.  It's by far the best thing Marvel has put out."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Although Civil War was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I don't like how many characters they tried to develop.  It felt too congested."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough.  Any idea what the critics are saying about Guardians 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Supposed to be not as good as the first one bus still got good scores."
"__MOVIES__ Have you heard anything about the after credits scene?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  I'm trying to be surprised by it."
"__MOVIES__ I hope it ties in with the next Thor movie and maybe even Spiderman."
"__MOVIES__ it kind of seems like Marvel can do no wrong."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  Too bad DC hasn't figured out the formula yet."
"__MOVIES__ Right!  Suicide Squad and Batman V Superman were disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ I give them credit for trying, but I'm not disagreeing."
"__MOVIES__ Between Wonder Woman and Justice League they are skating on thin ice."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  But, to be honest, I'm kind of getting tired of all these cinematic universe installments."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, a little bit.  That's why I'm looking forward to Guardians."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, in hindsight I hope they hold off on tying in to avengers and Dr Strange for a while just to keep it self-sustaining."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I forgot about Dr. Strange.  That's right up there with Guardians as far as I'm concerned."
"__MOVIES__ Like you said, Marvel can do no wrong."
