"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think that rap music is better now than when Tupac was alive?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Absolutely not better than Tupac!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, I agree that he was a legend in his time, but what about artists like Common?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think Common is good but he's got nothing on Tupac."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, I think that rap today has some great artists who are more expressive in their music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, they are like T.I. but they are doing more than rap and that's like diluting the rap industry with other things."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But what you call diluting is actually more of creativity. Do you think Tupac wouldn't be diversifying today if he were still alive?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's hard to say because he was specific to his genre during his time but he did venture into acting as well."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So maybe rap today would be better if he were still around?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think it definitely would."
