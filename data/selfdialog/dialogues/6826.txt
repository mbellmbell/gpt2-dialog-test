"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, did you have any disappointments with The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean besides Han Solo dying?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, besides that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I felt the whole Leia and Han's son going to the Dark Side was kind of unoriginal?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean? I didn't see that coming."
"__STAR_WARS__ You remmber the now no longer canon Expanded Star Wars Universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, so what about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In that universe, Jacen Solo, the oldest son of Leia and Han, went all Dar Side as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, so you mean that having a kid of Han and Leia go bad, had been done before."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, just not in the movies, but the books."
