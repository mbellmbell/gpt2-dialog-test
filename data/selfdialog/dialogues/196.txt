"__MUSIC__ Do you like any music from the 90's?"
"__MUSIC__ I like tons of music from the 90's.  I grew up in the 90's."
"__MUSIC__ Name one of your favorite bands."
"__MUSIC__ Nirvana would have to be at the top of the list. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say The Counting Crows top my list."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good one. There was so much good music then."
"__MUSIC__ Yes there was, Aerosmith made some great stuff in the 90's, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ I had the hits album 'Big Ones', I used to listen to it over and over."
"__MUSIC__ I had that one too.  I have to say though, I do not miss having CD's all over the place."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. I was really in to my music then so I had towers of CD's everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny.  Did you ever listen to ICP?"
"__MUSIC__ ICP? I don't thinbk I have heard of that one."
"__MUSIC__ They are not as well known, they make some unique music. It is funny, disgusting and completely offensive."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so they are kind of like 2 Live Crew?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess so. Well, they are both pretty offensive anyway."
"__MUSIC__ I remember listening to 'Dirty Nursery Rhymes' and my Dad hearing it and taking my CD player away for a week."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny. I never listened to ICP at home because I was afraid that same thing would happen to me."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe I forgot to mention my all time favorite that is from the 90's, Sublime."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I'm surprised I didn't think of that one. I loved the album Stand By Your Van."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! Those were some good times."
