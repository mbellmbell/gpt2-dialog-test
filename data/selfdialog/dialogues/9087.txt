"__BASEBALL__ Who do you think has the best team in the American League?"
"__BASEBALL__ For sure the Yankees"
"__BASEBALL__ No way they have no pitching and minimal hitting"
"__BASEBALL__ Well who do you think is the best"
"__BASEBALL__ The Red Sox are going to dominate the rest of the season"
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you think that the Sox are good"
"__BASEBALL__ One of the best starting pitching staff if not the best"
"__BASEBALL__ Yea but their in third place whats so good about that"
"__BASEBALL__ The hitting hasn't come around yet so they haven't supported the starters"
"__BASEBALL__ They scored double digit runs over the weekend"
"__BASEBALL__ I know hopefully that will start a trend"
"__BASEBALL__ I think they have a great closer too but I still think the Yankees will beat them"
"__BASEBALL__ How about we put up a bet who ever is right gets a free meal at any restaurant"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure thing but I'm not sure where I will be choosing once the Yankees take first place"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh don't waste your time worrying about something that won't happen"
"__BASEBALL__ Haha we should get tickets the next time the two play each other"
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds like a plan to me I'll check out the schedule later on"
"__BASEBALL__ I'll be wearing my pin stripe shirt and yankees hat"
"__BASEBALL__ And I will be taking pictures of you looking like a fool."
"__BASEBALL__ Can't wait go Yankees stop the sox."
