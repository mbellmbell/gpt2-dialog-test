"__COMEDY__ Have you watched the new CHIPS movie?"
"__COMEDY__ The one with Dax Shepard and Michael Pena?"
"__COMEDY__ That's the one. I just watched it today and feel lukewarm about it."
"__COMEDY__ Is it considered an action or a comedy?"
"__COMEDY__ I would say it's an action comedy in the buddy cop mold. It tried to be really funny and witty with its jokes, physical humor, and situation comedy but I felt it was really flat and oddly paced."
"__COMEDY__ Is Kristen Bell in this movie? She's always in movies with her husband Dax."
"__COMEDY__ Yes Kristen Bell is in here, small role for her, and she's really unlikable. I think the movie did a good job with the action and some of the chemistry element between Michael Pena and Dax but overall there seems to be so much out of place and forced."
"__COMEDY__ That's a shame to hear. I remember watching the trailers, and hearing the original TV Show theme song and thinking wow this is going to be a nostalgia blast."
"__COMEDY__ I think they did a good job for some of the homage to the TV series, as there is a cameo from Erik Estrada, the original Ponch."
"__COMEDY__ Well at least it has the original Ponch going for it. I'm sure if you were a fan of the original TV show you might get a kick out of this new movie even though as you described it, as not being perfect."
