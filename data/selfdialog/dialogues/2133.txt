"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, there are so many good ones, that's a tough question. You first."
"__MUSIC__ That's easy for me. My favorite band has been Nine Inch Nails for as long as I can remember!"
"__MUSIC__ Interesting, don't hear that everyday. Why them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well for one thing, they were really the first band to introduce me to something other than standard radio rock."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I can see that, but still aren't they a little to hard core or even violent?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha, you are not the first person to say that to me. Have you listened to much of their music?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean I have heard their main songs, but I have never paid that much attention to them."
"__MUSIC__ Well they are definately a loud band, and they have had some pretty rough songs. But they also have some stuff that is mello and even melodic."
"__MUSIC__ I would not have really guessed that from them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! And what is more, the lead singer, Trent Reznor, is really a musical genious!"
"__MUSIC__ What makes you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Besides Nine Ince Nails, he has scored movies one of which even won an Oscor."
"__MUSIC__ No kidding? Nine Inch Nails?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally! And he has produced a lot of music for other artists as well. From rap to other Industrial bands."
"__MUSIC__ Well maybe I should do a deep dive on them some time!"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Now back to my question, who is YOUR favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I do owe you an answer now don't I?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say so."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I think my favorite band of all time would have to be Led Zeplin."
