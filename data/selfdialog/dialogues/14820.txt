"__ACTION__ Ready for the final Planet of the Apes film?"
"__ACTION__ God, yes. Andy Serkis is amazing."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, and the direction and action have been great."
"__ACTION__ There's one thing I'm not sure about."
"__ACTION__ What's that?"
"__ACTION__ Woody Harrelson, with a shaved head, as a military commander."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, that was a bit odd, but he can make it work."
"__ACTION__ Do you think they'll pull a twist and have the humans win?"
"__ACTION__ That would be pretty interesting as a swerve, but the human population is dying off."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, they wouldn't support themselves."
