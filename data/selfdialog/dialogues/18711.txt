"__MOVIES__ So, what do you think?  Have we pretty much kick the horse dead on bad covers?"
"__MOVIES__ i don't know, I might be able to squeeze out a few more."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, dear god, no.."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, yes, I think I can.  Check it: 'Sweet Child O'Mine' by Sheryl Crow"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wow, yeah, I remember that one.. it was on that Adam Sandler movie uh... shoot, can't remember which-"
"__MOVIES__ Big Daddy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was it! Totally terrible. I mean, if you're gonna take a CLASSIC song like that and try to make it new, you'd better have something awesome to bring to the table."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Oh, neat little bit of trivia about that song though."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, among other things it wasn't really meant to be a song."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, check it out, you know that guitar riff in the beginning?  That's called 'Playing the scales.'  You'll notice it's the same beat over and over just keeps increasing on the pitch."
"__MOVIES__ Huh."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Slash was practicing on that one day and someone's like, 'Hey, this sounds really cool, let's put it as an intro to a song.'  So they built some lyrics around it."
"__MOVIES__ I did not know that."
"__MOVIES__ Another neat fact, near the end of the song they didn't have another verse to end the song with so, Axel is just literally saying, 'Where do we go now?' over and over again."
"__MOVIES__ Wow... mind blown."
"__MOVIES__ Now, this part I can't confirm, I think GNR was a bit surprised that that song became such a hit."
"__MOVIES__ Well, regardless how it came about, I think it's a really song."
"__MOVIES__ I do too.  Although crazily enough, as a younger man I thought he was singing about his kid.  Guess I took things too literally back then."
