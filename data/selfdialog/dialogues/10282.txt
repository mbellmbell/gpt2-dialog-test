"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you prefer single rappers or rap groups."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I've only ever listened to single ones."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So you've never been too fond of groups."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not that. I just haven't been exposed to much rap groups."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Listen to NWA."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why? Are they a big deal?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, they don't exist anymore, but they're easily the most influential rap group ever."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wait. Now that you mention it, the name sounds familiar. Who was in it?"
