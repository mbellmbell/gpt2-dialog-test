"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Zookeeper's Wife?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did about a month ago."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was so moving.  It really made me think of cruelty and how it comes about in people."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I agree it was incredibly moving, but didn't make me feel heavy, like other movies."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Some movies make you feel horrible after watching them, like Schindler's List."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! They're just too heavy."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the script?"
"__MOVIES__ I read the book, so I was a little disappointed in the script because the book is so much better."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know there was a book."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah there is, but I guess it is hard to be as good as a book."
"__MOVIES__ That's true.  I really liked the lead actress, but I forget her name."
"__MOVIES__ Jessica Chastain."
"__MOVIES__ That's right! She was wonderful."
"__MOVIES__ I'm trying to think of other movies that she was in. Was she in The Martian?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think she was! She was also in The Help."
"__MOVIES__ It's surprising that she isn't in more movies I think she's a great actress."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, but we can't control Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, we just have to appreciate what we have in those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes we do!"
