"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Lord of the Rings?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, awesome trilogy.  Strider was my favorite character."
"__MOVIES__ He was pretty awesome.  I'm a little dissapointed in Liv Tyler.  She didn't have all that major a part."
"__MOVIES__ And they made such a big deal about her being in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know.  You know who else was awesome?  The dwarf."
"__MOVIES__ He was.  And the elves were pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ I know, the way they come out and just nail headshots."
"__MOVIES__ Who would have thought those girly looking elves would be so tough."
"__MOVIES__ They were almost unstoppable."
"__MOVIES__ I liked Gandolf too.  Ian McKellen was perfect for that role."
"__MOVIES__ Yes he was. That whole trilogy was done the right way."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen the Hobbit yet though."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the first one, but not the others.  It was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard they all are."
"__MOVIES__ And we get the return of Golemn of course."
"__MOVIES__ He was a good small bad.  Not the big bad, but he had his moments."
"__MOVIES__ He did.  Not in a super clever way, but he was hard to shake."
"__MOVIES__ The special effects for him were awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the way that guy wore a suit and they just put CGI over him."
"__MOVIES__ I know, movies today are crazy."
