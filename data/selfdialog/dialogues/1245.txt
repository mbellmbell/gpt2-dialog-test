"__MUSIC__ Did you listen to the ocarina cover of the Steven Universe theme I sent you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I did, it was great! How did you find it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was a recommended video to me on youtube because I listened to other ocarina songs."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about ocarinas?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it was my favourite part of the game, Ocarina of Time, and I really like the aesthetics of ocarinas. Especially sweet potato ocarinas."
"__MUSIC__ Sweet potato?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the kind of bulbous ocarinas that you hold sideways?"
"__MUSIC__ Like in the game, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. So aesthetically those are my favourite, but I find the inline ocarinas easier to play."
"__MUSIC__ You play?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I haven't gotten very good yet, but I got a polycarbonate inline ocarina from Mountain Ocarinas."
"__MUSIC__ You should play for me sometime."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely will. It's a higher pitched ocarina and I love the way it lends itself to jigs, making cheerful noise and for the sadder songs, it adds somewhat of an eerie feel."
"__MUSIC__ Very interesting. Are there other kinds of ocarinas?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, lots. There are pendant ocarinas, which are the smallest and highest pitched and also some of the prettiest, there are ocarinas made from vegetables and even an ocarina and teacup in one!"
"__MUSIC__ Pendant ocarinas as in you can wear them as a necklace?"
"__MUSIC__ That's right. Mine is bigger but it comes with a neck cord anyway."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you play on it?"
"__MUSIC__ Zelda songs, Irish songs, hymns... they've been used for just about every style of music imagineable though."
"__MUSIC__ It seems they are very versatile."
