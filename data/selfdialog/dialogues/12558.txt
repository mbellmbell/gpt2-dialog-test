"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's Aaron Rodgers, but I think Tom Brady and his superbowl wins also enter the conversation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers is so talented, but it's hard to deny the handful of rings that Tom has."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think superbowl rings matter, but based on pure stats, Aaron Rodgers is unlike anyone who has played the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think his argument would be stronger with more than one superbowl win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Mike McCarthy needs to get Rodgers another ring or two and then maybe the haters will be a little less quick to judge him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though I think Tom might be my pick for the best, he cannot do most of the things Aaron does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom is definately not quick on his feet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course he isn't, he is several years older than Aaron and never was much of a runner in the first place."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why the Bill is a genius, he always plays to Tom's strengths."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ McCarthy could take a page or two out of his book with Aaron."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mike McCarthy relies too much on Aaron's athleticism and not enough on game plan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Aaron has had a lot of close calls that could've been rings if his team was better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every year, Aaron puts out a crazy amount of effort, only for them to lose in crazy championship games!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His hail mary in that Arizona playoff game made jump out of my chair in disbelief."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was kind of like that Rodgers to Rodgers one in Detroit, but with a little more on the line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wasn't that Detroit hail mary for the division title though or seeding purposes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was. We ended up improving our record and seeding, but then lost to  Arizona that year in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Aaron Rodgers though, the Packers are never really out of the running, but I could say the same about Tom."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's partially true, although plug another quarterback in for Tom in that system and I think the Patriots will still be successful."
