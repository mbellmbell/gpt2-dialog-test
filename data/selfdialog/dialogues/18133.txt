"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest Alien movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Alien: Covenant? Haven't seen it yet, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I want to, maybe this weekend. I hear it's quite good."
"__MOVIES__ It's got to be better than Prometheus, am I right? Wow that movie sucked."
"__MOVIES__ It was amazingly bad. Like, they spent so much money on special effects, you'd think they could pay a good writer to write a great script."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. Although, I have to say it was kind of hilariously bad. After a while I was enjoying it just to kind of point and laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, I see what you mean. Still, it was so illogical it really bugged me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well, I just try to roll with it. The first three movies in the alien series were all quite good, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, especially the first two in my opinion. But each one was quite different."
"__MOVIES__ The first one even passed the Bechdel test."
"__MOVIES__ That should not be a remarkable achievement!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, have two women with names talk to each other about something other than a man. Not difficult."
"__MOVIES__ And yet, a comparatively rare achievement."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the Alien movie where Ripley was acting sort of autistic. What was that called?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, Ripley 8 was the character's name. Hmm, I think that was Alien: Resurrection."
"__MOVIES__ Loved it! Didn't Sigourney Weaver play an autistic character in another movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Snow Cake. I really liked that too, although very different from the Alien movies."
"__MOVIES__ True, she didn't kick as much butt in that movie. But wow, what an actress."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed! The world needs more Sigourney Weaver."
"__MOVIES__ She really should be in all the movies!"
