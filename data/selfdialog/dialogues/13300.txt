"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Texas football teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think by far the cowboys are the best"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone would agree with that I think"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Texans lack key elements of their team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have basically no quarterback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they had a chance to pick up a couple good free agents but they let it slip"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel bad for them, but it ultimately came down to poor leadership"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I feel bad for those fans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott on the Cowboys is extremely good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, him and Ezekiel Elliot are both really good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have a really good chance to go the distance next year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and I bet they will get close"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were eliminated by my favorite team, the Packers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a great game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a packer fan too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I love the packers as well"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well then I hope the cowboys lose again to them next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we will have some luck in that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Although the cowboys are young, they may develop into a really great team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only time will tell!"
