"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your favorite pro football team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My team is the Miami Dolphins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that is not a very popular or good team, what is your allegiance to them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I grew up in south Florida, so it is my home team.  What is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a DC native, so naturally I am a Washington Redskins fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the name controversy, is Redskins an offensive name or not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is fine, it is a name, not a ridicule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts about coach Jay Gruden?  Do you think he can turn that team into a winning one?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Redskins have had a rough go for many years.  I do not think Gruden, or RG3, or anyone person can fix that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel you, same with Dolphins, we cannot go back to the good ole days of Schula or Marino."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will make it to the playoffs this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am favoring Sea Hawks and Broncos myself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I too favor the sea hawks for the superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as it is not the Bills, the Cowboys or the Patriots, I will be happy!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Outside of the Redskins, I really do not care who goes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You do not have a major rival you don't want to see in there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I would agree with you about the Cowboys and Patriots, but who cares about the Bills?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Buffalo is definetly a Miami Rival, although I do not think they have any chance of making it to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I would really Like to see Redskins and Dolphins make it this year, that would be the miracle of the football season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I won't hold my breath.  Probably Patriots and Falcons again..."
