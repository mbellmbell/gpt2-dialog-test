"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite robot from the Star Wars series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I've always liked R2-D2, ever since I watched The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ R2-D2 played such an important role by carrying the disk."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly! But I also like C-3PO for his cynical humor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, his humor cracked me up. What did you think of K-2SO in Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved him! He had a similar personality to C-3PO."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was almost in tears when he sacrificed himself in the end for Jyn and Cassian."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same here. Sometimes I feel like the droids are the real heroes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Tell me about it. It's amazing how much character development occurs within the robots."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be cool if there was a Star Wars movie that focused on the robots themselves."
