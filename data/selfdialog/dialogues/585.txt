"__MUSIC__ Man, I've been really getting into Woodstock lately."
"__MUSIC__ Really, why Woodstock?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I think it's one of the most interesting times in our history, and probably the first time music was really at the heart of a cultural revolution."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess I know what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ I've been studying Bob Dylan lately especially. I never realized how pivotal he really was."
"__MUSIC__ Man, he had some really great music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it's not just that. There were these two movements going on in the early 60s: pop music was exploding and there was this indie folk scene going on too."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't the Beatles use some Bob Dylan songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure did, and the thing with the late 60s is pop and folk started to merge into what became the counter culture protest music."
"__MUSIC__ That's so interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Also interesting that the two that really kicked off all this — Bob Dylan and The Beatles — were nowhere near Woodstock."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, John Lennon was back in the UK because the FBI was harassing him, and Dylan I think just wasn't interested."
"__MUSIC__ Dylan wasn't interested?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. He even owned a home in Woodstock. Though you know it wasn't actually held in Woodstock."
"__MUSIC__ Wait what?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's called Woodstock because originally it was supposed to be held there but ultimately it was held in Bethel, NY, nearby."
"__MUSIC__ No kidding."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Woodstock is full of interesting stories like that. Iron Butterfly didn't play because they demanded a helicopter and the organizer said no."
"__MUSIC__ Man, Woodstock is so interesting."
