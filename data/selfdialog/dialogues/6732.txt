"__STAR_WARS__ Anakin Skywalker must be saved"
"__STAR_WARS__ Uh..he kind of killed a bunch of people."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but he saves the day! He's a tortured soul."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay. So is Kylo Ren, but I don't care about his greasy self."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Even after everything he's been through?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, what has he been through? I get Anakin, but what has Kylo Ren been through?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He lost his father!"
"__STAR_WARS__ He killed his father, you're out."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's cute."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're going to hell."
