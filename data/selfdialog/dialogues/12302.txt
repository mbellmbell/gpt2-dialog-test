"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really getting excited for the Bills season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh you're crazy, no way do they do anything relevant"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Im not sure with a new front office they could have a chance this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not possible it's not like they got any better on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got healthier, another season with Tyrod Taylor and a new coach could open up the game the way it should be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope not a chance, You honestly think they can contend in their division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I certainly think they are better than the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, who isnt better than the jets? But really Patriots, Dolphins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The fins are terrible they haven't done anything relevant in years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, so the patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well you're not going to really compete with them, you just need to beat them once at least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you think that can happen? They got even better"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but any given sunday right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does that even mean? The patriots are so steady and never miss a step"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ well true but its not like they are unstoppable. Maybe if brady gets hurt or something"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, Maybe but Garrappolo is certainly capable"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True he did manage to get them through a few situations in the past."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and hes going to be the next Brady, just watch"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be the most patriots thing to happen"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep exactly they never miss a beat, its just next man up with those guys"
