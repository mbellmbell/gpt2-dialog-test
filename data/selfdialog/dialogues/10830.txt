"__FASHION__ What did you think of the red carpet fashion at the Met Gala this year?"
"__FASHION__ There were so many beautiful gowns. It's hard to choose which one I liked the best."
"__FASHION__ I thought Kate Hudson looked gorgeous as always in her long white Stella McCartney gown."
"__FASHION__ I agree, I loved that it was simple and clean."
"__FASHION__ I liked that it was sleeveless on one side."
"__FASHION__ Giselle Bundchen stunned in Stella McCartney as well!"
"__FASHION__ Definitely, her pewter embroidered Stella McCartney gown was to die for."
"__FASHION__ My favorite part of that gown was the very low cut of the back."
"__FASHION__ That was my favorite part too."
"__FASHION__ The glass bead embroidery on that dress was amazing. It must have taken forever to create."
"__FASHION__ I thought the grey Tom Ford tuxedo that Tom Brady wore to match was beautiful as well."
"__FASHION__ The color and cut of that tuxedo jacket were impeccable. It was a perfect match."
"__FASHION__ They did a good job keeping her makeup subtle so that it didn't overpower her gown."
"__FASHION__ The whole outfit was a home run."
"__FASHION__ It was, and the high pony was a great choice."
"__FASHION__ I loved that she paired the high pony with diamond drop earrings."
"__FASHION__ I wish I could find out who makes the marble print box clutch that Giselle was carrying."
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure who made it either."
"__FASHION__ There were a lot of people on the red carpet who pushed boundaries and went with some very risky fashion choices."
"__FASHION__ I know, oftentimes red carpet fashion is better when it's simple elegance rather than when it looks like someone is trying to hard to push the envelope."
