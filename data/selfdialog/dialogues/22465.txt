"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Not yet, is it any good?"
"__DISNEY__ It's amazing! I really enjoyed watching it in theaters, so I bought it when it came out!"
"__DISNEY__ Awesome! I may have to see about renting it."
"__DISNEY__ You really should. I think you will like it."
"__DISNEY__ Does it go along the same storyline as the original? Are the songs the same?"
"__DISNEY__ For the most part they stuck to the storyline, they added a little, but it helps the story along. And I was surprised at how well Emma Watson sings!"
"__DISNEY__ Nice! I have been a little apprehensive because I loved the original so much."
"__DISNEY__ I totally understand. I was worried I might not like it as much, but I wasn't disappointed at all."
"__DISNEY__ Alright, you've sold me, I'll be renting it this weekend!"
