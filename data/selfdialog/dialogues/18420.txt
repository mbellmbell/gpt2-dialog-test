"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Wonder Woman film yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, I was wondering if it was worth all the hype."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it.  Although they did change the Greek Mythology to suit themselves."
"__MOVIES__ They did?  What did they do?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, they said that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and that all the gods were dead because of a battle."
"__MOVIES__ That does sound a little odd."
"__MOVIES__ Except for Mars, the god of War.  He was still around giving trouble."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it does seem that war never ends, so it would be a good story line."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it actually worked out pretty well.  My husband and I talked about the changes and decided that storytelling was storytelling."
"__MOVIES__ So the story was good."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty good, but the best part was WW."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ It was so good seeing a woman hero that did not have to be saved by a man."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, tell me more."
"__MOVIES__ Are you sure?  I don't want to give away the ending."
"__MOVIES__ No, it's ok, I will see it anyway."
"__MOVIES__ One of the funniest parts was when Diana tells male protagonist that men are really only necessary for procreation and nothing else."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that does sound cute."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, the look on his face was priceless!"
