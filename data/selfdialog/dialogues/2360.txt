"__MUSIC__ Do you like heavy metal music?"
"__MUSIC__ I do. I especially like some of the instrumental aspects of it."

"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them. Aren't they kind of older acts?"
"__MUSIC__ They've both came on the scene years ago. You can still find tem both on Youtube."
"__MUSIC__ Joe Satriani's music has kind of a more positive, or happier vibe than lots of other kinds of heavy metal, doesn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ It does. That's because much of it is written in a major key."
"__MUSIC__ What is a major key?"
"__MUSIC__ Songs written in a major key use the major scale, which is known as a happier sounding scale than minor."
"__MUSIC__ So heavy metal usually uses minor key?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Blues music is also quite similar to the minor key."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of scale do most regular rock and roll songs use?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, most rock songs use either a blues scale or minor scale. Rock and roll itself comes from blues music."
"__MUSIC__ Is there any way to know whether a song is written in a major or minor key?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. You need also need to keep in mind, though, that there are other scales sometimes used."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. So how would I know if a rock song is written in a major key?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, basically, if it has kind of postive or happy sound to it, there's a good chance it's written in a major key."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a lot of different scales to learn for a musician."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, it's not that bad. Most scales have the same patterns that just start and end in different places."
