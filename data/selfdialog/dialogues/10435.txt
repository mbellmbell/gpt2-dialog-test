"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who do you think is the best lyricist in hip-hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would say Nas.  Maybe with Andre 3000 coming in at a close second."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nas's first album, 'Illmatic' is definitely a classic.  His second album, 'It Was Written', was a good album too."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He was a young guy when he recorded those album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yep.  One of my favorite songs from 'It Was Written' was a song called 'The Message'."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is that the song that samples Sting's 'Shape of My Heart'?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That is the one."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I love that song.  I get nostalgic when I listen to songs from that era."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Me too.  It remind of the good hip-hop that was coming out from New York City in the 90s."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There doesn't seem to be a lot of new talent coming out from New York these days."
