"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am simply dying to see these receivers get on the field for some football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly we are being spoiled rotten by the talent of receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say we are in the midst of some of the best receiver play in recent history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. You have Green, Beckham, Jones, Hopkins and so much more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best receiver in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely think it's a close call between Green and Julio. I would give the edge to Julio."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does Julio get that edge over Green because of their playoff run?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To be honest yeah. Julio was completely unstoppable the entire playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That one catch in the Superbowl was freakish."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A man of his size shouldn't be able to do half the things that he does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At his current pace he will be a Hall of Famer in no time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He deserves it. He's a good guy and an even better player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you don't think DeAndre Hopkins is worthy of being number one?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's just because they had Osweiler, so I can't give it to him despite it being out of his control."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just playing devil's advocate. I believe Julio is the number one guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know. Also he's not that good with yards after the catch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe after his huge season 2 or 3 years ago he said he needed to work on that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He showed this season that he still needs to work on it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is too big to be so easy to take down. He could easily be the best if he fixes that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and gets an actual quarterback who gives him the ball endlessly."
