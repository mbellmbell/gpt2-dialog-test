"__MOVIES__ I like collecting movie soundtracks."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I like both the albums, and the scores of the films."
"__MOVIES__ I can understand why. Some movies have really beautiful music."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly why I collect them. Harry Gregson-Williams is one of the best film composers in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I think he's a bit overrated. Same with Hans Zimmer."
"__MOVIES__ Hans Zimmer did the score for the Batman films, and those were great."
"__MOVIES__ But before him Danny Elfman did the score for the older Batman movies, and those were better."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that, but I do know music is an important part of movies."
"__MOVIES__ True. I think movies are mainly two components, the visual and the audio."
"__MOVIES__ But what about silent films? Don't those count?"
"__MOVIES__ I forgot all about silent films! Yeah, they count."
"__MOVIES__ So then I guess movies are just all about the visuals, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, no, I still think the sound is an important part of movies. Just not everything, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I agree. Like I said, I collect movie soundtracks, but no, music isn't everything."
"__MOVIES__ Even when it comes to audio, there are things like sound effects, and the mixing which is important."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so many little things combine to make a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's a wonder any movies get made at all."
"__MOVIES__ I guess even for bad films the stars had to align just right for it to get made at all."
"__MOVIES__ You're probably right. I could never be a movie maker; too much work."
