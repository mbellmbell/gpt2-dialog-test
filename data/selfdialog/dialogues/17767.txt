"__MOVIES__ Hey, do you like horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do! That's my favorite genre."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! What's your favorite horror movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably John Carpenter's Halloween."
"__MOVIES__ Oooh, I like that one too. Are you excited for the remake next year?"
"__MOVIES__ They're remaking it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's a complete reboot."
"__MOVIES__ I hope it's better than the 2007 remake."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it."
"__MOVIES__ Who's the director this time?"
"__MOVIES__ David Gordon Green, I believe."
"__MOVIES__ At least it isn't Rob Zombie again."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's a good director but his version of Halloween was so weird."
"__MOVIES__ We did not need a backstory on Michael Myers."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, it's actually much scarier when we don't know his backstory."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! I also didn't care for what they did to the Loomis character."
"__MOVIES__ Me either. He's not supposed to be so unlikable."
"__MOVIES__ I know! The 2007 version was barely the same character."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully the new version will be a much better reboot."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it can't be worse."
