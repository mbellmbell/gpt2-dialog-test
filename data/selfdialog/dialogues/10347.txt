"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's you're favorite rap group ever?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Mine would definitely be Lost Boys. Their song Renee just gets me every time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Mine would have to be Mob Deep. I think they're the most influential one ever."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Mob Deeps cool too. I can't believe Prodigy is dead now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know right! Such an awesome rapper."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Still though Lost Boys are my favorite. Why can't rappers be like them anymore? I miss the stories these guys tell."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know. I don't care how much money you lie about having, or about your gold necklace."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ HAHA! Yeah, I'd rather be told a story and entertained. Not Hearing about your gold teeth."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Whatever happened? I don't get these guys now a days!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What I really don't understand is the people who keep buying this new garbage!"
