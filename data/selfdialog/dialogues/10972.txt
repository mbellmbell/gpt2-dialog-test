"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your favorite NFL quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you mean a quarterback who is currently playing or just any quarterback in history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean someone who is currently playing in the league presently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would probably say Aaron Rodgers of the the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're a big Green Bay Packers fan then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, I don't dislike them but I'm more a fan of individual players than teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a Tom Brady fan at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I respect his athletic ability and it's hard to deny that he's one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time but I'm not a big fan of his."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally I'm the opposite. I'm more a fan of teams than individual players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what teams do you like to root for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a massive Dallas Cowboys fan and have been my entire life."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's got to be tough, they are disappointing every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's one thing just to be a bad team but they always come so close to being great but always seem to fall short in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they have one of the nicest stadiums in the NFL so there's that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah AT&T Stadium is really awesome. It cost over a billion dollars to build so it should be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the Dallas Cowboys' starting QB this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Looks like it's going to be Dak Prescott this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope for your sake that he works out. It's been a long time since Dallas has had a truly great quartback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've had some good ones but Troy Aikman so many years ago was the last superstar quarterback for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's going to be a fun game when the Cowboys play the Packers this year."
