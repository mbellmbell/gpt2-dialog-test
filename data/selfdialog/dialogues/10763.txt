"__FASHION__ Hey, Leslie, I have a question."
"__FASHION__ Shoot."
"__FASHION__ Since you are an aspiring fashion designer, my question is... What’s on the horizon for skirt/dress lengths?"
"__FASHION__ Well, I think you should look for everything from full circle skirts to flowy midis and maxis to flippy, flirty miniskirts this spring."
"__FASHION__ So the maxi look is still in? We aren't over that yet?"
"__FASHION__ Are you kidding me?  At least one maxi dress is should be in every woman's wardrobe."
"__FASHION__ You are so right."
"__FASHION__ It is a must-have look for those women who want to look fabulous without much effort."
"__FASHION__ Okay. We've got the dress part down how about the toe styles?"
"__FASHION__ You mean like for shoes/boots: square, pointy, platform?"
"__FASHION__ Exactly."
"__FASHION__ Square toes are out."
"__FASHION__ Thank-god. I personally never liked square toes on any type of shoe, pump, or boot."
"__FASHION__ That blocky shape is truly unflattering on the foot."
"__FASHION__ So, I take it pointy  toes will be making a come back."
"__FASHION__ They are but I hope  not at the extreme lengths of a few years back."
"__FASHION__ Those were just hideous."
"__FASHION__ You aren't kidding. I couldn't stand them myself."
"__FASHION__ You know, of all the shoe-toe shapes, my personal favorite is the almond."
"__FASHION__ Probably because it is  a gentle oval that makes legs look long and lean. It’s so sophisticated looking."
