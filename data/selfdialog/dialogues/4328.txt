"__MUSIC__ So have you ever listened to Led Zeppelin?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I have!  They've been around forever."
"__MUSIC__ I know, they were one of my original inspirations for music.  I learned to play guitar because of them."
"__MUSIC__ They have great music.  Everyone's heard Stairway to Heaven."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a great song.  I really love Kashmir."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that one is beautiful.  It goes on and on forever but it's a great song."
"__MUSIC__ I love the crescendo and how the beat builds throughout the song."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I wonder what happened to them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you know they were from London, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah."
"__MUSIC__ At first they weren't even that popular.  They were called the New Yardbirds, but then they changed their name."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that about them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and in 2007 they had a tribute concert in London.  I think they've been doing tribute concerts for awhile."
"__MUSIC__ They must be pretty old now."
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, but it's neat that the surviving members are still getting together and making music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's definitely neat.  It shows true passion for music."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely so!  I'd say they were definitely as big a hit in the 1970's as any band could be."
"__MUSIC__ They were certainly influential in music."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think they'll ever go out of style."
"__MUSIC__ No, probably not."
