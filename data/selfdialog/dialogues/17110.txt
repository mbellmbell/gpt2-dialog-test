"__MOVIES__ Have you seen La La Land?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't...did you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes...and you have to see it, you will love it."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Tell me about it."
"__MOVIES__ We saw it, and it was such a feel good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a musical? I hate when they keep breaking into song in musicals."
"__MOVIES__ IT's not like that. The songs and dances are woven into the overall story so well."
"__MOVIES__ I always think it seems silly, who does that in real life?"
"__MOVIES__ You just get so wrapped up in the story that you won't think like that at all."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I do like Ryan Gosling."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I am in love with Ryan Gosling now, if you like him before this movie, you will love him after."
"__MOVIES__ How about Emma Stone?"
"__MOVIES__ She is cute as a button and excellent in the movie too."
"__MOVIES__ How about them together?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't want to spoil the movie for you so I will not go into that."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, I don't like sad endings."
"__MOVIES__ It's not a sad ending, I told you it was a movie that had you feeling good on the way out."
"__MOVIES__ OK...do you think my boyfriend would like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes...mine did."
"__MOVIES__ Ok then, I think we will give a try."
