"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the Back to the Future series?"
"__MOVIES__ Believe or not I never have."
"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding?! They're classics!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! I just never happened to watch them."
"__MOVIES__ You need to watch them!"
"__MOVIES__ I know I will the next time I get the chance."
"__MOVIES__ They're not too long either. I think each one is about an hour and a half."
"__MOVIES__ That's not too bad."
"__MOVIES__ You can finish the whole series in a day!"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard the third one isn't great."
"__MOVIES__ It's the worst one out of all of them."
"__MOVIES__ That's such a shame."
"__MOVIES__ It's not too bad though. Worth watching at least once."
"__MOVIES__ Where does the last one take place."
"__MOVIES__ In the old western times!"
"__MOVIES__ This is already confusing."
"__MOVIES__ It's not too bad. It makes sense if you watch them all."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess I need to watch them then."
"__MOVIES__ I think you can get the trilogy for pretty cheap."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I should go grab it then!"
