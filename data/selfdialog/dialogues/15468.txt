"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite class in the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Mine is divination, what's yours?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Potions. I love cooking and chemistry sets so that would be right up my alley."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah if you didn't turn yourself into a frog first."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's why paying attention is so important. I'd have loved all the classes to be truthful."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Same here. I love the way they make you familiar with the inner workings of the school throughout the series."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes I believe that's part of its appeal. I want to visit the Harry Potter world at Universal Studios."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh me too, I've been wanting to go since before they opened."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I heard they really stuck to the movie, and included all the little details in the movie that fans would love."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ We'll get there one day, in the meantime we can continue to watch Harry Potter marathons for now."
