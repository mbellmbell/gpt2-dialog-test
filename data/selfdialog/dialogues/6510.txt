"__STAR_WARS__ So how much or little did you like the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked all three. The phantom menace got alot of bad reviews though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree I really liked all three."
"__STAR_WARS__ I might've not gone with Hayden Christianson in Attack of the clones but the movie was great."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Christianson either."
"__STAR_WARS__ My other critique is way too much CG."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly! Yoda was different each movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ They should have used the same puppet for Yoda that they used in Empire Strikes back."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. They just used too many computer generated characters which made the movie feel fake."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well that's the times we live in. Maybe the Last Jedi will be better?"
