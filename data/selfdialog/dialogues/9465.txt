"__BASEBALL__ Who is the best team in baseball right now?"
"__BASEBALL__ Believe it or not, it's the Houston Astros."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? Weren't they the worst team just a few years ago?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. But that's when they were in the National League."
"__BASEBALL__ How long ago was that?"
"__BASEBALL__ That was in 2012. They switched to the American League in 2013."
"__BASEBALL__ How are the world champion Chicago Cubs doing?"
"__BASEBALL__ They're not doing quite as well as last year."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they will repeat as world champions this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not sure. They need to improve some this year, but they have time. It's a long season."
"__BASEBALL__ So they aren't in first place in their division? If not, who is?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, they're not. Actually, the Cardinals are right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? I heard they had a terrible start to the season."
"__BASEBALL__ They did, but they're doing much better now. That's my point. The Cubs can still do the same thing."
"__BASEBALL__ The Cubs winning the World Series last year was such a big deal."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yes! That's because that's their first championship since 1908."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow! That's a very long time between champsionships!"
"__BASEBALL__ No doubt. But they pitched, hit, and defended better than everyone else last year. They earned it."
"__BASEBALL__ I heard the Cubs let Dexter Fowler go the Cardinals."
"__BASEBALL__ Unfortunately, yes. I thought that was not a smart move, letting their guy go to a rival."
