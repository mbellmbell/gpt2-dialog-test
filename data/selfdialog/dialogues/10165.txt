"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Enough of what the critics or the community wants us to think, who is your favorite rapper or rap group of all-time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Tough question. It'd have to be Outkast for me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I miss Outkast, I really wish they'd put out another album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know, it has been so long since I've heard Andre 3000 and Big Boi together. I miss them."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I miss them too, luckily their music has resonated with so many people and that means we hear their sound all over contemporary stuff."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, I was listening to To Pimp a Butterfly and Yeezus last night and thinking about how these albums would be starkly different had Outkast not existed."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, now I'm thinking about a Kendrick Lamar and Outkast collaboration. That'd be so cool."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No man, that'd be cooler than cool, it'd be ice cold! Sorry, that was super corny of me to quote 'Hey Ya!'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Corny, but I'll take it. Is that your favorite Outkast song of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, but it's up there. B.O.B. will probably always be my favorite, I had the good fortune to get to listen to the isolated vocals for that track and I don't know how that amount of rapping in one breath is possible"
