"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the better quarterback Joe Montana or Steve Young?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is no such thing as a wrong answer here. But you have to go by different years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you have to go by different years, just who is overall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because you have say, Steve Young 1993 vs. Joe Montana 1988."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steve Young I know ended his career with a better overall passer rating I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True 23 more rushing touchdowns too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget though that Young also played on great 49ers teams, ones that Montana help build."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true, Montana helped build those"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Montana is who you wanted if your team was down 7 points, at the 2 minute warning to tie the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you say hands down Montana?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking Montana is a god and Steve Young is top ten?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Montana proved how great he was when John Elway scored with like 40 seconds left to take the lead against the chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and then Montana drove those sorry butts down field and scored to win the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Young learned a lot from him and took the team to the superbowl in 94."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I'm super old school so Montana might be my final pick too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've grown to respect young more and more over the years though probably after he retired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too bad he didn't get consistent playing time til he was in his 30's and past his prime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, who knows what he could have been now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I guess Montana everyday and twice on Sunday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, respect for Joe but Montana for sure."
