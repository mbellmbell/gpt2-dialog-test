"__MUSIC__ Who's NOFX?"
"__MUSIC__ They are like this christian punk band."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to check them out. Are they pretty good?"
"__MUSIC__ They are but they are an older band."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. How did SR-71 rip them off though?"
"__MUSIC__ Well if you listen to some of their songs you'll notice similarities in tunes."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I never realized that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but both bands are still good."
"__MUSIC__ What about that one band New Found Glory?"
"__MUSIC__ What about them?"
"__MUSIC__ Whatever happened to that band?"
