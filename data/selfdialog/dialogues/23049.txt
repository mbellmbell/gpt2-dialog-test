"__DISNEY__ Favorite Disney princess. Go."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, Moana, easily."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I thought we agreed Belle was the best."
"__DISNEY__ You said favorite. Moana is my new favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, why?"
"__DISNEY__ Because she gets things done, because the ocean chose her, and because she didn't need a romantic interest."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, forgot you were aromantic."
"__DISNEY__ Yep, instant identification. Plus her singing voice."
"__DISNEY__ Oh absolutely, How Far I'll Go is STILL stuck in my head."
"__DISNEY__ Can you believe they just FOUND that girl?!"
