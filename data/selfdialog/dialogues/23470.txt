"__DISNEY__ I just got finished watching Moana with my daughter for the 100th time!"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that's a lot! She must love that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ She really does. Especially the songs, when they come on she sings and dances. It's adorable!"
"__DISNEY__ Aww! I've heard a bit about the movie, but I've never seen it. It's the one with The Rock in it right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, he plays a demi-god named Maui. He's actually pretty funny!"
"__DISNEY__ I've been meaning to watch it. What's it about?"
"__DISNEY__ Moana is the main character, she travels across the sea with Maui to save her island from 'the darkness'."
"__DISNEY__ Where does it take place?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was Hawaii because of Maui, but I read somewhere it's actually inspired by the Polynesian islands like Bora Bora and Samoa."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds awesome. I'll have to check it out soon!"
