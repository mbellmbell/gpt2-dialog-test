"__MUSIC__ Which band do you miss most from when you were in high school?"
"__MUSIC__ I was in high school in the early 2000's, and I really miss Story of The Year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, man! I loved them!"
"__MUSIC__ So did I. My favorite song by them was, 'Until The Day I Die'."
"__MUSIC__ That was a great hit. I also loved, 'Anthem of Our Dying Day'."
"__MUSIC__ That was an awesome one as well. Who else did you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I was also into Dashboard Confessional."
"__MUSIC__ They were cool! I liked Brand New."
"__MUSIC__ I loved their song, 'Mixtape'."
"__MUSIC__ Now that one was a classic!"
"__MUSIC__ It sure was! I was never into Taking Back Sunday, though."
"__MUSIC__ I never got too into them either."
"__MUSIC__ I've noticed a lot of bands in more modern times sort of replicate them such as Panic! At the Disco!"
"__MUSIC__ I've noticed that too. I could never really get into the newer bands."
"__MUSIC__ Switching subjects, what about older bands. Which one of them is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I would have to say the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ I never got into the Beatles or the Beach Boys."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! The Beatles are classic, though."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I guess I just have heard them too much."
"__MUSIC__ I can see how that could happen. Still an awesome band, though!"
