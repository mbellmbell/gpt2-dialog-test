"__BEATLES__ Who is this band?"
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles!  This is one of their first songs."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, how did I not recognize that?"
"__BEATLES__ Because the song isn't played that much.  This is 'Please Please Me,' one of their first hits."
"__BEATLES__ Cool!  What's your favorite Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ 'Let It Be,' how about yours?"
"__BEATLES__ 'A Hard Day's Night.'"
"__BEATLES__ That's a great one too!  When I hear that first note I get excited about the song!"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, it's much better than this song actually."
"__BEATLES__ I agree, they got better later in their career."
