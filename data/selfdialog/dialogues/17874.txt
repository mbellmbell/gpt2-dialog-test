"__MOVIES__ What movie did you take the kids to see last weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ My son was really interested in the Power Rangers Movie."
"__MOVIES__ Your daughter was okay with seeing it?"
"__MOVIES__ We were both unsure, but our curiousity won out."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?  Was it like those bad tv episodes?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, it was really good."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that Elizabeth Banks is the bad guy/ girl whatever."
"__MOVIES__ She was, my son loves her from the Lego Movie so he was laughing at her voice when she tried to sound threatening."
"__MOVIES__ But was it the same old rubber costumes with the mouths that don't move?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope.  She just had a bunch of make up on.  She was good"
"__MOVIES__ Awesome.  I don't think I know anyone else who was in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I liked that too.  They weren't big name actors, but they were familiar"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Like from other shows or movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the pink ranger was actually an actress from a kids' movie called Lemonade Mouth."
"__MOVIES__ Naomi Scott?  No way!  I didn't realize she was in the movie too."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  My daughter was so excited to recognize her."
"__MOVIES__ Very cool.  I may have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ It had some positive messages about inclusion as well."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, one of the rangers admitted that he was on the 'spectrum' and explained that he thinks differently."
