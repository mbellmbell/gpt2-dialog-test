"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I have!  It was so good!"
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the end scene with Yondu and Peter."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Baby Groot!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I did too, but I thought Drax really knocked it out of the park!"
"__MOVIES__ I did like how they went more in depth about his character."
"__MOVIES__ It was hilarious when he talked about meeting his wife"
"__MOVIES__ I guess now we know that he really does hate dancing."
"__MOVIES__ Did you notice that Groot would stop dancing every time Drax looked at him?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, what was that about?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently, it is just because Drax hates dancing."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, that makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ It also makes the opening scene even better."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was really cleverly done."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the way the characters related to Baby Groot too"
"__MOVIES__ Especially at the end when he was sleepy and they were passing him around"
"__MOVIES__ I think it really allowed for the others characters to look more human"
"__MOVIES__ Even Rocket has a soft spot for Baby Groot"
"__MOVIES__ Baby Groot is the only one Rocket likes."
