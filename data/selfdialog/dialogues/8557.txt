"__BEATLES__ Who's your favorite rock group of all time?"
"__BEATLES__ That's gotta be the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Why are they the all time favorite?"
"__BEATLES__ Not sure why, maybe just because everyone knows them the most. They had a good share of media coverage."
"__BEATLES__ So what happened to the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Unfortunately, half of the band has passed away. John Lennon was murdered by a crazyman back in 1980 and George Harrison died of lung cancer back in 2001."
"__BEATLES__ Why would anyone want to do away with someone like that?"
"__BEATLES__ Mark David Chapman killed John Lennon because he said he was jealous of the Beattles and wanted to be 'somebody' like the Beatles. The Beatles' fame got him upset, so he shot and killed the Beatles' main leader, John Lennon"
"__BEATLES__ That's a shame. Will the Beatles ever make a comeback?"
"__BEATLES__ Not looking good for a comeback. Ringo Starr looks contently retired with  hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank, and Paul McCartney seems to have little to no motive to reform the Beatles."
