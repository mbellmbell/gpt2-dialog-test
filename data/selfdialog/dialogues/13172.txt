"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the best run NFL franchise, would you say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotta go with New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't really argue with their success in the Belichek/Brady Era."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, they're the gold standard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have two reservations there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, what are they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Number one is the cheating stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ahh, a lot of that is overblown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Deflate -Gate was definitely ridiculous, but Spy-Gate was real."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was pretty bad. But I still say that doesn't disqualify them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My other issue is that it seems like all their success is due to coach and star quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what? They still won the games!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean the whole organization is strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, then what team would you pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd go with the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they're hanging with New England in terms of rings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rings, but also sustained success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they've won with multiple coaches and quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I think their ownership structure really knows how to run a winner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't really go wrong with either team!"
