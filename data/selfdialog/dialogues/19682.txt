"__MOVIES__ Did you see any of the Harry Potter movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding?  I saw all of them at least twice."
"__MOVIES__ Which one was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the first one, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was probably my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about Prisoner of Azkaban?"
"__MOVIES__ Welll, I liked them all but that was probably my least favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any of the other Young Adult books turned movies that you really liked?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably my next favorite series would be Hunger Games."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Jennifer Lawrence was great in those. What other movies of hers have you seen?"
"__MOVIES__ A few, and I really liked her in American Hustle."
"__MOVIES__ That was a great movie.  What did you think about Passengers?"
"__MOVIES__ Ugh.  I was so looking forward to that but I wasn't a fan."
"__MOVIES__ Me either and I'm a huge Chris Pratt Fan.  Speaking of which have you seen Guardian of the Galaxy 2 yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I am going this weekend and I can't wait to see it."
"__MOVIES__ So I take it you were a fan of the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, I thought it was great."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think Groot will grow up in this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Don't, know, but he's aborable as a little sapling in the previews!"
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite character is Rocket, how about yours."
"__MOVIES__ Now that I'm thinking about it, I think Groot.  He's very different than any movie character I've seen before!"
