"__BEATLES__ Do you feel The Beatles are overrated?"
"__BEATLES__ Absolutely not, they are essential in my mind."
"__BEATLES__ I just don't see it, I mean they are catchy enough, but many consider them the best band ever."
"__BEATLES__ I'm one of those people, there's never been a better final album than Let it Be and it wasn't even one of their stronger overall."
"__BEATLES__ What tracks would you recommend, perhaps I should give them another chance."
"__BEATLES__ Listen to a day in the life, strawberry fields forever and come together, see what you think."
"__BEATLES__ I'll check them out, still don't think I'll like them better than The Stones."
"__BEATLES__ Stones as in Rolling Stones? C'mon now great band in their own right, but they can't hold a candle to The Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ We can agree to disagee, although who knows maybe I'll notice something with The Beatles this time."
"__BEATLES__ You wouldn't be the first, sometimes it takes more than one listen. By the way Yesterday, listen to that one as well."
