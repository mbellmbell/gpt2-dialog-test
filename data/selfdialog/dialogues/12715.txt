"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really excited about the Raiders this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they moving to Las Vegas yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not yet, that won't be until 2020."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For some reason I thought it was going to be next year. Either way, I'm also excited about the Raiders this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They overachieved last year and were looking really good until the unfortunate Derek Carr injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the turning point for their season. Derek Carr is so good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, he was the heart and soul of their team and I think when he went down the sails went out on their season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It didn't help that the backup quarterback also got hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that late in the season going into the post season playoffs was rough with that situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought Michael Crabtree looked really good too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely had a resurgence and Derek Carr certainly made him look good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders defense was so good last year! I hope they were able to maintain and keep everyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The key defensive players are intact and they also added Jelani Jenkins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jelani was on the Dolphins last year right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he was on the Dolphins. He'll help solidify their linebacker core."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about offense aren't you excited about Cordarrelle Patterson and Jared Cook along with of course the BEAST, Marshawn Lynch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's obviously excitement from me without question. I'm also really pleased with the signing of EJ Manuel as a backup quarterback in case of something unfortunate happening again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right they also picked up EJ. That's a smart move especially since backup quarterback was so thin in depth for them last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm looking forward to the season as I expect the Raiders to be on top of the division again. I don't see the Denver Broncos, Chargers being much of a threat, but the Kansas City Chiefs will be tough again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be a fun season out there in the AFC West again, it'll be exciting."
