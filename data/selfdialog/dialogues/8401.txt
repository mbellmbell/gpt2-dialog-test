"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I would definitely consider myself a Beatles fan. And by that I mean a fan of their music, not necessarily the guys themselves."
"__BEATLES__ I know... I feel the same."
"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh wow. Good question. I don't know... The white album maybe, or Sergeant Pepper's."
"__BEATLES__ Good choices. I love those. And Abbey Road. Love it."
"__BEATLES__ Abbey Road. Yes. Actually you're right. I like it even better than Sergeant Pepper's. I Want You was one of my first favorite songs ever."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yes! It's such a trippy, heavy, slightly desperate song. Beautiful."
"__BEATLES__ It's true that there is a bit of discreet desperation, or at least deep, sad, longing in many of the songs of that album."
"__BEATLES__ Yep. Oh Darling comes to mind. Or Because."
"__BEATLES__ Or You Never Give me Your Money. I guess they were starting to feel that fame and success was not all that it cracked up to be."
