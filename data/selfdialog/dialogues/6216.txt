"__STAR_WARS__ So, in Star Wars, are droids alive?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, they're not."
"__STAR_WARS__ But they have like souls or consciousness or something?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're not part of the force, so no. They might sentient or sapient though."
"__STAR_WARS__ But doesn't Yoda say in Empire that the force flows through all things, even rocks and droids and stuff?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The force is everywhere, but not everything is connected to it in that way. Like rocks, droids aren't."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, but R2 is clearly self-aware, and practically a living being."
"__STAR_WARS__ But he's still a non-living machine. And most droids never even get his level of self-awareness."
"__STAR_WARS__ So when a droid dies that's it? They don't join the force?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, but they can always be rebuilt. That's the upside to being a droid."
