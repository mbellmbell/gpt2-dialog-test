"__POP__ Who do you think is the greatest pop singer of all time?"
"__POP__ You mean, besides Michael Jackson, the King of Pop?"
"__POP__ Besides Michael Jackson. And besides Madonna. Who would you say?"
"__POP__ I'd have to say Elvis Presley then."
"__POP__ You're probably right. I would put Prince and George Michael on that short list also."
"__POP__ Oh, I totally agree! Prince is more R&B, though."
"__POP__ Maybe. But George Michael is right up there and totally pop."
"__POP__ It's so sad that almost all of that list is dead now."
"__POP__ I can't believe it, either."
"__POP__ Their incredible music lives on, at least."
