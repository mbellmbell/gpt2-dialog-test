"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ did you ever hear about the deflating scandal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ no? what is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ the deflating scandal, where they were caught deflating their footballs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ no, which team was it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i believe it was the patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ of course, one of biggest teams in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yep, it was a huge thing years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ how did the NFL catch onto them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ probably heard a conversation about it or something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, and someone ratted the team out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ or, an NFL official could've just noticed a deflated ball and their possession."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ true, and then decided to persue it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i can't believe they were dumb enough to try and get away with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ well what are the advantages to deflating balls?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i'm no expert but it's probably easier to play with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ really? i would imagine it would be harder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ well i'm assuming if they are different than official weighted balls the other teams would'nt be able to handle them properly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i guess that makes sense, well what happened to the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i think they were banned from a whole season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ serves them right."
