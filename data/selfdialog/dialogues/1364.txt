"__MUSIC__ What hip hop artists do you miss hearing about?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess probably Nas and sometimes Eve."
"__MUSIC__ Nas is amazing and he is just legendary. I heard he is dating Nicki Minaj."
"__MUSIC__ How cool would it be if they released a track together?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be fire for sure."
"__MUSIC__ I would be one of the first ones downloading it on iTunes. They would be the perfect hip hop and singing duo."
"__MUSIC__ I know! Speaking of Eve, has she been up to anything musically lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard anything lately, but I still jam out to her oldies sometimes in the car!"
"__MUSIC__ So do I! What about Ja Rule, do you miss him?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't honestly miss him at all. Maybe sometimes when he was teamed up with Ashanti."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I still listen to their old song, 'Mesmerized'."
"__MUSIC__ So do I! I like the, 'Always on Time' one as well."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I don't know if he has released any new solos lately."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. He did have a reality show out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but as far as musically, I think he has mostly retired."
"__MUSIC__ Some new up and coming artists are wonderful enough to keep my attention, though. Like Post Malone."
"__MUSIC__ I really love him! He's so unique and raps about things with meanings."
"__MUSIC__ I love how his lyrics are deep, and he is just so individualistic."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I also like Future as far as new hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ As do I, though I think he has been slacking a bit lately."
