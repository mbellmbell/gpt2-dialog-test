"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite scene in all of Star Wars is the Trench Run from Episode IV. What is yours?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite is the Battle of Hoth."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which part of the Battle of Hoth, because that's a pretty long battle?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, it's definitely the AT-AT walkers showing up and laying waste to the Rebel Alliance defenses."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not the Snow Speeders bringing down the AT-AT with tow cables?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, watching the AT-AT just walking across the snow on the giant movie screen was amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel the AT-AT portion of the battle was too contrived. The Empire had ships and air superiority, they didn't need the AT-AT."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not true at all. It makes perfect sense for the Empire to employ walkers. The Rebels had a planetary shield protecting the base."
"__STAR_WARS__ I refuse to believe that dinky shield generator could have held up against the combined firepower of those Star Destroyers."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was initially only 2 Star Destroyers and don't forget the Rebels also had that massive Ion Cannon!"
