"__DISNEY__ I can't believe it's been so long since Snow White and the Seven Dwarves came out."
"__DISNEY__ It's astounding, isn't it? It's such a classic Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Totally. The dwarves are my favorite part of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ I like Bashful the most because it's so cute when his cheeks get all red. What about you?"
"__DISNEY__ I like Doc because it is so funny when he can't find the right words to say."
"__DISNEY__ I think it's cool how each dwarf had a different personality yet they were all so sweet, even Grumpy."
"__DISNEY__ I know, and they were all heartbroken when they thought that Snow White had died."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they ever visited her at the palace after the prince woke her up."
"__DISNEY__ I guess we'll never know. At least she gave them all a kiss on the head goodbye."
