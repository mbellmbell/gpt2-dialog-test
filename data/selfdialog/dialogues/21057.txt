"__THRILLER__ Have you seen the 2000 thriller American Psycho will Christian Bale?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I actually really like that movie and find it quite entertaining."
"__THRILLER__ It is a pretty amusing movie and I really thought the young Bale at that time did a great job."
"__THRILLER__ Not only is it a thriller, there is also a fair amount of dark comedy."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, that is also true. Especially the scene with Paul Allen, that is probably the most famous part of the movie."
"__THRILLER__ Not only that, but the Patrick character was also very interesting."
"__THRILLER__ That begs the question that has never been answered --- was it all in his head?"
"__THRILLER__ I have heard that rumor, but also read statements that while most of it in fact was in his head, not all of it."
"__THRILLER__ That's another strong aspect of the movie. Letting the audience decide what really happened."
"__THRILLER__ I agree. It's always good, because he we are almost twenty years later still talking about it!"
