"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite bad movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Favorite BAD movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like one you know is not well done, but you enjoy watching it anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I guess it's Grease 2, then."
"__MOVIES__ There's a Grease 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and it's terrible, but so much fun to watch.  Catchy, but bizarre songs, silly plot, bad editing."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds awesome."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of is.  It has Michelle Pfeiffer singing about how she wants a Cool Rider."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you've sold me on this terribleness that I have to see.  I'll have to see if I can find it somewhere."
"__MOVIES__ You should.  So, what's your favorite bad movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough call.  There's The Ice Pirates, which is a weird parody/rip-off of like Star Wars and other sci-fi movies."
"__MOVIES__ The Ice Pirates.  I don't think I've ever heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ They used to show it on TV, late.  It had Robert Urich and Joan Rivers, or at least her voice as a robot."
"__MOVIES__ Joan Rivers?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  The robot was also kind of styled like her."
"__MOVIES__ I don't even know what to say to that."
"__MOVIES__ Ha.  But I think I'd actually pick Cutthroat Island as my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ That huge flop with Geena Davis?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Matthew Modine.  It's incredibly ridiculous and I love it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I guess bad pirate movies must really do it for you."
