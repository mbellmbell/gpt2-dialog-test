"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your prediction to win it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sadly, I say the patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? how come?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The improved so much this offseason. Plus they have the best QB of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know they got Stephon Gilmore and Brandin Cooks, but they lost their best RB"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Legarette Blount was good, but it seems like anyone can be a RB in that offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brandin Cooks was a huge addition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, Brady hasn't had a top WR threat since Randy Moss"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh well we all know how that went we he played for them!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Undeafeated until the super bowl if I remember correctly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Darn Eli Manning wasn't having none of that undefeated juice"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was a tough break for them, Brady has won many more since then"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may get one more now that he has Edelman, Gronk, and Cooks to throw too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am eager to see how their running game works."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Blount had 18 touchdowns so it is going to be hard to replace that much production"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I do not think they got a certain guy to replace him with"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps runningback by committe is what they will use"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of teams have turned to that, sucks for fantasy football"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cooks to the patriots is good for fantasy football"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not for the dolphins, bills and jets though"
