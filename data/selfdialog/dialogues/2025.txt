"__MUSIC__ What do you think of video game music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really listen to that kind of music a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Not even when you're playing the games that have music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, yeah when I'm playing games I kind of have to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like what you hear?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I do, but it goes on in the background so you don't really pay attention that much to it."
"__MUSIC__ That's actually why I like it so much."
"__MUSIC__ Now that you mention it, I could see it being good background music."
"__MUSIC__ It's especially good for doing homework, because it's both relaxing and helps you focus."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of the better artists that do video game music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure what the guy's name is, but the person who does the music for the Fable games does a great job."
"__MUSIC__ What does he sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ He wrote a lot of great melodies to be played by an orchestra, so it's kind of like classical music."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting, is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ I love all the music from the first game. Each song is very memorable and fills you with a lot of emotion."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's pretty rare for music in a video game."
"__MUSIC__ I would say so too, it's rare to have really good music in a video game."
"__MUSIC__ Are there any other games that have great music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like all the music in the Final Fantasy games a lot, most of that is orchestral too."
"__MUSIC__ I guess orchestral video game music is some of the best then."
