"__COMEDY__ What is your favorite comedy?"
"__COMEDY__ You know I love those old movies from the 1980's. All I have to say is Caddy Shack."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, that's one of my favorites too. What about Ferris Bueller's Day Off? Gremlins, Airplane."
"__COMEDY__ Yep, those were good ones. What about Ghost Busters and Airplane."
"__COMEDY__ The humor was different then. I think in some ways we were allowed to laugh at eveyone."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, things are so PC now. Though I have to say did you see Key and Peele in Keanu?"
"__COMEDY__ Those guys are so funny. I would watch them in anything!"
"__COMEDY__ So I guess you saw them in Storks and Wanderlust?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, the wolf scenes are so funny. I don't remember the other."
"__COMEDY__ Well it was worth watching them for the wolves. Hope they do something new soon. Those guys are so irreverently funny."
