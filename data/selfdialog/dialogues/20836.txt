"__THRILLER__ Have you seen Tom Cruise's The Mummy?"
"__THRILLER__ I have! I watched it with my mum. She's a big fan of him."
"__THRILLER__ Did you like it? I found it to be boring to be honest."
"__THRILLER__ I found it boring too. I especially didn't buy the love story."
"__THRILLER__ Right? It was so forced. At the end of the movie I couldn't care less if the woman died."
"__THRILLER__ The whole movie was bad. The only character I liked was Princess Ahmanet."
"__THRILLER__ I liked her too but even her story was flawed, why bring a devil king to rule with her if she wasn't interested in competition?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I guess. At the end of the movie there really wasn't any character you wanted to cheer for."
"__THRILLER__ Exactly. I heard they're going to make more from this Dark Universe or something."
"__THRILLER__ That's what I heard too. I hope it isn't as boring as this one."
