"__COMEDY__ What's your favorite Tina Fey movie?"
"__COMEDY__ I think it would have to be Mean Girls. What about you?"
"__COMEDY__ Mean Girls is a good one, but Sisters is probably my favorite."
"__COMEDY__ Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are great together. They look like they could be sisters in real life!"
"__COMEDY__ I know. They were also hilarious in Baby Mama together."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yeah, that was a good one too."
"__COMEDY__ Wow I just realized they were in Mean Girls together, too! I completely forgot that Amy Poehler played Regina George's mom."
"__COMEDY__ I completely forgot too! It's so funny when she says that she's a cool mom, not a regular mom."
"__COMEDY__ I know, and the fact that her boobs are rock hard."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, that movie is classic."
