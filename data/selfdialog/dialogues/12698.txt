"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you picking to get to the Superbowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tough one, man. Let me tell you who I want."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. Who then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want the Falcons back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not the Patriots. That's for sure. Raiders or Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. Now why do you like those match-ups?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First. I'm a Falcon fan. Last year. That's rough. That's just a rough way to end the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. What else you got?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So with the Raiders, I want to see Carr at full health. And of course Marshawn. I feel like he got robbed a few years back, you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I can understand that. What else on those two teams, Oak and Denver?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, I know with all the Warriors' success, it's not like Oakland's in no-man's land or anything. I just feel like it would be great to win before they leave. I also just want Lynch to blow it up, you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. I do. And the Broncos?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mostly fan base. NFL hype. You know, either of those match-ups, Denver-Atlanta, Oakland-Atlanta. It'll be good PR. I mean, it'll be a lot of hype and lots of folks'll watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Yeah. For me, just my bias, I'd like to see Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've got a good shot. Too much can go wrong, though, you know. Always too much can go wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. But it'd be good. Man Raider nation would go crazy if they make it to the Superbowl, even more if it happens before they move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I know, right? I would definitely tune in for that. 'Must See TV,' for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the A versus Oakland or Denver? I could live with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, man. Here we go!"
