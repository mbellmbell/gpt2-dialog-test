"__MUSIC__ When you go the gym for a good workout, what kind of music do you tend to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ It kind of depends on what I am doing, to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ As in if you are lifting weights or doing cardio?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. For weight training exercises, rock music really gets me into the zone."
"__MUSIC__ And what about cardio? Do you preference?"
"__MUSIC__ For my cardio, I can do just about any type of music, as long as I enjoy what I am hearing."
"__MUSIC__ Does one particular genre mesh well for you in the cardio session?"
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, '90's pop just has a well good ring to it that keeps me going."
"__MUSIC__ That is always a good thing. Whatever works best for you!"
"__MUSIC__ I know you go the gym, as well. So, what about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually made a playlist on my phone specifically for my workout routine."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a smart idea. What type of music is on your playlist?"
"__MUSIC__ A little bit of everything, honestly. From Country, to pop, to heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I could workout to Country music. That just may not do much for me."
"__MUSIC__ I am not too picky with what I can workout to. Sometimes I'll even enjoy some EDM music."
"__MUSIC__ Same here! Are you a Skrillex fan?"
"__MUSIC__ I enjoy their music, For some reason, Avenged Sevenfold just has a bit that I love, so I workout to their music quite often."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they are just a great band overall!"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely agree with that. Sometimes I'll just take my earbuds out and listen to whatever music the gym is playing, as well."
"__MUSIC__ That is a good way to discover new artists, so I applaud that idea."
