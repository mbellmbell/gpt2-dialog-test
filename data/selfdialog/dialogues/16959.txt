"__MOVIES__ Yeah!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I thought it was good, but not his best."
"__MOVIES__ Whatever. Well, what is YOUR favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing beats Stepmom. I love my Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts."
"__MOVIES__ Really?! But that little boy was so weird and creepy."
"__MOVIES__ I know. They should've casted another for that role."
"__MOVIES__ And that teenage girl was a bit too dramatic."
"__MOVIES__ True. She was also in that one movie with Macaulay Culkin as a super religious chic, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! Saved is what I think it is called."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! We get on some weird tangents on movies, don't we?"
"__MOVIES__ As usual. That's why I like being able to talk about them with you."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of chic flicks, I say Bridget Jones's Baby and it was surprisingly really good!"
"__MOVIES__ Was it? I wasn't sure how good it was going to be, since I don't even recognize Renee's face anymore with all that plastic surgery."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my God, yes! See it! I hadn't seen the other Bridget Jones's movies, but this one had me in tears from laughter!"
"__MOVIES__ So what is your favorite Tarantino movie?"
"__MOVIES__ From Dusk Til Dawn. It is such an original vampire comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't George Clooney in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it has been a while since I have seen that one, but I remember it being good!"
"__MOVIES__ I own it, if you ever want to borrow it?"
