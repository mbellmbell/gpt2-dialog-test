"__STAR_WARS__ If it happened a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away......so where are they now?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess they have all passed away or something. Maybe a black hole got them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why didn't they visit Earth? They could travel light speed."
"__STAR_WARS__ You have to travel much faster than light speed to get to a different galaxy within a lifetime."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda probably lived long enough to make it to Earth."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably, but he had more important issues to deal with."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the Senate and Emperor were a real pain in the butt weren't they?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I don't blame him for taking it easy when he retired. Why he stayed on Dagobah beats me though."
"__STAR_WARS__ He and OB1 were basically the only jedi left. I guarantee his face was at the top of the Imperial most wanted posters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet he could have kicked Boba Fett's butt back in the day. A bounty hunter ain't getting his hands on Yoda."
