"__MOVIES__ Ugh. I wish that these movie remakes would just stop already."
"__MOVIES__ Why? Which movie are they remaking now?"
"__MOVIES__ They're remaking The Craft."
"__MOVIES__ Which movie was that?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, the one with the four teenage girls who are witches. The three girls gang up on the good one with dark magic."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right. The one with Robin Tunney and Neve Campbell."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe they're remaking that movie. I'll never get that scene from the original with all of the snakes, spiders, and bugs out of my head."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know. That was so gross."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, what's the deal with the remake."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it is technically not a remake per se. It is more of a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ So, are they just going to ignore the first movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the director said there would be callbacks to the first movie, but it will be its own story."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess that makes it a bit more interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I want to see it, but I am scared that this will somehow take away from the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ When does the remake come out?"
"__MOVIES__ They're saying that it is supposed to be coming out some time in 2017, but I also read that they're still working on the script."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like they are unsure of what they're doing."
"__MOVIES__ A little bit, but at least you know it will be a bit horror filled because the writer for 10 Cloverfield Lane just signed on to write the script."
"__MOVIES__ OK. Now, I am going to have to put this on my list of movies to see in 2017 or whenever it comes out."
