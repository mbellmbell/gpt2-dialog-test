"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Lady Gaga's new song?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't heard it yet. What is it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called 'The Cure.'"
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to look it up. Is it good?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's good. It's different from what I am used to hearing from her."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that? I know her last album was kind of country."
"__MUSIC__ I heard people say that, but I didn't hear anything from her last album besides that song 'Million Reasons.'"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't care for that one too much. She has a great voice, but I don't get what she was trying to do. She's not a country artist."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, her new song is different from that. She's back to doing pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I'm glad to hear that. So what is it about?"
"__MUSIC__ It's like a love song I guess. It's about how love is the cure for everything."
"__MUSIC__ Is it a dance song?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. It's not as uptempo as 'Born This Way' or 'Poker Face.' It's a little slower."
"__MUSIC__ 'Poker Face' was one of my favorite songs by her."
"__MUSIC__ I know! Me too. I wish she would make more songs like that."
"__MUSIC__ Well she's probably trying to do new things. You know artists like to change their style every once in awhile."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I don't like when they change too much though. Like, I really loved her first cd the most."
"__MUSIC__ That was my favorite too. After that, she was kind of hit or miss for me."
"__MUSIC__ This new song might be a miss."
"__MUSIC__ Well I will look it up on youtube and let you know what I think."
