"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite comedy is Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ Deadpool is not a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I beg to differ."
"__MOVIES__ It's a comic book movie. Not a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Then why is it funnier than ninety percent of the supposed comedies that have come out in the past ten years?"
"__MOVIES__ I have to admit it is hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Would you admit it's funnier than 'We're the millers'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I can agree to that."
"__MOVIES__ And 'We're the Millers' is a comedy, yes?"
"__MOVIES__ I see your point. But it's still considered a comic book movie."
"__MOVIES__ Movies can share genres."
"__MOVIES__ I mean primarily."
"__MOVIES__ Primarily, yes it is a comic book movie but it's also a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ So I think I see where you're going with this."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Deadpool is my favorite comedy."
"__MOVIES__ So do you consider the other comic book movies comedies? They all have humor in them."
"__MOVIES__ They're funny sometimes but nothing like Deadpool. Spiderman may come close."
"__MOVIES__ Spiderman is always funny but I doubt it will be as funny as Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ We'll see when it comes out."
