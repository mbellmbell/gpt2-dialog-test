"__MOVIES__ Hey did you see that movie Zootopia?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what is Zootopia?  Wasn't it some cartoon?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not a cartoon, it's like an animated film for both kids and adults!  It was great!"
"__MOVIES__ I do remember my kids talking about it.  So it was enjoyable for you, too?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, totally!  The characters are hilarious and it has some really memorable scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I love it when movies are made for the whole family."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too.  There's this one scene with sloths that is completely hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ So it's worth renting?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's perfect for a family movie night.  I love the computer graphics in it, too."
"__MOVIES__ I will definitely put that on our list of movies to rent.  I know I had seen the trailers but I kept forgetting about it."
"__MOVIES__ Just be on the lookout for the sloth scene, you'll know what I mean."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like they are coming out with animated films lately that are even better than acted films!"
"__MOVIES__ I know!  It's really come along way."
"__MOVIES__ The graphics are amazing and they can do so much action related stuff that can't be done with real humans."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it's amazing what they can do with the technology."
"__MOVIES__ For real.  Plus, I like seeing animals acting, it's always so funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is, and it's neat when famous actors and actresses are doing the voices."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, true.  Well we will be sure to rent Zootopia next family movie night, possibly tonight!"
"__MOVIES__ You should, I am sure that you will all enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks for the recommendation."
