"__THRILLER__ What did you think of the movie 'Signs'?"
"__THRILLER__ I actually didn't think it was bad. Not the best I've ever seen, though."
"__THRILLER__ I always thought it was really slow to start."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, but the plot does get pretty interesting after while."
"__THRILLER__ I thought the concept of the aliens and the crop circles were scary."
"__THRILLER__ I agree. The movie made me want to lock my doors when it picked up."
"__THRILLER__ M. Night Shyamalan always has pretty interesting ideas."
"__THRILLER__ He does. I thought the baby monitor scene was a great choice."
"__THRILLER__ That part freaked me out."
"__THRILLER__ Me too. That, and the fact that crop circles are a real life occurrence."
