"__DISNEY__ There is so much talk about disney putting hidden messages or things in the movies. Have you noticed any?"
"__DISNEY__ I have in fact."
"__DISNEY__ Like what? I have never seen anything at all!"
"__DISNEY__ Well the original vhs in the little mermaid had one. The priest at the end has noticable movement in his crotch area."
"__DISNEY__ What, really? Are you certain?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes completely. It is there on it. Not sure if they changed it for DVD or later releases."
"__DISNEY__ It is so bizarre they would do that at all."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, also the dust in aladdin in one scene is said to spell the word sex."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was allegedly the genie saying something inappropriate when he was a bee."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that one too. I think it is a little bit of a stretch but I can sort of hear it."
