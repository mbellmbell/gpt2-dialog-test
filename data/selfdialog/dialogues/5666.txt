"__STAR_WARS__ If you could be in any Star Wars vehicle, what would you choose?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like land or air? Either one is fine?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, whatever you want!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would want to be in a pod racer!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They go so fast and can even fly sideways!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Would be as fast as Anakin?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Even faster! I'd be the champion!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Who would build it for you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd get the Anakin's rival to make it, he had a cool one!"
