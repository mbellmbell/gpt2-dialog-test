"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that movie Signs?"
"__MOVIES__ The one set in the crop fields?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think it's by Shyamalan."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ How'd you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was kind of slow, but I liked the religious part of it."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a bit slow too. I also would've liked if the alien was more visible throughout the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's a good point. What'd you think of the weakness to water?"
"__MOVIES__ That was horrible. They could've done something else that made more sense."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. You'd think it'd get wet from the crops or just die because of humidity."
"__MOVIES__ I attribute that to the country being very dry, but yeah it's an oversight."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that movie wasn't so great. Sixth Sense was though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Sixth Sense was great."
"__MOVIES__ The plot twist at the end was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was. It was even better when realize all the clues the movie had."
"__MOVIES__ I caught it all watching it a second time."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think of his Avatar movie? I remember you watched the cartoon."
"__MOVIES__ I don't like to talk about it. Avatar deserved a better adaptation."
"__MOVIES__ So you won't be watching the sequel he plans to make?"
"__MOVIES__ No."
