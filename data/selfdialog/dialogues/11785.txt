"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I wouldn't bet on the Seahawks. They seem to be trending downwards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? Weren't they in the playoffs last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but they lost Marshawn Lynch and just didn't have the same pop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree to some extent, but they still have an amazing defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, if they can keep Richard Sherman's head on straight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a great player, but sometimes he just needs to keep his mouth shut."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well it seems like if he keeps moving his lips, he may be traded."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if he is traded, I don't know who I would bet to win the NFL or Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would probably expect the Falcons to come out of the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea? You think they could get back to the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might. They have a really strong team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do and Matt Ryan is coming off a great season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly! You never know though. Anybody could have a great year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, there's always a few other teams to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just tough to see anyone taking down the Patriots. They just keep getting better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they do, but sometimes age eventually catches up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I can understand that, but sometimes I don't know how Bellichek does it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either, the guy just wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many superbowls does he have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't even know. I lost count."
