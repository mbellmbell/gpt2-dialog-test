"__MUSIC__ Did I tell you that I was going to the symphony last night?"
"__MUSIC__ No, you didn't. That's cool. How was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was really beautiful. Brahms and Rachmaninoff."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds lovely. I've never even been to the symphony, sadly."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you should go. You'd really enjoy it. I mean, I know that you're really a music lover."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. I've been to the opera several times. But the symphony has eluded me."
"__MUSIC__ Which operas have you seen?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw Rigoletto and I also saw a production of Carmen. Both were spectacular."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds wonderful. I have to go see one someday soon ."
"__MUSIC__ I also went to a Luciano Pavarotti concert once and his voice was remarkable. I've never heard anything like it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, he was so talented. I used to love watching him on television."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine singing opera is one of the most difficult types of performance to carry off."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, for sure. There's a lot of power being put to work there."
"__MUSIC__ Who have you seen in concert that you've liked?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to an amazing Barry Manilow concert back in the day. He puts on a great show."
"__MUSIC__ I used to have a huge crush on him. I still think he's super talented."
"__MUSIC__ I know, when you think about all the songs he's written, it's like classic after classic."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he 'Writes the Songs.' Literally."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, that he does. And he used to write the commercials, too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I forgot about that. He wrote a lot of famous jingles."
