"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hello. What's up?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey. Nothing much. Have you seen any good movies lately."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, not really. I just saw 'Life' and I thought it was pretty bad."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't know that movie. What is it about?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's about some astronauts who intercept a capsule that has some alien."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's a scifi movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. I usually like this type movie, but this one not so much."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Really? Why not?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was just such a bad series of events and unrealistic things I couldn't overlook."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, the expert on alien life was playing with the alien like a pet for one thing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's funny."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ At one point the alien seems to be in stasis or hibernating and the idiot electro shocks it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow. That's funny."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, the alien get's angry and attacks the guy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't blame it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ This is the first movie ever where I actually wanted everyone to die."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's funny."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They were really so incompetent and so many stupid things."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think I'll pass on this one."
