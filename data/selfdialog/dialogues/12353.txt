"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to have the best offense in the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a tough question, there are a few good options."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but there are some obvious choices."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. The Falcons should really be able to put up some point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Julio Jones is unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he is too tall for a lot of the defenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean. He can have 3 guys covering him and he can still jump higher to catch the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also think that the Tampa Bay Bucks are going to break out this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. They added D. Jackson, his deep threat is going to open the field up for Mike Evans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Mike Evans is another big bodied receiver. He will be great this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have a third team that will have a top offense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps Green Bay will be back in form this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is quite possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jordy Nelson should be fully healed, and they got rid of Eddie Lacy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Lacy was not as good as he could have been on that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope the Seahawks can get him running right this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If any team can it will be them"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, they are built to run and run all day long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, their defense takes a lot of time off the clock, and so does running the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, faster pace teams struggle against them."
