"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard folks say the Chicago Bears will be better than expected this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No chance they get to eight wins this year, much less make the playoffs or anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense is going to be a lot better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose that's true, their front seven isn't bad. That secondary, though...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's still bad. Better, but still bad. Vic Fangio at the helm, he may work some magic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even still, there's only so much they can do. Aaron Rodgers is still in that division, that's going to be two losses right there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They always play the Packers tough, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear that every year. That secondary is still going to get torched."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jordan Howard is still a bright spot. Quarterback isn't going to be that much worse either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will admit Jordan Howard could be amazing. He has to stay healthy, though. Speaking of which, is Kyle Long even going to be 100% this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No one knows. He never had that surgery. I still think the interior of the line is going to be fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could be. Tackles still a problem. Question marks at wideout, not much talent at tight end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What, you don't believe in Baby Gronk?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ridiculous. Even if Shaheen is Gronk, it's going to be a couple years before he gets there. There's not going to be any consistent scoring for this team this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where do you think they are going to end up? I don't see playoffs at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As much as I'd like to see three wins and a high draft pick, they are probably still going to win enough to fall out of the top 5 in draft order."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be typical, wouldn't it? Not bad enough to totally tank the season, not good enough for the playoffs, either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's Bears football for the past 30 years, man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't argue with that. Maybe Trubisky will be a star, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's going to have to be for Pace to keep his job."
