"__STAR_WARS__ Who shot first: Greedo or Han?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Obviously, Han shot first, no matter what George Lucas says."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. What else do you think George Lucas screwed up?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think there is too much added stuff in the Mos Eisley scenes in the redone movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. I like the more gritty effect of the originals."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, another thing I liked from the early versions was the painted backgrounds."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did they replace these with computer generated imagery?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know for sure, but they probably did."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Bespin Cloud City backgrounds were pretty cool, even if they looked like paintings."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely. I'd like to live in Bespin Cloud City."
