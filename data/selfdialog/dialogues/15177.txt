"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just watched the last two Harry Potter movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh my gosh! What did you think!?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I was really pleased with it. I'm glad they split it into two parts to cover more, since the book was so long."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it's nice now that we can watch them together, but it was awful when part one had come out and part two hadn't yet!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Did you see them in theaters?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I saw part one on opening night, but I saw part two in theaters a few weeks after it came out."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What was it like when Dobby died at the end of part one?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The whole theater was crying! He was such a loved character, and opening night was full of die hard fans."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Man, I wished I hadn't missed that!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was something!"
