"__ACTION__ Are you a fan of the Die Hard movies?"
"__ACTION__ I used to be but it's been so long since I've seen one of them. I saw the one where they foiled the Russians' plans."
"__ACTION__ Oh that's the one where Bruce Willis spent the entire time with a headache."
"__ACTION__ Yes it really made you feel his pain. He's just a great action star all around."
"__ACTION__ Have you seen him in Pulp Fiction?"
"__ACTION__ Of course I have. Loved him in that too."
"__ACTION__ Quentin Tarantino is an excellent action director. Have you seen Kill Bill?"
"__ACTION__ I most certainly have. My favorite scene in part 1 is when she went on a killing spree in that club where O-Ren Ishii was."
"__ACTION__ That was a killer scene, literally. No holds barred there."
"__ACTION__ I heard they made most of that scene black and white because there was too much gratuitous blood."
