"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Mastodon?"
"__MUSIC__ What is Mastodon?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a relatively new metal band."
"__MUSIC__ I never heard of them. I like Meshuggah and Slipknot."
"__MUSIC__ Mastodon is not quite as heavy as Meshuggah or Slipknot, but they are great musicians and write interesting songs."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds cool. I've just recently started getting into metal, so I'm on the lookout for more good stuff."
"__MUSIC__ You should definitely give Mastodon a try, they have been called 'the masters of metal' by reviewers."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty impressive. What do you think makes them so good?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they are all very accomplished musicians. The drums are at a virtuoso level and the vocals are melodic but not operatic like some of the more annoying metal bands."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I get a little bored with the same growling style that a lot of new death-metal bands are doing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's exactly my feeling as well. A little of it is interesting, but not constantly on every track."
"__MUSIC__ Does Mastodon do any death-metal growling?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually they don't do any of that at all. They aren't a death metal band."
"__MUSIC__ Who are they similar too?"
"__MUSIC__ I think, instrumentally, they kind of remind of Rush, but more intense and metal sounding. The vocals remind me of Ozzy Osbourn at times."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound like a description of the typical modern metal band."
"__MUSIC__ I would say that's an accurate assessment. The hardest aspect of their sound is probably the drums."
"__MUSIC__ How would you characterize their sound? What makes them unique?"
"__MUSIC__ They have a sound that is kind of primitive and primordeal, but the music is complex and sophistocated at the same time. It's hard to explain how that works without hearing it."
"__MUSIC__ They sound pretty interesting. I'll have to give them a listen."
