"__STAR_WARS__ how about that force awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ i thought it was okay."
"__STAR_WARS__ Didn't it seem like a copy of a new hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ yeah, i guess it was kind of a reboot"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was more of a straight up copy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Nah, I think they're just trying to catch the attention of a new generation of fans"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that's true."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not like it was a horrible movie either."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but I hope the next movie tells us much more."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm sure it will; the backstory of Rey."
