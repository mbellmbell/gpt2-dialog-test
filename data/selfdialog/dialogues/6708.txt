"__STAR_WARS__ The Force.... is it a religion woth a power or do people who blieve in it so much get power."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, is the power of The Force like mutants in X-Men, Telekenisis or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ Possibly. What made you think of that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, in Episode one, Anikin's metachlorins levels were off the chart. So is accessing the force a biologicial thing?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought of it that way."
"__STAR_WARS__ That being the case, only certain people can harnase the force, not everyone."
"__STAR_WARS__ So that would mean....."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would mean it's not a 'Religion' but more like a mutation, like in X-Men."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, a interesting theory."
