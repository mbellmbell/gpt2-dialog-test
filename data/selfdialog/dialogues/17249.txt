"__MOVIES__ So what kind of movies do you watch?"
"__MOVIES__ All sorts, I love film."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? So do I. What's your favorite genre?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably drama or thriller."
"__MOVIES__ I agree I feel like the acting is better in a drama or thriller for some reason."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I totally agree. What's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to go with, 'The Graduate.'"
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie! Dustin Hoffman is my favorite!"
"__MOVIES__ No way me too!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I love Midnight Cowboy and Kramer vs. Kramer."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah me too, I've never cried so much in a movie then in Kramer vs. Kramer."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I know. Meryl Streep is awesome in that too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she is. I heard they didn't get along on set."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That sucks, what happened?"
"__MOVIES__ I read he slapped her or something to make her angry on set because he needed her to be angry in a scene.."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! that's insane."
"__MOVIES__ I know, maybe a little overboard."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you can say that for sure."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I think it's just one of those things actors do to get under their skin, they antagonize them on set."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but sometimes you can tell it makes movies better!"
