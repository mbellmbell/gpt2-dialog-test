"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What NFL rookie are you most excited about seeing play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I am most excited to see what happens with Mitch Trubisky in Chicago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh so you are interested in if he will be a boom or bust?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, with everything Chicago gave up to get him, I am interested to see how he performs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he is going to start for the Bears this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it all depends on how he does at training camp and in the pre-season. I know they have Glennon, so they might not be planning on starting him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't the Bears also sign Sanchez, too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they picked him up earlier this year, but he was injured turning an offseason workout, so Trubisky might have to be ready to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There usually aren't that many quarterbacks in the NFL that find success their first year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott was extrememly lucky last year to be in such a great situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had the leading rusher to really take the pressure off his throwing the ball, but with what he did do, it seemed fairly accurate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that Dak's situation is unique in today's NFL because he was able to take some time as they leaned heavily into their run game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's very true, I just think that it's tough to be a first year quarterback in the NFL, no matter your talent level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and that's why Mitch will be fun to watch because he did not play very long in college before being drafted by the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be interesting to see if he is an upgrade from Cutler, since he left to join the broadcast booth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cutler was a talented quarterback at one time, but it's almost like he stopped liking to play when the team wasn't adding stars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least the Bears have a better running game than they have the last few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Howard will likely be able to help Mitch or Mike Glennon get comfortable in the offense before having to throw too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That will be great for them, but I hope they aren't counting on a Zeke Elliot situation, because Howard is not him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but he will be a great serviceable running back as they try to improve their record this year."
