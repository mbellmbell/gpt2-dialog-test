"__BEATLES__ I don't think I know that one."
"__BEATLES__ I think a lot of people don't.. which is too bad. It is such a nice message."
"__BEATLES__ They have so many songs it is hard to keep track of them all."
"__BEATLES__ Well I do see your point. Do you know when I'm 64?"
"__BEATLES__ I do know that. I enjoy it very much."
"__BEATLES__ Ya it is a cute one. Kind of on the short side though."
"__BEATLES__ I never noticed if it is. I will say the lana del rey song young and beautiful song lyrics make me think back to When I'm 64."
"__BEATLES__ Never made that connection before but that is very true."
"__BEATLES__ Yes same them, will you still love me when... I am old."
