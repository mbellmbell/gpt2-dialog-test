"__DISNEY__ Did you know Disney is making a live-action remake of Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Really? When will it be in theaters?"
"__DISNEY__ It's not being released until November 2, 2018."
"__DISNEY__ That's a while off. Has a cast list been released yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No not yet. The film is still in pre-production."
"__DISNEY__ I can't wait! Mulan, is one of my favorite movies."
"__DISNEY__ Same, I love the story and music. Though it's not clear yet if they'll be adapting the songs as well."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they include the songs. I'd love to see a live-action version of 'I'll Make A Man Out of You'."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. Disney also needs to keep Mushu, the dragon, in."
"__DISNEY__ He'd probably be computer-generated. It'd be cool if Eddie Murphy could voice Mushu again."
