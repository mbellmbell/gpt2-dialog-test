"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your team for the upcoming football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I'm 49ers all day, man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's a shame. Their offseason looked terrible!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not as bad as the Jets, however."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true. Their offseason was probably the worst in history, and that's in a world where the 49ers still exist!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least the 49ers have an established team, however. The Jets can't seem to ever get it together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true. What do you think of the division this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seahawks are our biggest threat, I think. Cardinals and Rams are worst than they were last year, I hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think David Johnson is a threat!? You're crazy!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is, but Palmer is so old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But still great. He just needs some better offensive weapons to throw to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And don't even get me started on the Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where are they now anyway? Los Angeles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, unfortunately. LA didn't even truly want a team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did hear that. But yeah, I think that the Seahawks are the biggest threat in that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm glad you agree. If we can get one up on them, we can make a move for the one-seed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a lofty goal, however. They picked up Lacy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean Feast Mode? He can't run anymore!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You won't be saying that when the 49ers play the 'Hawks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see soon enough. Preseason is very close!"
