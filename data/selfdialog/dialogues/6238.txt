"__STAR_WARS__ His top would spin all around."
"__STAR_WARS__ And he had a few blinking lights."
"__STAR_WARS__ And he had the thing that could connect to the DEATH STAR."
"__STAR_WARS__ He could tell the DEATH STAR computer what to do."
"__STAR_WARS__ He made funny sounds that sounded like what he was saying."
"__STAR_WARS__ He had like 3 legs. But I never saw him go up stairs."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe that's why they always had ramps."
