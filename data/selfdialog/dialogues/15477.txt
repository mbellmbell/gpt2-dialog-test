"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, which Harry Potter movie is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really like Deathly Hallows Part 1."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? I think that's the weakest movie in the entire series. Really drab and slow."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Huh, that's why I like it. They really make the audience feel like Harry is struggling with his decisions."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sure, but it's so drawn out. I mean, they could have just released a single movie instead of breaking the last book up into two movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, that's true, but I guess the studio thought they could get people to come out to see both movies. Which movie in the series is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess my favorite is probably The Prisoner of Azkaban."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why is that your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, the first two were more kids movies, but by the third one the kids are starting to grow up, and they all do a better job acting."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're right, and that's the movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron. He's one of my favorite directors."
