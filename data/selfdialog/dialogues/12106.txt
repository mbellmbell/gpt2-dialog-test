"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What kind of sports do you watch on TV?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, all kinds. My favorite to watch is football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's exciting. Do you catch all the games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If possible. The one I never miss, if I can help it, is Monday Night Football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Monday Night Football? I used to watch that a lot. Not so much any more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How come you stopped?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, no real reason. Just usually busy on Monday nights."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I am too sometimes. But I always try to catch it, if I can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I liked it when it was on ABC. It's not the same on ESPN, for some reason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. It's best early in the season, too. Those are the most exciting games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? What's the difference?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, when it's early in the season, the records are brand new, you know. And the teams are usually showing off their new player additions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. That makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, at that point, you just don't know which teams are the strongest, who's gonna bounce back from a difficult start...that kind of thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Miami is my favorite team. I think they were the number one appearing team on MNF."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were, definitely. The San Francisco 49ers come in second. I think they played something like 50 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. What are the most often-seen match-ups, do you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let me think ... Broncos vs. Raiders happened like 20 times. Same with Cowboys against Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes for some heavy rivalry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure does. Some exciting games, for sure."
