"__MUSIC__ Hey man, remember the nineties?"
"__MUSIC__ What about them?"
"__MUSIC__ The music, man. The music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, like grunge, and Ace of Base?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and the heavy stuff too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, heavy like Decide, Armageddon? Like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. Remember Tool?"
"__MUSIC__ Tool? What did they do?"
"__MUSIC__ They had those weird stop-motion videos."
"__MUSIC__ The really scary ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they soft of defy explanation."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that song Sober, that was pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was from their first album. They were really good back then."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, whatever happened to them?"
"__MUSIC__ They're still around, I think. They haven't released a tape in a while, though."
"__MUSIC__ A tape?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they've sort of lost their edge too. They lean really sort of prog rock."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, maybe they just got older and rich and sort of last the aggression."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Maybe it happens to all of us."
"__MUSIC__ I know I'm not as abrasive and aggressive as I was on my first album."
