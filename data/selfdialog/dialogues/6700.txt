"__STAR_WARS__ Who is the most evil person in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say it's between The Emperor or Darth Vader"
"__STAR_WARS__ Who is more evil between those two?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Emperor because he likes to corrupt people"
"__STAR_WARS__ And Vader isn't that bad?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, not at the end of his life. He does some good things"
"__STAR_WARS__ How does the Emperor corrupt people?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He offers them power and that makes some Jedi go bad"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's what happened to Anakin too, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he wanted the power he needed to revenge Padme's death!"
