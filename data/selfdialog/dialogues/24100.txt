"__SUPERHERO__ Are you a marvel fan or DC when it comes to superheroes?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Good question, I love DC but lately Marvel have been killing it lately with movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree both the supermen movie and the Batman vs super man movies were disappointing."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree and superman is one of my favorite characters."
"__SUPERHERO__ I felt the same way about Batman until the latest movies. Now I think Iron Man is my favorite superhero."
"__SUPERHERO__ I could see that, he’s a great character, especially together with Captain America."
"__SUPERHERO__ Now your talking, he’s another one of my favorite superheroes, the winter soldier was excellent."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree, the first one was just ok, but the winter soldier and civil war were great."
"__SUPERHERO__ Civil war was amazing, the fight between my two favorite characters was so good and so were the other superheroes."
"__SUPERHERO__ Spider-Man stood out to me in that movie, another iconic superhero."
