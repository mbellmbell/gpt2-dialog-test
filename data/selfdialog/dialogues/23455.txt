"__DISNEY__ Did you know they're making a third Cars movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I'm not even sure I remember seeing Cars 2."
"__DISNEY__ I saw Cars 2, it was okay I guess, but not nearly as good as the first movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the first movie was really original and funny."
"__DISNEY__ So I wonder why they're doing another one?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably because they spent so much money on adding a Cars Land to Disneyland."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I heard about that. Isn't it supposed to be really realistic?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the entire area is just like Radiator Springs from the movies."
"__DISNEY__ Well then I can see them wanting to put out another movie to keep people excited."
"__DISNEY__ It makes sense.  I wonder if the movie will be any good."
