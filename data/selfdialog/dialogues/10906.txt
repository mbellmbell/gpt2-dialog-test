"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We're getting closer to the start of the new NFL season with each passing day!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! GOOOO PACKERS! They finally got some help for Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, not as much help as you think. I have the Lions winning that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Stafford is good, but he's not that good. Rodgers is still the best QB and that's what wins in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least we agree it won't be the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, definitely not. They don't have a running game since Peterson left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Bears are atrocious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chicago should not have traded up for Trubisky. The upcoming draft is going to be so much better for QBs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'll be picking high in the draft again with how bad their team is. I actually think Trubisky could be good but not anytime soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mike Glennon will never be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hah! Who do you have coming out of the AFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady just keeps going and going, like the Energizer Bunny."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he works hard to stay at the top, but he's almost 40 years old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He takes care of himself, personal trainers, specialized diet and all that. He could play for a bunch more years even."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The two other teams I think could beat New England in the AFC are Kansas City and the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oakland gets Derek Carr back and could be a threat but I can't see Alex Smith outgunning Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pat Mahomes will be in there sooner rather than later, mark my words. Big arm throwing deep to Hill and Kelce."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's an intriguing visual but, as a rookie QB, those deep throws often end up directly at a defender. And he's a gunslinger, he'll try it and fail before he learns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One thing about the NFL is, there are always unexpected big jumps. We're making our best guesses but they'll probably turn out wildly wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. Jacksonville Jaguars, the next Super Bowl Champs."
