"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it on opening night."
"__MOVIES__ I'd like to see it sometime. What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't as good as the first one, but I still like it a lot."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ I just thought it was really fun and irreverent."
"__MOVIES__ The special effects were great, too."
"__MOVIES__ Amazing how they turned Chris Pratt from chubby sitcom goof to action star."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he got pretty buff for that, too."
"__MOVIES__ Totally, P90X, I think."
"__MOVIES__ He was a great casting choice, though. Fit the role so well."
"__MOVIES__ Marvel does excellent with casting."
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'll watch the first Guardians of the Galaxy with my son then take him to see Vol. 2."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good idea, I'm sure he would really enjoy both."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see the postcredits scene."
"__MOVIES__ Those are always a treat."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it will be interesting to see how they start trying Guardians into the larger MCU."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I won't spoil anything, but you will see some of that in Vol. 2."
