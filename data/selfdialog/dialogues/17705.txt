"__MOVIES__ Hey, I've been looking for a good movie to watch with my little girl, any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh you asked just the right person. I love family movies, especially Disney movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah my little girl is really in to them as well. I even enjoy watching them."
"__MOVIES__ I watch them all the time. The other day I watched Frozen for the millionth time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my little girl loves that movie. Her favorite character is Anna."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes I love her to. My favorite character is Olaf."
"__MOVIES__ We have watched that movie so much I am sure I can quote it by heart."
"__MOVIES__ Well have you ever watched the animated movie Sing? It's not a Disney movie but it's really good."
"__MOVIES__ No I have never seen that one before. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a great movie where this man who owns a theater gets a bunch of people to sing and put on a concert."
"__MOVIES__ Who are some of the stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ There are so many. Scarlett Johansson, Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, and Jennifer Hudson all play in it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is a lot of great actors."
"__MOVIES__ It is a really cute movie. Does your daughter like to sing and dance?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, she loves to sing and dance. When she hears music she always joins in."
"__MOVIES__ This movie would be perfect for her then. The singing is great and the songs are really cute."
"__MOVIES__ I will definitely have to check and see if I can find that one."
"__MOVIES__ It should be out on DVD by now."
"__MOVIES__ Great, now maybe I can have a break from Frozen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I completely know what you mean by that."
