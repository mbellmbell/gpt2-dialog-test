"__STAR_WARS__ Out of all of the Star Wars movies, who is your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think like a lot of the fans out there, mine was always Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is up there for me, as well. How surprised were you at this untimely demise in Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I actually wasn't too caught off guard by it, since Harrison Ford has stated he's always wanted Solo to be killed off."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've heard that, as well. In terms of his character, do you think it wasn't a very heroic death?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was okay with it the way it executed. He died while trying to save his son."
"__STAR_WARS__ I understand your point. It was also in a way, a sort of passing the torch off to the new character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely. And I wouldn't rule out recurring appearances of him."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think they'll bring Solo back in flashbacks/visions?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Quite possibly. He was an extremely popular character so any way to bring him back would be great. Especially for the final episode."
