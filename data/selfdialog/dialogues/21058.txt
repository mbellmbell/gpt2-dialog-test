"__THRILLER__ Do you like thrillers?  Scary movies?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I do.  I love a good scare!"
"__THRILLER__ Well, have I got a suggestion for you.  I saw a really good one called 'The Boy' starring one of the actresses on 'The Walking Dead', Lauren Cohan."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah? What's it about?"
"__THRILLER__ A young American woman goes to England to work as a nanny on an old, isolated mansion estate."
"__THRILLER__ What's so good about it?"
"__THRILLER__ The child she's supposed to take care of is actually a doll!  The boy was in a fire and the parents treat the doll like their lost son."
"__THRILLER__ Really?  That doesn't sound all that scary-just strange and sad."
"__THRILLER__ Well, the parents go on holiday and leave the nanny with their 'little boy'.  Some very creepy and frightening things start happening that made me about jump out of my skin and I don't scare easy!!"
"__THRILLER__ Thanks for the recommendation, it sounds good.  I'll look for it and watch it as soon as I can."
