"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I pwnd you!  That movie was awesome though."
"__MOVIES__ Basically I agree, it was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ They guy, Fassbender, he did a Shaolin straight right palm heel at one point when he was practicing his martial arts."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw that, he got in the deep stance and extended his palm heel all slow, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that movie was wild, how he evolved from a guy who didn't know what was up, to a guy who really was an Assassin."
