"__MUSIC__ If you were going to recommend one British rapper, who'd it be?"
"__MUSIC__ Tough question. Everyone is going big for Stormzy right now but the underground is where it's at."
"__MUSIC__ Too many of these rappers go big and lose their authenticity right?"
"__MUSIC__ Bang on. Have a listen to Mic Righteous, Dreamland is a great album."
"__MUSIC__ I hear good things about English Frank too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I heard he's retired now but you can still find his stuff online."
"__MUSIC__ So take me back to Mic Righteous and what makes him real."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he's the son of a drug addict immigrant Dad and a mother who abandoned the family."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that comes out in his lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Too right. His brother became a boxing champion too and there's a bit of envy in there as well."
"__MUSIC__ So is it aspirational? Angry?"
"__MUSIC__ A bit of both. He's got the self-awareness but also the anger of all the best rappers."
"__MUSIC__ And the beats?"
"__MUSIC__ Always great. A lot of it is produced by Preston Play."
"__MUSIC__ I need to give it a listen don't I. Recommend me some tracks."
"__MUSIC__ Any of his Fire in the Booth videos are a good starting point, and from there just follow the links."
"__MUSIC__ Anything I can read that'll tell me more of his story?"
"__MUSIC__ It's all in the lyrics. Check out his 3rd Degree video, the track Gone as well."
"__MUSIC__ I'll be rapping myself before you know, by this time next year it'll be me that'll blow!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah right, I don't believe that. Listen man, your bars are whack!"
