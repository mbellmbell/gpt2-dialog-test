"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Rey is a Skywalker?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean Luke's daughter?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, Leia's daughter with Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wouldn't that make her a Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, half Skywalker anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe she was conceived by the force, like Anakin was."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope they don't go down that road again."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not me, young Anakin was just too much for me."
"__STAR_WARS__ So I guess you don't want a prequel for Rey?"
