"__STAR_WARS__ The Empire Strikes Back will always be the most overrated Star Wars film."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's blasphemy.  It's still the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Everybody says that, but I just don't see it."
"__STAR_WARS__ It has it all.  Best action, best ending..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not saying it doesn't have redeeming qualities, I'm saying it's overrated."
"__STAR_WARS__ Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  To me, the original is overrated."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now you're being silly.  That's the movie that kicked everything off!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's also a bit weak outside of the special effects story-wise."
"__STAR_WARS__ We obviously have different tastes in our Star Wars picks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Would seem so.  We should have a mock lightsaber battle to settle this."
