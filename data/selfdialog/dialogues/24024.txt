"__SUPERHERO__ If you could be a superhero who would you like to be."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think I would like to be Superman. I could just fly everywhere I wanted to go and avoid traffic."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, that would be a great power to have but I would like the super hearing. I would ease drop on everyone."
"__SUPERHERO__ I am not sure you would want to hear all the things that I say about you when your are not around."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, your so funny. I would take my laser vision and burn a hole in your desk. You would be too afraid to say anything bad about me."
"__SUPERHERO__ That would be right, but if i had super vision I could see you coming. Who would you want to be."
"__SUPERHERO__ Wonder Woman, I would use her truth lasso on our boss and ask if we are ever going to get a raise or promotion."
"__SUPERHERO__ I am not sure it would work on him, he lies so much he thinks he is telling the truth."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, that's true, but I could also use my invisible plane to fly to work."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, make sure you don't run into a flying man with a 'S' across his chest."
