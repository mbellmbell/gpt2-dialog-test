"__BEATLES__ Who's your favorite Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, tough one. These days it's Paul."
"__BEATLES__ Really? I had you pegged as a Lennon gal."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I used to be growing up, but now I find Lennon too serious at times."
"__BEATLES__ Ah, I love Lennon. He's my favorite."
"__BEATLES__ He is great, don't get me wrong, but no one can touch Paul's melodies."
"__BEATLES__ I think I read an interview with Bob Dylan once where he said Paul is the best melody writer of all time."
"__BEATLES__ That's extremely high praise!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it is, coming from one of the best lyricists of all time."
"__BEATLES__ Yup! My full ranking is this Paul then George then John then Ringo."
