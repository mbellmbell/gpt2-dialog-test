"__BASKETBALL__ I'm going to the Lakers game tonight. Do you want to come with?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure. What time does it start?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Around 7. They're playing against the Cavaliers."
"__BASKETBALL__ That should be a good match up."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sounds like it. I miss the days of Kobe and Shaq, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Those were epic times in basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I don't think we'll see anything like it again."
"__BASKETBALL__ There's plenty of young talent out there."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, but I just don't get as thrilled as I used to."
"__BASKETBALL__ Then why do you still watch them play?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Because I'm a fan. It's my duty to support the team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not me. I dropped the Bulls like a bad habit after Jordan left."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's because you're not a fan of the team. You're a fan of a player."
"__BASKETBALL__ That player made the team what it was and no one's been able to do it since."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, maybe you're right."
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course I am. What time are you picking me up?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I want to get there early so be ready by 6."
"__BASKETBALL__ What seats did you snag?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Third row."
"__BASKETBALL__ Pretty good. Should be a fun evening."
