"__STAR_WARS__ Name me someone who became famous because of Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, I can do that. Ben Burtt."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't recognize the name. Was he in the supporting cast?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In a way. In fact, he won an Oscar for his work."
"__STAR_WARS__ Come on, don't keep me in suspense!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ben Burtt was the sound effects editor. He invented all the cool sounds that we all recognize from Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, like the buzz-swish of a light saber."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the beeps and boops of Artoo Detoo."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the heavy mechanized breathing of Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha! I can see now why you call him a supporting player. The movie would not be the same without his work."
