"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I can't wait, I really hope the Rams do good this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will start of with Jared Goff?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so, he really needs to prove that he is a franchise player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know he has not lived up to the expectations of a franchise player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I am worried about it, he has to show something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, hopefully he has improved over the summer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about you, are you high on your team, the Saints?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think we got Drew Brees a decent defense, I think we will get back into the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really do want to see Brees in the playoffs, he is a top 3 quarterback and really deserves more post season success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, he has been lighting up the league, imagine if he had a good defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I think they would have won a few more Superbowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'll be happy as long as the Patriots don't win again, I really don't like their arrogance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, hopefully they get taken out early and not make the Superbowl so we can see new teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I kind of want them to miss the post season, but more likely they win more than 12 games again this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that's a safe bet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any teams you think will be a surprise this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe Miami, they may come out of nowhere and do good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so, I think the Bears may surprise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well one thing is for certain, this season will be a roller coaster."
