"__MUSIC__ What is your opinion on metal?"
"__MUSIC__ It can be good. I think that it can sometimes become mostly screaming."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. There seems to be a difference between screaming and some bands that actually produce music that could be classified as metal."
"__MUSIC__ I prefer the musical metal."
"__MUSIC__ What's a band that you consider musical metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I would consider slipknot one of those bands."
"__MUSIC__ Slipknot? They are pretty hardcore."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but they are also melodic."
"__MUSIC__ I could see that. They have some catchy tunes even with all of the screaming."
"__MUSIC__ Wait and Bleed is definitely a catchy tune."
"__MUSIC__ Duality and Psychosocial are also catchy tunes."
"__MUSIC__ Duality, definitely."
"__MUSIC__ Would you ever consider seeing slipknot in person."
"__MUSIC__ Probably not. I value my ear drums. I can imagine it would be an intense concert."
"__MUSIC__ Not to mention, a very interesting one as well."
"__MUSIC__ The people there are interesting, I bet."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. It's a different breed of people at metal concerts."
"__MUSIC__ It would be good to go for the experience, I guess, but my poor ear drums."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Maybe in my younger days I would have gone."
"__MUSIC__ If that's the case, would you still be here to live to tell about it?"
