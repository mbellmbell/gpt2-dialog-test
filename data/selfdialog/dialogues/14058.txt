"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see game 6 of Boston vs Washington?"

"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, that  game winning shot by John Wall was intense."
"__BASKETBALL__ You bet, I jumped out seat when he made it."
"__BASKETBALL__ This has been the most exciting series so far during the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, most other series were sweeps or were not really close."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who you routing for to win the next game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know. I kind of like Washington."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, I think Washington is good too. They have some superstars."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, I think so too. Boston is well balanced, but none of their players are elite."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. Isaiah Thomas is good, but I don't think he can carry the whole team by himself."
"__BASKETBALL__ They did get the number seed though for the season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ehh, I don't think it matters much. In the end I think Cleveland will go to the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hey, you never know. Washington and Boston did pretty well against the cavs during the regular season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, but regular season doesn't matter much. Playoffs is playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ True. Lebron really stepped up his game during these playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. I can picture him getting MVP. He is really dominating."
"__BASKETBALL__ The addition of Kyle Korver during the season helped the cavs out a lot as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, they've been crushing their opponents. The games weren't even close."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea. I guess I can see them going to the finals too."
