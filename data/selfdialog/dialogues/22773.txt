"__DISNEY__ Did you know that Disney is making more live action movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I heard that.  Do you know which ones?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know all of them, but I read that they are remaking The Little Mermaid and Mulan, a couple of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ I am looking forward to seeing those."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I saw the remake of Cinderella a couple of years ago with Lily James.  She made such a perfect Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ I saw it too.  The computer generated special effects were stunning."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I thought so too.  The scenes with the pumpkin coach and mice footmen were spectacular."
"__DISNEY__ I really enjoyed watching Cinderella magically change into the ballgown. It looked so real."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that was beautiful.  I'm excited to see how the new ones turn out."
"__DISNEY__ So am I.  I expect they will be very well done like most Disney movies."
