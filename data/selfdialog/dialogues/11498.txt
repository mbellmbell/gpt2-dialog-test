"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys offensive line is incredible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they are pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty good?  They're like the Golden State Warriors of OL's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you spend high picks on them all, of course they are going to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they weren't all that high."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were all first rounders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but we're not talking all top ten picks here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Tyron Smith was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was, but Martin was in the teens I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's really high for a guard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Frederick was a first rounder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At the end of the first round I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and if you remember, everyone hated the pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was an odd pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just because they thought he was overdrafted by a round or two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a steep price for a center."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steep price?  He's a perennial Pro Bowler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I get that, just saying it was still a first round pick they had to burn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In any event, you can't deny that they are a talented group."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see how they do without Leary and Free this year."
