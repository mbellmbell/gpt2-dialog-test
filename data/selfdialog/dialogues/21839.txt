"__DISNEY__ Can Disney make one movie that isn't awesome?"
"__DISNEY__ I know! I feel like everything they make is good."
"__DISNEY__ I used to think they could not replicate their old films, but then Frozen came out."
"__DISNEY__ I know. The Little Mermaid was my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Those old movies were great! They defined my childhood!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too - now I am still watching the new ones because they are so good!"
"__DISNEY__ Agreed - our kinds have it really good with the new Disney films."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they would make a more mature film."
"__DISNEY__ They could, but no need with the success they have in the children's genre."
"__DISNEY__ I can't wait to see what they come up with next!"
