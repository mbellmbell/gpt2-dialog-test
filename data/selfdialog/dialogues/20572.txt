"__MOVIES__ Where is the theater?"
"__MOVIES__ Why are you seeing a show?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I am going to see the new ghost busters, I hear it is really funny."
"__MOVIES__ It is but can kind of get preachy about it's feministic values."
"__MOVIES__ I won't mind, are there any hot actors."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I don't know his name but he plays there secretary and god is he a hunk."
"__MOVIES__ Well all movies need some eye candy and some movies need to have really hot guys."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think they used makeup on him, he is just that good looking naturally."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is possible, I thought that movie had too much CGI at the end."
"__MOVIES__ I can kinda see that the whole end sequence was computer generated."
"__MOVIES__ Why do they do that when it really can ruin a move."
"__MOVIES__ I think it is for expense mostly but also some visual effects aren't possible without computers."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the fact that they tried to have all the original cast in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well some of it was a streach, but I really like Bill Murry so I was cool with that."
"__MOVIES__ What was a theme of that film?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it is about how anyone with enough motivation can, in a world with ghosts, become a ghostbuster"
"__MOVIES__ Well that is a silly theme, I was thinking more along the lines of female empowerment and individual freedoms."
"__MOVIES__ That could be it too but I think it is more about finding ghosts."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that is the plot but I was wondering what other themes there may be"
"__MOVIES__ Well perhaps one about how humanity would be better off with ghost and we all die."
