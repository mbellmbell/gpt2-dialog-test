"__BEATLES__ Which Beatle do you think had the best solo career."
"__BEATLES__ I'd need a minute to think about that. Do you have an answer ready?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I think that it's definitely John Lennon. Plastic Ono Band is one of my all-time favs."
"__BEATLES__ That's a great record. As far as number of quality releases, it's hard to argue with Paul having the best career."
"__BEATLES__ I don't know. Paul has so much mediocrity and overly commercial stuff."
"__BEATLES__ That's true, but the sheer number of great albums, with the Wings and with Linda, like Ram, surely put him first."
"__BEATLES__ Well, I do think John Lennon had the best solo career, but the question of best solo Beatle album is different."
"__BEATLES__ Indeed. My favorite is Ram by Paul McCartney."
"__BEATLES__ That is a very off kilter album for Paul, I can see why you'd like it. George Harrison's double album All Things Must Pass is my favorite."
"__BEATLES__ Oh man! I forgot about that one!"
