"__MOVIES__ I wonder how many sequels they will do."
"__MOVIES__ It seems trilogy is minimal. Look at star wars. How many movies do we have now? I lost count. Like 9 now?"
"__MOVIES__ The original, and prequels, and 1 for the sequel, oh and the rogues series. Yep. We'll probably get 3 of the rogue series. So 12 in the series, not counting animations. and things."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if Wick series can be as popular? It's not G, so the audience is much smaller."
"__MOVIES__ Still it's the highest ranked movie on Rotten tomatoes with over 85 mill in revenues."
"__MOVIES__ RT is not very accurate in terms of their ratings. Not my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ it's just a guide anyway. Anyhoo. So the Santino guy literally owns Wick at this point?"
"__MOVIES__ He holds the blood oath marker. Which means he can ask Wick to do anything, or even kill him."
"__MOVIES__ So he literally owns him. That sucks."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. But still Wick refuses saying he's retired. So Santino blows up his house."
"__MOVIES__ So, all he wants Wick to do is kill his sister?"
"__MOVIES__ Santino's sister. Not Wick's. Anyway. Yes. That's the deal. If Santino's sister dies, then Wick is free."
"__MOVIES__ I would so kill the sister."
"__MOVIES__ Well, then that's not really a good movie. There has to be some ambivalence about it to make it emotional."
"__MOVIES__ Well, screw emotions. Wick will be happy after he's free. There's an emotion for ya"
"__MOVIES__ That's not a good emotion that sells tickets for this movie. We need pain, suffering, moral dilemmas, etc"
"__MOVIES__ But he still accepts the job. you know."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but only after much deliberation."
"__MOVIES__ So he ACCEPTS the JOB."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, fine yes!. But only after much pain and dilemma. That's the most important part. And then, he doesn't even killer, she kills herself, and he puts a bullet in her head."
