"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, it's almost football preseason!  Are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I wish it would start a little later in the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely!  It's too hot for football.  I feel sorry for those guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, it would also be nice if baseball was over and we could concentrate on football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they should look into starting the season later and extending it into the following year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be awesome if football ran right into baseball and baseball ran right into football so there was no break between."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they would ever do that but it would be nice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chief's had a pretty quiet offseason, did you follow them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, like you said, it was quiet but it is basically the same team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, 3 general managers in 10 years though, something is going on in the front offices."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, I think Clark Hunt is involved too much in the dealings of the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he is not really a football guy so he should probably just let the experts make the decisions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, he doesn't have the clout that his dad did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, his dad basically created the league and invented the superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Clark hasn't done anything except inherit the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ John Dorsey was a great general manager though, they will definitely miss him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, he had the inside line to a lot of trade deals and had a good relationship with the players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially Jamaal Charles, do you think he will make a comeback this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if they resigned him but he is getting pretty old and there are 3 young running backs behind him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of running backs, I hear Adrian Peterson and tearing it up this offseason."
