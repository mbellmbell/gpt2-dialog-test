"__MOVIES__ What are some good movies on Netflix?"
"__MOVIES__ Depends on who you are watching it with!"
"__MOVIES__ With my kids, I have 5 daughters!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, then you should watch Moana with them!"
"__MOVIES__ That's on Netflix already?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it just got added in the past day or two"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I've heard so much about it, what do you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's one of my favorite Disney movies recently"
"__MOVIES__ Is it better than Frozen?"
"__MOVIES__ That's hard to say, I really liked both of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one has better music?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say Moana, it's really upbeat and happy"
"__MOVIES__ Are the songs going to get stuck in my kids heads?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably, but not as much as Frozen songs did!"
"__MOVIES__ That's good, my daughers were dressing like Elsa for months!"
"__MOVIES__ Well now they might be dressing like Moana!"
"__MOVIES__ That's okay, she seems okay on the movie poster!"
"__MOVIES__ I hope my daughters dont sing the music too much!"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you'll be singing too!"
"__MOVIES__ We'll get the soundtrack for the whole family!"
