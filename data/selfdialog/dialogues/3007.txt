"__MUSIC__ Hey I know you are a guitar nerd and know a lot of different players."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah this is true. Mostly I like rock and heavy metal but I like all kinds of music."
"__MUSIC__ So are you familiar with Roy Clark?"
"__MUSIC__ You Roy Clark from Hee Haw?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Exactly! Have you ever heard him play? He's really good."
"__MUSIC__ He is a very underrated guitar player. The man has some mad skills."
"__MUSIC__ He is appreciated in the country music world for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard him play Malegue√±a? It's not country that's for sure."
"__MUSIC__ No I don't think so. Is it on acoustic or electric?"
"__MUSIC__ On acoustic. He is amazing to watch and listen to as well."
"__MUSIC__ A far cry from playing on Hee Haw."
"__MUSIC__ Well he did rip it up on the show with other musicians and not just sit/com music."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see him playing on the Porter Wagoner Show?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow  Porter Wagoner now that man could wear some glitzy ,shiny, sequined clothes."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously! This one video clip I watched had him introducing Roy. I thought holy cow stop moving or you are going to blind someone."
"__MUSIC__ Ha Ha! Yes he was a radical in his own way."
"__MUSIC__ It would be kind of fun to go to an old diner with a jukebox and have lunch and listen to old tunes like it really sounded. Not digitized."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if there are any places like that in existance?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I am sure there are places with refurbished jukeboxes and maybe some of the old things were kept to decorate."
"__MUSIC__ Got to go. Talk to you  later."
