"__SUPERHERO__ Know what's an under-rated superhero movie? The Crow."
"__SUPERHERO__ With Brandon Lee, who died?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, that one."
"__SUPERHERO__ Sorry, it's not a superhero movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why not?"
"__SUPERHERO__ It's a haunting or horror movie. He's dead and brought back to life and is now invincible."
"__SUPERHERO__ So? He has powers."
"__SUPERHERO__ Not really. He just kicks butt after being revived. I don't think that counts."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think it does. It's listed as a superhero movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ I prefer action-horror thriller. It's definitely good, but superhero? No. It's revenge."
