"__MOVIES__ Hey, I'm taking my son to the movies this weekend for his birthday. I was wondering if you want to bring your kids along?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, what movie are you going to see?"
"__MOVIES__ He has been dying to see Boss Baby, so I was thinking of that one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is that the one where the baby is wearing a suit and can talk?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! My son has been dying to see it."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great my girls have been asking to see it too. It looks so cute."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, my son has been watching all the trailer's for it over and over."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know what times it is playing?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't checked yet."
"__MOVIES__ That's okay, I know Storks is also playing. If we can't see Boss Baby maybe we can see that."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great idea. I don't know about my son but I saw the previews for it and it looks nice."
"__MOVIES__ It looked nice to me too."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked how they are expanding on the idea of storks bringing a baby."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I thought that was sweet too."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the part with the boy hanging up lights on the house to help the baby come home."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That was so funny."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and that part in Boss Baby where the baby dresses like a puppy?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that's why my girls want to see it, they love puppies!"
"__MOVIES__ My son keeps making fun of the Arnold Schwarzenegger reference with the cookie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes I saw that. I got a kick out of it."
