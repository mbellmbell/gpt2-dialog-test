"__MOVIES__ Did you hear about that new movie that Mel Gibson directed?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you referring to Hacksaw Ridge?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it and really enjoyed it!"
"__MOVIES__ Was it as good as a lot of the reviews were claiming?"
"__MOVIES__ It certainly was...maybe even better!"
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the action was intense and the acting was terrific.  The plot was the best part, though!"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Wasn't it based on a true story."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was and, from what I heard, it was authentic."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's always appealing.  Wasn't Vince Vaughn in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and he did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ That's not his typical role is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not all.  He definitely delivered though."
"__MOVIES__ Was it a tearjerker or what?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't cry but a friend of mine did.  It is really emotional."
"__MOVIES__ You're making me want to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ You definitely should!  It's not playing at the theaters anymore, though."
"__MOVIES__ Is it available to rent on DVD yet?"
"__MOVIES__ It probably is but I'm not sure.  Let me know if you find it and I'll watch it with you!"
