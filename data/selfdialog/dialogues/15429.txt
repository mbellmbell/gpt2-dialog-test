"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yesterday I sat down and watched Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen it before or was this your first time?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was my first time, I know that I am a bit late to the party haha."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Took you long enough...  What did you think of it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really enjoyed it overall, I am interested in seeing how the characters develop going forward."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Are you planning on watching the next one soon?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I will definitely be watching Chamber of Secrets sometime this week."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's great to hear, they are some of my favorite movies and I'm really glad to hear that you like them.  Who is your favorite character so far?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that my favorite character thus far is Hagrid. I really liked how he has been helping Harry ever since the beginning when he shows up for his birthday.   I also think that he is a pretty good comic relief.  He can really ease the tension in some of the situations and his collection of creatures is quite interesting as well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Definitely a good choice for a favorite character for sure.  I think that you'll enjoy Chamber of Secrets!  You'll have to let me know what you think of it afterwards."
