"__MOVIES__ What kind of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't have a favorite genre necessarily. I just tend to like whatever's good and thought provoking, so maybe dramas."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that makes sense. That's probably my favorite genre as well."
"__MOVIES__ It's weird. I don't like horror films, and it's not really horror, but Silence of the Lambs is one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I can understand that. Anthony Hopkins was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, definitely. Great directing too."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. I heard the director, Jonathan Demme passed away recently."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, i saw that. Sad..he wasn't very old either."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ Agent Starling's boss in that movie..well his character was based on one of our neighbors when i was growing up."
"__MOVIES__ Is that right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was the head of criminal behavior at the FBI in Quantico."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting!"
"__MOVIES__ I also learned some trivia about that famous line of Lecter's 'i ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, what 's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there are certain psychiatric medicines called MAOI's which require one to abstain from certain foods and drinks, and two of those are chianti and fava beans."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, so what is the meaning of the line then?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, i think it's meant to indicate that Dr. Lecter was not taking his meds when he killed the victime he's speaking of."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right, cause he himself was a psychiatric patient, i had forgotten that!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, exactly!"
