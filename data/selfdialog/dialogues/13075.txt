"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's getting closer to football season are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more excited about this season than I have been for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why are you so excited about this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because my Cowboys look like they're ready to make a legitimate Superbowl run this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You sure last year wasn't a fluke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm positive it wasn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you so sure about that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because they have the most dominate line in the NFL for starters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that offensive line can't hide their lack of talent on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The defense was missing key players last year and still performed better than expected."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that's still not enough to convince me that they're Superbowl contenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboy offense was one of the best in the league last year with key players injured."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What key offensive players are you talking about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Collins wasn't playing last year because of a toe injury and this year is the first year Dez Bryant is going into camp injury free."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok I'll give you that, but will that be enough to help their defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are going to be a dominant defense this year just watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't see them having a dominant defense, they lost key players in the secondary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have replacements that were getting plenty of game time reps and they are better than the players that left, in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I hope you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, I can't wait for the season to start"
