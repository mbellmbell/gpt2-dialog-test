"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see that movie Ratatouille?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw that in the theatres, actually. It's been a while."
"__DISNEY__ Here's a question for you, then. Who was Ratatouille?"
"__DISNEY__ Trick question! Ratatouille referred to the prepared dish and bistro in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly. It was not the name of the rat, as a lot of people seem to think."
"__DISNEY__ Yep. The rat's name was Remy."
"__DISNEY__ Something funny about that movie is the fact that we're all supposed to overlook the fact that someone has a rat hanging out on top of their head. Gross!"
"__DISNEY__ That's right. I remember the rat would control the cooking while hiding under the chef's hat."
"__DISNEY__ Patton Oswalt did the voice of Remy, by the way."
"__DISNEY__ Cool. I wonder if there were any other famous actors in that movie."
