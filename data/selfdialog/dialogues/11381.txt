"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought you were! How have they been doing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a pretty good year last year, finishing second in the NFC South."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was that good enough to earn them a playoff birth?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but it was pretty good when you consider those nine wins were more than they had in the previous two seasons combined."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true. It is all a matter of perspective I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My hope is that they can take it a step further this upcoming year and get in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure did not seem to give Lovie Smith much of a chance to be successful there."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Jameis Winston is going to be a huge star!"
