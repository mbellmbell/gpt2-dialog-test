"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win the superbowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Packers have a good chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers is one of the best Qb's in the entire league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with that but they have some weaknesses"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I agree with that too, their defense isn't very good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately I completely agree, there are certainly better defensive teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, they are consistently hurt at the most important time"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah last year their offensive line main men went down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the problem with a lot of teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else do you think may win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots always have a good chance under Bellicheck"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think they may already be the favorites"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a strong defense and offense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but the most important thing that really sets them apart is their coaching"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Bellicheck has won like 5 superbowls in the last 10 years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Never without Brady though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but I can see Brady sticking around for a while"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We shall see"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Goodluck to my favorite team, the patriots!"
