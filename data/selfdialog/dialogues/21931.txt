"__DISNEY__ It is strange to me how disney can make some great films and then such awful ones."
"__DISNEY__ What awful ones?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you kidding me ? There is a long list of awful disney films."
"__DISNEY__ Such as  what? I want names."
"__DISNEY__ Well to name a few Mc farland,USA. , Teen beach movie, Bad hair day. The list can go on and on."
"__DISNEY__ Well I will say not all there movies are top quality."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly I just find it weird that they can vary so much in the quality of film they make."
"__DISNEY__ Isn't that true of any studio, they have some hits some misses?"
"__DISNEY__ Perhaps, I just find it baffling to go from oscar worthy films to teen beach movie 2."
"__DISNEY__ Well I suppose they are trying to make as much money as possible."
