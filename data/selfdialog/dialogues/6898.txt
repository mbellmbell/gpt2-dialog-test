"__STAR_WARS__ Let's talk about Star Wars. Some people are really invested in the series of movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've seen a few of them, although the did get kind of boring after a bit. Very white, male fantasy focused."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, giving time to women's voice in the series, might have been a nice change. I hear the newest one has a strong woman character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's been getting a lot of publicity. Although the demographic that fixates on Star Wars, is white, male, for sure, definitely that audience."
"__STAR_WARS__ So much of media is saturated in with that perspective. It's hard not love some of the characters like Chewbacca, even if it is somewhat flawed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, although you wonder if it's aesthetic in appeal, more than written content."
"__STAR_WARS__ Because Chewbacca looks like a big walking teddy bear?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right. And the voices of R2-D2 and the droids, were very soft and kind of lovable."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kind of going for the comic angle. Do you think the plot was too simplistic though, all that good and evil simplicity?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe. Like chopping off Luke's hand, could definitely be Freudian. Emasculating, right?"
