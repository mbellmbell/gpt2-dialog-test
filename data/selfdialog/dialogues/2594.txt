"__MUSIC__ Did you hear Chris Cornell died?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I've been living under a rock for the past week."
"__MUSIC__ Very funny. They're saying it was a suicide."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I heard that, that's really sad. I recently fell in love with his cover of Prince's 'Nothing Compares to You'."
"__MUSIC__ That's a Prince song? I thought Sinead O'Connor did that song?"
"__MUSIC__ She did, but it was originally written by Prince. The version Chris Cornell did was Prince's original version."
"__MUSIC__ I'd love to hear it. Is it great?"
"__MUSIC__ It's beautiful. And you know, I'd been playing the song every day in the car, and thinking there was something so sad about Chris's version. Now I wonder..."
"__MUSIC__ You wonder if maybe the song was a suicide note?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really, but something about his voice when he sings it.. when I hear it now, it hurts my heart."
"__MUSIC__ It could be he was pouring out his emotions in the song."
"__MUSIC__ Could be. It seems he did that a lot."
"__MUSIC__ You know he suffered from anxiety and depression all his life?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I read that after he died. It makes me feel even sadder, because I can understand what he was going through."
"__MUSIC__ That's right, you suffer from severe anxiety and depression too, don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I do. And I think maybe now, with his death, people are starting to realize the messages in all of his past lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Right, songs like, 'Fell on Black Days', 'Black Hole Sun', lots of songs about depression."
"__MUSIC__ Who knows, maybe a person who is depressed will seek out his music and find some comfort in it now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah like he's reaching out to them posthumously."
"__MUSIC__ Hopefully it helps."
