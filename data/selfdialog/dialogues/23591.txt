"__DISNEY__ Doesn't that guy over there kind of remind you of that guy from Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ General Li Shang? Yea, I can see it a little."
"__DISNEY__ I just picture him singing 'How could I make a man out of you!'"
"__DISNEY__ I love that song! And the whole montage where Mulan got her act together... Amazing!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I feel like she was the first Disney heroine I could really relate to."
"__DISNEY__ Except impersonating a soldier and having to present yourself in front of a matchmaker!"
"__DISNEY__ True, but that would have definitely been me if I was in her shoes. I'm such a clutz!"
"__DISNEY__ She was in trouble from the start though. The matchmaker was not a pleasant woman."
"__DISNEY__ Well like Grandma said, 'Who spit in her bean curd?'"
"__DISNEY__ My sentiments exactly!"
