"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really excited about the upcoming season for the Detroit Lions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the polls show that 64% of the people think that the Lions will win the North this season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, who came in second?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Packers came in second and then the Vikings were third."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That doesn't really mean that the Lions will win, though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but they have had a losing streak for so long that it COULD happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could and should aren't necessarily the same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lions nearly beat the Packers last year, so that's a good sign."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, 'Almost' and 'Nearly' are only good in horse shoes and hand grenades."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I don't know about that.  Practice and the will to win factor in, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if you look at their past, the Packers have at least had 3 championships in the last 60 years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but Drew Stanton seems to have a good head on his shoulders"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but one person can't hold up the whole team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, let's hope that the coaching and the team finally have a chance to gel. 60 years is a huge drought.  We need some rain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, even a sprinkle will help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the meantime, I'll continue to go to the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, at least the food and drink are good at Ford Field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, let's get some tickets for next fall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but you're buying!"
