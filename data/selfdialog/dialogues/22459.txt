"__DISNEY__ Did you like Finding Nemo?"
"__DISNEY__ Nope. It's one of my least favorite movies Disney has made actually."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I didn't really like it either."
"__DISNEY__ It seems like almost all the Disney movies are good except for that one."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you think we don't like it so much?"
"__DISNEY__ It's probably because there's too much kiddy stuff, I don't know."
"__DISNEY__ Well all disney movies are for kids! Haha."
"__DISNEY__ That's true, but the characters in this movie are annoyingly kiddish."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I suppose that's true, but the dentist scene was pretty funny."
"__DISNEY__ I'd have to agrree with you on that!"
