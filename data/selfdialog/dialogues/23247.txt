"__DISNEY__ When I was young my parents always took us to the drive-in movie theater when the Disney movies were playing."
"__DISNEY__ Mine did too. We used to play on the swing set that was there."
"__DISNEY__ We took a blanket and sat on the grass. There were six kids in my family so we could not hear if we were all in the car."
"__DISNEY__ What ones did you go see?  I remember seeing Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ I will never forget seeing Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs. I was so scared of the witch."
"__DISNEY__ I was kind of scared of the Dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ That is so funny. We also saw Dumbo."
"__DISNEY__ I saw Dumbo too. I saw Pinocchio."
"__DISNEY__ Well come to think of it I was scared of my noise growing when I lied to my parents."
"__DISNEY__ I felt the same way. I suppose that one had a good message for children."
