"__MOVIES__ What did you think of 47 Meters Down?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really good."
"__MOVIES__ So did I. Its definitely a change from what Mandy Moore usually does."
"__MOVIES__ I think movies that are set in the ocean are almost guaranteed to creepy without much effort."
"__MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ A lot of people are afraid of deep, open, water. You almost immediately start thinking about what could be below you."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I remember after I saw Jaws, every time I went into the ocean I was expecting to be eaten!"
"__MOVIES__ That's what directors and writers are counting on, that most people already have that fear."
"__MOVIES__ Can you imagine being stuck in a cage under water? It would be horrifying."
"__MOVIES__ I doubt I'd even get in the cage in the first place, no thank you."
"__MOVIES__ What about the other movie with people stranded?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Open Water?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one. I'm not sure which is worse being in a cage or having no protection."
"__MOVIES__ As much as I hate cages, I have to think you'd be safer there."
"__MOVIES__ True, but you're all the way on the bottom, no one can see you to rescue you."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, at least if you're floating, you have a chance of someone seeing out."
"__MOVIES__ I really expected those guys to take off after the girls got stuck in the cage."
"__MOVIES__ I totally did too!  They just met those girls, no reason to hang around."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, remind me never to go shark watching with you!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I wouldn't leave you....probably."
