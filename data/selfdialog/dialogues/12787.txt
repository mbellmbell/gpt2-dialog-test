"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I can't wait for this NFL season to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the draft this year was amazing and a lot of teams look really good on paper. Especially our Philadelphia Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ YES! Derek Barnett I think was a great pickup in this years draft. He is the next Reggie White."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more excited on the offensive side myself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are you most excited about that we picked up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously Alshon Jeffrey. This guy can flat out play, I just hope he doesn't get hurt like he usually does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their best pickup was LeGarrett Blount. How we picked him up without any issues is beyond me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he was definitely a great pickup. I believe he has the most touchdowns for all running backs last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well you can't deny the power and presence of this guy. Very intimidating indeed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah most definitely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just glad Carson Wentz has more weapons to his arsenal now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not only did we get two big name acquisitions, we also picked some great role players both in the draft and free agency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Wendell Smallwood will be a key player in the offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't think Sproles can handle a full load for the team. He is great but needs breaks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope our defense comes up big for us. I don't think we did enough to shore up our holes in that secondary"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Malcom Jenkins should have another great year. Sidney was a good draft pick, and the line up front should release some of the pressure of the secondary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope no one gets hurt. That's what hurt the team the most the last couple years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I dunno what it is, but we as a team in whole tend to have a lot of key injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well let's hope no injuries this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed!!"
