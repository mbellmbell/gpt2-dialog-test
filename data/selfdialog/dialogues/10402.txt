"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So what's your favourite style or artist when it comes to rap music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's tough. I gotta say Class A'z, which are an irish rap collective, and everything that makes Irish rap distinctive."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you mean? What could make them distinctive, rapping about shamrocks?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, I mean, you get used to some of the same rhymes and word combinations repeated over American rap lyrics but since the Irish have several distint accents, that opens up a lot more opportunity for making interesting rhymes with words you never would've thought of."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I never thought of that. Is that the only thing that sets them apart?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well I find for me personally, the lyrics are much easier to make out and the flow is smoother, almost more polished. But you'll find the themes of the songs are not that much different from what you'll find in American rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You mean women, inebriation and money?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, more like social justice, minority issues and deep life questions."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's cool. I'll definitely give those artists a listen, thanks."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No problem!"
