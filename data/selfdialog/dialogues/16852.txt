"__MOVIES__ Hey, wanna watch the Fall with me?"
"__MOVIES__ What is that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's really hard to describe. It's a weird movie that's kind of a drama."
"__MOVIES__ Weird how?"
"__MOVIES__ In that it can be sketchy to figure out the twists and which characters are present in flashbacks and such, but it's so well done."
"__MOVIES__ I might be willing to give it a go."
"__MOVIES__ It takes place in California, my home and favourite state, and the acting and photography and everything is amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm surprised it's not more well known. It's way underrated in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ Well you'll help me if I get confused, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Right! It has an awesome story surrounding this guy in the hospital, there are just a couple places that leave you wondering what's really happening."
"__MOVIES__ Well I find some of my favourite movies have been ones that are more open to interpretation."
"__MOVIES__ That's basically what this is."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a sad movie? I don't like really sad dramas."
"__MOVIES__ I'll be honest, there was one scene that made me a little teary, and I don't usually get that way in movies."
"__MOVIES__ Just one scene?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you see the 2 main characters building this rapport and then this scene happens between them and it's just... well, you have to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Who's the other character besides the guy in the hospital?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the little girl who goes to visit him. She kind of stumbles upon him and they form this accidental friendship and fun fact, where you hear them misunderstanding each other because of her accent, that wasn't scripted, she really couldn't understand because she was learning english in real life."
"__MOVIES__ Aw, that's so cute!"
