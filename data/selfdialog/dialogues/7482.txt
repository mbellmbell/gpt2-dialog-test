"__LADY_GAGA__ I can't stop listening to lady GAGA!!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Haha, her songs always get stuck in my head."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know, me too. I swear I've been walking around humming bad romance for like five years."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you listened to Eh, Eh?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I think so."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's older, from her first album."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I've seen the music video. Set in little italy right?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah that's the one. I freaking love that song so much. I can't believe it wasn't played more."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know it seems like the radio only picks 2-3 songs off every album to play and forgets the rest."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, it's a shame. It's such a good song!"
