"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see the classic Disney Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I used to watch it all the time as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. It was one of my favorites until recently."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I watched it again a few weeks ago, and it dawned on me how many negative messages about women are in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, I guess you're probably right. I never thought about it."
"__DISNEY__ Neither did I. But the whole point of the movie is that this girl is beautiful and graceful enough for a guy to save her from her life."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. Like her life wouldn't have been intrinsically valuable had she not been this great beauty."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly. And the only way she could escape her terrible situation was to make a wish for someone else to save her."
"__DISNEY__ We've really come a long way in a short time."
