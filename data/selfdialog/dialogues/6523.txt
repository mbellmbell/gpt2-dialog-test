"__STAR_WARS__ Do you ever wonder if R2D2 would be jealous of BB8?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why would he be?"
"__STAR_WARS__ BB8 has greater mobility and way more spunk."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah there's no way R2D2 could have navigated those sand hills in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think R2D2 can hover though, so maybe he could have just hovered over them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Nah, he would have gotten so much sand in his gears."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, plus his hovering abilities are pretty substandard."
"__STAR_WARS__ They came in  pretty handy when he was stuck in that swamp in Dagobah though."
"__STAR_WARS__ BB8 is still superior I think."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well he's the millennial's R2D2 so of course he's improved."
