"__MOVIES__ I just saw the new John Wick movie, 'John Wick: Chapter 2."
"__MOVIES__ 'I've been wanting to see that. How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, given the audience feedback and reviews, I was expecting something a little better. There was a lot of constant action, but the movie was kind of just okay."
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of dissappointing. Why do you say that it was just okay?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, as far as the action goes, I kind of felt like I was watching someone play Call of Duty and just constantly shooting people in the head. There were enough plot twists to keep me engaged in the story, but just barely."
"__MOVIES__ It's Keanu Reeves, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes."
"__MOVIES__ How is he in it?"
"__MOVIES__ He was his typical self. His acting is a little bit forced, as if he is saying something the way he thinks it should be said, rather than giving a sense that he really is the character being portrayed."
"__MOVIES__ In other words, he's just kind of a lousy actor."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't say lousy, but I would have to say that he gets cast because of his boxoffice appeal, and not because of his ability to do a great portrayal of the character."
"__MOVIES__ So would you give it a thumbs up or thumbs down?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say that if you know what you should expect from the movie and want to be entertained by a basic action movie, then it's a thumbs up. As far as it being a 'good' movie, I couldn't recommend it as such."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in it besides Keanu?"
"__MOVIES__ It's funny, but they decided to cast Lawrence Fishburn as one of the gang leaders in the movie. With him and Keanu in the same scenes it felt like I was watching another Matrix movie."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any hot girls?"
"__MOVIES__ One of the main antagonists is a woman. I would say she does a good job of giving the impression of being a dangerous killer, but she wasn't there to add a lot of sex appeal to the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I want to bother renting it. Maybe I'll wait until it comes on cable or something."
"__MOVIES__ I think if there aren't any other good recent movies that you haven't rented yet, it might be worth a couple bucks to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Alright -- maybe next time I go to the Redbox I'll take a look at what's there and decide then."
