"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Falco was weird. It was so 80s though. It's the quintessential Europop from the 80s"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not sure if I would call it that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That was literally the first song in German I've ever heard."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ i know that can't be right."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What? how do you know?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Because 99 Luftballons was back in 1983. Rock me Amadeus was in 85."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh.. Shoot. Right. I did hear that luftballons song before."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ As a matter of fact, i would go so far as to say, it was Nena's popularity singing in German helped Falco to achieve his fame"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like, Americans have liked a German song before, so why not another German song..."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But anyway, the way Mozart was portrayed was kinda weird. He was portrayed so odd, childish, and immature. And what's with the laughter?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Eccentric. i think the movie makers wanted to portray his eccentricity."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes! Eccentric."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well. Mozart in his time was an incredibly odd fella. And to go against the grain to write an Opera in German, at the time, was unheard of."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Movie makes an error. Mozart was not buried at a pauper's mass grave."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It is known that he was interred in a common grave."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. Not sure why the movie maker made that error or did it intentionally."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Probably did it intentionally to elicit more emotions from the audience."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But that's a fake emotion off a false idea. That's... violative."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's a big word for you. Yeah, it's somewhat misleading. But it makes you really hate Salieri."
