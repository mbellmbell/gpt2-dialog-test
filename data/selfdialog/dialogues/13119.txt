"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hi, do you play fantasy football by any chance?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I've been playing for many years and I have two teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do I!  Football season is like 20 weeks of Christmas for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. I live for the NFL and the NY Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will always be a Niners fan and the Jets are my favorite N.Y. team.  I will usually root for the Giants in their division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm starting to put together my top fantasy picks. Which running backs do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm trying to get Ezekial Elliott this year. That dude is going to go off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He great but I don't like drafting anyone from the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally understand that feeling.  I'm no fan of the Dolphins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least you don't have to worry about the conflict of drafting a Dolphin this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, that's true.  It's been years since I've paid any attention to their roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of Florida, there is some good talent on the Bucs this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had Jameis Winston as a back up last year.  When he was hot he could rack up some points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, and with another year in the NFL under his belt he should do even better this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Cam Newton but he doesn't have enough quality receivers.  the Panthers need some studs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's been a problem with him since his rookie year. We still haven't been able to see what he is really capable of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you like in the QB position?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still believe in Aaron Rodgers. He's one of those guys who still puts up points even when he doesn't put up a win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like watching Drew Brees but I'm afraid to draft him anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Truth. He is no spring chicken anymore, a big hit could take him out for the season."
