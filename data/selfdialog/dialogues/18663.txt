"__MOVIES__ So why does the secret organization of the killers.."
"__MOVIES__ The continentals. ."
"__MOVIES__ That's such a weird name for a secret contract killer brotherhood. Why are they call that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it has to do with the hotel they operate out of. The contental hotel."
"__MOVIES__ You know, that reminds me. Why is continental breakfast called that?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I don't know. I don't care."
"__MOVIES__ Because they make food from European continent. For real. Look it up."
"__MOVIES__ I don't need to look it up,. I already knew."
"__MOVIES__ You said you didn't know."
"__MOVIES__ I know I said that. I only said that because i don't want to discuss it."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, do they have continental breakfast in this continental hotel? Hah, see what I did there?"
"__MOVIES__ Sigh, I don't know. But anyway that's the name of the rogue group of this elite assassins."
"__MOVIES__ if John Wick kill a buhnch of them by himself, they're not so elite."
"__MOVIES__ Or John Wick is just that much of a bad ass that he IS."
"__MOVIES__ So Santino dies and then what? What happens to the contract Santino put on Wick's head?"
"__MOVIES__ You know.. I don't know. i think you might have something there. that actually might be an untied loose end in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we missed it?"
"__MOVIES__ No., I'm pretty sure I didn't miss it. Oh wait, I know what happened."
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ Santino doesn't get to cancel the contract because he's dead, but the head of the Continetals, the High Table, doubles the contract because the killing was done in the continental hotel. So Not a loose end at all. just developed into more severe form of problem for Wick."
