"__DISNEY__ Did you know Disney films have been around for almost 100 years now?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, has it really been that long?"
"__DISNEY__ It's been 95 years this year since Walt Disney made a short film called Alice's Wonderland in 1923."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if he had any idea what would happen in the future."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure there's no way he could have known. He may have been thinking maybe he would make a dozen or two pictures and be successful, but probably couldn't comprehend how far it would go."
"__DISNEY__ Now there's not only the movies and cartoons, but Disneyland and Disney World, two of the biggest vacation attractions in the country."
"__DISNEY__ Walt Disney made over 600 films himself, and then the franchise continued."
"__DISNEY__ Think how many people he has entertained over the years."
"__DISNEY__ I can't wait to see in a few years what kind of celebration they have for the 100 year anniversary."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe they'll create a special Disney movie just for that."
