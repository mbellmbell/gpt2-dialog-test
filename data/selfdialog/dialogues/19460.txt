"__MOVIES__ There sure seem to be a lot of action movies out these days."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's what's selling at the movie theaters.  There are so many younger people going."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  My teenagers like to go with their friends.  I think they like to just hang out."
"__MOVIES__ I don't imagine they would be into seeing a romantic comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Probably not.  They do like the action, but they also like the animated shows."
"__MOVIES__ Those are actually pretty good.  I never thought I would like them, but they do a good job with them."
"__MOVIES__ It's amazing what computers can do now.  Some of those look almost real."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  When you watch some of the Avenger shows or the Transformer shows.  It's pretty impressive what they can do."
"__MOVIES__ You have to remind yourself that it's fake."
"__MOVIES__ I will say that I do like the whole Avengers series.  Lots of action and usually pretty good plots."
"__MOVIES__ They've done a great job with those.  I remember those characters from comic books growing up."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  I remember them also from the Saturday morning cartoons."
"__MOVIES__ I also thought Star Wars was pretty great when I was younger, but these new ones are way better done."
"__MOVIES__ May the graphics are better, but I have to say that I like the older movies better.  I thought they had better story lines."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the characters on the ones now can be kind of unforgettable compared to those older ones."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty crazy how that whole series has stood the test of time.  We were into it as kids, and now our kids are into it."
"__MOVIES__ Jurassic Park is another one like that.  I loved the first one, but I will say that I enjoyed this last one just as much."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Chris Pratt did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what movies will look like in 10 years."
"__MOVIES__ I can't imagine.  I never thought they would be where they are right now.  Could be interesting."
