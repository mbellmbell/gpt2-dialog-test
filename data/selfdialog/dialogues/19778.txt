"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch the Saw movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the first 3. Have there been more than that?"
"__MOVIES__ There have been close to 7 to date."
"__MOVIES__ I really should get caught up. My favourite is still the first one though."
"__MOVIES__ It was so good! I mean, in a morbid way."
"__MOVIES__ I can't stand the character of Jigsaw. They give me the creeps."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think they chose that aesthetic for Jigsaw?"
"__MOVIES__ I've wondered about that. I wonder if Jigsaw is male or female, I don't remember if it was disclosed or not."
"__MOVIES__ We should really see the rest of the movies together."
"__MOVIES__ And have a marathon!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, we should go through them in chronological order."
"__MOVIES__ That will be enough gore to last me a few months."
"__MOVIES__ There are some interesting fan theories I've seen online about the Saw movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well that piques my curiosity. I'm more interested in the fan art I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ There's a lot of inspiration considering how many movies are available."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it looks like the newest movie, Jigsaw is coming out later this year."
"__MOVIES__ Want to see it in the theatre?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Let's get caught up in time, shall we?"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good. I'll bring the movie snacks."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing like watching someone cut their foot off in a dingy room to kickstart your appetite."
