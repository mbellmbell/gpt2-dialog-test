"__STAR_WARS__ Which Star Wars movie has your favorite opening crawl text?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like the first line from The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, me too - it was very exciting and set the stage for trying to find Luke Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder how many drafts of Star Wars crawls they go through."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you a fan of Boba Fett?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Absolutely - I wonder sometimes if he survived the Sarlaac Pit and they will bring him back."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be a stretch, but perhaps Boba Fett could make some sort of cameo."
"__STAR_WARS__ I always liked his ship too in The Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ The X-wing fighter remains my favorite ship."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the Death Star trench run from the 1977 Star Wars was pretty epic."
