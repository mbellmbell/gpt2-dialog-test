"__MUSIC__ Hi! Are you guys getting ready for your winter concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the marching band has been working really hard this year."
"__MUSIC__ Did you get to go anywhere interesting to play during marching band season?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe it, but we got to go to New York and march in the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade."
"__MUSIC__ I saw you leading it off.  You earned your name 'The Pride of West Virginia' because we sure were proud of you guys."
"__MUSIC__ It was a long march, but we had a great time.  We played our usual standards."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite that you play is 'Simple Gifts'"
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of fun to make the circles and come in and out with that one."
"__MUSIC__ How many years have they been playing that with the band?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  I should ask one of the 'old timers'."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't you getting to be one."
"__MUSIC__ I've only been with the band for 5 years.  'Granny' has been marching for about 20."
"__MUSIC__ I bet she has some good stories."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure she does.  She also knows a lot of music and stays in shape since she marches every fall."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think the fans like best of the music you guys play?"
"__MUSIC__ They like the current, contemporary tunes.  But we don't play many of those."
"__MUSIC__ I thought there was ONE particular song that really got the crowd going?"
"__MUSIC__ You wouldn't be talking about 'Almost Heaven, West Virginia'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup!  I love the way you guys make the shape of the state."
"__MUSIC__ Have you been able to locate me where I told you I stand in the state outline yet?"
