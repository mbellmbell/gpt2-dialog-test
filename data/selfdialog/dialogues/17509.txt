"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Wedding Planner?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean that Jennifer Lopez movie from 2001? Yes. Why?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm in the mood for a romantic comedy, something simple and sweet. Would you recommend The Wedding Planner?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, not really, unless you're a really big Jennifer Lopez fan."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a huge fan of Lopez, but I do like Matthew McConaughey. He's the male lead in the movie, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he plays the love interest to Jennifer Lopez. But, like I said, if you're not a Lopez fan, you might find the movie a bit grating."
"__MOVIES__ She is a fairly annoying actress, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I certainly think so. Judy Greer does have a small part in the movie though, so that's good - I love Judy Greer."
"__MOVIES__ Oh me too! Maybe I will check it out after all."
"__MOVIES__ Just be prepared, this is a seriously mindless romantic comedy. To call it formulaic would be an understatement."
"__MOVIES__ I hear you. That might be just what I'm in the mood for, though. Sometimes I just want a movie that will let me turn my brain off."
"__MOVIES__ The Wedding Planner definitely requires minimal brain power."
"__MOVIES__ Haha - okay, you've made yourself clear. As long as there's at least a few scenes of McConaughey being cute, I think I'll be satisfied."
"__MOVIES__ There is lots of McConaughey cuteness. Oh, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras is in it too - she's great as the other woman."
"__MOVIES__ So what you're saying is this is basically an adorable romantic comedy, with Jennifer Lopez as the only drawback?"
"__MOVIES__ Jennifer Lopez and lazy writing, yes. If you're okay with those two drawbacks, you'll probably enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome. And do you think it's safe to watch with my teenagers around?"
"__MOVIES__ It's rated PG-13, so you should be fine."
"__MOVIES__ Excellent. I'm excited! Simple-minded romantic comedy goodness, here I come!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, enjoy. I had no idea you were so easy to please when it came to movies!"
