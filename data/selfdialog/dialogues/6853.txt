"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars bounty hunter?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to go with Boba Fett. He had the best outfit and the coolest gear."
"__STAR_WARS__ Bossk was definitely the ugliest."
"__STAR_WARS__ That dude is like half komodo dragon or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think his bite is just as deadly?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say so. With a mug that ugly you know his dental health is pretty bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wasn't one of the bounty hunters in Empire a droid?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, IG-88, a sentient droid without a master."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think R2D2 is also a free spirit. He's always kind of just doing his own thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, he definitely has a lot of spunk to him. He's by far my favorite droid."
