"__MUSIC__ What's some of the strangest music you've heard?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of alternative stuff is really strange."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really? Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, alternative covers a lot of different kinds of music."
"__MUSIC__ I've noticed."
"__MUSIC__ Failure does a lot of good alternative stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Failure, that's an odd name."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I'm not sure why they're called that."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of like regular alternative stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That's not very specific."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I mean they have rock guitar stuff and ambient sounds."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see what you meant."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah like regular alternative music, like pink floyd?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess they could be counted as alternative."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, why not?"
"__MUSIC__ There's just not a lot of stuff that sounds the same in the alternative genre, you know?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's true. Then again, it depends on who you listen to."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, I'm sure everyone has their own list of alternative music bands."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Failure is definitely one of the better ones for me anyways."
