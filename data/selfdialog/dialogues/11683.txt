"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have any good stories?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a football story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, this is a sad football story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it is about the year I moved from Buffalo, NY to east Texas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let me guess...Bills fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ YOu got it. I moved to Texas the first year the Cowboys played the Bills for the first time in the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must have been really something!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're telling me!  I moved from the shadow of Rich Stadium, in Orchard Park, NY, where a Buffalo Bills sweatshirt is considered a thing of beauty, to east Texas, where a Bills sweatshirt was considered a practice target for gun holders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My fun started when the Bills made it to the playoffs, and played Houston in the first round. If you weren't a Cowboys fan, then you were an OIlers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right! That was the year of The Comeback!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right! The Bills overcame a 32-point deficit to defeat the Oilers in overtime!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a good game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I never saw it because the game was blacked out where I was living!  So, after that game, I was a Bills fan in the Lonestar state...with a target on my back!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then, somehow the BIlls made it to the Superbowl, only to face the other Texas team, the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.  And when the Cowboys crushed the Bills, every Texan in a 100-mile radius of where I was living felt that it was their personnal obligation to rub it in my face!"
