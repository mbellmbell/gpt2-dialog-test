"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the basketball game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, and I couldn't believe how bad the calls were."
"__BASKETBALL__ It seemed like the refs were oblivious when a player deliberately elbowed someone."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think those refs would have noticed if one team had 7 players on the court and the other team had 3 players."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're probably right."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hate poorly refereed games. It takes the emphasis off of two teams trying to prove who is better, it's just which team gets luckier with the ref's calls."
"__BASKETBALL__ Have you ever seen murderball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What the heck is muderball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Disabled athletes who are confined to wheelchairs play against each other. Some have other disabilities, too. The games are absolutely amazing."
"__BASKETBALL__ How can they play basketball with wheelchairs out on the court?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They're special wheelchiars, designed to go faster and turn sharper. Those athletes aren't just playing basketball like regular teams, they're pushing their wheelchairs as fast as they can go the whole time."
"__BASKETBALL__ You must get some serious upper body workout from that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly. I love watching those games because the dedication and athleticism of the players is so awesome. It really is inspiring."
"__BASKETBALL__ Last night's game had fouls, Do murderball games have fouls?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They have brutal fouls. If somebody gets thrown an elbow when the ref isn't looking, it can even knock the player's chair over on the court and knock the player to the floor."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sounds like murderball is more punishing on athletes than ordinary basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's gaining in popularity and has become an Olympic sport because the games are so exciting. They're addictive."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do they have women's teams too?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course! Just like there are women basketball teams, there are women murderball teams. They don't get any breaks because they're women, they train and play just as hard as the women."
"__BASKETBALL__ You've got me really interested in finding out more about this. I want to see a game!"
