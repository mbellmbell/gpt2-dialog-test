"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to instrumental music?"
"__MUSIC__ All the time!"
"__MUSIC__ In what context."

"__MUSIC__ I always have music when I read."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you listen to when you do homework or read?"
"__MUSIC__ Either classical or electronic."
"__MUSIC__ Electronic is usually too exciting for me to do homework too."
"__MUSIC__ Actually I listen to really chill songs. They're repetitive and mellow."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really. Does that exist?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it's a whole genre. It's called Chill, Chill out, or Chillstep."
"__MUSIC__ Wow I didn't realize, I should check it out."
"__MUSIC__ I also listen to instrumental music like classical piano, or also orchestral arrangements."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds pretty good. Any particular groups you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ The Piano guys, various symphonies. Try Pandora."
"__MUSIC__ What's Pandora for?"
"__MUSIC__ Basically it's an internet radio that tries to fine tune to what you like."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's pretty good I'll check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Let me know how it goes."
