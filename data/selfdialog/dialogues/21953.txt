"__DISNEY__ Did you hear Disney is making a live action film about Cruella De Vil?"
"__DISNEY__ Cruella De Vil? She's the one from 101 Dalmations, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. She's the one who wanted to make a fur coat out the puppies!"
"__DISNEY__ Yikes, now I remember! I hated her!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too! I still think a movie about her backstory will be interesting though."
"__DISNEY__ Have they already finished casting?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so. I read that Emma Stone will be playing Cruella in the film."
"__DISNEY__ Emma Stone? That's a surprising choice."
"__DISNEY__ I think so too, but she's a great actress."
"__DISNEY__ You're right, I bet she'll do great."
