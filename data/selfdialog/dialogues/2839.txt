"__MUSIC__ I have been listening to some retro music."
"__MUSIC__ Really? What have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I just rediscovered REM."
"__MUSIC__ Man, I haven't listened to them in ages. Which album or albums, are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Murmur is one of my all time faves. Radio Free Paradise, I love Losing My Religion."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, me too. Those are good ones. Brings me back."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so much good music. Remember Superman?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think everyone I knew was listening to that one. Seems like you heard everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know. I guess it's all nostalgic for me."
"__MUSIC__ Good times no doubt. The music of that time period is so different from what I'm hearing now a days."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was distinctive for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, before people started using all this equipment to help enhance their voices and crap."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I miss the old school aspects. The sound is different. Those guys have had a great career."
"__MUSIC__ No doubt, hard to believe they started out in Athens."
"__MUSIC__ I know right? I remember the rumors of them being sighted at the Globe!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too, it was like a fever on campus. Mostly bogus."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah by then they were too big. Though I could see them just doing for history of the venue."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, things have gotten so cleaned up and lost all it's gritty charm."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure you can still find bands and bars like we did."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it won't be REM."
