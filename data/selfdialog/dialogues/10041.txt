"__RAP_HIPHOP__ My favorite Tupac song always been 'Keep Your Head Up' because he was speaking highly about women in urban America"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True, I liked that song also. Being that my favorite rapper is Biggie, my favorite song is 'Sky is the Limit.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Kendrick Lamar is what's hot right now. Have you heard that song 'Humble' ?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I heard it. But I like his album 'To Pimp a Butterfly' better."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think K Dot is bringing back real hip hop back to life. His bars are phenomenal!!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I feel that. So what do you think about female rappers?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I personally like Nicki Minaj. I get hyped when I hear her song 'Did It On Them.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That track was cool, but 'Shether' by Remy Ma blew that out the water."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Aren't Remy and Nicki beefin' right now? I mean they both are cool to me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, man. That whole battle with the back and forth between these two ladies is getting real ugly."
