"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen The Faculty?"
"__MOVIES__ With Josh Hartnett right? And I think Usher made an appearance in it too."
"__MOVIES__ Right he was one of the football players. It was a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's been a while since I've seen it. Reminded me of Invasion of the Body Snatchers."
"__MOVIES__ That's the movie they sort of based it on. Lots of movies have used that same theme."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen The Stepford Wives?"
"__MOVIES__ The original one or the newer one?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen either?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I've only seen the newer one with Nicole Kidman."
"__MOVIES__ Right I have to say I like that one a little better than the original."
"__MOVIES__ Usually the original is better but then you have those exceptions."
"__MOVIES__ Right like normally sequels aren't as good as the original but an exception is Terminator II"
"__MOVIES__ Terminator II definitely outdid part 1 but that was because it came much later and special effects had improved."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I saw it at the movies with my dad when it first came out."
"__MOVIES__ That's awesome. Are you a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course I am! Isn't everybody? I even liked Kindergarten Cop."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was a cute one along with Twins with ihim and Danny Devito"
"__MOVIES__ Whatever happened to Danny Devito? I haven't seen him in anything in a while."
"__MOVIES__ I guess he's retired. He and his wife Rhea Perlman are somewhere relaxing that's for sure."
"__MOVIES__ They make such a cute couple too. They remind me of how cute Ruby Dee and Ozzie Harris were as a couple."
