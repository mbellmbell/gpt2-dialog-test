"__FASHION__ How do you even start picking out a wedding dress?"
"__FASHION__ It really depends on your style, there are so many these days!"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure what my style is, I suppose I want something that won't look super dated in the future."
"__FASHION__ Yeah that's really hard. I wonder if people in the 80's thought those poofy shoulders would look so dated like they do now?"
"__FASHION__ I have no idea! They are are hideous though."
"__FASHION__ A-line is a very classic style that I imagine won't go out of fashion any time in the future."
"__FASHION__ You are probably right."
"__FASHION__ I would really avoid mermaid dresses for sure."
"__FASHION__ Yeah I don't like that style anyway. I had a friend that got one and she even said explicitly to me that she didn't want her dress to look dated either!"
"__FASHION__ Yeah I can't imagine that would still be in fashion even ten years from now. The silhouette is just a bit strange looking."
"__FASHION__ I saw in stores that the fashionable thing now is showing a LOT of skin with see-through dresses."
"__FASHION__ Maybe in Italy! I can't imagine anyone wearing such a thing in the U.S. any time soon. We're too stuffy for such things."
"__FASHION__ I think you are right that an A-line would definitely be the best way at sticking with a classic style that won't look dated."
"__FASHION__ Luckily lace is coming back into fashion. Even though it goes in an out I think lace is a good idea if you like it."
"__FASHION__ I love lace! I think that would look great. Maybe even with a bit of sparkle."
"__FASHION__ Sparkles is always great! Just don't go too overboard. That gets scratchy feeling and you don't want to be uncomfortable!"
"__FASHION__ That's a good point. What do you think of those high-low dresses? I've been seeing them more and more, even with wedding dresses."
"__FASHION__ I think they are really cute - but for a wedding dress? Maybe if you were having a beach wedding in Hawaii or something like that."
"__FASHION__ Yeah it would make a good destination wedding dress. I'll stick with the A-line like you mentioned. It's simple and classic."
"__FASHION__ Great decision. Lets go find the perfect one!"
