"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you think about Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love the jazz music she does with Tony Bennett."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't like those songs. I like her Pop Songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I admit her Pop Songs are better than the stuff on the radio now but not as good as her covers of the classic American song book."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think that Poker Face is one of the best pop songs since Madonna."
"__LADY_GAGA__ See, I thought she was a wannabe Madonna before I heard her jazz songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you think of Joanne."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Eh. Not bad but not great."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, we agree on something."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I would rather hear her pop music though."
