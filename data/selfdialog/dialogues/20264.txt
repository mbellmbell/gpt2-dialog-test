"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the movie Mean Girls?"
"__MOVIES__ No, doesn't that have Lindsay Lohan in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it does, it also has Rachel McAdams in it and the girl who was in Dear John."
"__MOVIES__ Oh was it Amanda Seyfried? She's gorgeous. Isn't that a chick-flick though?"
"__MOVIES__ It is, but it's pretty popular. It's one of the top most quotable movies of all time."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well basically it's about mean girls in high school based on popularity."
"__MOVIES__ That reminds me of my high school days, not fun."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's kind of like real life. The main character, Lindsay, Cady in the movie, befriends a girl and gay guy and they plan to kind of destroy the girls' popularity by showing everyone who they really are."
"__MOVIES__ That's a little vicious, but I guess since the mean girls are doing the bullying first."
"__MOVIES__ That's how it is, but in the midst of it all Cady ends up being one of the popular girls and turning on her new friends. Oh and Cady had just moved there from Africa and is considered pretty hot."
"__MOVIES__ No wonder she became popular, it probably got to her head too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it really did. Then she makes out with the main girl's ex-boyfriend!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! but the girl was cheating on him anyway."
"__MOVIES__ So it sounds like there's some drama involved."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, for sure. It should be right up your alley!"
"__MOVIES__ Very funny! How many times have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Too many...or maybe not enough."
"__MOVIES__ Let's watch it together then!"
