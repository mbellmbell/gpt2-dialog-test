"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What's up?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nothing much. You?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Same. Hey, you went to the movies this weekend right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, with the family."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What'd you guys watch?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The new Pirates of the Caribbean movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ohhh interesting. How was it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Honestly, not that good."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No? Why?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was just wayyyy too long."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I hate movies that are like that. Anything else?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I felt like they really wasted Jack Sparrow in this one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He wasn't the main guy! He was essentially the drunken sidekick the whole time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Was he at least funny though?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, in his usual way, but it just felt kind of cheap."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Huh. Does Orlando Bloom come back?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He actually does. The story revolves around his son though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I guess that could be fun. Should I watch it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Probably not in the theater. Save yourself some money."
