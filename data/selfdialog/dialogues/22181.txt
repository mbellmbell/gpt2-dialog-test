"__DISNEY__ Did you watch the movie Beauty and the Beast when you were a kid?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!  I went to the theater to see it."
"__DISNEY__ So did I!  My mom saved up and was able to take me and my sister."
"__DISNEY__ I went with my brother and he hated it."
"__DISNEY__ Oh?  I can't believe someone hated Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Granted, he was on the verge of being a teenager.  He didn't have time for a love story, I guess."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that's really funny!"
"__DISNEY__ The best part is now he's an adult and has to watch it with his kids."
"__DISNEY__ Does he still hate it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, he told me the first time he watched it with his son, he cried."
