"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite Star Wars movie out of all of them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to say that 'The Empire Strikes Back' holds a special place in my heart."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, why do you like that one so much?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I just really love the snow in the beginning, and I always love winter moments in movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that's kind of a silly reason."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, but it just makes me feel like I am there, or that I am really immersed in that world."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, I can understand that justification."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also like when Luke is in the swamps with Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now that is a classic scene!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's cool to see Yoda in his element, and to see Luke starting out as a Jedi."
