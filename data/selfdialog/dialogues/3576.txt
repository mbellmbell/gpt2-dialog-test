"__MUSIC__ Are you a Philip Glass fan?"
"__MUSIC__ No way, man that guy is crazy"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, his music is so repetitive and boring"
"__MUSIC__ I know a lot of people feel that way, but you may not have heard enough of his work to make a fair judgment. He's written a ton of stuff and it doesn't all sound like that"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, if you say so"
"__MUSIC__ You should check out some more of his stuff before coming to a conclusion. The guy is a genius"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I will. Any recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, listen to a string quarted perform the closing from Mishima. Or listen to Paul Barnes play 'Orphee and the Princess' on piano"
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I might check them out."
"__MUSIC__ Also the piano Etudies, no. 8 and 16 are a couple of my favorites and are not too repetitive."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I will look for them on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ Great. Let me know what you think."
"__MUSIC__ I will. Generally i've preferred older classical music, you know the typical Mozart and Chopin and stuff, but i'm open to new things."
"__MUSIC__ I get that. I just happen to think Glass is the Mozart of our time, and believe it or not, im not the only one"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe he is!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely one of the greatest composers of our time, no doubt about that"
"__MUSIC__ I will take your word for it"
"__MUSIC__ You should. Cause i know more about music than you do."
"__MUSIC__ Haha! True that."
