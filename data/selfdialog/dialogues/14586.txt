"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey what are you doing Thursday after class?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Probably studying, why?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There's a free movie playing!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Really!?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah! A movie in the park."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sounds great. Wha't playing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Never heard of it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's airly new... and a kid's movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, really? Wouldn't that be weird for two adults to go to a kid's event?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well the advertisement doesn't say anything about that!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok, then! I do still love kid's movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too! I still watch the Rudolph classics on TV every Christmas."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too! And I always have to watch Home Alone."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Classic. Did you ever watch the sequel?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, just the first one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There's more than one?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, they built on the Home Alone empire! All the other one's are pretty bad though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I bet."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't even think they went to the theaters. Straight for TV movies are always a flop!"
