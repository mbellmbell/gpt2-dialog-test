"__FASHION__ What did Kim Kardashinan wear yesterday?"
"__FASHION__ How am I supposed to know, I don't know fashion."
"__FASHION__ Yes you do, I know you secretly watch that show."
"__FASHION__ Okay, okay, it's true, she wore that little black catour dress that has the really low cut."
"__FASHION__ I be she looked like a slut. I mean she is a slut right? Her style really says so."
"__FASHION__ Ha, yea, she is a bit like that. I bet she doesn't put out though, I mean have you heard that she wears designer nose rings."
"__FASHION__ Really is that for some kind of S&M sort of fantasy?"
"__FASHION__ I bet it is. I mean it is made to order, supposedly, but the point is when people dress like that they ask for a certain audience."
"__FASHION__ And I guess we are both in that audience because I mean we both like to see skin."
"__FASHION__ Well who doesn't like skin. She is hot and why not use clothing to express that."
"__FASHION__ A valid point. Clothing is as much of an expression of who you are as your facebook page."
"__FASHION__ I don't know if that is true in my case. Maybe if all my posts are old and not hip."
"__FASHION__ Are you wearing tights?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, I like to wear them under my pants."
"__FASHION__ That must get uncomfortable. How do you do it?"
"__FASHION__ Well you know what they say suffer for fashion. And it is my own style, why not?"
"__FASHION__ Well maybe cuz it can't feel very good to have your junk up in those."
"__FASHION__ It actually breaths quite well considering it  wasn't meant to be used as a male accessory"
"__FASHION__ Do you ever read the instructions? It could be hazardous to your health."
"__FASHION__ Well I never read anything about that. All I know is it looks great."
