"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the worst NFL player right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean in the history of the game or currently?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd go for currently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say maybe JaMarcus Russell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The quaterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think he's the worst player statistically speaking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say it's Russell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was suppose to be this awesome young talent when he got drafted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He just flopped."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Flopped?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah his three year stint with the raiders ended up being a complete waste for the organization. They got nothing out of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think the cause of that was just bad luck?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No he had terrible work ethic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Give me some examples."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he came to practice out of shape and overweight, was the last guy to show up for work and the first to go home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow that is a horrid work ethic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really showed on the feild man. He was a disaster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What ever happened to him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He no longer plays for the NFL. No team wanted him."
