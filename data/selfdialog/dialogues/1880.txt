"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Kendrick Lamar album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I've heard good things about it, though."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's great. It's not his overall best, but it's still really good."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard all of his other stuff, I just haven't had time to hear the new album."
"__MUSIC__ It's a good mix of catchy songs that still have meaning and pertain to the theme of the album."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I like about Kendrick. He keeps getting better at appealing to the masses but still sticking to his roots."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. This album is no different, either."
"__MUSIC__ Are there any features on it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah there's a few. I think Rihanna is the best one, though."
"__MUSIC__ A Kendrick and Rihanna track sounds like it would be amazing."
"__MUSIC__ It is!. It's one of my favorite songs right now and it will probably be all over the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I should probably listen, then, before I get tired of hearing it everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but for me, even Kendrick Lamar songs that get popular still appeal to me after hearing them over and over again."
"__MUSIC__ No matter how good an artist is, I'm capable of getting tired of some of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose, but then you can just go back to listening to some of their older stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. The album Section.80 by Kendrick is still one of my favorites of all time."
"__MUSIC__ I love that album too. That was before he got popular."
"__MUSIC__ Well see, maybe that's why I like that album so much. It was before those songs got overplayed."
"__MUSIC__ No, I think it's just a great album."
"__MUSIC__ Perhaps. Then again, every album he makes ends up being close to perfection."
