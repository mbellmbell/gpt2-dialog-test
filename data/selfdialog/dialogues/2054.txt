"__MUSIC__ Are you into Bob Dylan at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he's not really my thing, but I like a few of his songs. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I was listening to the radio and the topic was musical legends and so many people called in saying his songs would be good if his vocals were different."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I sort of get that. It just won't click for some people."
"__MUSIC__ But if the songs themselves are written well, it doesn't really matter how the voice sounds, right?"
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. I mean, I like people who aren't classically 'good.'"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like people are forgetting that music doesn't have to be perfect. No art has to be. Isn't it more personable to hear Bob Dylan sing his own stuff than some random studio singer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I could see that. It's more natural."
"__MUSIC__ It's like it's coming from the original source. It's not second-hand. That makes it more emotional for me."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I never thought of it that way. It's like Taylor Swift. People say she can't sing perfectly, but it is her songs."
"__MUSIC__ It's a lot of people. Like anyone folksy. I can't imagine anyone doing James Taylor songs other than James Taylor."
"__MUSIC__ His voice sounds gentle and nice, but yeah, it's not perfect. Maybe that's more ideal."
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to this station that plays old rock 'n' roll and it seems like every singer is the original writer."
"__MUSIC__ You don't see that as much these days. It's like pop stuff music is saturated with formulaic approaches."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say we could start our own band, but that might require musical talent."
"__MUSIC__ I can play 'chopsticks' on the piano."
"__MUSIC__ I think I already forgot how. But being able to play the piano would be cool."
"__MUSIC__ I used to know how to play a few songs, but I only took a few lessons when I was young."
"__MUSIC__ There aren't too many Billy Joels these days."
"__MUSIC__ I think the closest is a Ben Folds, maybe."
