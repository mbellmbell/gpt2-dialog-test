"__MUSIC__ Heard any good instrumental music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Nothing that really stands out for me.  I have been listening to older stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Like who, in particular?"
"__MUSIC__ Yanni, David Arkenstone, and I think David Lenz."
"__MUSIC__ Those are all really good!"
"__MUSIC__ I think I like Yanni the best."
"__MUSIC__ He has some pretty good songs.  I don't like the ones with vocals, though."
"__MUSIC__ No, me either.  I like the album where he is at the Acropolis."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the 'Live at the Acropolis'?  That IS a good one."
"__MUSIC__ I used to play it on repeat, back when it first came out."
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty good ambient music, too."
"__MUSIC__ I like it a lot.  I play it when I have housework to do, stuff like that."
"__MUSIC__ I bet that helps the housework go a little faster."
"__MUSIC__ It really does.  I HAVE to have music while I work."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  I always feel like it is taking forever without music."
"__MUSIC__ Is Yanni the one who was in a relationship with Linda Evans?"
"__MUSIC__ The lady from that old Dynasty show?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's the one!"
"__MUSIC__ I really don't know.  I don't pay attention to things like that."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I'll have to look it up, and I will try and find some more music like his, too."
