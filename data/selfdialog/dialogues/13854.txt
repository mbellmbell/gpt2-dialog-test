"__BASKETBALL__ Hey man how's it going? Have you been watching the NBA this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Good man. I've been trying to keep up but I don't always have time."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's been a lot of fun to watch, you've missed some good games let me tell you."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well tell me! You know I love the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I was amazed at how well they've done so far, I was into Houston."
"__BASKETBALL__ Come on really the Rockets? I'm surprised your rooting for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't tease me you know I've always liked the Rockets just not that much."
"__BASKETBALL__ I remember you we're into the Wizards for quite a while."
"__BASKETBALL__ I still like to watch the Wizards but I'm just not as strong of a fan for them anymore."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's alright we all have favorites that fade in and out, it's not weird."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm just happy watching the Rockets do their thing, I'll get back to the Wizards eventually."
"__BASKETBALL__ I understand I'm the same way with a few of these teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm really happy with the way Harden and Gordon have been working together."
"__BASKETBALL__ That makes it easier when the team fits, I forget who's the Center these days do you know?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Right now it's Nene, I'm reasonably satisfied."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about the battle with the Warriors coming up?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not worried I've never thought much of the Warriors this year it's all luck."
"__BASKETBALL__ Luck can take you far in the NBA sometimes though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Either way I'm looking forward to the Championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too, I was thinking about having a party at my house if you and the guys want to come watch!"
