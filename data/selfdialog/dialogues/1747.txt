"__MUSIC__ I am in awe of film composers. The best ones are able to change the personalities of their scores to fit just about any genre or mood."
"__MUSIC__ I think one of the most iconic film composers was Bernard Herrmann."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you. I collect movie soundtracks, and I have quite a lot of Herrmann scores."
"__MUSIC__ I know he did some classics that everyone recognizes - North by Northwest, Psycho."
"__MUSIC__ He also did scores that are talked about less, but are no less wonderful."
"__MUSIC__ One of my favorite scores is Mysterious Island."
"__MUSIC__ He did a lot of fantasy film scores, and they are all amazing. Mysterious Island had those crashing cymbals in the main theme."
"__MUSIC__ Just the music for that intense balloon sequence at the beginning really got the blood moving and set you up for the rest of the adventure."
"__MUSIC__ One of my husband's favorite Harrmann scores is The 7th Voyage of Sinbad."
"__MUSIC__ Another fantasy score, and another great one. It captures the exotic flavor of the setting."
"__MUSIC__ I think the most romantic score Herrmann wrote was for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir."
"__MUSIC__ What a great movie that was. My husband adores that score - he would play the soundtrack over and over, and just lose himself in it."
"__MUSIC__ He did a ton of Alfred Hitchcock films. You've already mentioned two of his most well known - North by Northwest and Psycho."
"__MUSIC__ Another Herrmann Hitchcock score I love is Marnie. It's romantic also, but eerie and mysterious, since the movie deals with the mystery of why Tippi Hedren is the way she is."
"__MUSIC__ He did the score to a classic sci fi film, The Day the Earth Stood Still."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I cannot even think of some of these films without hearing the score in my head."
"__MUSIC__ That's what makes a great composer. The music brings the film alive, but it also has a life of its own."
"__MUSIC__ Remember when the original Star Wars came out? The main theme actually made it into playlists on radio."
"__MUSIC__ That was astonishing. It's a testament to the iconic music of John Williams."
"__MUSIC__ I don't suppose the screaming strings of Herrmann's Psycho score would do that today, ha."
