"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see The Empire Strikes Back when it first came out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did! It was a huge cliff-hanger."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't imagine having to wait all that time to find out what happened to Han."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was really hard! I figured he'd get rescued, but I wasn't sure how."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about the Han and Leia romance?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I thought that was great. They're such a feisty couple."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also liked Luke training with Yoda. Yoda's so funny!"
"__STAR_WARS__ He is, and it was great getting to see Luke really becoming a Jedi knight."
"__STAR_WARS__ But I'm glad that I can go straight to the next movie to see the happy ending!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Lucky you! I had to wait three years for the next installment."
