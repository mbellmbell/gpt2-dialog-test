"__MOVIES__ I can't believe they still make Transformers movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they started, what? Ten years ago?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one came out in 2007, so you're right."
"__MOVIES__ A full decade of films. It's surprising there's only been 5 during that time."
"__MOVIES__ Michael Bay took a couple breaks in between to make other movies."
"__MOVIES__ That explains it. Is the new one getting good reviews?"
"__MOVIES__ No. These films never review well."
"__MOVIES__ But people like them anyway, I guess?"
"__MOVIES__ They seem to make a billion dollars on average, so yes, someone must like them."
"__MOVIES__ They're okay. They're not good, but they're not horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is the best one, in your opinion?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know. Maybe Dark of the Moon despite the silly title."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Well, in my opinion, Revenge of the Fallen is the worst one."
"__MOVIES__ No arguments here. Even Age of Extinction is better than it."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if this new one will somehow be worse."
"__MOVIES__ It probably depends on who you ask. Some will say it's the best one yet."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it does have Transformers fighting Nazis. Maybe it's worth seeing on the novelty alone."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget Transformers meeting King Arthur, too!"
"__MOVIES__ Good or bad, they're certainly strange movies!"
"__MOVIES__ It's the reason I always see them. Curiosity gets the best of me."
