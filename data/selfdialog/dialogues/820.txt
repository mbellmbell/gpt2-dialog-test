"__MUSIC__ Hey, I was just listening to some Pink Floyd.  Do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ They're allright.  I haven't heard them too much."
"__MUSIC__ Their music is definitely unique!  You should listen to them more."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about it so much?  I always thought they were a little weird."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I think The Wall is one of the best albums ever released!  Their uniqueness is what makes them so great."
"__MUSIC__ They're from London, right?  Like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are from the same time and same place."
"__MUSIC__ I am not as wild about that style of music."
"__MUSIC__ You just aren't appreciating it.  Wish You Were Here is one of the most beautiful songs ever produced."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I do like that one.  But a lot of their stuff just sounds too bizarre to me."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it can go in that direction, but think of it as relaxing music to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ To me it's just lacking a beat."
"__MUSIC__ Well apparently a lot of the world disagrees with you.  They're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I didn't know that.  But yeah I know they're pretty popular."
"__MUSIC__ The Dark Side of the Moon was another album that was great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard of that one, too."
"__MUSIC__ It was on the Billboard chart for over fourteen years."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's unbelievable."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, see what I mean?  They are a talented group with great music for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe it's just not my style."
