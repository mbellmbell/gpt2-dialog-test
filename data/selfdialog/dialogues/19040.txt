"__MOVIES__ I watched Life the other day and it was a really good Science Fiction horror. It reminded me of a cross between Aliens and Event Horizon."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the movie with Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, and Ryan Reynolds?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the movie. It just released a month ago or so, but I didn't hear much about it."
"__MOVIES__ I read some message boards about it and they really seem to give it good ratings. Tell me about it."
"__MOVIES__ The movie is about a crew of astronauts up in a space station that just discovered a life form from Mars. So now they're researching and learning about it."
"__MOVIES__ Don't tell me, this life form becomes a threat and everyone is fearing for their lives!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's what eventually happens, but there are a few surprises along the way. I also really enjoyed the scientific approach they took to learning about the life form."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it wasn't just an action horror fest, it dealt with some what realistic scenarios of how things would be if scientist really did find another life form."
"__MOVIES__ How did the life form look? Was it scary?"
"__MOVIES__ At first no, it was just an amoeba looking shape like a large cell. It was really interesting. It seem friendly too until provoked!"
"__MOVIES__ Who's the hero of the movie, Ryan or Jake?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't spoil it for you but it'll surprise you. I can tell you Jake plays his usual character self he always plays."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the isolated kind of anti social guy?"
"__MOVIES__ That's it. He's always so good playing that type of character. Ryan plays his usual outspoken, dry humor self too. Not exactly Deadpool though."
"__MOVIES__ I can imagine it. I think I've only seen one movie where Ryan Reynolds was serious and truly terrifying."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you mean that Amityville Horror remake where he was the dad that goes insane?"
"__MOVIES__ He was so terrifying in that!"
"__MOVIES__ He's pretty good in Life. I would recommend it. I enjoyed it a lot, had mixed feelings on the ending, but overall very entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good. I'll remember that. Thanks for the recommendation."
