"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you think that the 'Fast & Furious' movies objectify women?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Now that's an interesting question.  I would definitely say yes, but I have mixed feelings."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Can you elaborate?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ On one hand, this franchise has so much gratuitous and random shots of scantily clad females."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's almost a cornerstone at this point."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ But on the other hand, women should do whatever they feel is empowering to them.  Also, the coolest characters are female in the series."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Letty is definitely the coolest and toughest of that whole crew next to Dom."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Those two characters are perfect for each other."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Gisele, portrayed by Gal Gadot, I thought was also pretty empowering as a character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Don't forget the woman who played the police officer from Brazil.  She was a strong female character too."
