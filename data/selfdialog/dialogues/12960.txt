"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What good quarterback will never win a Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Stafford."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No? Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He plays for Detroit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that it? They're pretty decent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well for one, they feel snakebitten."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, 0-16 puts a pall on one's franchise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But also, look at their division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Green Bay, Minnesota and Chicago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. That's a tough division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Except Chicago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but Green Bay is great and the Vikings are on the rise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're sneakily good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I think that's a tough road ahead of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, they've lost Megatron, and he was huuuge in that offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've got Reggie Bush though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's had some lucky years there, but their RBs are snakebitten too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose, yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And there's still no replacement for Johnson."
