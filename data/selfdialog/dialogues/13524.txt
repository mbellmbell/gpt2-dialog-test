"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know the opening day for the Titans this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no idea. I know it's in the beginning of September.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, I'll look up. I want to check the schedule anyway. I'm so excited about them this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think Mariota is 100% now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd imagine so. He is still a young player and I heard that break was a clean one. Easy to mend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's good to hear...I like him too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, when I lived in Hawaii, all locals were so proud of him. I kind of share the feeling."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a pretty good team all in all...done well last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, they surprised us all, didn't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Much like the Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah! What was up with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they are showing up so they can move to Vegas..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ haha...that maybe! Vegas would be better than Oakland!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, and the Vikings did well, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! my boyfriend was so happy about that! He's from St. Paul."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I bet he hate the Packers then!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course! Just like how I don't like the Falcons..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's okay, no body much care about the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am really hoping for a great season for the Titans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good luck! I don't think they are quite ready for the Superbowl, but who knows...."
