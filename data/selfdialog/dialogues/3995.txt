"__MUSIC__ Did you hear the latest Katy Perry single?"
"__MUSIC__ Is that 'Swish Swish'? Yeah, it's terrible."
"__MUSIC__ Not even Nicki Minaj featuring can save it."
"__MUSIC__ What's up with Katy Perry?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but I feel like her marketing team is making some big mistakes."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed, she seems to have changed direction out of nowhere."
"__MUSIC__ She had the candy bubblegum pop princess thing cornered, and then she switched."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! There was no-one doing that shtick and now she's kind of hip-hoppy."
"__MUSIC__ The first single from the new album kind of flopped, too."
"__MUSIC__ Was that 'Chained to the Rhythm'? I saw the video but I only heard the song a few times."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was kind of universally panned. Do you her politics damaged her?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure, maybe. Perhaps a combination of politics and image change?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that seems right. She went from super political during the election to this kind of weird pop hip hop thing."
"__MUSIC__ And she did a song with Migos, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's what I mean. She's trying to get hip hop credibility and it isn't working."
"__MUSIC__ It looks kind of desperate, I guess. It's such a sudden change in branding for her."
"__MUSIC__ She isn't a bad singer but she isn't an amazing one, so her brand has always been more important than for others."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly - when I think of her Super Bowl performance, it was sunny and bright and what I think of when I think Katy Perry."
"__MUSIC__ Whereas these new songs featuring rappers just don't sound like her."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, people can tell when something is very forced and fake, and that's how this new album feels."
