"__THRILLER__ Seven was the creepiest movie ever."
"__THRILLER__ It's actually got a 7 in it."
"__THRILLER__ Huh?  What do you mean."
"__THRILLER__ The title of the movie is actually Se7en.  It has the number 7 instead of a v."
"__THRILLER__ That's odd.  I get it, but still odd."
"__THRILLER__ I winced at the ending for sure."
"__THRILLER__ It's not every day you find your wife's head in a box and learned she was pregnant."
"__THRILLER__ That was genuinely screwed up."
"__THRILLER__ That was the point though.  It wasn't a happy ending movie at all."
"__THRILLER__ I wish they would make more like that."
