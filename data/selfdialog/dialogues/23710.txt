"__DISNEY__ I just watched Moana for the first time. Have you seen it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I missed it in the movies and haven't seen it on Netflix yet."
"__DISNEY__ You're missing out! You should totally watch it."
"__DISNEY__ That's what I've heard.  What did you love about it?"
"__DISNEY__ It was so cute and funny!  My favorite song was 'You're welcome'?"
"__DISNEY__ I've heard that song, I didn't realize it was from Moana!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah!  It really has some great songs in it!"
"__DISNEY__ Excellent!  Did it have a good side-kick?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!  Hey-Hey the chicken!  I don't want to give it all away, so you should see it!"
"__DISNEY__ Ok, I will!"
