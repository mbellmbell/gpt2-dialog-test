"__MOVIES__ I've been thinking--lately I've been feeling like heist movies are my favorite genre."
"__MOVIES__ Heist movies? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it has to do with coming up with the scheme. I really like those parts."
"__MOVIES__ Those are always fun."
"__MOVIES__ And then watching it play out is really exciting."
"__MOVIES__ It is satisfying."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of movies are your favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I have a particular kind of movie I like best."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What are your favorites then."
"__MOVIES__ I really like The Virgin Suicides."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't Sophia Coppola direct that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. And the plot is really engrossing."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen it. Think I'd like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. What other kinds of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ When I was a kid my favorite was Home Alone."
"__MOVIES__ I think of that as a Christmas movie."
"__MOVIES__ I also really liked Galaxy Quest."
"__MOVIES__ All of these are either action or comedy. Maybe you wouldn't like The Virgin Suicides."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad!"
"__MOVIES__ You could give it a shot anyway if you wanted."
