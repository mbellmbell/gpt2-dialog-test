"__STAR_WARS__ So, in Episode one of Star Wars, they said Anakin does not have a dad right."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that the force made him, with his mom."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, he is more than half metaclhorins?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, weird but yes."
"__STAR_WARS__ And, they still had to question if he was the chosen one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I always thought that part was odd."
"__STAR_WARS__ Would they not have been a bit afraid of him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would think it was odd, him being so powerful."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that is why he went bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why, due to people fearing him?"
