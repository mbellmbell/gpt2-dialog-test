"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was reading about Andrew Luck and I hope he'll be able to play soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had surgery right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, on his shoulder, and he still can't throw."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How long ago was his surgery?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In January so it has been awhile."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will the Colts use if he can't start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Scott Tollzien. He played for Wisconsin in college, and then the 49ers and Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh well he's had a lot of experience then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, just not as a starter. They really need Luck to get back as soon as possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is he even practicing yet at camp?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. He is just observing because he hasn't been released yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he gets healthy they probably have a really good shot this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they need more than him though. They didn't have a great season last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely need to up their defense a bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially being in the same conference as the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Brady probably doesn't have many years left, but I'm sure they can find someone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. The Patriots are strong as a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They could probably do well with any quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure they could with the offense and defense that they have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would like to see a new champion this year though. The same winners get boring after awhile."
