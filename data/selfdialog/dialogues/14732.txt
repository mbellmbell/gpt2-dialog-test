"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, I'm looking for a fun little comedy to watch. Do you have anything to recommend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Actually yes. We just watched one last weekend."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What was it called?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Masterminds. It's with a bunch of very funny people like Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig, and others."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Was it really funny or kinda dumb?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Both at the same time actually. It was really silly, but I laughed a lot."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's not too crass in terms of humor?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, not at all. It's not that kind of teenage humor oriented toward body parts."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good, cause I get tired quickly of that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, it's really funny. It's about a naive and somewhat dumb Loomis employee who is convinced to steal a truckload of money (literally) by a work crush."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Classic heist movie, with a comedy treatment?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Something like that. But of course most of them are really dumb, or not too forward thinking at the very least."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sounds like it could be fun. Anyone else that I know in that movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Jason Sudeikis plays the part of a hilarious Southern hitman."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I love Jason Sudeikis!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well you'll love him in that because he's a riot. It's a character bit, and it's highly ridiculous, but he makes it work beautifully."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh wow - I'll watch it!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Otherwise, we watched Christmas office Party recently. But it wasn't as funny, although I kinda liked it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nah... We watched it and my girlfriend fell asleep after five minutes."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah... my husband did the same."
