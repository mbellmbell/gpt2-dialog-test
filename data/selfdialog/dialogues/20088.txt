"__MOVIES__ You're a big fan of the Harry Potter books, aren't you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I've read all the books and seen all the movies."
"__MOVIES__ I read a story yesterday about the girl who plays Luna Lovegood. She's in the movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the pretty blonde girl. I forget her name."
"__MOVIES__ It's Evanna Lynch. There was an interesting story about how she was pen pals with J.K Rowling."
"__MOVIES__ Is that how she got the role?"
"__MOVIES__ Not exactly. She still had to compete for it in a casting call with thousands of other girls it said."
"__MOVIES__ How did she get to be pen pals with J. K. Rowling?"
"__MOVIES__ She wrote to her saying how Harry Potter was the only thing that kept her mind off her problems."
"__MOVIES__ What problems did she have?"
"__MOVIES__ She was in the hospital when she wrote to her. She had an eating disorder."
"__MOVIES__ That was really nice of Rowling to become her pen pal."
"__MOVIES__ She's an ambassador now at a chairty for children Rowling started"

"__MOVIES__ Lumos. It helps children in institutions and orphanages."
"__MOVIES__ That's really great that Rowling is helping so many children with a charity organization."
"__MOVIES__ Her books have helped many children. Evanna said Luna helped her because she always felt odd and weird, and Luna made her see that as empowering."
"__MOVIES__ What a great story!"
"__MOVIES__ I know. I thought it was great that now Evanna has a role in helping others."
"__MOVIES__ By helping someone, you can empower that person to help others, which spreads your help."
