"__HORROR__ The 80s was definitely the best year for horror. They gave us iconic slasher villains like Freddie Krueger and Jason Voorhees!"
"__HORROR__ I'd have to disagree. I'm more partial to the Alfred Hitchcock era, he was a true master of suspense."
"__HORROR__ I've never really heard too much about Hitchcock, but I've seen The Birds. Black and white movies aren't my thing though."
"__HORROR__ I highly recommend you check more of his movies out! Without Hitchcock, the horror genre would never be the same."
"__HORROR__ What kind of films would you suggest to me? Obviously I've seen The Birds already!"
"__HORROR__ There are so many out there! A few of my personal recommendations include Psycho, Dial M for Murder, and The Man Who Knew Too Much."
"__HORROR__ Sounds good! Are there color versions of any of these films? Black and white is quite dull on the eyes."
"__HORROR__ Some of the best movies ever made have been in black and white, but I'm sure there are some remastered colored versions out there, if that floats your boat."
"__HORROR__ I see what you're getting out, I'll check some of those movies out. Any newer horror movies you looking forward too?"
"__HORROR__ None really, I feel that newer horror movies are too clich√© and rely too heavily on overused jump scares."
