"__MUSIC__ Have you heard that new Sam Hunt song?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't even know who Sam Hunt is.  What is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Body Like a Back Road.  It's a great song!"
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well technically I guess it's country, but it's got a great beat and a little bit of rock influence I'd say."
"__MUSIC__ So it's kinda a mixture of country and pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah you could definitely say that."
"__MUSIC__ So who on earth is Sam Hunt?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a country singer, just not as big of a name as some."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah I don't listen to much country.  That's probably why I don't know him."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'm surprised you haven't heard his new one.  It's been a Billboard number one song for twenty weeks."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, on which Billboard list?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, country hits.  Maybe that's why you haven't heard it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I bet.  I do like to keep up with Billboard hits, though."
"__MUSIC__ Sam Hunt actually has released two albums already."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Was anything else a hit?"
"__MUSIC__ Not that I know of.  He was new to me with this song."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'll definitely check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it has great lyrics and a good beat.  I bet you'll like it."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the recommendation, I will definitely let you know!"
