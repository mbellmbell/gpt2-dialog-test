"__MUSIC__ What's the last band you saw in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually I think it was Britney Spears."
"__MUSIC__ I bet that was a great show.  When did you see her?"
"__MUSIC__ It was about a year ago in Las Vegas.  It was a really good concert.  She performed a lot of her hits from Circus."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite song from that cd was Womanizer."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she release that album around the time she went kind of crazy?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was right after that.  She certainly came right back into the spotlight though.  That album had a lot of good singles."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It had Womanizer, Circus, Kill the Lights, If You Seek Amy. It was just a good album all around."
"__MUSIC__ I think it might have been her best one yet.  I liked In the Zone but Circus was really just a little better."
"__MUSIC__ Really you think so?  I loved that song Everytime.  It really showed that she could do ballads and not just pop."
"__MUSIC__ She is very talented there's no doubt.  I'd say she rivals Madonna as the 'queen of pop'"
"__MUSIC__ But there's so much competition for that title.  Madonna, Kelly Clarkson, and Lady Gaga."
"__MUSIC__ I think Kelly Clarkson has done really well for herself.  She won American Idol back in 2002 and she's not stopped making really good music."
"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that song Piece by Piece."
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  It's so emotional.  I saw a live performance with her singing it on American Idol for the finale and she got tears in her eyes and had to stop singing for a second."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that too.  Keith Urban was just crying and it made me tear up too."
"__MUSIC__ She really is a great artist.  She has a ton of cds but all of them have some good songs on them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, not like some artists where their cds are kind of hit or miss."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know she was born in Texas?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that.  She really doesn't have an accent though."
