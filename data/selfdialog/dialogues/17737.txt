"__MOVIES__ Do you like superhero movies?  I was going to go see 'Wonder Woman.'"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really a big fan."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any you like at all?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved Iron Man, the first one.  And I saw 'Daredevil' on Netflix, but that's it."
"__MOVIES__ Any reason you don't like them?"
"__MOVIES__ I was just never into that genre even as a kid.  And now, I feel like they make too many of these movies."
"__MOVIES__ True, but they're probably here to stay."
"__MOVIES__ You think so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well for one, look at the rate they're making these.  And also look at how much source material there is for it."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, but I'm sure people will get tired of them eventually."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that, man."
"__MOVIES__ I think there's already a backlash against it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, consider this.  Westerns were popular for like 2 or 3 decades."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose.  I guess there's no escaping it for the time being."
"__MOVIES__ You're stuck with it.  But I say give it another shot, because these movies are starting to become more diverse."
"__MOVIES__ Story wise?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup.  More complex plots and different stories to tell."
"__MOVIES__ I still won't go line up to see these things, but let me know if there's ever one that's too good to pass."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'll be your filter for these movies."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good.  Thanks."
