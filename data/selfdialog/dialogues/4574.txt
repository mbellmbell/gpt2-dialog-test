"__MUSIC__ Who's better, Run-DMC or The Beastie Boys?"
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to say."
"__MUSIC__ Why you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because Run-DMC used to write the songs for The Beastie Boys when they first came out."
"__MUSIC__ For real?"
"__MUSIC__ That song Slow and Low? Run-DMC wrote that."
"__MUSIC__ That song was hot. Wasn't it on their first album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It also had Paul Revere on their and some other fire."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the rap music from the eighties and nineties is better than what they make today."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I stll be playing Scarface and Kool G rap."
"__MUSIC__ Scarface was that dude. He got extra hot after he left the Ghetto Boys."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but The Ghetto Boys still made some bangers."
"__MUSIC__ I think Face was the truth. He made that song with Tupac."
"__MUSIC__ You talking about Smile?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__MUSIC__ I used to like the video for that joint."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Tupac was that dude."
"__MUSIC__ Man, 'pac was ahead of his time."
"__MUSIC__ I know, if he was still alive he would STILL be on top of the rap game."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right. Between him and Biggie? They had the game sewn up."
