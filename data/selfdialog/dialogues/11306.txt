"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so sick of the Broncos fans around here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you despise them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps it's the fact that they are just everywhere around these parts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably because you don't have another football team in this market."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are the closest team, but it's so much more than that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, well what do you hate in particular?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For one, their colors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's wrong with blue and orange?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see it everywhere.  I can't go anywhere in the winter without seeing Broncos coats!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like a silly reason to hate the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What drives me even crazier is their fanbase."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're no different from everyone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, but they are, much more annoying."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In what ways exactly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For one, all they talk about was their Super Bowl victory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a good win for Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But see, they don't talk about getting spanked by the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And why would they?  That was a horrible Super Bowl to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they make up a billion excuses why they lost the game and don't just own it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they've made a Super Bowl recently, that's gotta stand for something."
