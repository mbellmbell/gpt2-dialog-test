"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been keeping up with the NFL draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have. I'm really excited for next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have been thinking a lot about defenses coming into this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There have been a lot of good defensive picks drafted in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think has the strongest defense for the coming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think the Denver Broncos have a phenomenal lineup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're not wrong there. They are definitely top three."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think has them beat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In terms of defense I would say the Seattle Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. The Seahawks defense is looking insane again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's been nothing new for them to dominate defensively."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to say the Texans are looking really strong defensively, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, their defense might even be ahead of the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say so too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wasn't there some talk of the Richard Sherman being up for trade in the offseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I forgot about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He plays a huge role in defense for the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't think they would do half as well without him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, I don't see the team moving him after the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I think it's safe to say he'll be staying a Seahawk in the upcoming season."
