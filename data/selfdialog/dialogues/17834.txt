"__MOVIES__ Do you like horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do, for the most part.  I don't like really gory movies.  I prefer creepy, like ghost stories and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm kind of the same way.  I like haunted house movies a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, me too.  Like, I liked Insidious, which was kind of a haunted house movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I liked those movies too.  I liked Sinister a lot as well.  Although that was a little bit bloody.  A lot of people died in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my God, I saw that.  The really creeped me out big time."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  That was one of those that stuck with me even as I was trying to fall asleep."
"__MOVIES__ I like the older scary movies almost more than the current ones.  For instance, Poltergeist is one of my all time favorites.  I can watch it again and again."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great movie.  Definitely a fan of the classic version from the eighties.  I thought the new one was really disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ It was awful.  Some movies just shouldn't be rebooted.  They got it right the first time.  Why do it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  But they never seem to learn their lesson, do they?  They just keep making inferior new versions of excellent movies."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Nightmare On Elm Street was another example of that.  The original was scary and really well made and unique.  The remake was just the opposite."
"__MOVIES__ At least there are certain ones they don't seem to touch.  The Exorcist, for instance."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're leaving that one alone.  Good thing too.  I'd hate to see a lame new version of that."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see a movie called Ghost Story?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure.  What was it again?"
"__MOVIES__ It's based on a book and it's about these four old guys who accidentally killed this girl and she comes back to haunt them."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I've seen that one.  Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not really hugely popular, but I've always liked it.  It's creepy, for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Well, as I said, I like creepy.  I'll have to check that one out."
