"__MUSIC__ Did you ever do band camp in high school?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was in marching band for all four years."
"__MUSIC__ So, are the stories true?"
"__MUSIC__ You know ... the American Pie stories."
"__MUSIC__ Ahh, those. Umm, sort of."
"__MUSIC__ What is and what isn't? I have a kid joining."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the friendships that develop surrounding music are really strong, since it brings us all together."
"__MUSIC__ That's boring. Tell me about what I need to hear."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the band camp bus is basically sex ed."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ There are chaperones but they can only do so much. On the way home from competitions and games it's makeout central."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it's no different than any other group. Get a ton of teenagers together and put them in an enclosed space, guess what'll happen?"
"__MUSIC__ No actual sex, though, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Shouldn't be. There's a 'heads up' rule on the bus."
"__MUSIC__ Good."
"__MUSIC__ We pretty much saw each other changing all the time."
"__MUSIC__ So, high school music programs are sex ed?"
"__MUSIC__ Basically. But the amount and quality of music we play is great. Kids are in it for the music, not the sex."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I think I feel better, but I am not sure."
