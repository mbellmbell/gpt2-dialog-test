"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen all of the Fantastic Four movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I have, even the one with Michael B. Jordan."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes he's an excellent actor. I loved the fact that they made The Human Torch Black."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes that was a nice touch. I like the original ones with Jessica Alba better."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right, they were funnier and explained a lot more about the characters."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think I'd like to have Johnny Storm's powers if I could have any of of them."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'd probably prefer Reed Richard's powers since I'm lazy and don't like to get up for things. I could just stretch and reach for them."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's hilarious. They made a great team though, and had great chemistry."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I'm wondering if they'll come out with another one."
"__SUPERHERO__ The movies were great but they weren't that great. They should just leave it as is."
