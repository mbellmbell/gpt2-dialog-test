"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you still need those Harry Potter DVD's?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, we want to binge watch them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ok, which ones?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you have at least the first three?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes. But what about the rest?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think I might have the rest but when we moved I displaced them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, how about I bring the first three and then we can watch the rest next time?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sounds like a good plan. Do you think we can watch three in one day?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think so, if it's a weekend."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, how about we watch them on Saturday?"
