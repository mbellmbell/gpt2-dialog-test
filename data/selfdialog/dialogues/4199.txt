"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the Carly Rae Jepsen song, Cut to the Feeling?"
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't. I don't really love Carly Rae Jepsen."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, that one song got so played out it just started to drive me crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Which song? Call Me Maybe?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that one. It was overplayed."
"__MUSIC__ It did go pretty viral with the lip-synching videos and everything. But still, I like her music."
"__MUSIC__ What's the new song again?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Cut to the Feeling. It's my summer jam."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. I don't know."
"__MUSIC__ I think she has some really interesting 80's influences in her music. It just makes me happy when I listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Were'nt the 80's kind of cheesy?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. But that doens't mean they weren't fun."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I just like more chill music. Like something you would listen to at a coffee shop."
"__MUSIC__ That's fair. I like listening to music I can dance to."
"__MUSIC__ I don't dance. It makes me look like a frog slipping on an icy lake while trying to do yoga."
"__MUSIC__ That is hilarious! I'm sure it's not all that bad."
"__MUSIC__ No, it really is."
"__MUSIC__ I think you should try to listen to some dance music and have a good time. Even just alone in your house."
"__MUSIC__ I might try that, but I hope I don't hurt myself!"
