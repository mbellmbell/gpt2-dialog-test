"__BASEBALL__ Do you like baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's okay.  I'd rather play than watch, it just seems like there's a lot time with not much going on."
"__BASEBALL__ You think the games are boring?"
"__BASEBALL__ Some parts.  If it could just be the highlights, that would be great, with ten minutes a game, all the best hits and catches and outs."
"__BASEBALL__ That's not the way it works."
"__BASEBALL__ No, but it should.  I mean, I've watched some of a no-hitter and sure, there's some tense moments, but mostly it's just a guy throwing to another guy."
"__BASEBALL__ Have you ever been to a game?  Not just watched one on TV?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, in Seattle.  The field was really green and I guess some of the stats were kind of interesting, but it got a little boring after a while."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess if there aren't many hits, it can be a little tedious.  So, do you have favorite position?"
"__BASEBALL__ To watch or to play?"
"__BASEBALL__ Either, both."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I can't really pitch and my throw is little short for an outfielder, so maybe first base.  Watching, though, it changes a little depending on the caliber of the player."
"__BASEBALL__ So, you just like the really good players?"
"__BASEBALL__ I like really good players, but what I mean is that some seem to have a little more flair a little more style when throwing or catching."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess I get that, some players seem to just have a little more presence."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they seem to be the ones who make these amazing catches or throws."
"__BASEBALL__ How are you as a batter?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm okay. When I've played, I usually get a hit every other time at bat, though mostly singles."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not really a great hitter, I can only ever get fast balls and the pitcher learns that pretty quick.  But I'm pretty damn good as a catcher."
"__BASEBALL__ I could see that."
