"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think the Empire is really the bad guys in Star Wars. What do you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, really if you think about it. The jedis are really the bad guys."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why would you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The main reason is that they will take a child that they think is strong with the force and make them become a jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Eeeek, I never thought about that. That is kind of messed up but that still doesn't make the Empire good guys."
"__STAR_WARS__ It does if the Empire is trying to stop what the jedis are doing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmmm, but what about the Sith? Aren't they bad?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Darth Vader was a Sith. He was just reuniting his family and following his beliefs."
"__STAR_WARS__ Can't blame a guy for doing that."
