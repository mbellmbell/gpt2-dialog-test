"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Jaguars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh interesting.  You from that area?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, why do you ask?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just they're not very good, so you must be from around there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh.  Yeah I see what you mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Chiefs."
