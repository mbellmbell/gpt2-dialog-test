"__HORROR__ Have you ever seen the Final Destination series?"
"__HORROR__ No, what's it about?"
"__HORROR__ It a really good horror series. There's five movies and they're all about different disasters that people saw before they happened and were able to save everyone."
"__HORROR__ Well, that doesn't sound like a horror movie at all!"
"__HORROR__ You would think, until Death comes back for them all. They start dying in the order they would have if they hadn't been saved, in really gruesome ways."
"__HORROR__ Wow! And there's five whole movies about this?"
"__HORROR__ Well, they all kind of connect. In the first one, one girl survives, but then she tries to help the people in the second one and ends up dying then."
"__HORROR__ Cool! Any thing else I might like?"
"__HORROR__ There's also a twist ending with the last one, but I don't want to spoil it for you!"
"__HORROR__ I'll let you know if I watch them!"
