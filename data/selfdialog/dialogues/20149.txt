"__MOVIES__ Do you ever like spoof movies?"
"__MOVIES__ What exactly are spoof movies?"

"__MOVIES__ Oh right I knew that."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like them at all?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. I think they're kind of stupid."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes they can be funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yes sometimes. But have you seen 'Fifty Shades of Black'?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually I have but only part of it. Got tired of watching it."
"__MOVIES__ I really like Marlon Wayans but just didn't care for that spoof."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't either. It was so dumb it wasn't really funny."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the original 'Fifty Shades of Grey' movies though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh me too. They were pretty raunchy but amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait for the last in the trilogy to come out next year."
"__MOVIES__ Me either."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the actor who played Christian?"
"__MOVIES__ He was pretty hot actually."

"__MOVIES__ It will be interesting to see how they conclude with the next movie."
