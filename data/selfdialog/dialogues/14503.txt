"__HORROR__ The Rob Zombie movie 'House of 1000 Corpses' is quite disturbing."
"__HORROR__ Yes, I agree, I was a bit freaked out the further along the movie went."
"__HORROR__ When they pulled into Captain Spaulding's place, I thought he was just a weird, funny guy."
"__HORROR__ I know, I started freaking out a bit when they rode the Murder Ride, I knew something wasn't right."
"__HORROR__ Probably when things really got bad was when they dressed the people up as rabbits and put them down that hole in the ground."
"__HORROR__ Right, that was terrifying and the girl running for her life and coming face to face with that monster Dr. Satan."
"__HORROR__ You know, that was so bad, he was extra creepy."
"__HORROR__ The worst part of the whole thing was the end, you know, when she rose out of the ground and that horrible place."
"__HORROR__ Yes, I truly thought she was safe, and all I could think was 'run girl run!'."
"__HORROR__ Of all people to pick her up, Captain Spaulding, well, we both know what happens now, and the movie doesn't even have to continue!"
