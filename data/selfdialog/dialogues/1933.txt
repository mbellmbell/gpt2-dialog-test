"__MUSIC__ Do you know of any older folk music?"
"__MUSIC__ I know a lot. Have you heard of the Kingston Trio?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. Are they folk singers?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They became popular in the late 50's to late 60's."
"__MUSIC__ Are they a family group or just friends?"
"__MUSIC__ They were childhood friends. Their names are Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane, and Dave Guard."
"__MUSIC__ I vaguely heard of them. What are some of their most famous songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I think their biggest hit is Tom Dooley. I know that was on their first album that shot them into stardom."
"__MUSIC__ They sound like they are like The Mama's and the Papas and Peter, Paul and Mary. Are they?"
"__MUSIC__ I think the Mama's and the Papas and Peter Paul and Mary sang similar songs of that era. In fact, I think all three groups sang each other's songs."
"__MUSIC__ I love Peter Paul and Mary. I especially love their song 'Where have all the flowers gone?'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.. I love that song too. and the Mama's and the Papas song 'California Dreamin'..."
"__MUSIC__ All this talk about folk singers makes me want to go listen to some. I also like Cat Stevens and he became famous around the 60's-70's too."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that Cat Stevens actually gave up his fame and fortune to devote himself to his religion?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I did not know that. Was he a Buddhist? His work reminds me of a Budhhist."
"__MUSIC__ No, actually I believe that Cat Stevens converted to Islam. In fact, I know that he is practicing Islam and that was a huge part of who he is now."
"__MUSIC__ That is interesting. Do you know if Cat Stevens makes albums anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he does but I am not sure. I did read that his name is actually Yusuf Islam now."
"__MUSIC__ I also heard that Cat Stevens contracted tuberculosis in the late 60's that made him think about his life with more meaning."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. I guess money and fame for some artists is not as important as following their spiritual heart."
