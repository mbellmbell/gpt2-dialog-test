"__MOVIES__ Do you prefer to watch old movies or new ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I like both, some of the old ones remind me of how things used to be but the new ones make you think about how things might be in the future."
"__MOVIES__ The ones that try to show the future are usually frightening, the buildings are blown up and everyone's starving."
"__MOVIES__ Well some of them we all live on a space ship."
"__MOVIES__ Well I do have to say the science fiction movies are better today.."
"__MOVIES__ Especially when they have monster or aliens, they no longer use painted lizards."
"__MOVIES__ I think Star Wars really improved the way syfy movies were made when it comes to graphics and characters."
"__MOVIES__ I remember when my husband and I went to the theater to see Star Wars it was mind blowing."
"__MOVIES__ I know, all of the action and it had a great story line."
"__MOVIES__ Plus having two great looking men as the stars did not hurt."
"__MOVIES__ Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill were great in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Hans Solo and Luke Skywalker are the greatest names for characters ever."
"__MOVIES__ Princess Leia was a cool name also, and Carrie Fisher did a good job."
"__MOVIES__ Well let's not forget Chewbacca, Yoda and Darth Vader."
"__MOVIES__ And the robots C-3PO and R2D2."
"__MOVIES__ That movie had so many great character names."
"__MOVIES__ The more characters the more toys you have to buy the kids."
"__MOVIES__ Can you imagine how much money the Star Wars Trilogy has made."
"__MOVIES__ I can't even. I know my kids had a lot of them."
"__MOVIES__ Mine too and now we are buying them for the grandchildren."
