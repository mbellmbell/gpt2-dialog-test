"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of Spider-Man?"
"__MOVIES__ Spider-Man?  Yea, he's one of my favorite superheroes."
"__MOVIES__ Then I have a question.  Why's there another movie being made, with a different actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Well besides money, the main reason is that this will be the first time Marvel Studios makes their own Spider-Man movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm confused.  Aren't all the Spider-Man movies by Marvel?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Spider-Man' the character belongs to Marvel, but Sony Pictures previously retained the rights to the movie franchise."
"__MOVIES__ I see.  So Marvel's own in-house studio is making it this time."
"__MOVIES__ That's correct.  Which is why Spider-Man can now exist in the same universe as the rest of the Marvel movie characters."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about the new actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Tom Holland?  He might be my favorite actor to have played Spider-Man."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea.  Not only was he great in 'Captain America: Civil War,' but he's also the first Spider-Man to actually be high-school age."
"__MOVIES__ Good point.  Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were both way too old to play teenagers."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the Spider-Man movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't say I'm a big superhero genre fan, but I really loved 'Spider-Man' 1 and 2."
"__MOVIES__ Those were classics.  They helped jump start the so-called 'Golden Age' of superhero movies."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they do a good job with this new one."
"__MOVIES__ I think they will.  Marvel Studios hasn't had a flop yet."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great point.  There's definitely consistency in terms of successes."
"__MOVIES__ Let's hope that doesn't stop any time soon!"
