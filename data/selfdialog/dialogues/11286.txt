"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL season is almost here, are you going to any games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I don't have a team near me, but I can't wait to watch some of the receivers this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a lot of amazing receivers to watch this year, I'm looking forward to Odell Beckham Jr.'s performance, he makes some incredible catches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does, do you think he will have a better year than Antonio Brown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, Brown is really good and the Steelers have a good run game that helps avoid double coverage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd guess that Brown has more receiving yards and touchdowns, but I still think some of the best plays of the year will come from Beckham, he is a great athlete."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers are going to be good again this year, Leveon Bell was impressive last year and he doesn't have any suspensions this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet you are right, I wonder how good Bell can be receiving out of the backfield, that was really hard to combat on defense last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember watching Kansas City play them, and they did pretty good, but you are right.  Covering both Brown and Bell is really hard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that game, Tyreek Hill looked good for Kansas City."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could break out even more this year.  He is extremely fast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, Kansas City didn't resign Jeremy Maclin, so Hill could get a lot more opportunities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then he could go crazy because he did not get a lot of targets last year, and still had some of the best highlights in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alex Smith will never be a gun slinger, but Hill scores from behind the line of scrimmage, so that may not matter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Tom Brady throwing to Brandon Cooks this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That will be devastating.  He will have Gronkowski and Cooks, they will be frustrating teams once again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to pick, I think Brown, then Beckham, then Cooks, then Hill for most touchdowns this year, in that order."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like that list, I think we are missing someone though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dez Bryant, he could have the most of anyone on that team with such a great offense."
