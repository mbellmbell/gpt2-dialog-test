"__HORROR__ So, what horror films do you want to see?"
"__HORROR__ Well, gosh there's several that have been out for awhile i want to watch but haven't gotten around to. For examples, Train to Busan/"
"__HORROR__ I don't think I've heard of that one."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, it's from South Korea.  It's about this guy and his young daughter who get onboard a bullet and it starts getting taken over by zombies.  i heard it's got a lot of action and is real suspenseful."
"__HORROR__ Whoa, that sounds pretty cool."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, another one I want to see is The Girl With All the Gift."
"__HORROR__ I'm sensing a theme here..."
"__HORROR__ Haha.. yeah, they both have to do with zombies... although I don't think they're called that in The Girl."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I've heard people praising that film as really good."
"__HORROR__ I may have to read the book it's based on first"
