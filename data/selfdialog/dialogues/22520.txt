"__DISNEY__ Frozen is a great Disney movie, but I actually thought Tangled was better."
"__DISNEY__ Really?  I loved Frozen!"
"__DISNEY__ Don't get me wrong.  I liked Frozen, too, but I thought it was a little over-hyped."
"__DISNEY__ I have never seen Tangled, so I wouldn't know."
"__DISNEY__ You are missing out!  It's adorable!"
"__DISNEY__ Isn't it the story of Rapunzel?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes.  She's a teenager who grew up thinking the woman who raised her was her mother...but she wasn't!"
"__DISNEY__ Frozen has a talking snowman though..."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, well Tangled has a funny horse named Maximus."
"__DISNEY__ I'll watch it and be the judge as to which is better!"
