"__DISNEY__ Hey, have you watched the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't but I have been wanting to. How was it?"
"__DISNEY__ It was great! I actually watched the new one before the old cartoon one."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I watched the old cartoon one a long time ago, but I'd like to watch this one too."
"__DISNEY__ You really should, it was so good! Emma Watson played the perfect Belle."
"__DISNEY__ I imagine she would have played a good Belle, she is beautiful!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes she definitely is, but what was most impressive was her acting skills."
"__DISNEY__ She is a great actress!  Was the storyline the same as the cartoon movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, exactly like it, right down to the musicals."
"__DISNEY__ They usually change movies so much when remaking them. That's so surprising that they didn't do it with this one."
