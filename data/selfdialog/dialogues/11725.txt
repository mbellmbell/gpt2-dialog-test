"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Browns will be improved this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean... they loaded up on draft picks. They should be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You would THINK they would be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's hard to be confident in them though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They always seem to do poorly every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's because their old management staff kept messing things up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how their new staff does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We shall see. They can't do any worse than the old regime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only way they would be worse is if they went winless this coming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's hard to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I feel bad for the Chargers losing to them last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Suprise of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chargers also need a reboot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That team is literally up and down every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Philip Rivers is a gun slinger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He reminds me of Brett Favre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he chucks the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He makes a lot of mistakes too. I like his hustle though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't teach that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's for sure."
