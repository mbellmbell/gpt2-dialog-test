"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really confused about the NFL and its TV schedule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they have one Monday Night matchup and all-day Sunday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But why do they need Thursday?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they feel threatened by college, or other TV shows that in no way affect them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also don't like that on Sundays, there's only ever two games on at once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they only have deals with the NFL network, CBS, Fox, and NBC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't even get the NFL network."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they just will do anything for money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In college there's always like eight games on at once so you have a legitimate choice"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but this is the NFL. The commissioner would never have it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's really all about the money isn't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. I rarely can watch a game anyway because my team gets blacked out a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish the NFL network would be available everywhere, and you could choose what game you wanted at any time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. Too bad logic doesn't make money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too bad they pay their players millions of dollars each, thus necessitating it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a bit extravagant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just hoping they don't go to Wednesdays or Tuesdays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too; it's too excessive."
