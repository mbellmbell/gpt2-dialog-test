"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, that is a very tough call. There are definitely a few that I would have difficulty choosing from."
"__BEATLES__ I can understand that. Do you have a favorite member?"
"__BEATLES__ I'd probably have to say Paul McCartnet. I really also liked his work with Wings."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, for sure. That is also great music."
"__BEATLES__ John Lennon is of course a close second."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I would even go so far as to say he is my favorite. Imagine is just one of those songs that I can never turn off."
"__BEATLES__ I hear you on that one."
"__BEATLES__ Sounds like we both are both big fans. Would you be interested in going to see a tribute band concert sometime?"
"__BEATLES__ Absolutely. Just let me know when!"
