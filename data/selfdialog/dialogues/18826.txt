"__MOVIES__ By any chance, have you managed to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have, and it's a great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard that it had a really stacked cast."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. We're talking people like Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Kurt Russell."
"__MOVIES__ My goodness, that sounds amazing just by the names alone."
"__MOVIES__ They all put on a terrific show. Each character is just so unique and likeable."
"__MOVIES__ Who is Dave Bautista's character again?"
"__MOVIES__ His character is Drax. He's a greenish alien person with a very blunt personality, and I mean blunt to the point of being nilarious."
"__MOVIES__ That's exactly what I'd heard about him from the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ There's also Cooper and Diesel's duo of Rocket and Groot. They are just as funny."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Rocket the only one in the group that can understand Groot?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. All he knows how to say is 'I am Groot', and Rocket's translations are always super funny."
"__MOVIES__ And how's Chris Pratt's character?"
"__MOVIES__ Star-Lord? He's a pretty straightforward hero with a tragic backstory and likable personality, and this movie explores his origins a bit further."
"__MOVIES__ What are some other good things about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The soundtrack!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? How?"
"__MOVIES__ Since Star-Lord is such a huge fan of music, the film constantly plays the music that the character listens to, which are a bunch of hits from the 70s and 80s."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ It IS awesome!"
