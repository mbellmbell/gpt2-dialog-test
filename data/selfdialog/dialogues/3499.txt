"__MUSIC__ My favorite genre. That's hard."
"__MUSIC__ Mine will always be classic rock."
"__MUSIC__ That's one of my favorites too."
"__MUSIC__ What is your absolute favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I can't commit to one genre for life like you."
"__MUSIC__ Are you avoiding the question, or what?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all. It’s complicated."
"__MUSIC__ Let’s have it."
"__MUSIC__ I like many kinds of music, or maybe all kinds. I sometimes rank them."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. Whose number one on the list?"
"__MUSIC__ Today, it’s a four way tie. Jazz, classic rock, classical and bluegrass like Bela Fleck's earlier stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That is one heck of a four way tie."
"__MUSIC__ Tomorrow it might be different."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if that's avoiding your true passion, I suspect classical, so as not to appear old fashioned."
"__MUSIC__ Not true. I just cannot say that any genre is bad or good."
"__MUSIC__ Well, tell me how you think of music."
"__MUSIC__ Every genre has its good and bad. Like usually belittled disco."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. When I think of it, that's true."
"__MUSIC__ I bet you like some of Willie Nelson's stuff even though you say you hate country."
"__MUSIC__ You got me there. I was speaking of generally."
