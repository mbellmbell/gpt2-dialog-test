"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been to Festival of the Lakes in Hammond, Indiana, for their July music festival?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I've never been there. I know where Hammond is, it's only about half an hour or 40 minutes from Chicago."
"__MUSIC__ It's held at Wolf Lake Memorial Park every July, and it's a really unique musical festival."
"__MUSIC__ What's unique about it?"
"__MUSIC__ It last for 5 days from Wednesday through Sunday, and every night it's a different kind of genre, so there's all types of music. It's usually a main band and an opening band."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, 5 different nights of music? That must be fun for people who live near there."
"__MUSIC__ It's really great if you live in the neighborhood within walking distance, because then it's free. For everyone else, it's $25 per vehicle for one night, or you can get a 3 day pass for $60."
"__MUSIC__ That's not really expensive, if you have three people in the car and split it, it's only a little over $8 each."
"__MUSIC__ The stage built in a cool open face building in the park is on a big grassy area, where there's plenty of room to sit and see everything up close."
"__MUSIC__ Is there food available?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, a ton of food trucks parked along a paved area. And across from the grassy area is a huge space with a carnival, with lots of rides you pay to go on, and all the usual concession stands and game booths."
"__MUSIC__ A carnival and a concert both in the same space? That does sound like fun!"
"__MUSIC__ It's open from 5 pm to midnight. And if you go early, from 5 pm until dusk, they give free pontoon boat rides on the lake that is also right there by the grassy area and carnival."
"__MUSIC__ The pontoon boat rides are free? Nothing is ever free these days! What kind of bands are playing?"
"__MUSIC__ The headliners this year are Kool & the Gang, Bush, Dick Diamond & the Dusters, The Crawpuppies, Limp Bizkit, and Flo Rida."
"__MUSIC__ Bsuh and Limp Bizkit? Those are some serious bands to get to see that cheap depending on how many people you can get to come in your car."
"__MUSIC__ They have other events going on, a golfing thing, a fishing tournament, a 5k chairty walk, senior's day, special person's day for handicapped people, fireworks usually one or two nights. There's a lot going on."
"__MUSIC__ And they do this every year?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, it's a city party for the citizens to enjoy their city and park, but everyone is welcome no matter where you're from. Tons of police around, so no violence or crime, a really safe fun time- unless you have too many beers in the beer tent."
"__MUSIC__ No violence or crime. Cheap and tons of things to do. Nearby parking. Summertime out on a lawn enjoying the nice weather. I want to go !!!"
