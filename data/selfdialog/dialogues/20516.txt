"__MOVIES__ Hey mom, can we see a movie today?"
"__MOVIES__ It is the weekend, so I would allow just today."
"__MOVIES__ Thank you! Please let me see the new King Arthur movie."
"__MOVIES__ That one does look good, but I know the director makes violent movies."
"__MOVIES__ This one is more stylized mom, the violence isn't too gory or bloody."
"__MOVIES__ I just worry a bit about you getting exposed to that, but it has been getting good reviews."
"__MOVIES__ I know that Jude Law and the guy from Vikings is in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow I love that show Vikings!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, that is why I brought it up!"
"__MOVIES__ We can check this out, I may want to watch a trailer first."
"__MOVIES__ Let me get my computer, I saw the trailer and immediately wanted to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know what it is rated?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! It is rated PG-13 so it won't be too gratutitous."
"__MOVIES__ That is a great word! I think we should see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Jude Law is a great actor and I believe he is the villain."
"__MOVIES__ Oh and I see it is directed by Guy Ritchie, I know he is a bit violent but he is talented as well."
"__MOVIES__ I think we will like it!"
"__MOVIES__ HOpefully the accents don't get too off track, that makes me nuts."
"__MOVIES__ I think they are mostly British actors, so it will feel more real."
"__MOVIES__ Let's go see it!"
