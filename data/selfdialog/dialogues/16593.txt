"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I loved Dead Men Tell No Tales! I thought it was great!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, me too! I felt like it was on par with the original."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Especially after the last one which was pretty disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and what I really loved is that we see an influx of new characters."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that too. Because I think they breathed some new life into the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Plus, we also get to see Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner again! I was so excited about that."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! There is no Pirates of the Caribbean without their characters."
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree. This movie has something for everyone. A bit of the old and the new."
"__MOVIES__ At two hours and nine minutes, this has the shortest running time of all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed, it did feel shorter while I was watching it too."
"__MOVIES__ But I honestly couldn't feel the time passing. It's been six years since the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's been a long wait for all the fans."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's the largest gap between any of the Pirates of the Caribbean films."
"__MOVIES__ It was great to see Paul McCartney playing an interesting cameo!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I really enjoyed seeing him in this movie!"
"__MOVIES__ There were some sad moments during the movie too, don't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes there were. i found myself shedding a few tears on a couple of ocassions at least."
"__MOVIES__ But plenty of humor and funny dialogue too!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, wasn't it wonderful? I really loved this movie."
