"__MUSIC__ Do you play any instruments?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually yes. I played trumpet in the jazz band in high school."
"__MUSIC__ Trumpet?!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Does it seem out of character?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you're a quiet guy and trumpet is just so loud."
"__MUSIC__ My girlfriend at the time played alto sax."
"__MUSIC__ That makes a little more sense then. What sort of music did the jazz band play?"
"__MUSIC__ All sorts of things really. Mac the Knife, some Nat King Cole covers."
"__MUSIC__ That does sounds all over the place."
"__MUSIC__ There were some original compositions too."
"__MUSIC__ Were you guys any good?"
"__MUSIC__ We were awful."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad! It sound like you had fun though."
"__MUSIC__ We did. What about you? Do you play any instruments?"
"__MUSIC__ I tried to play the guitar for a couple years."
"__MUSIC__ Did you manage to play any songs?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of Smoke on the Water. You know, stuff that you play when you're first learning."
"__MUSIC__ You must have driven your parents insane."
"__MUSIC__ Probably. Let me know if you ever want to try a duet."
"__MUSIC__ I doubt that'll happen!"
