"__HORROR__ Did you ever see the Halloween movies?"
"__HORROR__ I've seen them.  Not a big fan though."
"__HORROR__ Oh, I thought Michael Myers was awesome."
"__HORROR__ I wouldn't want to meet him in the street, but there are scarier movies."
"__HORROR__ He is iconic though, right?"
"__HORROR__ Definately.  And the Halloween theme is downright awesome."
"__HORROR__ Oh yeah, the song is totally creepy."
"__HORROR__ Wasn't it a low budget film?"
"__HORROR__ I think it actually was.  Maybe independent when it came out."
"__HORROR__ Well, for being low budget, it didn't do bad."
