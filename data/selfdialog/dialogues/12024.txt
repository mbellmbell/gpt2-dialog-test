"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey can you smell that? It's in the air Fall is almost here and Football is in the air...Can you feel it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, I can feel it, the NFL train is near, all day Sunday, Sunday Night, Monday Night and don't forget Thursday's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love it all also. What is your favorite night?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Monday Nights."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, there is just something about continuing football from Sunday to Monday. I think the NFL got it right this time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the signature songs for these nights?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ they're really cool, I look forward to who's singing the new song every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know which teams will be playing the first Monday night game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure, I need to check my NFL schedule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are there any rookie players your looking forward to watching?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want to see what the rookie Running Back James Conner drafted by the Steelers heard he was a beast in college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll keep an eye out for him. They also have a new quarterback Dobbs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he has a great arm they could use a replacement I think Ben is getting old and slow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Boy, I would love to see the Steelers win another SuperBowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the rookie can show up Ben then they may get to the playoffs, not the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wishing thinking on my part, but the NFL is so unpredictable at times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right teams that made it to the playoff one year may not make it back there for years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love me some football, there's nothing better than the NFL.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could not have said it better..."
