"__SUPERHERO__ I think Chris Evans is the best looking Avenger."
"__SUPERHERO__ He does do a good job as Captain America, but not the best."
"__SUPERHERO__ Really?  Who would you say?"
"__SUPERHERO__ For me, I would say Robert Downey Jr."
"__SUPERHERO__ Wow.  That's a bit of a shock."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think it's his attitude and confidence.  I have to admit, it's kind of alluring."
"__SUPERHERO__ But Chris Evans looks like he lifts weights in his sleep."
"__SUPERHERO__ He probably does, but having huge muscles doesn't make you a superhero."
"__SUPERHERO__ Of course not.  Wearing a funny costume does."
"__SUPERHERO__ You got me there."
