"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, did you watch the NFL draft this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, I never miss it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the 49ers picks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the nailed it in the first few rounds. Solomon Thomas and Reuben Foster were excellent choices."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need something. They have been terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. Plus their quarterback situation is so different now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Kaepernick and Gabbert left and now all eyes are on Hoyer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he can do well for them, but there is still alot that is unknown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, I am really hoping the Falcons can keep it together and make it back to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not really a Falcons fan, but it was a very disappointing loss for them this past year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan deserves another shot at a ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I think he's been an excellent quarterback for many years, and deserves more recognition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but with Tom Brady still in the league, who knows."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady has dominated for too long. I think someone else should get the spotlight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he's won many rings. But if he's still healthy and successful, all power to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My eyes are on the Raiders. With Carr and Lynch, they are going to be interesting to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is definitely a lot of potential there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw an interview with Carr after it was announced that he would get the largest contract in history, and he talked about tithing and living the same way. I thought that was really cool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that is different. I hope he succeeds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. I think their team will go through alot of growth this year and in the years to come."
