"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see The Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was Great."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked that Darth Vadar was redeemed in the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wasn't it a shock to find out that he was both Leia and Luke's father?"
"__STAR_WARS__ But now that Luke and Leia know they are siblings, and have family, since the rest died."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course, Leia also has Han."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now Han can really be a big bother to Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Han will be a good father, or still be that brash guy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Leia should be a calming influence on him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet the kids will be a handful"
