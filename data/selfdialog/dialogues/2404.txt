"__MUSIC__ Hey, what do you think of the 'Despacito' song on the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ Ugh! Don't even talk to me!"
"__MUSIC__ What? It's a great song."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's a great song. But get Justin Bieber outta here!"
"__MUSIC__ My take on it is, he's bringing Latin music to a wider audience."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but he ruined the song! He can't even speak Spanish."
"__MUSIC__ Do you really thing the song would be as popular without Bieber?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe not, but good music doesn't have to be popular with every teenage girl."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, then, what's a Latin hit that the U.S. should be listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Chino & Nacho all the way. They're a Venezuelan group who have been popular in Latin America since 2008."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a song recommendation? I'd like to listen to more Latin music."
"__MUSIC__ 'Andas En Mi Cabeza' is a song they did with Daddy Yankee. 'Ni√±a Bonita' is another favorite of mine."
"__MUSIC__ I think actually I've heard those with my Colombian friends."
"__MUSIC__ Probably! They're very popular in Colombia too."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so I'll drop the Bieber version of 'Despacito' and listen to some better music."
"__MUSIC__ You better!"
"__MUSIC__ What other genres of Latin American music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I lived in Ecuador for a few years, so I like traditional Andean music. Check out 'Maria Chun Chun'!"
"__MUSIC__ I'd like to get to know the hits and more regional music, as well."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good take on it. People listen to a mix of everything!"
