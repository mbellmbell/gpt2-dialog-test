"__POP__ what's your second favorite pop singer?"
"__POP__ well, you know my first was Avril Lavigne right?"
"__POP__ yea, you've told me about that before"
"__POP__ so I think the second position in my heart belongs to Taylor Swift, to be honest I'm not quite sure what her genere is anymore"
"__POP__ yeah, she transformed herself from a country girl style to pop star, definitely a good move to make more money, haha"
"__POP__ umm, that's a valid point, but also I think she's getting more mature and don't live in that fairy tale style country music any more?"
"__POP__ that could be a valid point as well. But anyway, in the end it's the music that matters"
"__POP__ I used to listen to her Love Story and You Belong With Me"
"__POP__ I got to know Taylor Swift by listening to You Belong With Me"
"__POP__ yeah, me too. That was a very popular song"
