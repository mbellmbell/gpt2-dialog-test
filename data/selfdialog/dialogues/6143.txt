"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think Star Wars never has a solid family unit?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Luke had one in the beginning of Epsiode 6."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but his family was quickly killed. So was Leia's."
"__STAR_WARS__ It does seem like parents are always dying, doesn't it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't think of a single family unit that stays together."
"__STAR_WARS__ They continued the trend in the new movies as well. Anakin leaves his mom and she later dies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and Rey doesn't have parents either."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if maybe its just too hard to let the protagonist run off to adventures if there is someone keeping tabs on them."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is a valid point, but you would think at least one character would at least have both parents until adulthood."
"__STAR_WARS__ Technically, Han and Leia both survive until their child is an adult, not that it turns out particularly well for them..."
