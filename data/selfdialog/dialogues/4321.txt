"__MUSIC__ What decade had the worst music?"
"__MUSIC__ Are we talking of all time, or in our lifetimes?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's say in the past 100 years."
"__MUSIC__ Good, because otherwise I'd probably say some decade during like 4000 BC!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, i bet the music wasn't too good then, haha. But in the past 100 years."
"__MUSIC__ I'd have to go with the 70s."
"__MUSIC__ Not a big Disco fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Disco was terrible! Some of the corniest music around."
"__MUSIC__ What about Stayin' Alive? I Will Survive?"
"__MUSIC__ Those are some decent songs, I guess, but not among my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Or what about YMCA? That song is always fun at stadiums!"
"__MUSIC__ If you're basing your defense of an entire decade's music off a song being fun at stadiums, then I rest my case."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough, but there were some good bands making music in the 70s."
"__MUSIC__ Name some!"
"__MUSIC__ Led Zepplin was active in the 70s. Pink Floyd, Aerosmith."
"__MUSIC__ Aerosmith is not a good band, and Pink Floyd did a lot of their best stuff in the 60s."
"__MUSIC__ Either way, there was some good music in the 70s."
"__MUSIC__ You're right, but there's some good music done in every decade. Just a lot more bad stuff in the 70s."
"__MUSIC__ I can see your point, but I have some fond memories of 70s music."
"__MUSIC__ For sure, there are a few gems. But overall, bottom decade for music, in my opinion."
