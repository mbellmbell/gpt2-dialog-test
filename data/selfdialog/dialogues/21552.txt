"__DISNEY__ I need help finding a good DIsney movie"
"__DISNEY__ Do you like the ones with princesses or not?"
"__DISNEY__ Not really, I have a young son so he's not into that"
"__DISNEY__ Oh okay. Try watching Toy Story and see if he likes it"
"__DISNEY__ I think he will love it!"
"__DISNEY__ If he enjoys it, there's like 3 more to watch!"
"__DISNEY__ He will start to think his toys are alive like Woody though"
"__DISNEY__ That's normal though, every kid does that!"
"__DISNEY__ Be sure to get him some toys that were used in the movie"
"__DISNEY__ Good idea! I'll look online for a Woody doll and maybe Buzz too!"
