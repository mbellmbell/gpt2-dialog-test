"__MOVIES__ So, have you heard about the next Jurassic movie they're working on?"
"__MOVIES__ What about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, apparently they're doing Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Guess who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Jeff Goldblum?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! They announced that he has joined the project!"
"__MOVIES__ Sweet! I loved him in the first two movies."
"__MOVIES__ Jurassic Park was epic. I really don't think there will ever be another movie like that."
"__MOVIES__ It was the favorite movie for an entire generation of kids."
"__MOVIES__ Jeff Goldblum is famous for so many lines from that movie."
"__MOVIES__ 'Life, uh, finds away'."
"__MOVIES__ So what did you think of Lost World?"
"__MOVIES__ I have to admit, it really wasn't as good as the first one."
"__MOVIES__ A lot of people felt that way, actually."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad I'm not the only one."
"__MOVIES__ I actually thought there were some really good scenes in Lost World, though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really? Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Like when the RV gets pushed over the cliff."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. That was actually a good scene."
"__MOVIES__ The part with the long grass was pretty scary, too."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I see your point."
