"__MUSIC__ Let's talk about heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, let's do it!"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of it recently. Lots of good stuff out there."
"__MUSIC__ You don't strike me as a big metal guy."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not, but every now and then I'll go through a phase."
"__MUSIC__ Who are you into recently?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of this band from France called Gojira."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them, never listened to them though."
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty good. Mostly faster stuff, growly vocals, very clean sounding."
"__MUSIC__ Do they sing in French?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it's all in English. I actually held off on checking them out for a while because I thought that metal lyrics in French would sound kind of goofy."
"__MUSIC__ Who else have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ This isn't the most original answer, but Mastodon's new album is pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? I thought they were kind of past their prime now."
"__MUSIC__ They're definitely a bit past their prime, but the new album is a big improvement over their last couple of albums."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. I'll have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ The drummer sings a lot on this one."
"__MUSIC__ Bummer! I'm not really a fan of his singing."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I kind of like it."
"__MUSIC__ I just like it more when Mastodon gets a little more growly and mean, and the drummer's voice is so high."
