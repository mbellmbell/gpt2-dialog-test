"__MOVIES__ You know, when I was a kid, I thought the Pink Panther movies were supposed to be cartoons?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, because of the little shorts before the actual film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I had no idea the actual film revolved around the Pink Panther diamond and that's where the title came from!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the remake with Steve Martin?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It actually is not bad."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like it more than the original?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that. The original is dated, but it is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ It's better than Son of the Pink Panther for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Steve Martin's Pink Panther 2 is better than that, and it isn't even a good movie at all!"
"__MOVIES__ Hehe. I guess a lot of the Pink Panther films aren't so great."
"__MOVIES__ That's what happens to any long running franchise. Just look at Nightmare on Elm Street for example."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, or better yet Friday the 13th. Those movies had an even bigger decline than their Freddy based counterpart."
"__MOVIES__ Saw had that problem too. Except with Saw 6. That one was actually surprisingly good."
"__MOVIES__ At least all the Saw movies went to theaters. After the 4th Hellraiser movie, which was supposed to be the last, they just started releasing them straight to video."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's not just horror movies that suffer declines like this, but they're easy to point out because when they get big they put a new one out every year."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of which, they actually are bring Saw back!"
"__MOVIES__ Is it a reboot?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe a little, but it's going to continue the story of the original films."
"__MOVIES__ Then hopefully it can reverse the trend of movies in long franchises going downhill and be genuinely good."
"__MOVIES__ That, and I hope we get another Pink Panther film someday!"
