"__MUSIC__ Do you know the song, 'Nights in White Satin'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ I was listening to it the other night and I got to thinking...I have no idea what that song is about!"
"__MUSIC__ Who cares! It's the Moody Blues!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, when I listen to it, I seem to slip into some kind of a mystical funk, or a depressed fog of emotions."
"__MUSIC__ OK. Did you skip breakfast?"
"__MUSIC__ Come on. man! I'm serious!"
"__MUSIC__ OK. Ok."
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics talk of love, letters that were written, but unsent, as well as emotional pain."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's a song of regret. Lost love or something."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense I guess. The guy must have taken the girl for granted because he sings about about how how he somehow missed beauty with his eyes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and he also says something about not knowing what the truth is anymore. Perhaps, as time has gone on, he is not so certain as to why they broke up in the first place."
"__MUSIC__ Makes sense. And he sings about how people walking hand-in-hand can't understand how he feels, which probably means he feels alone in his sorrow and that those still in relationship can't understand his heart ache."
"__MUSIC__ I think you got a handle on it!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but what I can't figure out is what's with the white satin?"
"__MUSIC__ He spend nights in white satin."
"__MUSIC__ Does that have some deep meaning about the afterlife, or angels, or some ethereal plane?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Maybe his ex girlfriend picked out the satin sheets, and he is till paying them off..."
"__MUSIC__ HIgh interest rate credit card!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. We're good."
