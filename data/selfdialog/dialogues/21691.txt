"__DISNEY__ Hey, have you seen the Jungle Book?"
"__DISNEY__ Which one? The animated one or the newer, live-action one?"
"__DISNEY__ They're both amazing, but I meant the newer one."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I just watched it with my family last week!"
"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite part? Did you have a favorite character?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought the temple scene with all the monkeys, the orangutan, Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera!"
"__DISNEY__ Did you mean King Louie and where Baloo and Bagheera have to rescue Mowgli?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I couldn't remember the orangutan's name - Louie!"
"__DISNEY__ Did you find Shere Khan scary?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I managed to act cool about it, but my little brother screamed at least once. He's really scared of being eaten by lions or tigers."
