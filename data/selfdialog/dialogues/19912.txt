"__MOVIES__ Hi, Geoff, what are you watching?"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, Zebadiah, I'm watching The Lord of the Rings"
"__MOVIES__ Nice, which of the three are you watching?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm watching the Fellowship of the Ring, extended version?"
"__MOVIES__ Extended version, what's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a longer version of the movie, it has like 30 more minutes of movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, I didn't know that there was an extended version."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it adds some background information and other things to the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do the other two movies also have extended versions?"
"__MOVIES__ They sure do!"
"__MOVIES__ Thats cool, so do the extended versions match up to the books better?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, kind of."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they provide some more details that were given in the books, but weren't really necessary to the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok, so basically this is just the stuff that the director wanted to add back to it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess he figured that some people might want to see more."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good idea.  I wonder if they release two versions to a lot of movies."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard of a few, but not too many."
"__MOVIES__ It would be awesome if they did that with the original Star Wars movies."
"__MOVIES__ That would be cool,but I doubt they filmed stuff they didn't use."
