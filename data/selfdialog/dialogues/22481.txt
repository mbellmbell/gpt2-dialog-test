"__DISNEY__ When I was in high school Disney re-released some of their iconic animated movies."
"__DISNEY__ I remember that. Did you see many of them?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw a lot of them. I recall going to The Jungle Book with a boy I had a crush on."
"__DISNEY__ That must have been fun."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I didn't know he was bringing three of his little nephews with us so it wasn't the romantic outing I had hoped for."
"__DISNEY__ But you enjoyed the movie, yes?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, of course! How can one not enjoy a Disney film?"
"__DISNEY__ Did you see the live action version of it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but I hear Idris Elba was good."
"__DISNEY__ He was, and I adore the song .... Bear Necessities!"
