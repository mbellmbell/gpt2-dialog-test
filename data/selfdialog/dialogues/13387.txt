"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you like to see win a Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be nice if the Bengals or Panthers would win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's interesting - I would not have pegged your for a fan of either team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I always root for the underdog - I like both teams.  I live in North Carolina now and I grew up in Cinncinati, Ohio."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What would be your favorite Super Bowl matchup?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Panthers versus the Patriots would make a great game again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you're right, good pairing of quarterbacks.  That would be a cool rematch to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been to a Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, my company got some tickets to Super Bowl XXXVIII, hence my interest in Pats vs. Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where did you have seats at Super Bowl XXXVIII?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We were right on the 50 yard line - I only wish the Panthers had won!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they will at some point - Cam Newton could do it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have season tickets to Panthers games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't, but I occasionally purchase tickets from a friend of mine if he isn't going - I usually go to around four games a year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's awesome - great stadium too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Indeed it is - I really enjoy games there - the hot dogs too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have a subscription and ever watch NFL gamepass?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely - that way I can pick and choose what to watch on game days - very versatile."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might think about getting that - I enjoy the NFL enough that it might be worth it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think NFL gamepass is definitely worth it - almost as good as being there!"
