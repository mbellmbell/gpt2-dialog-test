"__POP__ There was a new article yesterday about an interview with Louis Tomlinson, who used to be in One Direction."
"__POP__ Is he putting out new music?"
"__POP__ Yes, it said he's working on a second single that should be coming out soon."
"__POP__ His first solo single did really well, I think it was number two on the charts or something like that."
"__POP__ Most of the article was him whining about how the music biz people are much more interested in Harry Styles, and how he always gets ignored."
"__POP__ Wow, a little jealousy going on there, huh?"
"__POP__ A lot of jealousy- how he can't get a hit songwriter to write for him, but Harry doesn't have that problem. How he was always stuck in the back row of One Direction, and was the only one to never get solos."
"__POP__ It's not Harry's fault if he's a better singer, or more charasmatic and all the girls like him."
"__POP__ He also spoke about how he could see he was forgettable sometimes, and how when his mom died, he didn't have her to comfort him anymore when he questioned his ability."
"__POP__ Well, that sounds like he knows he's not as popular or as good as Harry, but there's no excuse to have a chip on his shoulder about Harry's popularity."
