"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about Durant moving to Golden State?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm pretty sure he just wants a ring and this is his easiest path to get one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. I agree."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm also not sure how well he'll integrate into their system."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's a big that they needed though."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true, their size is a detriment at times."
"__BASKETBALL__ Especially against LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ohh, that stings; 3-1."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not sure how they'll ever get over that."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's going to be tough."
"__BASKETBALL__ Going 73-9 doesn't mean a thing if you ain't got that ring."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, still impressive what they did last year though."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think I've won 73 anything in my life."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me neither."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who did Cleveland lose though?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Deli, but that's about it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Man, that team is stacked too."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's really a two race team this season."
"__BASKETBALL__ So much for parity in the NBA."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yup, crazy."
