"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best running back in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adrian Peterson!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This isn't 2012, man. AP is pretty old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about Ezekiel Elliot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a great rookie season last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was electric."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be a little nervous about saying a 2nd year player is the best in the league, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The position is a young man's position, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with that. But what about the Cowboys' offensive line?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, they are really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes a lot of players look good, running behind a line like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So if not Elliot, then who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Jordan Howard?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of the Bears?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Another second year player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a nice surprise, but I think Elliot is the clearly superior talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jordan Howard had nothing going for him, though. The Bears offense was basically just him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was pretty much their only weapon, true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I give a player a lot of credit for that."
