"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Kendrick Lamar?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he's good, not sure if he's as amazing as everyone says."
"__MUSIC__ Oh? I think he's amazing. Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ I just don't see what he's doing that hasn't been done before."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if he's completely changing the game, but you have to admit he is unique."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose. Unique does not equal great, though."
"__MUSIC__ True, but Kendrick has great lyrics, great technique and mass appeal."
"__MUSIC__ There are a couple of tracks I like, like 'Swimming Pools.'"
"__MUSIC__ 'Swimming Pools' is great because it's a deep and thought-provoking song disguised as a mindless club hit."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I kind of get that."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think about 'HUMBLE.' his recent single?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's fine. Nothing special."
"__MUSIC__ 'HUMBLE.' is interesting because it's the opposite of 'Swimming Pools.'"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, 'Swimming Pools' is a deep song that sounds like a mindless song, while 'HUMBLE.' is a mindless song that sounds deep."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you just kind of assume all Kendrick Lamar songs have deep meanings."
"__MUSIC__ If you listen to the lyrics, 'HUMBLE.' is basically just Kendrick bragging about how awesome he is. Not much to it."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I should listen more closely to his lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ He's very clever in the way that he puts things together."
"__MUSIC__ I'll keep that in mind."
