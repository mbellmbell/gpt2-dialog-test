"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite soundtrack?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh, the first thing that comes to mind is Titanic..."
"__MUSIC__ You're awful. Titanic? Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Shut up - the single with Celine Dion made me cry."
"__MUSIC__ I think the movie made you cry. That song-"
"__MUSIC__ -perfectly enhanced the emotion of the film!"
"__MUSIC__ Sure."
"__MUSIC__ Shush. Anyway my other two favorites are Hackers and... The Matrix?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Celine Dion and electronica? That's a clash."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Celine Dion's an outlier. And I liked 90s electronica. Got me motivated."
"__MUSIC__ I was addicted to Dragula."
"__MUSIC__ Rob Zombie's intense. I don't like any of his other stuff but yeah Dragula in The Matrix had me loving him for a second."
"__MUSIC__ Fluke was good in the sequel."
"__MUSIC__ I choreographed a dance to Fluke. That was an awesome one! What about you? - with soundtracks, I mean."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of like scores, so Lord of the Rings wins it for me."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, interesting! If you like atmospheric stuff, have you heard of Massive Attack?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! They're great."
"__MUSIC__ If you like Massive Attack, you should try out Four Tet. Very similar."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, awesome. I'll check them out."
"__MUSIC__ They've got a lot of albums - I loved Rounds, though, personally."
