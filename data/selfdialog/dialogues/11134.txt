"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are you feeling about the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great! I'm so excited to see the Cowboys dominate again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you sure they're going to be as great as they were last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, why wouldn't they be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Cowboys actually have a lot going against them this year in comparison to the amazing season they had last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like what? I'm not sure what you're talking about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, for starters, I think Dek Prescott isn't going to have nearly as good of a season as last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not like he's injured or anything. He's going to be great just like he has been."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of quarterbacks regress a good deal in their second NFL season as defenses adjust to them. Remember Colin Kaepernick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a fair point. But it's only speculation, and one reason at that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Cowboys also lost a great deal of players on defense. I think 4 of the starters in the secondary left during free agency?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow. I know we had people leave in the off-season but I didn't realize it was that many."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the Cowboys corners and safetys aren't looking that great. Which is scary considering everyone in the NFC East really upgraded their receiving corps this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cornerback is one of those positions where a star can emerge at any time. I'm sure we'll see some talent develop throughout the course of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still though, I wouldn't expect the same kind of regular season record as last year. They've also lost two of their starters from the offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not good. That line was one of the best in the league. Top five last year I'd say!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. However, when you have young playmakers like Ekeziel Elliott sometimes you can afford to have gaps in talent at other positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is so fun to watch. The Cowboys are never out of a game when he's playing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! It's going to be a great season to watch the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And to watch them in the Super Bowl hopefully!"
