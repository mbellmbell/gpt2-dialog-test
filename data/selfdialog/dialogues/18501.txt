"__MOVIES__ So, you seen any good movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I've been on a Pixar binge recently."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love their films!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Though they haven't been as good recently."
"__MOVIES__ True. What's your favourite."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I have at least three--but I really like Wall-e."
"__MOVIES__ Wall-e is so cute!"
"__MOVIES__ I actually know a guy that worked on the animation."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's neat. I'm amazed by how much information about the characters they gave you with so little dialogue."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's hard to believe Wall-e never says a word except 'eva.'"
"__MOVIES__ It's the very definition of showing and not telling in film."
"__MOVIES__ I remember going to see it; it's actually the first Pixar film I saw in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding? That's cool. What are the other two?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, out of the newer ones I thought Inside Out was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness, I cried so much. It was a great representation of what depression feels like."
"__MOVIES__ And I loved how they validated both the importance of Joy and Sadness together."
"__MOVIES__ The music, by Giacchino, was a real tear jerker too."
"__MOVIES__ And then the third favourite Pixar film is Toy Story 3."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I wept during that one. My older brother was going off to college that year."
"__MOVIES__ Aw, that's so sweet. It's such a good conclusion to Toy Story."
