"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been following the NFL in the offseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A little. Mainly just until the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The draft had a few surprises."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some, but I'd say the biggest surprise was Mitchell Trubisky going so high!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I would've thought Deshaun Watson would've been ahead of him for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. Watson was the third quarterback chosen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't expect that at all. I was also a little surprised by Reuben Foster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's a great talent obviously, but he left the combine because he got into a fight!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right. I forgot about that. Well, sometimes teams are willing to take a chance to get a great player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's part of the reason we get such bad role models in sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately it's about the money usually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but it seems like if a guy can't even handle a combine he's just going to be a problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think we kind of saw that with Colin Kapernick. He wasn't doing anything bad per se, but he didn't make life easier for his team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. And now he isn't being picked up because of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if that's the whole reason. He really hasn't been that impressive as a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but combine that with the fact that any team that takes him is going to have to deal with political issues and it doesn't bode well for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right. At least it hasn't so far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be interesting to see if he gets back in if someone gets hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure which team would be willing to give him a try."
