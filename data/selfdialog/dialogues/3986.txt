"__MUSIC__ Are you listening to Queen? I love Freddie!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah Freddie Mercury was awesome or should I call him Farrokh?"
"__MUSIC__ Farrokh??? why ??"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah his real name was Farrokh Bulsara, he was actually born in India and adopted the name Freddie."
"__MUSIC__ I know he was the one naming Queen as the band name and was meant to shock and sound regal at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song from Queen?"
"__MUSIC__ Mine is Crazy little thing called love, fun fact...he composed it in a bath. Freddy got inspired by everything."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah England got that one right, they are so proud they even honored the band by releasing a postage stamp in a commemorative gesture."
"__MUSIC__ I would love to have one of those, I bet they are very rare these days."
"__MUSIC__ Queen was an extraordinary singer, they don't make singers like him anymore. He was a know as a tenor but was actually a baritone."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow I did not know that one!! I knew his voice was amazing just not how amazing it was."
"__MUSIC__ Queen as a band was amazing in so many levels. Plus they were graduated in many different areas, Brian was May studied astrophysics, Roger Taylor was trying to be a dentist and I know John Deacon was an Engineer in electronics."
"__MUSIC__ Freddie was graduated in Arts if I'm not mistaken."
"__MUSIC__ They were born to succeed. It was a terrible loss for music he day Freddie passed."
"__MUSIC__ I was very young, didn't have the chance to see them live. Freddie died in 1991 and that was the end of it all. I would give anything to see a show with the whole band."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it was very sad, he left this world too early."
"__MUSIC__ He left his boyfriend and his ex wife, both broken hearted."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah who wouldn't be? Freddie had a very short but intense life."
"__MUSIC__ At least he left us with that amazing collection of music that we can hear forever."
"__MUSIC__ Bless him for that!"
