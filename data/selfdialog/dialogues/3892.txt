"__MUSIC__ Do you like Pink Floyd?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard much, but I like what I've heard."
"__MUSIC__ What Pink Floyd stuff have you listened to?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Dark Side of the Moon', of course, and 'The Wall'."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, the two most famous albums and so different!"
"__MUSIC__ They really are different aren't they? Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Both the bassist and guitarist wrote for Pink Floyd, and 'The Wall' is primarily the bassist's writing."
"__MUSIC__ And 'Dark Side of the Moon'?"
"__MUSIC__ That was more written by the whole band, if I recall correctly."
"__MUSIC__ That's my favorite of the two, if I had to pick."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's everyone's favorite. It's just an incredible album."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever done the Wizard of Oz thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Where you sync the album up to the movie? I have, actually!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh! What happened?"
"__MUSIC__ There are definitely some weird coincidences."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ There are times when the lyrics perfectly describe what's happening on scene, or the 'feel' of the music matches."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's creepy. Do you think it's intentional?"
"__MUSIC__ No way, not at all. That seems like a lot of work for what ends up as minor coincidences."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. I always thought people who think they wrote the album to match the film are a bit crazy."
