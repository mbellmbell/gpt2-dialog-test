"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about foreign films?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it really depends."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there are so many different factors. I can't understand the language, so the actor has to be great!"
"__MOVIES__ Any preferences? How about French films?"
"__MOVIES__ With French films, I feel I'm always missing important symbolism."
"__MOVIES__ Okay what about Dutch?"
"__MOVIES__ Dutch films are easier to follow, but they all feel oddly American. I like Japanese movies."
"__MOVIES__ Really how come?"
"__MOVIES__ Well all movies from East Asia have their own style and flair."
"__MOVIES__ I recently saw this East German film about a struggling pop star."
"__MOVIES__ And does it take place in East Germany?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's called Solo Sunny, and it's really sad. And weird."
"__MOVIES__ Like most East German films I would imagine!"
"__MOVIES__ There are also these really cool rubble films from the 1940s in Germany."
"__MOVIES__ What are those? Films about rubble?"
"__MOVIES__ No, silly, they're movies made after the war. They couldn't hide the debris."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds really interesting."
"__MOVIES__ They are really well made. You should check out 'A Murderer Amongst Us.'"
"__MOVIES__ Thanks, I will!"
