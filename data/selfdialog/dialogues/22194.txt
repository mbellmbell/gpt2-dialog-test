"__DISNEY__ Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Mulan would take the cake."
"__DISNEY__ Ewww, why?"
"__DISNEY__ I just think they did a great job showing gender inequality in the army."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, the Chinese army back in the day!"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, but then they showed how no matter what gender you are, you can contribute and make a difference."
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm, I never thought of it like that."
"__DISNEY__ I think Mulan had more guts than any of the men out there."
"__DISNEY__ How can you possibly say that?"
"__DISNEY__ She was willing to sacrifice everything to take her fathers place in the army, that is called fortitude."
