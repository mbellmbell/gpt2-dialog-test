"__DISNEY__ I can never watch The Fox and the Hound ever again."
"__DISNEY__ Did you watch it recently?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I watched it yesterday."
"__DISNEY__ Why can't you ever watch it again?"
"__DISNEY__ I forgot how sad it was."
"__DISNEY__ What part is sad?"
"__DISNEY__ First off, when Tod's mom dies."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I remember that. It's awful!"
"__DISNEY__ Also, when Tod's owner leaves him in the forest. I bawled my eyes out."
"__DISNEY__ I probably shouldn't watch that movie anytime soon! I'm not up for a sad movie like that."
