"__MOVIES__ I just saw Passengers at the movie theaters. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't. Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea! I loved it!"
"__MOVIES__ That's that one with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, they make a great team. Great actors!"
"__MOVIES__ Was anyone else in the movie or just them?"
"__MOVIES__ There was that British 'Sheen' guy. I forget his first name."
"__MOVIES__ Michael?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, him. And, Lawrence Fishbourne or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I like him too. Morpheus!"
"__MOVIES__ Yea he's a great actor as well."
"__MOVIES__ Don't spoil it for me, but what's it basically about? The trailer is pretty vague."
"__MOVIES__ Chris Pratt's character wakes up too early from cryo-sleep, like almost a century too early."
"__MOVIES__ What, and he's stuck on the spaceship by himself?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, but there's plenty of things for him to do and a realistic robot to talk to."
"__MOVIES__ And Jennifer's character wakes up too early too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but her circumstances were different."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ That, I'm not gonna tell you! You just have to go see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok, yea I don't want any spoilers."
