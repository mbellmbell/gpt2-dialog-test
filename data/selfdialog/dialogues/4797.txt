"__MUSIC__ Who do you prefer: NSYNC or Backstreet Boys?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely the Backstreet Boys."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Aside from I Want It That Way, all of their songs are terrible."
"__MUSIC__ I really enjoyed Quit Playing Games (With My Heart), Everybody (Backstreet's Back), and Larger Than Life."
"__MUSIC__ I forgot about Larger Than Life. That was a good song too I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. So why are you so adamant about NSYNC being better?"
"__MUSIC__ Aside from the greatness that was the album No Strings Attached, I think Justin Timberlake was far and away the most talented person in either boy band."
"__MUSIC__ I think that is undeniable, but I would say that Justin Timberlake's best work came later during his solo career."
"__MUSIC__ Very true. I think that Cry Me A River is the best breakup song ever recorded."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I much preferred his song What Goes Around...Comes Around."
"__MUSIC__ I just found it too much of a copy of Cry Me A River to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ To each their own. Did you know the rumor that Cry Me A River was reportedly about Timberlake's Relationship with Britney Spears?"
"__MUSIC__ No, although that does make sense now that you mention it. Speaking of Britney Spears, what has she been up to recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Aside from a residency in Las Vegas, she released some new music last year."
"__MUSIC__ Anything that I might recognize?"
"__MUSIC__ She released the song Make Me..., which featured G-Eazy."
"__MUSIC__ I think that I know who G-Eazy is. He has that song Me, Myself & I, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really the girl who sings the chorus to that song. Who is she again?"
"__MUSIC__ Bebe Rexha."
"__MUSIC__ That's the name. I really like her single I Got You."
