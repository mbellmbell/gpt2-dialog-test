"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite NFL player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tough to say, current or all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Current first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow that's really tough. I would have to say Odell Beckham."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a bad choice I suppose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why who would you pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Im joining the AP train."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adrian Peterson? What has he done recently?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just you wait and see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We've all been waiting for a few years now, he hasn't been the same since the scandal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He hasn't been on the right team either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think he is now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Saints are a better place for him to showcase his talents."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but he is never going to be the same he used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't know that, you only like Beckham because he's popular now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not true, I like Beckham because he makes incredible plays look easy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Almost none of those look easy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The way he catches those balls they sure do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least Peterson is a tough guy who can take a hit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh would you stop it, Beckham can take a hit too."
