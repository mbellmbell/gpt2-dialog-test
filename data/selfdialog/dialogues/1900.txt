"__MUSIC__ I'm bored. Let's go see a show."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds fun! Any idea who's playing a show in town tonight?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I heard K. Flay is doing a set at a bar downtown."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of K. Flay. Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ She's a rapper. She's pretty great."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds cool. Does she have any songs I would have heard?"
"__MUSIC__ I kind of doubt it. She's pretty indie."
"__MUSIC__ I'm excited to check out something new then."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think you'll really like her. She makes most of her own beats, too."
"__MUSIC__ That's so cool! I'm always on the lookout for more lady musicians in hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ There are some really great ones if you know where to look."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Women don't get enough credit in art and music."
"__MUSIC__ Too true. I've been on a kick lately where I'm only listening to female artists."
"__MUSIC__ What a good idea! Can you recommend any more to me?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! Have you listened to Nova Rockafeller yet?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't. Tell me more?"
"__MUSIC__ She's another awesome indie rapper that I think would be right up your alley."
"__MUSIC__ That's great. Does she remind you of anyone else I'd know?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, to be honest. I thought of her because I think she and K. Flay have a similar style, actually."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see. I guess I'll really have to pay attention at the show tonight."
