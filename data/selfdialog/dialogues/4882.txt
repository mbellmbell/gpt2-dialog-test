"__MUSIC__ Who do you think is the best R&B artist around?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he's not strictly R&B but it's gotta be Frank Ocean."
"__MUSIC__ He's my pick too. Dude has got talent."
"__MUSIC__ So much talent. Hasn't put out a dud yet."
"__MUSIC__ Well, everyone likes Channel Orange, but the story is a bit different for Blonde."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people don't connect with it. It's too difficult or weird or whatever."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's not straight up poppy R&B in the way people were expecting."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I think people really wanted that one gigantic single like Think of U and they didn't get it."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good point and why I'm thinking that he's the best sometimes R&B artist. He has songs on Blonde that sound like The Shins."
"__MUSIC__ So true. White Ferrari has moments that could be off Oh Inverted World by The Shins."
"__MUSIC__ It's weird because I was thinking it was gonna be similar to Little Red Corvette."
"__MUSIC__ Nope! Not at all."
"__MUSIC__ Not at all. Although, I will say for certain that Prince is a great influence on Frank."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's mentioned it in interviews before."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've read some. After Prince passed away last year, Frank Ocean posted 'When You Were Mine' by Prince on Tumblr."
"__MUSIC__ That's an absolute gem of a song that not too many people know."
"__MUSIC__ But back to Blonde, there are songs on there where Frank does really odd things with pitching vocals."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like Nikes is not a radio track at all."
"__MUSIC__ At all, but I'm really glad to see he's doing what's pleasing his artistic sense."
