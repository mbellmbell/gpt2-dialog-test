"__MUSIC__ My favorite film composer is Hans Zimmer. I know that Williams is more popular, but he is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't ring a bell, what did he do?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he is most known for the Lion King Soundtrack, but he has composed such a variety of pieces."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I thought that was Elton John"
"__MUSIC__ John did the songs, but Zimmer composed the music like the 'Naaa sa venya!'"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I like that score, what else is he known for?"
"__MUSIC__ TONS of music! He did Gladiator, Inception, The Dark Knight, you name it!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok! I know who you're talking about. He is really good, I liked Gladiator and that Inception Music"
"__MUSIC__ He is known for those, but he does all sorts of work with his group Media Ventures, you'll here his guys doing all kinds of music."
"__MUSIC__ Like Pirates of the Carribean?"
"__MUSIC__ His buddy Klaus Badeldt did the first one, but the sequels are all Zimmer. His group scored Iron Man, Game of Thones, and everything Ridley Scott has done"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I'm gonna have to look him up."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite scores by him are actually his less known pieces."
"__MUSIC__ I see he did Driving Miss Daisy, I don't remember the music from that movie at all though..."
"__MUSIC__ If you hear it, you'll recognize it."
"__MUSIC__ Also Rain Man and Black Hawk Down, those were good movies."
"__MUSIC__ He's changed his style over time, those earlier ones were scores where he used a lot of theme, but later he went more minimalist."
"__MUSIC__ Minimalist?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, where the themes are reduced to simple progressions like The Joker Theme in the Dark Knight."
"__MUSIC__ Like Phillip Glass?"
