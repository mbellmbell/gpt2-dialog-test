"__MUSIC__ Who do you like that is kind of like Billy Joel?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?    Why not just listen to him?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Billy Joel has not released anything new in a number of years."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, isn't he still touring and selling out Madison Square Garden?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Billy Joel is playing concerts, but has not released anything new in twenty years or more."
"__MUSIC__ That is a long time.     I guess you are asking about piano-based pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that is one direction I would be interested in."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there is always Elton John."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he is a great piano player, and I know much of his albums through Duets and that Disney soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ OK.      He has released two or three new discs in the last few years that are pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Great, I will check them out.      Who else?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there is always Leon Russell, who was kind of a hero to both of them."
"__MUSIC__ I know a little of his work.     He's that old white-haired guy with the long beard?"
"__MUSIC__ That is the one.     He was quite popular in the late sixties."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that.     Where can I see him."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he played with George Harrison and Bob Dylan in that tribute concert."
"__MUSIC__ Which Tribute?     That was well before Live Aid, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, something like 1972.      You cannot miss him."
"__MUSIC__ I will check it out!    Do you remember the name?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was The Concert for Bangladesh.     The picture is of a starving Indian or African kid.     Quite sad."
