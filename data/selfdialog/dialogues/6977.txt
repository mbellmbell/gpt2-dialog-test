"__STAR_WARS__ So what do you think of the new Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're okay, I've only seen one of the new ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I feel the same lukewarm way."
"__STAR_WARS__ It just isn't the same without George Lucas directing them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and now everything is computer-generated, so it gives it a cheap and fake look."
"__STAR_WARS__ I miss the miniatures and models they used on the first trilogy too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Were you surprised that they killed off Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Unfortunately I knew that outcome going in, as someone spoiled it for me online."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hate when that happens because it ruins a good chunk of the story."
"__STAR_WARS__ I still enjoyed the movie actually, but it definitely didn't shock me like it did to some other moviegoers."
