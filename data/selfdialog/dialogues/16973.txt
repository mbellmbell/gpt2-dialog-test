"__MOVIES__ Would you consider alien invasion movies war movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They're completely different. No way, man."
"__MOVIES__ Think about it though, they're really similar types of films."
"__MOVIES__ Just because they show two opposing forces fighting each other doesn't make them war films."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Alien invasion movies are usually escapism. War movies are closer to horror films if anything."
"__MOVIES__ Oh so, they're not similar to alien invasion, but they are similar to horror. Yet I'm all wrong?"
"__MOVIES__ Let me explain. Both horror films and war films are meant to disturb you and show you the dark side of humanity."
"__MOVIES__ If that's the case, then we may as well throw in zombie movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh boy. Here we go."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, if it's all about the darkness inside us, then zombie movies fit perfectly. After all, the real monster is man."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you're saying, but war movies are about the brutality of battle. Zombie movies are about the selfishness of man."
"__MOVIES__ And wars are fought over selfish reasons."
"__MOVIES__ But that's not the point of war movies. War movies are meant to show the effects of fighting on the common solider."
"__MOVIES__ And that's like horror films how, again?"
"__MOVIES__ In most horror films, we see random people hunted by an evil force. In war movies, random soldiers are hunted by an opposing force."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I guess I see where you're coming from."
"__MOVIES__ Glad we could reach an agreement."
"__MOVIES__ Not so fast; in alien invasion movies, random people are hunted by an evil, opposing force. They're both war and horror movies all in one."
"__MOVIES__ Shoot, you've used my own logic against me. I still disagree though."
