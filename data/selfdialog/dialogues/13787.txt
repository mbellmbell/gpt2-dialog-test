"__BASKETBALL__ Have you seen the Arizona Diamondbacks this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, I watched yesterday in San Diego.  What do you think of the catcher who got hit by a pitch a few weeks back?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It was pretty amazing that he came back and hit a home run in his first game."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, it was pretty phenomenal.  Do you think the pitcher hit him on purpose?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I believe these guys are professionals and have great control but in the same sense they are human."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, humans make errors but something in my gut says it was on purpose."
"__BASKETBALL__ I too feel it was intentional even though he says it was an accident."
"__BASKETBALL__ How do you feel the Diamondbacks are doing this season?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I like their chances this year to at least make the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too, they are playing some pretty good ball and as long as they keep playing as a team, they will be fine"
"__BASKETBALL__ How about the Baltimore Orioles in the American league.  What do you think about how they are playing?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Orioles are definitely turning some heads this season.  I am not sure they can keep it up at their current pace."
"__BASKETBALL__ I have to agree, they have definitely played well at the beginning of the season with the second best record in all of baseball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, and they have one of the hardest rivals in all of baseball.  They have to play the NY Yankees and even if the Yankees record sucks, they will always play the Orioles hard."
"__BASKETBALL__ Pretty crazy how baseball teams have rivals that always play each other hard."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, both the Orioles and the Red Sox are big time rivals with the Yankees. Who was your all time favorite Yankee?"
"__BASKETBALL__ You know, I don't have to go back that far to say Derek Jieter.  Who is your all time favorite baseball player?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I would have to say Cal Ripkin because I grew up watching him play for the Orioles.  Man could that boy play some ball."
"__BASKETBALL__ I really enjoyed watching Ripkin play but I truly loved when Earl Weaver was their coach."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yes, he could cover up home plate better then any other coach in the majors.  He was iconic."
