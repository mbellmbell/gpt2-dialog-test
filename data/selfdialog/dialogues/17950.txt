"__MOVIES__ Is there anything more jolly than a good Christmas movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, I can watch Christmas movies over and over, no matter the time of the year."
"__MOVIES__ That's the magic of them, everybody loves Christmas, it gives good vibes."
"__MOVIES__ Yup, it doesn't matter when you watch them because everyone is always pining for that holiday cheer."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Christmas movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough one, I want to veer towards the animated classics like Rudolph and Year Without A Santa Claus, but I don't know."
"__MOVIES__ For me it's probably Christmas Vacation, it's hard to beat."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that one has everything, good family bonding, great comedy, Chevy Chase at his best."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I can watch it over and over and never get sick of it, I love the TV marathons during the month of December."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of TV marathon how can we not mention A Christmas Story."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the undisputed classic."
"__MOVIES__ Even if it's not one's favorite it's probably arugably the best Christmas film ever made."
"__MOVIES__ It's brilliantly acted and written, captures that era so well."
"__MOVIES__ Definitley does, it's such a funny take on the holiday."
"__MOVIES__ Drink your Ovaltine, teaching kids to never expect the best."
"__MOVIES__ One of the best scenes of all time, Ralph's reaction to that is the greatest."
"__MOVIES__ The use of narration in A Christmas Story sends it over the top of greatness for me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah sometimes narration can ruin a movie, but in this case it gave it perfect comedic sense."
"__MOVIES__ All of this talk has me wanting to go get in the holiday cheer."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think I'll watch A Christmas Story tonight."
