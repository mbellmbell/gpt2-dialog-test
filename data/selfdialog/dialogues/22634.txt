"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that's a hard one. There's just so many classics!"
"__DISNEY__ It doesn't have to be just classics either, it can be some of the new ones they put out."
"__DISNEY__ I think for me, it would have to be Inside Out for the new ones, and Mulan for the classics."
"__DISNEY__ Interesting! I'd have to agree with you on that."
"__DISNEY__ I think Mulan was just so different from the other princesses and Inside Out is a movie everyone can relate to."
"__DISNEY__ I loved the animation from Inside Out, it was very pleasant to watch. Even my kids loved it."
"__DISNEY__ I feel like it would definitely call out to children!"
"__DISNEY__ I like that Disney is sending positive messages to little children and making movies they can relate to."
"__DISNEY__ Not only that, but adults can enjoy them too! That's when you know it's good."
