"__ICEHOCKEY__ What have you thought of the NHL playoffs thus far?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Amazing! The Penguins have been playing great."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's good to hear, even though I don't like the Penguins."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know you don't! Sorry for the Penguins beat down of the Blue Jackets."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's ok.  I really do like where they are going."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You are right and they should continue to get better and better."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am hopeful.  This is the first time they have actually looked good and are going places."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yah I agree.  Only took them fifteen years."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right and the trend should continue.  Are you worried about the Penguins loss last night though?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I kinda am, but I think it was just a hangover game for them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I would agree with that.  That was a wild and hard fought series against Washington."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Always great to see Washington lose, but the Penguins are certainly banged up."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They are banged up, but they aren't missing anyone too big besides Letang."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You are right and last night we could have used Letang big time."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Letang might be one of the best defense men in the leauge."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He certainly is and can score on whim."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I would expect them to bounce back tomorrow though."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too and I love how Fleury is playing in goal right now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh he's been amazing.  I bet you're glad he wasn't traded."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Extremely.  Their GM is looking pretty good right about now."
