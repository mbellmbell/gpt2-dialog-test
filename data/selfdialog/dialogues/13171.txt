"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think about LA getting two teams this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think its a really bad move for the NFL. I don't see how LA will support one team let alone two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but they are the second biggest market in the country."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but its just not a football town. LA is a lot like San Diego and San Diego never supports football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel bad for St Louis and Oakland. They seemed like decent football towns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. I think that is the second time both of these cities lost their teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of times there is more than meets the eye when teams move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. I don't think St Louis was bringing a lot of fans in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they really weren't. However, the Rams have been a bad team for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if the NFL will finally concede that these two cities cannot support football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of it has to do with having an organization that is committed to winning. The fans will follow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is true. But I don't think the city should suffer because of bad ownership."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In surprised they elected to put both teams in LA. There were so many options."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. Law Vegas has been asking for a team for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if Vegas would support a team though. Nobody is from Lad Vegas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. But there would be a good following for the visiting team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least those in Oakland have another team right across the bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. That might be why it was tough to maintain a second team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if there are just too many teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could be. There are only so many markets that can support the NFL."
