"__MOVIES__ My husband and I just had our anniversary and we went to a movie in the Theater for the first time in 10 years."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really?  I love going to the theater.  It is so much more immersive than just watching a movie at home."
"__MOVIES__ I had forgotten how awesome the theater experience was."
"__MOVIES__ So what Movie did you decide to see?"
"__MOVIES__ He let me choose, so I chose the Shack."
"__MOVIES__ I missed that one.  Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was amazing! I read the book three times and could not wait to see the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What was so good about it?"
"__MOVIES__ They followed the book so well and brought the book to life on the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite scene?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved how they portrayed the struggle that Mac had in stepping out of the boat to walk on the water with Jesus."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like a deep deep movie."
"__MOVIES__ Of course the book is much deeper but they did such a good job to get to the meat of the point of story in just the length of a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Can you tell me anything else without telling me the end?  I really want to see this one myself."
"__MOVIES__ I can't think of anything except for specific things which might ruin it for you."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok.  Is it a sad movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well be prepared to shed some tears when you watch that one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh great!  I do tend to love sad movies."
"__MOVIES__ You should maybe try and read the book before seeing the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Ok I will do that for sure.  I have been meaning to read it anyway!"
