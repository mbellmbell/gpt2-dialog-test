"__MOVIES__ Hey what movies have you seen recently?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Alien Covenant last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I saw that too! I'm very interested to know what you thought."
"__MOVIES__ It was 'meh', I was pretty disappointed, although it did have its moments."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there were some interesting concepts and Michael Fassbender is excellent."
"__MOVIES__ I see."
"__MOVIES__ And it was also great to see the xenomorph in action again."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
"__MOVIES__ But ultimately I think it was a tonal mess and all over the map."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I felt the same way...it seemed like it wanted to be two movies at once."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and that was very distracting and irritating."
"__MOVIES__ I personally preferred Prometheus."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, although I think they are 'overthinking' this whole franchise in general."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I agree, they need to keep it simple."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, why all of this mythology? It's getting way too convoluted."
"__MOVIES__ They need to just stick to what they know best- straight up action or horror."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they would let the District 9 director make his Alien 5 instead."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I would be much more interested in seeing that."
