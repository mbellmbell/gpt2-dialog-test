"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So the 8 is then what?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's currently out in the theaters. We should go watch it"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What's it about, though"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I guess the same stuff. Except Dom gets seduced by this girl. Or something."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ But he's married?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yep. And he goes off and gets Hobbs arrested while stealing some EMP thing for the girl, so they can go steal the God's eye"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ God's eye again. That's kinda getting old."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, that's the premise anyway. Anyway this Cipher girl blackmails Dom to doing more jobs for her."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ And the English guy joins the team? Deckard guy from Furious 7?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Looks that way, Maybe he wanted in the action. i don't know. Anyway, we should go see it."
