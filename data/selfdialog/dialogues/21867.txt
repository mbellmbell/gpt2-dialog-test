"__DISNEY__ The Haunted Mansion was on HBO today."
"__DISNEY__ Oh man, what did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ It's hard to imagine Disney screwing it up more."
"__DISNEY__ I know right?  Why did they take all the fun out of it?"
"__DISNEY__ It wasn't that it wasn't fun, I just thought it should have been darker."
"__DISNEY__ You mean like super-creepy?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, kind of like they should have made it PG-13 and not as campy."
"__DISNEY__ I could see that."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they remake it that way and make it tons better."
"__DISNEY__ I would pay $10 in a theater to see it for sure."
