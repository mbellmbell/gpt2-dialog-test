"__DISNEY__ Do you know what year the movie 'Pinocchio' came out?"
"__DISNEY__ If i'm not mistaken, I believe it came out in 1940. That's a very old movie but it's so influential."
"__DISNEY__ Ya, what was it about? Can you give me a quick summary?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure. It's about a puppet who is turned into a real life person but first must prove himself worthy to become a real boy."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know what his father or creators name was? I think i'm starting to remember it."
"__DISNEY__ His father's name was Geppetto. He wanted a boy so bad that he wood carved one."
"__DISNEY__ Oh ok. I'm know about it now. There was a Blue Fairy who appointed Jiminy Cricket to be his 'conscience'."
"__DISNEY__ Yep. that's right and every time Pinocchio lied, his nose would grow. It was hilarious."
"__DISNEY__ I glad that Pinocchio finally became a boy at the end."
"__DISNEY__ That just goes to show you that being honest pays off."
