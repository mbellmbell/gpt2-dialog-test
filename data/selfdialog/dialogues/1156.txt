"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to Ed Sheeran's new album yet?"
"__MUSIC__ Are you talking about 'Divide'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I can't stop listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! What's your favorite song on it?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm having trouble deciding between 'Happier' and 'Galway Girl.'"
"__MUSIC__ I like those ones too!"
"__MUSIC__ Which song was your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say 'Shape of You.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I really liked that one but I've heard it too many times on the radio and now I'm not as much of a fan."
"__MUSIC__ So true- It seems to be on every time I'm in the car."
"__MUSIC__ Are you going to his concert this summer?"
"__MUSIC__ No, the tickets were too expensive!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were outrageous."
"__MUSIC__ Are you going?"
"__MUSIC__ I was going to go but I realized it was my mom's birthday so I had to sell the tickets."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's such a bummer."
"__MUSIC__ I know- I hear he's really good live."
"__MUSIC__ I heard the same thing as well!"
"__MUSIC__ We should try and go to his concert the next time he comes to New York!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, that would be a lot of fun!"
