"__MOVIES__ Did you watch the Kong movie from the early 2000s?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so."
"__MOVIES__ It's the one where they go to his island capture him bring him back and try to show him off to the world."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I remember it now."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was alright but it was missing something."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think it was the human element."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ I always took him as this character that is very related to humans in the sense of his thought process and less of an animal."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good point."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but I liked the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Remember the scene at the end when he's on top of the building."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the one when he's holding the girl hostage."
"__MOVIES__ Well he loved the girl I think he was just trying to protect her."
"__MOVIES__ That's a fair point of view."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe they shot at him with planes."
"__MOVIES__ They had to do something."
"__MOVIES__ Either way I loved the movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was a little different than you'd expect from that type of movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was solid so I give it a 4 out of 5 you?"
"__MOVIES__ 4 out of 5 as well."
