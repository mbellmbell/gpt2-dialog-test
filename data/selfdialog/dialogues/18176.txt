"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie The Incredibles?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was amazing!  I actually own that movie."
"__MOVIES__ So do I!  I watch it every couple of years with my family."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  Our kids loved it too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's totally hilarious.  The characters are just great."
"__MOVIES__ I know!  I wish they'd make a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Who knows, maybe they will?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was a movie that we could all relate too.  My husband and I loved it as well as our kids."
"__MOVIES__ Well it was just so funny!  When did that movie come out?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, it was sometime back around 2005 or so I think."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think you're right.  My youngest was a toddler when we first watched it."
"__MOVIES__ I swear, even our toddler enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well it has that cute baby in it!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it does, I had forgotten that!  I like to think that my husband and I are like Mr. and Mrs. Incredible."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny!  What if there really were superheros amongst us?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well you never know."
"__MOVIES__ Either way it was a great idea.  I wonder who made that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it a Pixar movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I think you're right.  It had some funny shorts in the beginning that I think were Pixar."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they seem to produce a lot of the best animated movies."
