"__MOVIES__ Ever seen Anchorman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw the first one wasn't there a new one recently?"
"__MOVIES__ By recent it was in two thousand and thirteen then sure."
"__MOVIES__ You know what I meant! Is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's not as comparable to the original but at least they still have Will Ferrell as Ron."
"__MOVIES__ I loved his character, probably one of his best movies was the original."
"__MOVIES__ The second one is still amazing though, it has great reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I'll try to see it, anything bad in the movie that I should be worried about?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing more than the first, there's drugs and some suggestive and vulgar language but other than that it's fine."
"__MOVIES__ What's the rating though?"
"__MOVIES__ It's rated PG-13 so don't worry about that, it's not THAT nasty."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, good do you want to watch it too soon?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I loved it, Will really nailed the character with him and he fits it so perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ I sure hope so, how long is the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about 2 hours long."
"__MOVIES__ Is it filled with the randomness that is Will Ferrell?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, it goes off on a tangent a lot but it's hilarious. At then end it's a classic western with a final showdown."
"__MOVIES__ Shh! Don't spoil it now, I haven't seen it remember?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but let's watch it now."
"__MOVIES__ Sure!"
