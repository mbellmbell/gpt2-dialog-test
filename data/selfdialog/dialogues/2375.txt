"__MUSIC__ I do.  They are one of my favorite bands!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember all that hassle when Apple gave away their album for free?"

"__MUSIC__ Me too!  Which one is your favorite again?"
"__MUSIC__ I thin it is the Joshua Tree."
"__MUSIC__ I LOVE that one.  I listened to it over and over when I first got it."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  It was one of the first albums I bought on CD."
