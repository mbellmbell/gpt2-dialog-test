"__BEATLES__ I hate getting stuck in traffic. Do you want to play a music trivia game while we are waiting?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I'll go first. I will give you three clues and then you have to make your guess."
"__BEATLES__ Okay, but you have to say if it is a person, song, or a band. Stay in our era I don't know much about today's music."
"__BEATLES__ Alright, this is a four man band that popular in the sixties."
"__BEATLES__ Were they Americans?"
"__BEATLES__ You can't ask questions, just listen to the clues. The second clue is they are from Liverpool."
"__BEATLES__ Well, I think I got it but I will take the last clue."
"__BEATLES__ Their first hit song was in 1962 named 'Love Me Do'."
"__BEATLES__ It has to be the Beatles. Now it is my turn to give you clues."
"__BEATLES__ Give me clues that give me a real chance of figuring it out like I did you."
