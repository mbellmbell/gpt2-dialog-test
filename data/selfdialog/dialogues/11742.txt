"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you psyched about this coming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. Can't wait to see my team in action."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No offense, but I don't see them doing anything this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had 9 losses last year, and pretty much the same for the past years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey nothing is impossible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your right. The starting quarterback; Tyrod Taylor could be replaced."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think it's just a quaterback issue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just saying, he is a major component in the team and has to step up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On that note, did you hear the Bills picked up Nathan Peterman?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has he played on any other NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he was recently drafted from a Pittsburgh college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wander how his stats are?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From what I see, there is a close chance he can be starter quarterback for the Bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which one would you want to see out on the field as starter quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sticking with the veteran quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A true fan of Tyrod Taylor I see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Until his career is over with the Bills."
