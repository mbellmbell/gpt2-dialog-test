"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Colton Dixon's new song?"
"__MUSIC__ Which one? He is one of my favorite Christian singers!"
"__MUSIC__ His song is called All That Matters. It really has some beautiful lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to check it out. I don't think I have heard that one."
"__MUSIC__ His song really speaks to my heart. I have it set to repeat on my Iphone."
"__MUSIC__ I do that all the time with my favorite songs! I play them until I don't want to hear them anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right? I have a shower playlist too and his song is the first one on my list."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good way to start the morning. You can get your mind set for the day."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! His lyrics remind me that no matter what disasters come my way, God can undo them all!"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I am talking about. I sure love his singing...and his hair."
"__MUSIC__ His hair is definitely not what I expected. It's a little wild, but I like that he is different."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think he appeals to a lot more people because his look and sound are so modern."
"__MUSIC__ I started following him on Facebook. I'm totally not stalking him!"
"__MUSIC__ Did you? I will have to look him up on there. I hadn't thought about that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think he just got married. I saw some pics of him and his wife with the Disney bride/groom ears."
"__MUSIC__ Is she pretty?"
"__MUSIC__ She was actually! They looked really happy together."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess I know what I'm fixing to do."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to be nosy and look at his pictures on Facebook and listen to that new song."
