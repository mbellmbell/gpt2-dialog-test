"__MUSIC__ Hey, music major."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, that's me!"
"__MUSIC__ My roommate says she has synesthesia."
"__MUSIC__ Sweet! Musically-connected?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, can you explain it? I have no idea what it means."
"__MUSIC__ Synesthesia is basically your senses being cross-wired and responding to the wrong stimulae."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, for music, you can see colors when hearing certain sounds. You can smell things too. Those are the most common."
"__MUSIC__ So, one piece produces a color?"
"__MUSIC__ No, and it depends on the person."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ For some people, each timbre produces its own color. For others, certain chords, certain keys, and so forth."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound consistent."
"__MUSIC__ It's not - each person hears and sees it differently."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to tell you later when I talk to her."
"__MUSIC__ A bunch of composers wrote down the colors they associated with each."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds fun but it could be torture."
"__MUSIC__ It might be! Messiaen, specifically."
"__MUSIC__ What happened to him?"
"__MUSIC__ He started seeing colors after extreme starvation in the Nazi camps."
