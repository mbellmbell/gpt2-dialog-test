"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's up? Are you ready for the football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait. We just got a new projection T.V. and green wall for watching NFL games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great! Who do you think will go all the way this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to bet on it today I would say the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to deny their talent but I am not a fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Understood. That whole Aaron Hernandez fiasco left a bad taste in my mouth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They knew who he was and what he was capable of before they drafted him!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had enough off the field problems to scare most teams away. Pats are all about winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of tight ends, I like Greg Olsen from the Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Olsen is cool and I think that Travis Kelce is going to have a big year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Gronk? He's on top right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's great when he's playing but I think he's injury prone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he stay off of the bench and on the field he'll be unstoppable this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same with Jordan Reed from the Skins. he's got mad skills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. He missed four games last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that Matt Ryan still has what it takes to win a ring?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely! I have been a Ryan fan since he was with Boston College."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a tough guy, this year will depend on his offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe the O line is the key ingredient for any team's offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it is and that is why the Patriots always dominate."
