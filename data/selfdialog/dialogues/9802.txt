"__COMEDY__ What do you think is the funniest movie you've ever seen?"
"__COMEDY__ I think The Hangover is one of the best. Zach Galifianakis is perfect for his role."
"__COMEDY__ Really? I thought it was a bit hyped up. I really think I liked him better in The Due Date."
"__COMEDY__ I haven't heard of that. Who else is in it?"
"__COMEDY__ Robert Downey, Jr. is the other main character in the film."
"__COMEDY__ Oh! Now it's ringing a bell. Robert Downey, Jr. usually does more action films."
"__COMEDY__ That's true, but he was great in Due Date and also in Tropic Thunder."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yes! Ben Stiller's in that as well, right?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, he is. You can't beat him in Zoolander though."
"__COMEDY__ True. Zoolander might be one of my other favorite comedies of all time."
