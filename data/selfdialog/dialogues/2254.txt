"__MUSIC__ What is the worst song you have ever heard?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's easy!"
"__MUSIC__ Easy?  It took me weeks to decide on an answer to that question!"
"__MUSIC__ Then you have never heard this song."
"__MUSIC__ I am sure you are mistaken. I have taken Master's level courses in 'Music Theory' , as well as 'Contemporary Music as an Artform'..."
"__MUSIC__ I still don't think you have heard this particular song."
"__MUSIC__ I have studies the genre's of Pop, Rock, Soul, Jazz, Opera...."
"__MUSIC__ Still think you are clueless."
"__MUSIC__ I know every song from Cole Porter to the Beatles, Aretha Franklin to James Brown, The Osmonds to the Jackson Five, and I have listened to every classical classical number ever written!"
"__MUSIC__ Still clueless."
"__MUSIC__ Clueless? Why, I have a Ph.D. in Musical History from Harvard."
"__MUSIC__ You still wouldn't know. You couldn't know."
"__MUSIC__ I was the Jeopardy game show all-time winner because of my in depth knowledge in music! Of course I could know!"
"__MUSIC__ You think so?"
"__MUSIC__ I know so!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok Mr. Musical genius. What song did my daughter make up jusy last evening?"
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ That's right, the worst song I ever heard was made up by my daughter last night. It's called 'Itsy Bitsy Potty'"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know that one. How could I know a song your daughter just made up...a horrible-sounding song your daughter just created?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the worst song ever!  But for some reason, it may be my favorite!"
