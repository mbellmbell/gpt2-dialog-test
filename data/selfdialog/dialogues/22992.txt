"__DISNEY__ So which do you think was sadder, The Lion King or Bambi?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, tough questions! They're both tear-jerkers."
"__DISNEY__ I feel like in The Lion King it's more unexpected when Simba's father dies."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe so, but both of them make you cry."
"__DISNEY__ They're both great movies, too."
"__DISNEY__ The animation in The Lion King is a lot more sophisticated."
"__DISNEY__ True, but Bambi is still worth watching."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, definitely! And Thumper is still funny."
"__DISNEY__ Honestly, the two movies have a lot in common."
"__DISNEY__ They're both about nature, and about the circle of life."
