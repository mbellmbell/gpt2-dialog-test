"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to much 80s country?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I guess so.  You mean like Eddie Rabbit?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, Eddie Rabbit, Don Williams, Mandrell, those are the folks."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ I have this thing about 80s country, I grew up listening to it because of my parents, and I'm hooked on some of it."
"__MUSIC__ I like a few songs here and there, but I'm not a fan."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, the problem I think is the production value, it all sounds kind of weird."
"__MUSIC__ Weird? How?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it kind of a strange blend of 80s production techniques and weird arrangement choices."
"__MUSIC__ Give me an example."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard Luckenbach Texas from Waylon?"
"__MUSIC__ 'back to the basics of love?'"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, that's the one.  I think it's a fantastic song, but the production is horrible."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I like that song, but what do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Listen to the guitar in the intro, it sounds so sterile and processed.  It's just the opposite of country as far as I'm concerned."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I'll have to give it another listen. What are your favorite 80s country songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Man, hard to narrow it down...Queen of Hearts, 7 year ache, Luckenbach, the outlaws"
"__MUSIC__ good tunes, yea maybe I'll hit youtube and go down that rabbit hole"
"__MUSIC__ I recommend it, but pack a lunch, you'll be a while"
"__MUSIC__ you got it"
