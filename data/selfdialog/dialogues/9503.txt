"__BASEBALL__ Alright, dude, I got a beef about baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm trying to eat..."
"__BASEBALL__ Anyway, why aren't more baseball players in jail?"
"__BASEBALL__ Again, I'm eating here. But go ahead. What are you ranting about this time?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, we see baseball players get into fights on a semi-regular basis. At least every week or two the benches clear, there are punches thrown."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, and?"
"__BASEBALL__ And they take bats and destroy them, they break water coolers when mad, they throw bases around."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they're playing kids games. They're kids, pretty much. What's your point?"
"__BASEBALL__ What are the penalties that they get from MLB?"
"__BASEBALL__ Usually a $5,000 fine and a 2- to 3-game suspension."
"__BASEBALL__ And if this happened in real life? Someone throws an object at your head at 95 miles per hour, and people get into a big fight?"
"__BASEBALL__ They... oh..."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they go to jail. And pay fines that actually cost a lot of money, relatively, instead of the amount they get paid per inning played."
"__BASEBALL__ So, why do you think they don't go to jail?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know. They should, especially if they are supposed to be role models for kids."
"__BASEBALL__ I'd love to see cops on the field actually putting these players in handcuffs and tasering them."
"__BASEBALL__ Their personalities alone deserve it. But anyway, the other problem is that MLB doesn't do enough to dissuade the fights."
"__BASEBALL__ The fans cheer it heavily, too."
"__BASEBALL__ So, they are promoting violence while not showing any true consequences."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they care more about what players put into their bodies than actual crimes. Kind of weird."
