"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Sci Fi movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably the movie called Alien."
"__MOVIES__ That one is really crazy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you have seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah do you remember the part with the face hugger?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that part is so nasty haha."
"__MOVIES__ It really is, I would hate to discover an alien like that."
"__MOVIES__ The only thing worse than that is when it grows into the full alien."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that thing gets huge."
"__MOVIES__ It would be scary to be stuck on a spaceship with something that deadly."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they made more movies like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, now a days all you see is a bunch of jump scare movies."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of ruins the genre."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen any of The Predator movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw the first one with Arnold Schwarzenegger."
"__MOVIES__ That one was awesome, how they are in the jungle and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was cool to see a bunch of soldiers try to fight it."
"__MOVIES__ It was crazy how at the end Arnold ended up using mud to hide from its thermal vision."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that part was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I'm just really surprised that he managed to beat the predator."
