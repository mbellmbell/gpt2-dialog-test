"__MOVIES__ I am so excited for the third installment of Pitch Perfect to come out!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I have never seen any of the Pitch Perfect movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you should, they are so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I don't think they look that funny from commercials I have seen."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me, they are hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ Which one do you like better?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the first one more than the second one but I still think they are both so good."
"__MOVIES__ It has Anna Kendrick in it right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she is so funny in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't find her funny at all. She bothers me as an actress."
"__MOVIES__ Really? She is so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ I do like Rebel Wilson, she is in that movie too right?"
"__MOVIES__ She is! She plays Fat Amy."
"__MOVIES__ Fat Amy? Is that really her character's name in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It is! She even calls herself Fat Amy. It is so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't sound funny at all, that sounds really mean."
"__MOVIES__ No, it is very lighthearted! She is a great character in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. Well I think I will skip those."
"__MOVIES__ Suit yourself. I still can't wait for the third one to come out!"
"__MOVIES__ Good for you."
