"__DISNEY__ I feel like sequels are never any good."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I totally disagree with you there--think about Disney!"
"__DISNEY__ What good sequels did Disney ever make?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, think about the Toy Story movies and Finding Dory, those were both sequels."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I cried my eyes out at Toy Story 3!"
"__DISNEY__ The way they handled the Andy and Woody storyline was so sweet."
"__DISNEY__ And it was really sentimental for me, too, since I was about the same age as Woody."
"__DISNEY__ I was really nervous when the first announced another sequel, but they really knew what they were doing."
"__DISNEY__ And I guess Toy Story 2 was pretty good, too."
"__DISNEY__ Oh for sure! I cry at Jessie's song every time."
