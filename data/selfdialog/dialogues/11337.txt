"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you read about the draft grade that the Chicago Bears got?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they had a horrible draft!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That front office is the worst in all of football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have to be. That trade from the third position up to the second position was just bizarre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On ESPN, everyone says that San Francisco 'fleeced' the Bears' front office."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that is strong language, but they're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was watching the draft live at home, and i was stunned when they announced that the Bears were moving up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! I thought all along that they would take a defensive lineman or move down and take the safety from LSU."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. Every projection had them taking a 'can't miss' lineman at number three or even a strong safety."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But instead they trade up one spot to take a quarterback!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't get it. Trubisky is just the best of a terrible class of quarterbacks this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. He only played one year at North Carolina on top of it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't mind the pick as much if the Bears hadn't just signed Mike Glennon to a huge contract to the quarterback for 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would they sign Glennon and then draft a quarterback when they have so many other needs on that team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes no sense. That front office is pathetic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are awful. And don't even get me started with the Bears drafting a Division II tight end in the second round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was still in shock when I saw their second pick, and I just threw my hands up in disgust."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. The Bears will be the worst team in the NFL this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least they'll have another high draft pick next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That doesn't matter if the front office has no idea how to run a proper draft room!"
