"__MUSIC__ Do you like Bheetoven?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the most powerful classical music you could listen to."
"__MUSIC__ He changed music forever.  Imagine listening to his 9th for the first time?"
"__MUSIC__ I know, even today it's one of the most impressive pieces I've ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ The way it builds from the start and the giant wall of sound during Ode to Joy."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe the best segment of music ever."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, not enough people appreciate it because it's so overplayed and heard."
"__MUSIC__ His 5th was really good too.  All the speed and anger."
"__MUSIC__ I also like Fur Alise, that was relaxing and thought provoking"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was.  More people should pay closer attention to classical these days."
"__MUSIC__ Or at least some of the better stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I'd like to see someone do some more rock classical."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of like Trans Siberian Orchestra?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, just like them.  Only a little less Christmas based."
"__MUSIC__ That would be awesome.  Bheetovens 5th on an electric guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that would be beyond epic."
"__MUSIC__ Would be really hard though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and probably not popular."
"__MUSIC__ But I'd like it."
"__MUSIC__ Me too."
