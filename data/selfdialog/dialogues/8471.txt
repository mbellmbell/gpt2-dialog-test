"__BEATLES__ Which of the Beatles is your favorite?"
"__BEATLES__ Honestly, George Harrison is my pick. He's one of my favorite guitarists of all time."
"__BEATLES__ Good pick! Personally, I'd have to say Paul McCartney, I love him with Wings too."
"__BEATLES__ So, what do you think about Ringo?"
"__BEATLES__ Ringo who? Oh yeah, almost forgot about him...."
"__BEATLES__ Hahahaha! Everyone seems to forget about Ringo!"
"__BEATLES__ He can't seem to catch a break, now can he? At least he and Paul are still alive though."
"__BEATLES__ Some people think Paul is actually dead, and was replaced. Isn't that funny?"
"__BEATLES__ That's almost as absurd as saying Gucci Mane died and was cloned!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, some people believe the dumbest things!"
