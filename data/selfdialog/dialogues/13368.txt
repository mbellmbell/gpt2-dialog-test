"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Quarterbacks these days are so babied by the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think there's too many rules in place to protect the quarterback at all costs. It makes the game worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have to make rules for the quarterback because their safety is at risk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are quarterbacks in more danger than the average player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you think about it, quarterbacks are basically sitting ducks when they're just standing in the pocket looking for a passer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know, but that comes with the terrirtory. It's not like these guys aren't getting paid for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I don't think it's just a matter of being paid for it. They also have to think how it affects the game if quarterbacks get injured often."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To me, it's a part of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see where you're coming from, but I also see where the NFL is coming from."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just too many rules to protect the quarterback at the expense of the defensive players' abilities to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the rules are fine. Defensive players are still able to hit the quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not like they used to. These days, defensive players can get fined or penalized just for sneezing at a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that it actually makes defensive players quicker and smarter when they have to play within the new rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When defensive players can't just go all out to hit a quarterback, they have to think about strategy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I disagree. It limits them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think defensive players all of a sudden have to think about approaching the quarter with more skills than just brute force."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally, I would rather see the old rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just want to see quarterbacks playing for a whole season even if it means babying them."
