"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hello."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi there."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What have you been doing lately?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nothing much. Just been watching movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What movies?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Last one I watched was Dredd."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good choice. I love that movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So do I. It's criminal that they're not making a sequel."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Blame the advertising department."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I heard it didn't do well in theatres."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They totally failed to market the movie correctly."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It did really well in DVD sales, though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I heard that too, but I guess it still wasn't enough."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nope. Execs don't know what's good for them."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ At least it's getting a TV show."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wait, really?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What's what I heard."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well at leats something is happening!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'd still prefer a new movie though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, me too."
