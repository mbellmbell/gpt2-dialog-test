"__STAR_WARS__ The most iconic and worthwhile Star Wars films are the first three."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. These worked well because of the way George Lucas adapted the philosopy of Joseph Campbell in the characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right. It especially works in Luke Skywalker's origin story in A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't forget the characterization of Obi Wan as the wise man that Luke goes to for answers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course. And what about the archetypical villian in the character of Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think, though, that that really comes out in The Empire Strikes Back, when Darth Vader reveals himself as Luke's father."
"__STAR_WARS__ Isn't that one of the greatest surprise endings in cineme? It blew me away when I first saw that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. But I have to say I have a partiality for The Return of the Jedi. It's so much fun."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know if I agree. The tightest of the three is The Empire Strikes Back - interestingly the only one of them that Lucas didn't direct."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait. Did he direct The Return of the Jedi? Anyway, all things said, that trilogy sure is a classic of cinema."
