"__MOVIES__ I just the trailer for Jackie Chan's new movie, The Foreigner."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?  What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It actually reminds me a lot of that Liam Neeson movie, Taken, except in this one Jackie's daughter is killed in a terrorist attack and he is after revenge."
"__MOVIES__ So what makes it like Taken then?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Jackie is apparently some kind of special forces retired guy, so it makes me think of that 'I have a particular set of skills' bit, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I get it So does it look good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  I mean, it's Jackie Chan. He's getting older, so he's slowing down some though."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of noticed that in Kung Fu Yoga.  I mean, he still fights and stuff but he does a lot of things almost standing in one place, blocking."
"__MOVIES__ A lot less running around and climbing up walls and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ You know he always does all his own stunts so it's to be expected.  I mean, how old is he now?"
"__MOVIES__ He's 63."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty impressive then, that he's still basically an action hero!"
"__MOVIES__ No kidding.  Remember when Van Damm started getting old?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, he's only 56."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously?  Because it seemed like in his last few movies, like Pound of Flesh, he looked to me like he was really stiff."
"__MOVIES__ He had a big cocaine habit for a while you know. And then he's also bipolar, too."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, no I didn't know anything about that."
"__MOVIES__ He's supposed to have a new movie out in 2018, Black Water, where he is co-staring with Dolph Lundgren."
"__MOVIES__ That should be a good one."
