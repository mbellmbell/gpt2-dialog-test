"__MOVIES__ Hey, guess what movie I just watched?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea, what was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was the Disney movie The Princess and the Frog, have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I remember when that came out, but I never saw it.  Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's fantastic!  It totally lives up to its reputation."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's set in New Orleans and it's about this girl who dreams of being a chef.  She winds up getting turned into a frog along with a wayward prince."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean, a wayward prince?"
"__MOVIES__ He's totally stuck up.  They end up on a journey together through the bayou."
"__MOVIES__ Oh interesting.  Is it funny?"
"__MOVIES__ It's absolutely hilarious!  Plus the sound track is great and will totally get stuck in your head."
"__MOVIES__ I had heard that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's incredible.  I love the Disney princess movies and this is one of the best for sure."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like they just get better and better.  Did you see Tangled?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes but I did not like it as much as the Princess and the Frog."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ It was good but not as good.  This one is funnier, I promise."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I will have to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the music is better.  Plus it's got a good moral."
"__MOVIES__ They usually do have good morals."
