"__STAR_WARS__ Which ship battle was your favorite out of all the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought that the battle in Return of The Jedi was really good. How about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Personally, and I know this is going to be a bit of an unpopular opinion. But I really liked the Rogue One ship battle."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh that's interesting. Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well don't you remember how Admiral Raddus ordered them to ram those two star destroyers into each other?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah I had forgotten about that. That was super cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ I honestly think those last fifteen minutes were the absolute coolest parts of that movie. Hands down."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah and when Vader comes in swinging at all those rebels. You can just feel the fear."
"__STAR_WARS__ He straight up crushed that one dude up against the ceiling! Insanely awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know how I felt about the CG Leia though. A little gaudy, but I guess it worked."
