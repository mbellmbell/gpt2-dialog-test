"__BASEBALL__ How did the world series begin anyway? It's so stupid. Oh gee, look. We're gonna play for the world Championship. Oh, look, only the Americans are playing."
"__BASEBALL__ just about everything you ask is way to overgeneralized. You really can't pick one single game as the start of the world series."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok Fine then. What can be considered somewhat like a world series where multiple leagues played for one title?"
"__BASEBALL__ If that's what you meant, then, the original world series should be the post season competition between the American Association and the National League."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok, now we're getting somewhere."
"__BASEBALL__ yes. And this game was initially called the 'The Championship of the United States,' or the 'World's Championship series.'"
"__BASEBALL__ Now that sounds like the world series."
"__BASEBALL__ And it was called that, for short. The first game was played in 1884, between the Providence Grays vs New York Metropolitans"
"__BASEBALL__ These teams are not even around anymore."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, New York Metropolitans is called the New York Mets now. And the MLB didn't exist until 1903, which is most commonly referred to year as the year when the first World Series was played"
"__BASEBALL__ Who played in that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Boston Americans vs Pittsburg Pirates."
"__BASEBALL__ let me guess. Boston Americans became the Red Sox?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yep."
"__BASEBALL__ Did Pirates win any world series?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yep, They won the first inaugural series in 1903, and then a few more after that, and the last one they won was back in 1979"
"__BASEBALL__ What's the deal was that shoeless Joe guy?"
"__BASEBALL__ Black Sox Scandal. Shoeless Joe was an outfielder for the Chicago White Sox. And he and 8 other players were accused of fixing the world series to make some money from the gamblers at the time."
"__BASEBALL__ Did he do it? Did all 8 do it? All guilty?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, Chicago White Sox wouldn't win a world series until 2005. They call it the Curse of the Black Sox. Shoeless joe had a home run in the series, perfect fielding stats with no errors, had the highest batting average of 3.75 in the series. Yet he was banned from baseball for life along with the other 8. His records from the series show that he didn't throw the game. Thus the curse."
