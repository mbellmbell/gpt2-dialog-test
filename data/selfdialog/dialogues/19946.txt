"__MOVIES__ Would you like to come over and spend the day with me?"

"__MOVIES__ Does it also have Tina Fey in it as well?"
"__MOVIES__ It sure does! The cast is one of the strong points of the movie in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I do not think that I have ever seen that one come to think of it."
"__MOVIES__ Great, I will bring that one over for us to watch then!"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good to me! Maybe you could bring over one more just in case we want to watch another one."
"__MOVIES__ I recently bought a new movie called A Dog's Purpose."
"__MOVIES__ I have been wanting to watch that one for a long time!"
