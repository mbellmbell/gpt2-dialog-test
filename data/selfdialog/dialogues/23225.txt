"__DISNEY__ Remember the Disney movie Alladin?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course I remember Alladin!  That was one of my favorites as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Mine too.  I always said I'd name my first daughter Jasmine, and then I did!"
"__DISNEY__ It's just a hilarious movie, especially with the genie."
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't it played by Robin Williams?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, he's hilarious."
"__DISNEY__ They actually made a few sequels but none of them were as good as the original."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really?  Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I know Return of Jafar was one of them.  I watched it but it wasn't too great."
"__DISNEY__ I never heard of that one."
