"__DISNEY__ How come you did not like 'Frozen'?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it was underrated."
"__DISNEY__ I actually liked it. I did like the music."
"__DISNEY__ The only reason 'Frozen' was popular was there were no other family movies showing at that time."
"__DISNEY__ Is that true? I will have to look that up. Do you think that's how 'Frozen' got so popular?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. And I am telling you, it's overrated."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. Is that - is that a 'Frozen' backpack you are carrying?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it is. I like Olaf."
"__DISNEY__ You are putting down 'Frozen' but you are buying the merchandise?"
