"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite line in the Beatle's song 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?'"
"__BEATLES__ That's hard to say! I think I like the phrase 'kaleidescope eyes' the most."
"__BEATLES__ It's definitely beautiful imagery - and a little crazy!"
"__BEATLES__ For sure! What about you, what's your favorite phrase or line?"
"__BEATLES__ I like 'looking glass tie'. I always picture a mirror in the shape of a tie."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah - it's almost like you could see yourself reflected in that person's heart."
"__BEATLES__ Exactly. Another interesting song is 'We All Live In A Yellow Submarine'"
"__BEATLES__ Tell me about it! Though it does have a catching rhythm."
"__BEATLES__ Once my five year old sister heard and she was singing it all day long for days!"
"__BEATLES__ Oh no! How did you get her to stop?"
