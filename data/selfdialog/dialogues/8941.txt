"__BEATLES__ I've been listening to the Beatles a lot lately."
"__BEATLES__ Oh? What are some of their best songs?"
"__BEATLES__ Here Comes the Sun is one of the best. It is so cheerful and happy."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah that is a good one. It always makes me feel happy."
"__BEATLES__ Baby You Can Drive My Car is cute as well. What are your favorites?"
"__BEATLES__ Help! is such a classic. So is All You Need is Love."
"__BEATLES__ Great choices. What about Yellow Submarine?"
"__BEATLES__ Also good, but not my favorite. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da is probably my all-time favorite."
"__BEATLES__ Oh I love how silly Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da is!"
"__BEATLES__ Me too. It always makes me lighten up when I'm being too serious!"
