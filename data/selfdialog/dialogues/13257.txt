"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the strict tackling rules for the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I wish they would just let them play football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you care about the safety of the players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well of course I do, but they get paid a lot of money to get hit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a lot of them die in their 50's because of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, that's the price you pay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cold man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but the league is so soft now with all these anti-tackling rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The players used to be able to lead with their helmet and hit 'defenseless' players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think it's a bad thing that they can't anymore?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, I think it takes the excitement out of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that somewhat, but I think the players safety far outweighs that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get where you're coming from, but don't you miss big hits too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, I really do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't you want to see them come back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To an extent I guess, I don't want dead players either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That risk is always there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but there's no need to maximize it right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so, I just miss it."
