"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I did! Wasn't it great?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it! I thought it was so exciting and it made me want to watch it again right after."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree. I love how funny the Guardians of the Galaxy movies are."
"__MOVIES__ They are funny, especially thanks to Chris Pratt."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's great! One of my favorite actors."
"__MOVIES__ What other movies was he in?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in Jurassic World and Passengers."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's right!  I never saw those movies, but I remember hearing about them."
"__MOVIES__ They're both really good; you should check them out."
"__MOVIES__ I might do that.  I'm afraid I won't like Jurassic World as much as the originals, though/"
"__MOVIES__ I can understand that, but really I love both."
"__MOVIES__ What's the difference between the storylines?"
"__MOVIES__ It does not differ very much.  Jurassic World is another amusement park with dinosaurs in it and then things go horribly wrong."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it sounds very similar.  Are you sure I will like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so! The visuals are amazing to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out then, along with other Chris Pratt movies."
"__MOVIES__ I support you completely.  Let me know if you need suggestions."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely will, thanks!"
"__MOVIES__ Any time!  I'm glad to pass on movie suggestions."
