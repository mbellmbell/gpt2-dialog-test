"__BASKETBALL__ Did you go to the game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The basketball game?  Where was it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ At the high school.  It was a home game."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I had to work."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, you totally missed it.  It was awesome!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, yeah?  We won?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the score was 87-42."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow.  That means the team is heading to the playoffs, right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the first round is next week I think."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I'm going to have to make sure to take off for that one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that one is an away game, but we can ride together."
"__BASKETBALL__ That sounds good.  So, I guess they buckled up on their defense?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, yeah.  The score at halftime was 42-30."
"__BASKETBALL__ Seriously?  So, they only allowed 12 points to be scored in the whole second half?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that's why I'm telling you it was awesome!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow, the other coach must have been livid!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, he was, you should have heard him!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Those poor kids on that team though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, at least their season is over and he won't be yelling at them anymore."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess if you look at it that way."
