"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oakland is going to enjoy having Marshawn lynch this season though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, its too bad that he left Seattle, but Oakland is getting a gamer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aren't you tired of Marshawn Lynch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What you do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know? His whole act."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like not talking to the media? Retiring and coming back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that stuff. It all has gotten old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, I have thought about that too. His teammates seem to like him though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. His act is just getting really old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, old or not he is gonna be an excellent addition to the raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, we already know they have their QB and lead receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, the only weak point on the offense last year was RB. They solved that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! Now they just have to keep their guys healthy and win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it should finally be that time for the Raiders. They have a needed a QB to build around for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well they have one now in Carr. Or at least they paid him like one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, you are definitely right. That man got paid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lots of money he did. Lots of money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we'll see how that translates to the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well if Carr stays healthy, they are a superbowl contender."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but that seems to be a big if with him."
