"__MOVIES__ Name me a movie that you love, that most other people don't like, or make fun of."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, I have a lot of those. Today I will say Hook, with Robin WIlliams and Dustin Hoffman."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that one. Julia Roberts played Tinkerbell."
"__MOVIES__ And it was directed by Steven Spielberg, one of my favorite directors."
"__MOVIES__ I recall a lot of people didn't really get into it. Why do you love it?"
"__MOVIES__ I love the premise, first of all. The idea that Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up in Neverland, followed Wendy to the real world and grew up to become a stressed out yuppie who forgot how to play, is priceless."
"__MOVIES__ I must say, casting Robin Williams was brilliant. He was, in many ways, a giddy little child wrapped up in a man's body."
"__MOVIES__ He was good at playing stressed out Peter, but it was just lovely when he embraced his inner Pan and became a child at heart again."
"__MOVIES__ What else did you like about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the production values are outstanding. The sets were so elaborate and beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ I think one of the criticisms was the huge budget."
"__MOVIES__ But it's all there on the screen, at least. It's a feast for the eyes."
"__MOVIES__ I think Julia Roberts is a feast for the eyes, personally. But they trapped her in that horrible outfit. They didn't even dress her like the classic Disney Tinkerbell."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a miss on their parts. They made up for it a little bit in the sequence where Tinkerbell becomes as big as Peter to confess her feelings for him."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I wish she had been dressed in that lovely fairy outfit the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ I also liked Dustin Hoffman as Hook. He had a little tongue in cheek energy, but mostly he played it straight."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the swordfight between Hook and Peter at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Hoffman and Williams worked with a fencing master to make it look great. And the flying scenes were good too."
"__MOVIES__ Those were the olden days when there was no CGI to do the flying sequences."
"__MOVIES__ That makes the on-set effects all the more special, because there were guys sweating blood to pull them off. I loved the result."
