"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey did you hear the Raiders are moving to Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're doing what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, moving to Vegas.  No more Oakland Raiders"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I hadn't heard.  You know this isn't their first move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really. I always assumed they were from Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think they have moved a few times but always end up back in Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I wonder what the Raider fans think about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are pretty loyal in Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, you don't get fans like them anywhere else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are crazy.  Wearing all that stuff like skull head on their shoulders and all that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, pretty insane.  I think that they are the wildest fans in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The dog pound gets pretty crazy too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but not like it used to before the old Browns left Cleveland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course there is the Dirty Towel too in Pittsburg.  They have some pretty good fans too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure do.  Stemming from the 70's when they won four titles in like 5 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the old Bradshaw days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those were good but being a Dallas Cowboy fan those kinda still hurt as two of those was against the boys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, classic confrontation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too True.  I waited 19 years but they finally got them back in 95'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Took you a long time to get revenge on the Steelers."
