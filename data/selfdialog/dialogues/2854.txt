"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see the Eagles in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I always wanted to."
"__MUSIC__ I think their music is timeless."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but with Glen Fry gone, it is probably over for them."
"__MUSIC__ I just saw that Glen's son is going to be playing with them for a few concerts."
"__MUSIC__ That is great! He should sound pretty much like Glen did."
"__MUSIC__ I really hope so. If they get anywhere near me, I am going."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I won't miss the opportunity again."
"__MUSIC__ Hotel California is probably my all time favorite song."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, it is a good one, but I always think of Tequila Sunrise when I think of the Eagles."
"__MUSIC__ They had so many hits."
"__MUSIC__ It seems like every song they put out was a hit!"
"__MUSIC__ Don Henley has been pretty successful on his own."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I saw him in concert near here. He sounded great."
"__MUSIC__ His voice is so distinctive, I honestly think as long as he stays with the Eagles, they can still tour."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, his voice really makes many of those hits."
"__MUSIC__ Their harmonies simply aren't matched by today's artists."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, although I do like many of the younger artists today."
"__MUSIC__ I do too, but when asked my favorite all time group, I always say the Eagles."
"__MUSIC__ I do too! They are something very special."
