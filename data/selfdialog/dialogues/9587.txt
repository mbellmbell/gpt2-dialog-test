"__COMEDY__ No I haven't? Whats it about?"
"__COMEDY__ It is about a family visiting their daughter and her eclectic boyfriend for the holidays."
"__COMEDY__ That sounds interesting. So I'm assuming there is some crazy stuff that happens."
"__COMEDY__ Oh ya. When I say eclectic I mean it."
"__COMEDY__ Who plays in it?"
"__COMEDY__ It stars James Frano and Bryan Cranston."
"__COMEDY__ Oh that has to be good then. They are both hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ Ya it is. It is definitely not to be watched with children though."
"__COMEDY__ Oh ok. Thanks for the heads up."
