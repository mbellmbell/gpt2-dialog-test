"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Titans will be this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Much improved is my guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why in particular?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For one thing, they are developing a very good offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely have been collecting some good young talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It helps that they've got Murray running behind them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's reminding me of his glory days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean when he was with Dallas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  His time in Philly was no glory day for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, what a mess that was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Mariota?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's improving year after year.  Seems like a good pick so far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, that guy has some jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he ran all the time at Oregon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really helps when he scrambles.  Linebackers can't catch him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He picked up tons of first downs last year from running out of the pocket."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the key with him is keeping him healthy though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you can't run for your life and not expect to be hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they can challenge the Steelers to win the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so.  I hate the Steelers!"
