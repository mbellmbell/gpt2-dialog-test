"__MOVIES__ Do you prefer classic films or modern films?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by classic?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, old Hollywood type stuff from the 1950s."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! Yeah, I like some of that. I also like modern stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"
"__MOVIES__ That's an absolute classic! Who was in that one again?"
"__MOVIES__ Joan Crawford and Bette Davis."
"__MOVIES__ That's right! They play the two sisters."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! What kinds of modern films do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm more into Asian horror than anything else."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What's that like?"
"__MOVIES__ It's really dark, but it's more about what you don't see than what you do see."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ They do a lot more with ambiance and soundtrack, so you're always on the edge of your seat."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Can you recommend any good ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Start with something like Ringu or Ju-On. Those are considered two of the biggest classics."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard of Ringu. Is that The Ring?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Exactly, it was released in 1995."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's one of my absolute favorites."
