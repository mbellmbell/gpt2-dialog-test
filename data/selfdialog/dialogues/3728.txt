"__MUSIC__ Do you like post-punk?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really sure what that is. So... maybe?"
"__MUSIC__ Well you know how there was the big breakthrough of punk bands in the mid to late 70s..."
"__MUSIC__ yeah, Sex Pistols, the Ramones..."
"__MUSIC__ Right. They kind of freed up music again after years of it becoming this big-budget stadium spectacle event."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, punk was definitely more of a garage rock, anyone-can-do-it type of music."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, and there was an emphasis on keeping it simple at first...three-minutes-or-less songs, basic drum guitar bass combo..."
"__MUSIC__ So what does that have to do with post-punk?"
"__MUSIC__ Well post-punk was that wave of bands that came right after the punk breakthrough, who built on that new wave of freedom."
"__MUSIC__ So who do you think of as post-punk?"
"__MUSIC__ Well bands like Talking Heads, Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees..."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, didn't those bands used synthesizes at least some of the time?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, post-punk started out simple, but then they took that freedom of being able to break all the rules and do whatever and used it to start incorporating all sorts of different sounds into their music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so they could slip some funk and world music elements right in alongside their punk sound. Or not."
"__MUSIC__ It definitely sounds very arty."
"__MUSIC__ Well it was, a lot of those bands were just started at his kids who discovered punk while they were going to art school, and wanted to experiment musically and play whatever, but maybe not have to  dress like rock stars or shave their hair to Mohawks like some punks."
"__MUSIC__ This also kinda sounds like New Wave."
"__MUSIC__ Well New Wave was definitely more of an 80s thing, and almost always used synthesizers and was more pop-oriented the post-punk."
"__MUSIC__ if I remember right then, I think some of these 80s New Wave bands may have started out as post-punk acts in the 70s."
