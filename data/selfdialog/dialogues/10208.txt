"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't really understand whether there's a difference between rap and hip-hop. The language confuses me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's cool, a lot of people use them pretty interchangeably. But I was watching this awesome old film Wild Style that really showed how rap is an element of hip hop culture overall."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you mean 'an element'?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, hip hop is like the overall multi-media art form. It typically has four elements, it's just that we don't talk about some of them as much."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So what are these four elements?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Rap (the words), Dj-ing (scratching, turntables), dance, and graffiti"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, so rap is more the...verbal element?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah! I just think it's really interesting how we never really talk that much about graffiti or the visual style anymore."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I have no idea about any of that. I've seen some hip-hop influenced dance, though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but even that makes it sound like it came later, as opposed to being an integral part all along."
