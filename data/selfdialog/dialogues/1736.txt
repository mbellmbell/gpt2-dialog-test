"__MUSIC__ What do you think is the best music video of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ There have been a lot of great ones!"
"__MUSIC__ For sure. But what's #1 for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe the video for the song 'Come to Daddy' by Aphex Twins."
"__MUSIC__ I've never seen it, nor heard the song."
"__MUSIC__ The song is really awesome, very dark and sinister. The video kind of enhances it."
"__MUSIC__ Nice. I think my favorite is the music video for the song 'Black Hole Sun' by Soundgarden."
"__MUSIC__ Now that video, I have seen. And the song is wonderful."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Something about the combination of the song and the video really does it for me."
"__MUSIC__ When you think about it, music and images go together extremely well."
"__MUSIC__ That's two of the five senses!"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, smart guy. What I mean is that music is already emotionally powerful, and then when you add imagery, it enhances it even further."
"__MUSIC__ I knew what you meant, was just giving you a hard time."
"__MUSIC__ I think that Rock music naturally pairs the best with music videos."
"__MUSIC__ Really? In what sense?"
"__MUSIC__ The combination of guitar, sung vocals, and drums. I think it's a powerful pairing with imagery."
"__MUSIC__ Moreso that other instruments?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm thinking more about something like Hip Hop or R & B music. I like those genres, but not so much the music videos."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I can think of some great Hip Hop/R&B music videos, though. What about 'Crossroads' by Bone Thugs in Harmony?"
"__MUSIC__ Ah, true, that is a killer song. And video."
