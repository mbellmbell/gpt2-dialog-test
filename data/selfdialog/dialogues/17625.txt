"__MOVIES__ Do you ever worry that your kids will think that the historical movies today are really what happened?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Like that movie that Oliver Stone did, JFK?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Yes, I remember that with Kevin Costner?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one, I loved that Joe Pecsi character that had those dark painted on eyebrows."
"__MOVIES__ I saw a picture of the real man, he did look like that!"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  When we saw it at the movies, we were shocked.  It seemed like one big lie."
"__MOVIES__ I believe that Stone did a lot of research on the subject before he made it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I bet he put in a lot of 'poetic license' to make it more Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ Gee, I would have thought there was enough drama based on the real story alone."
"__MOVIES__ That was such a sad time wasn't it?  Well, at least it got my kids to see some real history."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but isn't that my question, was it real history?  Sometimes my kids tell me things that are just plain wrong."
"__MOVIES__ If they didn't see a Hollywood blockbuster they wouldn't know anything about back then."
"__MOVIES__ History is important, I wish Hollywood would take their responsibility seriously."
"__MOVIES__ As far as I know, Oliver Stone was deadly serious about it, he went on talk shows to argue his points"
"__MOVIES__ You mean promote the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he really seemed passionate about his arguments"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that congress actually opened an investigation after his movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't know that.  Maybe I should find a copy and watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ I bet the library has a copy of the movie you can watch with those wonderful extras now that they have DVDs"
"__MOVIES__ I guess even if they aren't accurate, movies get the conversation going again."
