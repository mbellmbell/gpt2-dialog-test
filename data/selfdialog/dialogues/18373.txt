"__MOVIES__ I feel I need to vent a little, ok?"
"__MOVIES__ On what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I am upset at Hollywood. I hate all the remakes they are producing."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they had more original ideas, but some look so good."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ The new IT. I think it will be even better than the original."
"__MOVIES__ That may be the exception. But most are poor imitations."
"__MOVIES__ I did hear they are redoing Labyrinth."
"__MOVIES__ Well at least that one is not a true remake. It is going to be more like a continuation."
"__MOVIES__ How can you continue without bowie?"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. maybe they won't have the jaret character?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard James franco is involved."
"__MOVIES__ I feel his stuff goes either way. Really good or awful."
"__MOVIES__ Ya, he has been all over with the quality of his stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, especially some of his own directing/producing."
"__MOVIES__ I have hope because he has been so good in some movies."
"__MOVIES__ I do enjoy some of his lighter work too. Like pineapple express is pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ It is the ultimate stoner film, but great!"
"__MOVIES__ I was surprised I enjoyed that film as much as I did."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Rogen adds a lot to the movie."
