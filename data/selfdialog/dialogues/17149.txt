"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did! It was so good!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good too, though I feel like some things could have been done better."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I felt like a good portion of people's lines were predictable."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, maybe a little bit, but that's part of the charm."
"__MOVIES__ If you say so, but I did like the new Darth Vader like guy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was a cool character, a little whiny though."
"__MOVIES__ He was kind of a brat, but he was at least fun to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I like his lightsaber, it's very different from what's been done in the other movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was cool to seem them try something new."
"__MOVIES__ I also like that there was a girl as the main character."
"__MOVIES__ She was very likable, very spunky and funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! She was so cool!"
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait for the next movie to come out, I hated that cliffhanger ending."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I didn't like it either, but I guess it had to be done."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of see what you mean. It's a good way to keep the audience thirsty for more anyways."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Disney has really been pushing the Star War's franchise lately."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they definitely are, there's a new generation of people to enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ True. There are quite a few people from the old generation to enjoy it too, though."
