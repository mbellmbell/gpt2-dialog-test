"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite music genre?"
"__MUSIC__ For me it's metal hands down and then I guess classical music."
"__MUSIC__ Now that's a weird line of preference."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't think that, because if you listen to some metal songs they have a lot of similarities to classical music."
"__MUSIC__ What makes you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just how many different instruments that can get used within the metal genre that are classical instruments."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have any examples of this?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say that Rhapsody of Fire - Emerald Sword is a pretty good example."
"__MUSIC__ What an interesting band name. Where is the band from?"
"__MUSIC__ It's an Italian symphonic power metal band."
"__MUSIC__ Symphonic power metal? Such a thing exists?"
"__MUSIC__ You would be surprised at how many different sub genres exist within metal."
"__MUSIC__ So metal isn't all with screaming vocals?"
"__MUSIC__ No far from it, some of the best singers I am familiar with are metal singers. I believe some of them would put pop singers to shame."
"__MUSIC__ I would like to see that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure there are metal bands that have done covers of pop songs."
"__MUSIC__ When you mention it I think I stumbled over Children of Bodom when they covered Oops I did it Again."
"__MUSIC__ That's one hilarious cover, shows us that they don't take themselves too serious."
"__MUSIC__ It's refreshing to see that not all bands take themselves super serious."
"__MUSIC__ Just a shame they don't earn the same kind of money as those pop stars."
