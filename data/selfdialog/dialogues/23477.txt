"__DISNEY__ Did you see the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I did! What did you think about it?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it! I thought the way they brought Will and Elizabeth back together was great!"
"__DISNEY__ Same! It's hard to believe the series has progressed to their children being old enough to have their own adventures."
"__DISNEY__ Seriously, where has the time gone?"
"__DISNEY__ Also, what did you think about Barbosa having a daughter?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow! That totally surprised me."
"__DISNEY__ Right? I couldn't believe it either."
"__DISNEY__ Too bad there won't be another one in the series, but at least this last one was great."
"__DISNEY__ I know. Well, onto bigger and better things I guess!"
