"__DISNEY__ Did you know they are making Toy Story 4?"
"__DISNEY__ What did not know that!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and Don Rickles who played Mr. Potato Head just died."
"__DISNEY__ Oh no. That is sad. What will they do?"
"__DISNEY__ Luckily all the voice work was already completed."
"__DISNEY__ That is good but still sad that he died."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. I wonder what the story line will be though?"
"__DISNEY__ I do too. Maybe it will focus on the toys in their new home."
"__DISNEY__ It would be really sad if they show the girl that Andy gave the toys to grow up and not want to play with them also."
"__DISNEY__ Don't be silly. They wouldn't do that."
