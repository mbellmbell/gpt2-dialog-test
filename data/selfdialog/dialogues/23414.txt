"__DISNEY__ So what did you think of Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was all right."
"__DISNEY__ Just all right? What didn't you like about it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it didn't make sense to me."
"__DISNEY__ What didn't make sense?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, a few things actually."
"__DISNEY__ Oh? Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, for one, why would anyone try selling ice in a kingdom that's made of ice?!"
"__DISNEY__ Haha, you goof! Did you really enjoy the movie or not?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I enjoyed it well enough. Especially the singing."
