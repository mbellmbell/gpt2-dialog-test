"__MOVIES__ Hey! So there's this new movie I really want to see. I saw it on Apple Trailers."
"__MOVIES__ What's it called."
"__MOVIES__ It's called The Ornithologist."
"__MOVIES__ Like someone who studies birds?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. It starts with a man in a canoe looking at birds through his binoculars."
"__MOVIES__ Then what happens? Where is the movie set?"
"__MOVIES__ It looks like they're on some quest for a bird. But there's also a lot of mystery involved. Well the film is Portuguese..."
"__MOVIES__ So it's set in Portugal?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so! They're in some sort of jungle or forest setting. The main character seems to be with some Chinese girls."
"__MOVIES__ Portuguese? Chinese? What language is it in? Are there subtitles?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you'll definitely need subtitles. There's a bit of English, but also Portuguese and Chinese."
"__MOVIES__ That's okay. I really don't mind subtitles."
"__MOVIES__ And you know what's cool? The director, Jo√£o Pedro Rodrigues, has sorta based this movie on a saint."
"__MOVIES__ Which saint? It sounds like a bit of a leap."
"__MOVIES__ Well the review in Variety calls it 'playfully blasphemous modernized hagiography' of the life of St. Anthony of Padua."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, now this sounds really cool. What else did that review say?"
"__MOVIES__ It says that 'arthouse' cinema fans will really like it, but faithfully religious viewers--not so much."
"__MOVIES__ I'm more of the first time. And I'm all about historical reinterpretations, no matter how indirect."
"__MOVIES__ Then I think you'd love it! I'm equally excited for the scenery and for the story."
"__MOVIES__ Even if it's strange, I want to see it too!"
