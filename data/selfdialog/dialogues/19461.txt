"__MOVIES__ I just saw the best movie!"
"__MOVIES__ What did you watch?"
"__MOVIES__ King Arthur:  Legend of the Sword"
"__MOVIES__ What did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's hard to describe.  It just seemed to have dry humor mixed with lots of action."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Jude Law plays the bad guy.  It also has Charlie Hunnam, I think his name is.  Eric Bana is also in it, but his brother kills him early in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Poor Eric Bana.  He should stop playing the part of the brother.  He died in Troy too."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny, I didn't even think about that."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Charlie Hunnan originally supposed to be in 50 Shades of Grey?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I heard that."
"__MOVIES__ I love Jude Law as an actor.  He was great in Sherlock Holmes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's great.  King Arthur is also a Guy Ritchie movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Who is Guy Ritchie?"
"__MOVIES__ He was the director of the Sherlock Holmes movies."
"__MOVIES__ That makes a lot of sense."
"__MOVIES__ You should definitely go see the King Arthur movie.  It's been out for a while now, so the theater shouldn't be too crowded."
"__MOVIES__ I will check it out."
"__MOVIES__ It's a great story."
"__MOVIES__ I like the legend."
