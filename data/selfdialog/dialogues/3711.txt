"__MUSIC__ Do you like Lindsey Stirling's music?"
"__MUSIC__ Sound a bit familiar, what kind of stuff does she do?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of electronica, but with classic music interwoven."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I think I might have heard her stuff at a rave one time. Like, violin combined with heavy beat?"
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like her, yes. She has classical music training, and I think that makes her music much more interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Is she anything like Bjork?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, other than being female and immensely talented, I don't think I would compare them too heavily. I do like Bjork also though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Bjork is amazing. Her musical style is insanely diverse."
"__MUSIC__ And her voice is divine. Vespertine was an amazing album, so dark and moody."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and the soundtrack she did for that movie she was in was fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ You mean Dancer in the Dark?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that one! One of my favorite movies, and the music was a perfect match for it."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Well, speaking of amazing women who do weird music, do you like Laurie Anderson?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! She's actually one of my favorites of all time. I remember hearing Big Science as a kid, it really blew my mind."
"__MUSIC__ I can see how that could blow a child's mind. Especially O Superman."
"__MUSIC__ The political message in that song is still so relevant to our times."
"__MUSIC__ Sadly true. I like her political perspective on things, and the way she plays with gender roles."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, I see what you mean. Those voice filters she uses are crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of political songs, Anderson's Only An Expert was pretty fabulous."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and such a catchy tune!"
