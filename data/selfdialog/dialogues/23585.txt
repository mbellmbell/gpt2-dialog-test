"__DISNEY__ Why?"
"__DISNEY__ Isn't it obvious? She owns a tiger."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, that's a good point. But Ariel is a mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but I don't want to have to hang out underwater."
"__DISNEY__ Good point."
"__DISNEY__ Plus Jasmine has a palace."
"__DISNEY__ So does Rapunzel from Tangled!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Jasmine has a palace AND a tiger."
