"__COMEDY__ Have you seen 'The Hangover' movies?"
"__COMEDY__ Only the first one, which I thought was pretty good. Not the others, though."
"__COMEDY__ I've seen all 3 and I agree, I think the first one is my favorite."
"__COMEDY__ So you wouldn't recommend the other two?"
"__COMEDY__ Not really - if you've seen the first one that's kind of all you need. Zach Galifanakis is just so funny."
"__COMEDY__ He was the main reason I watched the first one, actually."
"__COMEDY__ I'm glad he's getting a lot more movie roles. I always loved his stand up comedy."
"__COMEDY__ Me too, and he somehow brings that weird sense of humor to mainstream movies."
"__COMEDY__ He's one of the few actors where I know I'll laugh, so I'll see a movie just because he's in it."
"__COMEDY__ Same here - him and Will Ferrell are guaranteed to make a movie funny."
