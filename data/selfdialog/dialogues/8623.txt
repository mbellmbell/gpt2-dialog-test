"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite Beatle song?"
"__BEATLES__ I could be like most people and say Hey Jude or I wanna hold your hand, but I prefer some of their deeper stuff like A day in the Life or side 2 of Abbey Road (Golden Slumbers, et al)."
"__BEATLES__ The later songs are pretty good, but sometimes get too serious for me. I prefer the earlier hits."
"__BEATLES__ I can understand, but I think the true value of the Beatles as 'THE' Super Band is their later music."
"__BEATLES__ Probably is, but I just like their 'boy band' songs better, you know, I Saw her standing there and Eight Days a week."
"__BEATLES__ I get you, but for me songs like Tomorrow Never Knows and She's Leaving Home are more inspiring."
"__BEATLES__ You may be right. If I had to pick some of their later songs it would be ones like Penny Lane or Yellow Submarine."
"__BEATLES__ Those are fun and I think help move listeners over into their more serious stuff. Don't get me wrong, I think the great thing about the Beatles is that they are both fun and deep!"
"__BEATLES__ I agree, that's why that are the super group of all time!"
"__BEATLES__ What's the saying, if you don't like the Beatles you don't like music! LOL!"
