"__POP__ Who's your favorite pop artist that people don't know?"
"__POP__ Abra Moore!"
"__POP__ Who is that?"
"__POP__ Exactly."
"__POP__ Right, I got you. Tell me about her."
"__POP__ She had an album out in 1997 and had just one mini-hit."
"__POP__ What was that?"
"__POP__ Four Leaf Clover."
"__POP__ Not sure I know what it sounds like."
"__POP__ Again, that's what you asked. She has another album in 1995 that was good, an unreleased album, and two more that didn't chart."
