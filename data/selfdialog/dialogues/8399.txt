"__BEATLES__ Do you think the Beatles deserve to be considered great composers, along with Beethoven and the like?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, it's funny because just today I was watching an interview where Paul McCartney said that classical composers were the pop artists of their day."
"__BEATLES__ That's interesting to think about, yeah. And the Beatles helped the public see that."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, the obvious artistic quality of their music really helped the public rethink pop music in a big way."
"__BEATLES__ It's true! Though they also created a kind of false dichotomy, I think."
"__BEATLES__ You mean between 'Serious Pop' and 'Lightweight Pop,' right?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, exactly. Because people today still love to trash artists like Justin Bieber, comparing him to the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Well, his music doesn't seem too conceptually ambitious, to be fair. The Beatles just kept pushing things forward, artistically."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, when you look at how far they progressed since about 1963 to 1967 or 1968..."
"__BEATLES__ Totally! The leap from 'Love Me Do' to the White Album is incredible."
