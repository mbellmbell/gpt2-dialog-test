"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite part of The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love it when Han Solo and Chewbaka show up. I saw A New Hope decades ago when I was a kid, and seeing them again in a Star Wars film brought up great memories."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was great. But then it must have been quite a shock when Solo gets it."
"__STAR_WARS__ It sure was. I didn't hear any spoilers and didn't see it coming. I couldn't believe it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rey is a great new heroine though, and a great Jedi trainee."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, her character was handled well. Other than seeing Solo and Chewbaka, my favorite part was when she finds Luke Skywalker and delivers his light saber."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, he's only in the film for a few seconds but his presence has a terrific impact."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's for sure. And Mark Hamill is excellent. He fits right into the role as if he's never left."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. There's a lot to look forward to in the sequel."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can hardly wait."
