"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen all of the Star Wars films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yes, I'm a big fan so I've seen all of the movies many times. I almost have the dialogue memorized."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was your opinion on Rogue One? Do you think it was as good as the main Star Wars films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it very much. It was good to see some backstory for how the Rebel Alliance was able to capture the plans for the Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it too. It had a slightly more dark tone than the main series."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was definitely grittier than other Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ One amazing thing about the movie was the totally CGI characters, Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, on a technical level I was very impressed with the quality of the CGI. Just a few years ago such a thing would have been impossible."
"__STAR_WARS__ So what was your favorite thing about Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The entire third act with the epic space battle was just incredible. Probably the battle sequence out of all Stars Wars movies so that's saying a lot."
