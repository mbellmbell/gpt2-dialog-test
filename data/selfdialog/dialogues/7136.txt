"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hey! What did you think about the Bruins game last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Without Rask and Marchand they're falling apart!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Games like that make me reminisce about the '71 Bruins."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Forget the '71 team! All we need is Bobby Orr."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Even at 70 years old Bobby Orr could lead this season's team to victory."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, too bad we don't have better talent."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well they fire Coach Julien so whoever they get to replace him has got to be better."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No doubt. He'll bring in some real talent that isn't afraid to get rough."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They don't even need roughness. This team just needs more drive and passion."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree! If they really put an effort into it we'd be all set."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe next season will be better."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ We can only hope. I've been catching some minor league games recently and there is definitely talent out there."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The farm team for the Bruins is stacked."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I sure hope the new coach calls up some players from the minors."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think he will."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That will even open up space on the minors for some of these new college grads who look promising."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I was a UNH game last week and there were a couple guys out on the ice who made some great shots."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I heard about that game! The overtime slapshot was incredible."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah! I've got to get back to work, but I'll catch you at the Bruins game next week!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ See you there!"
