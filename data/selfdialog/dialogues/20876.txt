"__THRILLER__ Have you seen Gone Girl?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh my, that is one freaky movie."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I saw it in the theaters. I haven't watched in on TV because I think it'll freak me out when I'm alone."
"__THRILLER__ Ha ha.  Just as long as you don't live in the Midwest."
"__THRILLER__ But I do! I think the girl in that movie deserved an Oscar."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, she was great. Affleck was great too."
"__THRILLER__ I feel bad for him at the end.  I mean, he's bad but not that bad."
"__THRILLER__ I agree. I mean, she was a murderer."
"__THRILLER__ And had tried to get him to framed for murder."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that was a suprising movie."
