"__DISNEY__ Hey, did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I hear it was breaking all sorts of records when it came out."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I heard that too."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it. It followed the cartoon really closely, but there were some new scenes and some things were explained better."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ In the original animation, they said that the rose would bloom until his 21st birthday, and later they said that they'd been cursed for ten years."
"__DISNEY__ So... the prince was 11 when he got cursed?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. if some lady comes to my house and asks my 11 year old to let her in, I would want him to say no."
"__DISNEY__ Good point."
