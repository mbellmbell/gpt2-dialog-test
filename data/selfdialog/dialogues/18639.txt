"__MOVIES__ Hey can you help me with movies?"
"__MOVIES__ sure. what do you want to know?"
"__MOVIES__ so basically I am looking for some good action movie to watch."
"__MOVIES__ okay. does it have to be new or any will do?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess any will do, though it should be something that I haven't watched before."
"__MOVIES__ okay so in general how many actions movies have you seen so far?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess not many. I don't get much time to watch movies."
"__MOVIES__ oh. so how come you have time right now?"
"__MOVIES__ it's my summer vacation! now tell me a good movie!"
"__MOVIES__ okay sure. have you seen minority report?"
"__MOVIES__ I have heard that name before. But I am not sure if I have seen it."

"__MOVIES__ Oh yes! I have seen that one!"
"__MOVIES__ okay so let me guess another name."
"__MOVIES__ sure, tell me some awesome movie!"
"__MOVIES__ okay have you seen expandable series? it is totally 100% action."
"__MOVIES__ no I haven't seen that one.  You mean all action no story?"
"__MOVIES__ yes, kind of no story, but definitely lots of action."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I can try that kind of movie."
"__MOVIES__ sure. and if you like the first part, there are two more expandable movies. enjoy!"
