"__MOVIES__ I watched a really disturbing movie the other night."
"__MOVIES__ What was it called?"
"__MOVIES__ It was called We Need to Talk about Kevin."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that one.  Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Tilda Swinton and John C. Reilly.  It came out a few years ago.  I think it's based on a book."
"__MOVIES__ Why was it disturbing?"
"__MOVIES__ Well this lady has a baby and she doesn't really connect with him and he's really unruly.  Long story short he grows up and does something really terrible."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like something I'd like to watch."
"__MOVIES__ It made me want to go hug my son and tell him I love him."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Tilda Swinton in that new Marvel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Doctor Strange?  Yeah, she was in that movie.  She hardly seemed like herself though."
"__MOVIES__ I know at first I didn't even know it was her."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that movie was kind of weird.  I think they're planning to make more."
"__MOVIES__ I think they are.  Did you see the scene after the credits?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what was it?"
"__MOVIES__ He was sitting there with Thor and asking him to leave Earth and then they hinted that Doctor Strange would help Thor."
"__MOVIES__ Out of all the Avengers movies, I liked Thor the least."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  I thought Captain America was not great."
"__MOVIES__ That's true.  He's sort of a stupid superhero.  I mean he has a shield."
"__MOVIES__ The whole thing with him and Bucky was really annoying."
