"__MOVIES__ What types of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like a little bit of everything. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Same here, I'm not overly picky. Have you seen 'Fifty Shades of Grey'?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, but I'm not a big fan of it. Or the second one."
"__MOVIES__ I watched it mainly because of Jamie Dornan. I'm a fan of his."
"__MOVIES__ What other movies has he been in?"
"__MOVIES__ A bunch. 'Anthropod', 'Burnt', 'Flying Home'."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's cool. Have you seen 'The Notebook'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it makes me cry everytime I watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. It's a beautiful love story."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Noah, who was Ryan Gosling's character."
"__MOVIES__ He was so great to Allie. He loved her so much."
"__MOVIES__ He really did. I was happy they ended up together, but the ending was so sad."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really sad too, but almost bittersweet that they passed away together."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. What other movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like Tim Burton films. Those are a lot of fun."
"__MOVIES__ Like 'Beetlejuice'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's a classic."
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie, too. No one plays Beetlejuice like Michael Keaton."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed! He was so funny!!"
