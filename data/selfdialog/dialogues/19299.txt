"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite romantic comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Tough questions."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. I will accept your challenge!"
"__MOVIES__ Game on!"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is either 'When Harry Met Sally'..."
"__MOVIES__ That is a good one!"
"__MOVIES__ Or 'Serendipity.'"
"__MOVIES__ Sarah who?"
"__MOVIES__ Not Sarah! Serendipity!"
"__MOVIES__ Serendipity...wasn't that a child's book about a dinosaur?"
"__MOVIES__ I think you are right, but this is a totally different Serendipity!  This one starred John Cusak and Kate Beckinsale."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I like those actors!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it's about two people who meet by chance while shopping, and have a fun evening together."
"__MOVIES__ Sound simple enouigh."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but here is the kicker. At the end of the evening, the Kate Beckinsale character insists they part without telling each other who they are or how to find each other again."
"__MOVIES__ What? That's insane!"
"__MOVIES__ She insists that if they are meant to be together, fate will intervene and theywill be brought together again."
"__MOVIES__ That's nuts. So, did they find each other again?"
"__MOVIES__ Only after years of searching. It was really funny, and kind of cute too!"
