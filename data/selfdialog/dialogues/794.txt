"__MUSIC__ Do you like to Karaoke?"
"__MUSIC__ I usually just listen to music. I don't like to sing it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh come on. Haven't you ever sung in the shower."
"__MUSIC__ No actually."
"__MUSIC__ You got to try Karaoke sometime. Just let loose."
"__MUSIC__ I am a terrible singer and would just make a fool of myself."
"__MUSIC__ You know Karaoke is just about making a fool of yourself."
"__MUSIC__ Still, no!"
"__MUSIC__ Alright. So I'm planning for us to go to a karaoke bar this weekend with some friends."
"__MUSIC__ What!? No way I'm going."
"__MUSIC__ I already rented a room and invited friends and told them you were coming."
"__MUSIC__ You did not! You're kidding!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I'm kidding. But I really think you should at least try it."
"__MUSIC__ What's the big deal."
"__MUSIC__ I think if you're a bad singer, singing can be a fun way to get better and just have fun with friends."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ And if you don't like it, I promise you can never sing again."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, fine. If I don't like it, I'm going straight back to listening to music."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, no problem. This saturday?"
"__MUSIC__ Fine."
