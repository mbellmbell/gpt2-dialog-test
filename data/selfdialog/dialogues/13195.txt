"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will make the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man, its way too early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, but just for fun. Take a stab at it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm. I'll say Packers and Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ahh come on. That's boring. That's basically like picking all the #1 seeds in an NCAA bracket."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they both re-loaded in the offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, but if you had to pick two sleeper picks for the Super Bowl, what would you say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm. I'll say the Chargers and the Buccaneers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa, I've heard a lot of hype about Tampa Bay, but not really for San Diego."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I just think they have a lot of good pieces on offense and the AFC is pretty open after the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know much about their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither do I, but look at Rivers, Gordon, Gates, and Keenan Allen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow I forgot about Keenan Allen after his injury last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he's a monster when healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah last year I predicted him to be a top 5 fantasy WR, and took him in the 2nd round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch that hurts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm sure the injury hurt worse for him, but yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what else has got to hurt? The Chargers are leaving San Diego after the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that's a complete shame. The Chargers belong in San Diego."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, but a team in Vegas will be fun."
