"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think Snoke is?  Someone new or someone from the past?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he's someone new.  There are a lot of people he could be but I think they all have plot holes."
"__STAR_WARS__ One person I hope he is not is Palpatine.  He was a great bad guy, and powerful, but he's gone."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, if they did bring someone from the past maybe someone supremely powerful like Darth Plagous."
"__STAR_WARS__ That seems to be the prevailing wisdom.  Or maybe the guy who trained Yoda whomever that may be."
"__STAR_WARS__ Have not even given thought to that theory yet.  I have heard some theories about a return of Samuel L Jackson's character."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was one I hear too.  But I wouldn't be big on that as a plot device.  Even though you never saw him actually die."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and as we know in the Star Wars universe with Jedi, unless you see a body."
"__STAR_WARS__ He isn't dead."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just hope they don't do something lame."
