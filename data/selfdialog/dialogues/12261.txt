"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I never know what to make of the NFC Central. Do you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They used to call them the Black and Blue division because of how gritty they were."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe nobody's gritty anymore. I don't know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think the Packers will win that division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure there's much to stop them. They got Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rodgers kind of gets me. Great numbers all the time but only one Super Bowl ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could describe a lot of QBs, I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so but is it him or the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they haven't put a good enough team around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought you'd say that. Or maybe he's just not the winner he's cracked up to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not like the heyday with Bret Favre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's for sure. And Mike Holmgren as coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, after Holmgren left it kind of left with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should have let him have the general manager job and been coach too, then he would have stayed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I never understood why they didn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That west coast offense, he developed a lot of that stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but you know then he went to Seattle and I don't think he did so well there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. I guess you've always got to find the right combination."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like Landry and Staubach in Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, or Belachick and Brady in New England."
