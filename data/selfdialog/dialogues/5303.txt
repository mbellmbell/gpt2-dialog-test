"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think is the last jedi in the next Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it is Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think the last jedi will be Rey?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because at the end of The Force Awakens, Rey hands the light saber to Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes sense. So in The Last Jedi, do you think Luke will train Rey as a jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I think so."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Luke is Rey's father?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am thinking so, but I haven't read ahead in all of the books by George Lucas."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think The Last Jedi is coming out in theaters in December 2017."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and I am so excited!"
