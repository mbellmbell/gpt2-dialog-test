"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear about the NFL player complaining about the NFL salaries?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, what was he complaining about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's complaining that NBA stars make more money than NFL stars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's like apples and oranges, it's two different things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, and the pay structure is different, but it's not like these guys get paid peanuts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean. Actors and athletes make way too much money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This former player, Terrance Knighton, was complaining because some NBA stars had some big contract signings recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who were the NBA stars?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ James Harden from the Houston Rockets signed a contract for 228 million for the next six years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that is a LOT of money for playing with a ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know, it's crazy. Steph Curry from the Golden State Warriors signed a 5 year contract for 201 million."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what was Knighton's point about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was arguing Aaron Rogers is a more valuable athlete, and should earn more than Harden."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much does Rogers make?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's in the middle of a 5 year contract for 110 million."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not exactly peanuts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also argued Tom Brady should make more than Steph Curry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought Brady was very well paid?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's on a two year contract for 41 million."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that's the same as Curry then. They should all just be grateful they get paid as well as they do for playing a game for a living."
