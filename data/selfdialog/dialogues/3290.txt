"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Rap Music?"
"__MUSIC__ I really do not care for it at all"
"__MUSIC__ I don't either. You cannot even understand half of what they are saying."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, it does not even seem like music."
"__MUSIC__ I like the music from the seventies. They had some great bands."
"__MUSIC__ Sure did, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan to name a few."
"__MUSIC__ Let's not forget the Beatles, Credence Clearwater Revival and The Band."
"__MUSIC__ Wow.  I remember them all. They were all great!"
"__MUSIC__ Some great songs too, like Proud Mary by CCR and the Weight by the Band."
"__MUSIC__ Yea definitely. And how about those Southern Rock bands like The Outlaws and Lynryd Skynrd?"
"__MUSIC__ They were some great bands too."
"__MUSIC__ Todays music is nothing like it use to be."
"__MUSIC__ It is either loud and screaming or you just cannot understand the words."
"__MUSIC__ That is true."
"__MUSIC__ No one will even remember most of these musicians years from now. They will remember a few like Taylor Swift or Beyonce."
"__MUSIC__ Yes those who have really made a name for themselves."
"__MUSIC__ The rest will be forgotten and maybe they should be."
"__MUSIC__ You are not kidding."
"__MUSIC__ I wish I could go back in time and see the bands from the seventies again."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, that would be an experience."
