"__DISNEY__ The Little Mermaid has to be my favorite of all time"
"__DISNEY__ Really? I'm not really into the talking animals like Sebastian and Flounder."
"__DISNEY__ I love speaking Animals.  The imagination behind Ursula, and the curse of her stealing Ariel's voice is so fun to engage in."
"__DISNEY__ It definitely has to much imagination for me, but I'm sucker for Prince Eric and some romance plot."
"__DISNEY__ That's understandable.  You know I've always wanted a dog like Max, Eric's dog."
"__DISNEY__ Well, you sure you didn't want a fish with how much you love this little sea story?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess I wanted a bond like Eric had with Max.  Just like when he saved him from that burning ship."
"__DISNEY__ That's when he encountered Ariel right? Those love stories get me I guess."
"__DISNEY__ See, I knew you liked some part of the Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I do, but I think I relate more to Sebastian or Triton though."
