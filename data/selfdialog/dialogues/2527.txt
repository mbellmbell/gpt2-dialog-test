"__MUSIC__ What annoys you the most in music?"
"__MUSIC__ Commercial or classical?"
"__MUSIC__ Commercial."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I hate the over-sexualization of teenage girls, or those who look it."
"__MUSIC__ Like whom?"
"__MUSIC__ Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, Britney and Christina back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ So what if people find them sexy? As long as they're talented singers."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it brings unwanted attention to them and their bodies before they should have it."
"__MUSIC__ Fine."
"__MUSIC__ What's yours?"
"__MUSIC__ I absolutely hate the Picardy Third."
"__MUSIC__ What is that? This sounds technical."
"__MUSIC__ It's when a composer writes a piece entirely in minor, but ends the final chord in major instead."
"__MUSIC__ Why does that bug you? Seems like it's a happy ending."
"__MUSIC__ Because it takes a beautiful piece of music that's supposed to be sad, and ruins it at the very last second."
"__MUSIC__ True, but it's probably historically important."
"__MUSIC__ A bit. They used them back in the day to set up pairs of pieces that go together."
"__MUSIC__ So on their own they sound awful, but they make sense in a larger context?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like how all of life works!"
