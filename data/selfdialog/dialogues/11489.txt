"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you want to make a bet on the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What type of bet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A bet on the playoff teams, the person who predicts the most correct teams gets fifty dollars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure that sounds fun, I think the Patriots are the obvious pick we will both have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that is a foregone conclusion, they are pretty much guaranteed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you picking your Jaguars to make it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I want to win the money, they are not going to make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see, head before heart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, well at least you don't have to worry, I think your Packers are in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I also think they have a good shot at the Super Bowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably do, I think they improved enough in the off season to be a favorite to win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as Aaron Rodgers is there they have a shot at it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a game changing type of player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, he also came up big in the second half of last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can just imagine what he could do with a competent team around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah give him a better coach like the Patriots and the Packers have a dynasty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do not doubt that at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So anyway want to up the bet, lets make it an even one hundred."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can live with that, this season is going to be even better because of the stakes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, it's been great talking football with you."
