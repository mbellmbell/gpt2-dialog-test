"__STAR_WARS__ Would you ever want to see a movie about what went on between Empire and Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Without a doubt, clearly a lot went on with Luke, and Leia, and everyone for that matter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Besides just the healing of Luke.  Leia seemed to suddenly know a lot about Luke's powers for someone who hadn't seen them in previous movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Luke seemed to have much better control over them than he had at the end of Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ All the Skywalker's are like that.  They have enormous power."
"__STAR_WARS__ On that subject, I wonder how much Leia learned in the years between Jedi and the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, when Han died she clearly understood the force and knew how to use it.  I wonder if she carries a light saber."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be great if she did.  I want to see her fight."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's sad that Carrie Fisher died, I hope they gave her a good sendoff in The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet they did.  It is sad but her last movie is in her greatest and most well known role."
