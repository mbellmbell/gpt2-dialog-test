"__DISNEY__ I know it's not technically a 'princess' but my favorite Disney (non) princess is Pocohontas."
"__DISNEY__ I saw that when I lived In Zurich, Switzerland."
"__DISNEY__ Disney is beloved everywhere."
"__DISNEY__ This was a really cool showing. It was in a park in downtown Switzerland and hey showed it outside like a drive in movie."
"__DISNEY__ That must have been fun."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, it was. For a mere 10 Swiss Francs we got to see the movie, were issued a heavy cardboard 'stool' that we all put together ourselves, and a box of popcorn."
"__DISNEY__ That's a lot for 10 francs."
"__DISNEY__ You bet is was. And the funniest thing happened 1/2 way through the movie."
"__DISNEY__ What was that?"
"__DISNEY__ The ground was soft from an earlier rain so half way through the movie, one by one people's cardboard stools collapsed and you'd just see heads disappear. It was funny. I fell, too."
