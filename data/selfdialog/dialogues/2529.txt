"__MUSIC__ What did  you think of the new Linkin park  track?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was solid   but missing  its original feel"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the vocals just  did not hit the same  was  as  tracks like in the  end ."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think some of the message  got lost  as well?"
"__MUSIC__ Some what  it did  seem  a little dumbed  down   ,"
"__MUSIC__ And it just did not have  the same punch to the  gut  right ?"
"__MUSIC__ Thats part of it   it just felt so  artistic now ."
"__MUSIC__ Would  you like to  see  them  go back to  their roots  more ?"
"__MUSIC__ Well even the  remix  they did  with Jay  seemed  very edgy at  the time ."
"__MUSIC__ I would   like  to  see  the orignial members  all come back  together myself ."
"__MUSIC__ I  think thats part of it  too the  chemistry is  just  kind of  off ."
"__MUSIC__ Would  you go see them perform  live  still?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I am sure   they still perform  amazing  live  and  I like  their older  stuff  still ."
"__MUSIC__ Who  do you think  should  open  for  them ?"
"__MUSIC__ I  think  a band  like  chevelle  or  hinder  would  sound  great with them ."
"__MUSIC__ I would  also like to hear some of the older  stuff  that did not make  the cd  cuts  ."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder  how much of that would be   hits ."
"__MUSIC__ I  am sure  we will  see them  get  better with time  again"
"__MUSIC__ I hope  so too"
