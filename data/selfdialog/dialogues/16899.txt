"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new King Kong?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Isn't it a sequel to the new Godzilla though?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but they share a universe."
"__MOVIES__ So what does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It means eventually we'll be getting a Godzilla vs. Kong movie."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, is it true that they can't call him King Kong anymore? I think I heard that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, some trademark issue or something. They get around it with the tagline 'Kong is King'."
"__MOVIES__ Clever. But yeah, I haven't seen it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe you should I thought it was pretty fun."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'll watch it sometime, whenever I get around to it."
"__MOVIES__ I actually like it more than Peter Jackson's King Kong movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I feel like Jackson's movie had more spectacle, but this new movie just more fun."
"__MOVIES__ I did like the new Godzilla, so I'll definitely check it out at some point."
"__MOVIES__ You know, the director of Godzilla also did Rogue One."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Did he do the new Kong, too?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. He's going to be doing the Metal Gear Solid movie next."
"__MOVIES__ They're making that into a movie? I never thought it would happen."
"__MOVIES__ Who knows, it might not. Movies have a way of not happening sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, development hell is a thing for a reason."
