"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You ready for football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I can't wait. Ready to see these Bills get it going."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully, they got a good reboot in during the offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully. I'm glad Rex Ryan is gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. You know how much I hate him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is the worst. All he thinks about are the Pats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, right? Like, dude, focus on your OWN team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And his brother's defense was, of course, trash."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certified trash. How many games did they lose?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think at least 9."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a shame. Tyrod Taylor looks like he has some potential."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right? It's criminal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then, of course, y'all have Watkins and McCoy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is McCoy still there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, but maybe not. But still... Watkins and Taylor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's a deadly duo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Watkins needs to stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck, so does Tyrod."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I think they can make the playoffs this year, for sure."
