"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I like Hunchback of Notre Dame."
"__DISNEY__ I like that one too. It's a pretty intense movie for kids, no?"
"__DISNEY__ I know right? What with it talking about lust, genocide, murder, and all that."
"__DISNEY__ I guess they expect those things to just fly over kid's heads."
"__DISNEY__ I know right? Just focus on the singing gargoyles."
"__DISNEY__ Plus they did make the ending less depressing. Everyone dies in the original version."
"__DISNEY__ I know, they did that with The Little Mermaid too."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that's another one that ends on a pretty depressing note in the original."
"__DISNEY__ I guess it makes sense they had to change these things."
