"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What rapper do you think doesn't get enough credit?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Big Sean, for sure. He is super goofy and completely misses with his lyrics sometimes, but.."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But what?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He is a super positive rapper and he has the most fun cadences and ad libs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I only know a few of his ad libs, like 'BOY' and 'I DO IT.' You're right, those are fun."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I really like how fun and goofy they are and I also like that he doesn't have to pretend to be some super hard gang member. He's putting himself out there saying this is who I am, take it or leave it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, he has a few songs about finding your passion, appreciating your family, and working really hard. Definitely a positive message."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, he writes songs like 'Bounce Back' which are about being resilient and struggling through adversity."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's super confident on that track. I think it has a great message personally."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's so true! Whether it's sports, music, business, relationships or whatever human endeavor, one has to be resilient and 'bounce back.'"
