"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I went to the club the other night and guess what song came on?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think I already know what you're going to say, but Back That Azz Up??"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Haha yeah, honestly every time I go out I hear that song being played at least 5-6 times."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ By far the greatest song Juvenile ever put out. It just flows, perfect for playing in a club. The girls go wild when they hear it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Girls aren't the only ones that go wild when it's played, I get loose as soon as that iconic beat drops!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm listenig to it rite now! I wouldn't call it Juvenile's greatest song though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ok I'm game, what's Juvenile's greatest song then?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Slow Motion is the best Juvenile song in my opinion. It's just as iconic as Back That Azz Up but Juvenile collaborated with Souja Slim for Slow Motion."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I always forget Souja Slim was part of Slow Motion, I wish he was still alive, the music he made was top of the line."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, it's ashame he was killed but I guess that shows you how gangsta he really was."
