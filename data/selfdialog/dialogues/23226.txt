"__DISNEY__ When I was a kid, I loved going to Magic Kingdom. My favorite park has to be Hollywood Studios, though."
"__DISNEY__ Can't beat Epcot, that place has everything!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it does, but I still like the whole 'retro' thing, best. Didn't the Norway ride get replaced?"
"__DISNEY__ They practically turned the whole place into Arendelle for Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ I sometimes hear little kids still singing 'Let It Go' when I'm walking through the mall."
"__DISNEY__ You've been to Animal Kindgom, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Once, but it was sweltering! I hate it when it gets that hot!"
"__DISNEY__ They're putting in a new Avatar thing in Animal Kingdom."
"__DISNEY__ Seriously? It feels like only a short time ago they put in that new restaurant at Magic Kingdom."
"__DISNEY__ That one? Yeah, you have to wait for years to eat there."
