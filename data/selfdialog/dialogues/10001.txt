"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's this huge stack of CDs?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well remember I was going to loan you some Class A'z?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ This is all Class A'z?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ About half of it is."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's the rest?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well Class A'z has consisted of several different artists who've also done other stuff, so some of it is that group as a whole and some of it is the individual artists' solo ventures."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh cool! This looks like it will take a long time to get through"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Don't feel obligated to continue listening to an album if you're not digging it, but I'm sure you'll find some good stuff in there."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Thanks, I really wanted to expand my musical horizons."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No problem!"
