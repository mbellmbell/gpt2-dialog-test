"__MOVIES__ Do you want to go see a movie with me?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, what sort of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like a lot of things, but right now I'm in the mood for an action/adventure type of movie."
"__MOVIES__ Everyone is talking about Transformers, but I'm ambivalent. Have you seen Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ No but I heard a lot about it."
"__MOVIES__ Really, what have you heard?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's see, it is mostly set during World War I."
"__MOVIES__ Is it historically accurate?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, they take a lot of liberties, but it is fun."
"__MOVIES__ How is the acting?"
"__MOVIES__ I've only heard good things. They cast Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and the lady from Princess Bride (Robin Wright) as a major amazon."
"__MOVIES__ I used to love that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I was constantly quoting. I love the 'land war in Asia' thing."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is to say 'Inconceivable' in a silly voice."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's weird that it became such a cult classic, but I love it. What else is so quotable?"
"__MOVIES__ Terminator is one everyone knows, even if they never watched the movie."
"__MOVIES__ 'Come with me if you want to live!'"
"__MOVIES__ And 'I'll be back!'"
"__MOVIES__ I really like the plot of the first one, and maybe the second."
"__MOVIES__ But the circles in the next bunch of movies can drive you crazy."
