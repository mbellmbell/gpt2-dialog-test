"__MOVIES__ What movies are on tv right now?"
"__MOVIES__ I looked a few minutes ago.  I couldn't really find anything"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, Shakespeare In Love is on."
"__MOVIES__ Uggh.  Don't you dare."
"__MOVIES__ What about.. let's see.. Blair Witch Project"
"__MOVIES__ That works. Make sure it's not the sequel though."
"__MOVIES__ I take it you didn't like the sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen it?  It made no sense."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't even explain it because of weird it was.  The characters did this and then couldn't understand what happened."
"__MOVIES__ Uh huh.."
"__MOVIES__ And then they're like 'Oh sorry, this may not have happened, this is what may happened.' and then show you something else and you're just left confused as heck."
"__MOVIES__ Anyone famous in it?"
"__MOVIES__ No and the first one wasn't either but at least it made a bit more sense."
"__MOVIES__ How about The Odd Couple?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't know that was on."
"__MOVIES__ It just started.  I love the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too especially when Walter Matthau picks up the linguini and throws it up against the wall and says 'Now, it's garbage'."
"__MOVIES__ I love whenever they play poker with their friends.  They all just play off each other and it's hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah.  Vinnie playing with his chips and talking about how he has to leave early but keeps winning."
