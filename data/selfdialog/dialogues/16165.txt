"__ROCK__ So what's the best concert you've been to?"
"__ROCK__ I've been to a lot, but hands down, The Rolling Stones was the best."
"__ROCK__ It's really hard to believe those guys are still touring now in their 70s."
"__ROCK__ I saw them about 20 years ago when they were in their 50s, and they had the energy of 30 year olds."
"__ROCK__ They are one of those 'timeless' rock bands, that you can imagine their music being played long after they're gone."
"__ROCK__ Oh, I know, like Wild Horses- wild horses, couldn't drag me awayyyy."
"__ROCK__ Everyone made such a big deal over the Beatles, but I always liked The Rolling Stones better."
"__ROCK__ The Beatles only lasted a decade, but The Stones have evolved over decades and had a much longer career."
"__ROCK__ I'm amazed Keith Richards has lasted so long considering what a bad boy he was."
"__ROCK__ That's one of the things I love about the Stones though, is how the band members have stuck together."
