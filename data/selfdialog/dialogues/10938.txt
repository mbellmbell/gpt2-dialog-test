"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what do you think about the Dolphins quarterbacks this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, obviously you need to start with Ryan Tannehill."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had that knee injury late last year, and I heard there were questions about his recovery during the off-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At this point it doesn't look like that will be an issue.  He will wear a brace, but he has looked good in camps so far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeas, but those are just camps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, we won't know for sure until games start and he needs to put stress on the knee or he takes a hit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about his progress as a quaterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is his second season under Adam Gase, and it looks like he has really started to improve."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We have heard that before with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but his progress does seem pretty genuine.  He looks like the leader this team needs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about his problems with accuracy on the deep ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you look at his numbers from last year, you will see that stat is actually misrepresented.  When his line gave him time, he was one of the better deep passers in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about his troubles on third down and in the red zone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More experience for the team in the offense should help, as should the addition of Julius Thomas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the backup quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Moore is back as the primary backup, and he is one of the best in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, no worries there.  What about the future?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a couple young players in Brandon Doughty and David Fales."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither of them is replacing Matt Moore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, they are both projects.  Their job right now is to learn and see how they develop."
