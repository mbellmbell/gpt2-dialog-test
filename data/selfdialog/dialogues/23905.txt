"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think Captain America: Civil War succeeded as a Captain America movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, yeah, he's the main character."
"__SUPERHERO__ I mean, instead of it being an Avengers-focused movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, got you. Umm, yes, I think so."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why?"
"__SUPERHERO__ It was mostly about him, his beliefs and how they jarred against Tony's, and how this broke up the team."
"__SUPERHERO__ What about Bucky?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm not sure that matters. Yes, it is part of his character and his morals, but the Bucky thing doesn't work for me."
"__SUPERHERO__ The 'Bucky thing?'"
"__SUPERHERO__ His memory was wiped yet he's always on Cap's side. Doesn't seem like it would actually happen."
