"__MUSIC__ How well do you know the band Modest Mouse?"
"__MUSIC__ Not too well, I just remember there one giant hit, 'Float On.'"
"__MUSIC__ That is the song most people know them by. Did you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was strange sounding for sure, but also magnetic and compelling. It wasn't like anything I knew when it came out in 2003."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! That's what drew me to them as a band initially. Their weirdness and idiosyncracies."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, weird can be good. There's for sure good weird in music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Float On isn't exactly characteristic of all of their stuff. My favorite stuff is their earlier stuff and it's way different."
"__MUSIC__ How so? What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ For the most part it's less produced, but it's also moodier and less poppy."
"__MUSIC__ So even weirder?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, even weirder, but in the greatest way imaginable."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what do you recommend I check out?"
"__MUSIC__ I think their absolute masterpiece is the Lonesome Crowded West."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you pick that one?"
"__MUSIC__ It's about America. It's still relevant today."
"__MUSIC__ About America in what sense?"
"__MUSIC__ It's about alienation, mass culture, sprawl, road trips, religion, seedy night clubs, banking, lawyers, and more."
"__MUSIC__ That does all sound like America. When did it come out?"
"__MUSIC__ That's the amazing thing. It came out in 1997, which is now twenty years ago, but it is still super relevant."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'm adding it to my queue now on Spotify. You've sold me."
