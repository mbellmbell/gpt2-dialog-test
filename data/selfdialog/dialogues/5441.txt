"__STAR_WARS__ What happened in Force awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Didn't you watch the movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I did, but I fell asleep in the middle of it."
"__STAR_WARS__ What! It was so good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I had a really rough night before."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's kind of fuzzy, but basically Rey ge's captured by Kylo ren, and escapes, then she learns she is a jedi, and wins the fight against Kylo ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's pretty awesome. Were the fights cool?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Actually there weren't too many fights, but there a lot more in Rogue one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll have to watch that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, let's watch it together. I'll watch it again."
