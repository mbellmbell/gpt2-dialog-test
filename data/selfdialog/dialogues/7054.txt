"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hey, are you at all interested in ice hockey?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, I've never actually seen a match, but I like ice skating."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If you're into ice skating, you should definitely look into ice hockey! We're currently recruiting new members for our team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Huh. You don't require people with more experience?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ We encourage everybody to try out. Even if you don't make the main team, you can still join us in some of our practices."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Really? That sounds interesting."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Great! Tryouts are tomorrow at 8. Let me know if you want to practice before then."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's so nice of you! I definitely wouldn't mind an overview of the rules."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hahaha, it would be my pleasure. What do you know?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, I know you have a stick. And hit the ball."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You mean the puck."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, the puck."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Anything else?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ There are goals you shoot off?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, that's enough to get started with, I think. Want to go practice puck handling techniques?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Definitely! Do you have an extra stick I could borrow?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yup! Do you have ice skates already."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, I have my own pair."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Great. Have you been to the rink before?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, so I'll just follow you."
