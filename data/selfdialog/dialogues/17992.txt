"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure how I feel about them making another sequel to Toy Story."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they kind of ended it pretty well with Toy Story 3."
"__MOVIES__ It was a great cap on the nostalgia for those who grew up with the series."
"__MOVIES__ Though I think people were apprehensive about 3 too and that turned out good."
"__MOVIES__ True, Pixar can generally do no wrong, they're pretty solid."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah even if it's not as good as past entries there's no doubt it will still be a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ But it's Toy Story I feel like there's a standard there, it needs to be great."
"__MOVIES__ We're talking about a movie that is about talking toys."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but it's more than just that, there's a message, like all of their movies."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose so, but they're largely marketed towards kids."
"__MOVIES__ And that's the beauty of it, the depth that exists within them even though they're marketed at kids."
"__MOVIES__ That is definitely a thing I like about animated movies these days."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah there's a lot of subtext in even stuff like Zootopia."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of, Zootopia was an instant classic."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah we're pretty spoiled when it comes to animated movies these days."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding, Moana was another stupdendous flick."
"__MOVIES__ Disney is still churning out the goods, even if they aren't hand drawn like people want."
"__MOVIES__ I have nothing wrong with CGI animation these days, people need to get with the times."
"__MOVIES__ Even though the cartoon Disney movies were beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I can't disagree there."
