"__HORROR__ Have you seen The Autopsy of Jane Doe?"
"__HORROR__ No I haven't but isn't Emile Hirsch in that?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox play a father and son who run a business operating a coroners office. The local sheriffs bring in an undamaged body from a heinous crime scene and want them to figure out her cause of death."
"__HORROR__ Wow, that sounds pretty intriguing! This is a horror movie right?"
"__HORROR__ Oh yes it definitely is a horror movie. The suspense is excellent. There's a huge aura of mystery and the uneasiness I felt watching this was so terrifying it was good."
"__HORROR__ Does the whole film take place in this coroners office?"
"__HORROR__ Pretty much, it takes place in the coroners office which gives it a creepy claustrophobic feel. The setup is very terrifying and the suspense as they're trying to figure out Jane's death is so unnerving."
"__HORROR__ Is this more supernatural horror?"
"__HORROR__ There's definitely a supernatural horror element about this film. I won't spoil much but the first half of the movie during the autopsy on Jane is really startling with each discovery they find, and there's a lot of strange happenings that occur in the coroners office after the body arrives."
"__HORROR__ This sounds really good. I'll have to give it a watch! I think I remember Andre Orvedal directed it, he did a fantastic job with his other movie called Troll Hunter. I'll have to look for this!"
