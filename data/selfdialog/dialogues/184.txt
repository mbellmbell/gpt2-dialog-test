"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like pop, but I also like country and alternative."
"__MUSIC__ If you like pop and country, you must like Taylor Swift!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm a fan. I liked her more when she was country though."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I feel like she gained a lot of fans after the release of 1989."
"__MUSIC__ It was a good album, but I feel like going towards pop music was a sell-out for her."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's surprising. 1989 was the best selling album of 2014!"
"__MUSIC__ I had read that online, I thought she would have more competition."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Adele and Ed Sheeran didn't release albums that year."
"__MUSIC__ That's right- Sheeran's newest album came out in 2017."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's called 'Divide'. It's really good."
"__MUSIC__ I like 'Castle on a Hill' from that album."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, it's used in a trailer for an upcoming movie."
"__MUSIC__ For the movie Ferdinad!"
"__MUSIC__ You're right. I hope he wins a grammy this coming year."
"__MUSIC__ He has a good chance. Harry Styles, could too."
"__MUSIC__ Harry's new album is so different from his One Direction songs."
"__MUSIC__ I agree- it's more rock than pop."
"__MUSIC__ I think it shows how he has involved as an artist."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. He's already leading the 2017 Teen Choice nominations."
