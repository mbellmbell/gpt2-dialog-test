"__STAR_WARS__ Is that the one with Rey in it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and John Boyega."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who's Jon Boyega?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Boyega plays the storm trooper who doesn't want to kill anymore."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, he's the guy following Rey halfway around the universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right and Luke is in it but only in the last minute."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's been so long I forgot half the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ You remember, Harrison Ford dies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, you mean Han not the actor?"
