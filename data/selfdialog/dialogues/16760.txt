"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't, I am not really into comic book movies."
"__MOVIES__ Do you watch any of them at all?"
"__MOVIES__ I have seen a few, Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool, Watchmen, and others like that."
"__MOVIES__ Batman?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, I watch all of Nolan's movies."
"__MOVIES__ Batman Begins was one of the best comic movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, it would be tough to be better than that."
"__MOVIES__ Wonder Woman isn't quite as good but it is close."
"__MOVIES__ That is pretty high praise."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really good, and the reviews for it are great too."
"__MOVIES__ I will probably check it out, I do like the casting."
"__MOVIES__ You mean Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I feel like her look fits the role perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ She does a great job but honestly I never thought she was the best actress."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that, she had always been more for the eye candy."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, she is quite beautiful, and her acting isn't terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, it is passable but not great."
"__MOVIES__ Hope you give it a chance, let me know what you think."
"__MOVIES__ I will make sure to do that!"
