"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some people think that Tom Brady is too old to play football.  I think he is a bundle of energy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How old is he?  Isn't he almost forty?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is 39."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know you are his fan.  Good luck to you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aren't you a Seahawks' fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So-so.  My brother is the real fan in our family and I support him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that The Seattle Seahawks has just signed a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think so.  I have not had time following footballs lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The new guy's name is Austin Davis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You more much more about Seahawks than I do even though you are a Patriots' fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like football in general.  I enjoy college football too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To tell you the truth, I enjoy college football games more than NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because it is not about money.  Professional football players might not be loyal to their team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree.  They might move to a different team if they got a better offer financially."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is exactly what I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am going to go to a sports bar for the game.  Let me know if you would like to join me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay.  I will email you the address."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thank you.  Talk to you later."
