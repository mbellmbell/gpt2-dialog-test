"__MUSIC__ Do you follow current music much?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and no. I hear the big hits on the radio, but I wouldn't say I am an avid follower."
"__MUSIC__ Is there any specific genre you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I enjoy most music and I'm sure I can find at least one song in any genre that I would listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I really like one-hit wonders."
"__MUSIC__ What?! That's not exactly a genre."
"__MUSIC__ I know. But I find it fascinating that a group or artist can have one amazing song that everyone knows, and essentially never be heard from again."
"__MUSIC__ That is kind of weird isn't it? Do you have a favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Not in particular, but I like a lot of the 80s ones."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, like Tainted Love, Come On Eileen, and I'm too Sexy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but believe it or not, I'm too Sexy was from the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ It has such an 80s vibe though!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it was in 1991."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that makes sense. I feel like the style of the decade always carries over a few years."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have any one-hit wonders that you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a lot that I like, but who can say no to Macarena!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, the Macarena. The dance craze that never dies!"
"__MUSIC__ Also, for some reason I really love the song My Sharona."
"__MUSIC__ Who sang that one again?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was The Knack."
