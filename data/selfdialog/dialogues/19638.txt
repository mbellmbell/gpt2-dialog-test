"__MOVIES__ I'm a big Jane Fonda fan, I can't wait to watch Klute."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen Klute is it a new film?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Klute came out in the seventies when Jane Fonda was making a lot of movies."
"__MOVIES__ I think I've heard of that film, does she play a waitress?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, but I think she plays a secretary who witnesses a murder."
"__MOVIES__ That was a popular theme in movies from the seventies."
"__MOVIES__ What was the last good horror movie you watched?"
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed It Follows, I can't stop thinking about it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the trailer for It Follows, it looked really good."
"__MOVIES__ Don't Breathe looks to be a really frightening movie as well."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I've seen the trailer, what is Don't Breathe about?"
"__MOVIES__ Some young people decide to rob a blind man, but it turns out he's a serial killer."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds amazing, I'm really into movies like that."
"__MOVIES__ The plot from Klute reminds me of Dressed to Kill, the DePalma film from the eighties."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Dressed to Kill, and I can see what you mean about the plot similarity."
"__MOVIES__ Being in the wrong place at the wrong time is a popular cinematic plot device."
"__MOVIES__ I think movies from the seventies have a quality that I really appreciate."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I think it may have something to do with the film stock that was used back then, they have a distinct look."
"__MOVIES__ Don't get me started on DePalma, Scorsese and the rest of those directors, I could talk forever!"
"__MOVIES__ Now those were some of the best when it came to making great movies!"
