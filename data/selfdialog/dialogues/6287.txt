"__STAR_WARS__ Did you hear that Carrie Fisher died?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I did. I wonder what they're going to do about Princess Leia in the new Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they're going to kill her character off like they did with Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but they would have to do it off screen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they could have another actress play Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think they could replace such a classic character."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, I guess they'll just have to figure something out."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if they will have to change the plot around to reflect Kylo Ren's parents both being dead."
"__STAR_WARS__ A lot of the characters don't seem to have parents though - Leia, Luke, Anakin, Ray all were missing parents."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I can't wait to see what they do."
