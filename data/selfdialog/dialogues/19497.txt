"__MOVIES__ My birthday was last week, and I was pleased to see that Wonder Woman is out and I got to see it that night on my birthday."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! Great! What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I hoped that it would be amazing, but it definitely had pros and cons."
"__MOVIES__ So, it wasn't everything that you hoped it would be?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it had some plot holes for one."
"__MOVIES__ That's a movie that many people, especially females, have been hoping to see on the big screen for many years, so that is a shame."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is! They finally did a superhero for females, so it should have been made as close to flawless as possible."
"__MOVIES__ What were some of the flaws?"
"__MOVIES__ The most glaring thing is that about 75% of the way through it it seemed to drag on because not much was going on."
"__MOVIES__ I hate when that happens. What was another flaw?"
"__MOVIES__ The first half of the movie seemed very believable, but at some point, they turned into a cliche love story."
"__MOVIES__ Hm, that's annoying. What did you think of the actress who played Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, she was amazing! Now, she was totally believable, and she is beautiful, too."
"__MOVIES__ What about her love interest?"
"__MOVIES__ He was okay. He was really handsome, but I didn't love his acting."
"__MOVIES__ Was there anyone else who stood out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! The love interest in the movie had a secretary. She was great! She has a heavy accent and she was very funny."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great. Did the audience laugh out loud at all?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! We did, many times. I thought the movie was worth seeing because of her and the actress who played Wonder Woman, though."
"__MOVIES__ I will have to check it out. Thank you!"
