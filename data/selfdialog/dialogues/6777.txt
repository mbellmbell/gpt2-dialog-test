"__STAR_WARS__ So how 'realistic' would you say A New Hope, the first Star Wars movie, is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's funny that you bring that up, because when you think of Star Wars as opposed to, like, a 1950s sci-fi movie, it becomes apparent."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean that it was revisionist, in the sense of how Westerns started to change?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I think so, because certain tropes get played around with."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like Princess Leia as a damsel in distress, or Chewbacca as a big scary creature..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, and what people say a lot is that the Star Wars universe looks 'lived-in.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like an old pair of jeans, you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, exactly -- characters wear kind of rough, worn-out looking garments, especially on Tattooine, and the ships look kind of broken down."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whereas in those 1950s movies, there is a kind of postwar optimism in how we see the future..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, everything is shiny and new, but in Star Wars, it's a galaxy that's a lot more like our own sort of drab world."
