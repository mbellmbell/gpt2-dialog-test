"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah you're right all the cool movies should come out this summer."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I usually hang out with a bunch of friends at the Hillsboro Park. Sometimes they have free concerts along with the farmers market there. Usually Starts in late April til around early August."
