"__BEATLES__ Of the Beatles' later albums, which is your favorite?"
"__BEATLES__ Abbey Road, without a doubt. It really displays the strengths of each member."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, there's a lot to like on that record, but overall, I think I'm put off by the slickness of it. It's like you can hear the 1970s looming ahead."
"__BEATLES__ Hey, there's nothing wrong with that! I love that side 2 medley."
"__BEATLES__ There are lots of high points, but still I prefer the rough edges and inconsistency of Let It Be--I think I'm the only one!"
"__BEATLES__ But that album is such a downer."
"__BEATLES__ I don't know, it just feels more human to me somehow. And who doesn't love the title track and Hey Jude?"
"__BEATLES__ What do you think of the stripped down version that came out a few years ago, the one without the Phil Spector production?"
"__BEATLES__ I gave it a listen. I like how it gives some insight into what they were thinking at the time, but you can't really go back in time and re-experience it as new."
"__BEATLES__ I know what you mean--a lot of water under the bridge since then!"
