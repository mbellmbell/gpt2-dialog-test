"__MUSIC__ Hey do you remember Paula Abdul's music?"
"__MUSIC__ Who is she, isn't she some judge on American Idol or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Something like that, but back in the nineties she was a pop singer!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?  I didn't even know that!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah!  She had some great songs like Opposites Attract and Straight Up."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I ever even heard of her back then."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, she was pretty popular.  I bet you heard them you just didn't know it was her."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, maybe so.  Why did she quit making music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she just fizzled out or maybe got too old."
"__MUSIC__ Was she like a one hit wonder?"
"__MUSIC__ No, there was more than one hit.  She had a bunch."
"__MUSIC__ A bunch of hits or a bunch of albums?"
"__MUSIC__ I think there were at least several albums but she had a bunch of hits."
"__MUSIC__ I loved Janet Jackson back then."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so did I.  But they really had the same style of music."
"__MUSIC__ All that dance pop music of the nineties was great."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  I'm surprised you never heard of her."
"__MUSIC__ Well I have now.  I can go google her and listen to some of her old stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny, I'm sure you'll find some of it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure I will!"
