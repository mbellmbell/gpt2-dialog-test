"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will there be a race in the NFC South next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There might be.     Which teams do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't think they will compete, but even the Carolina Panthers have improved."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, there defense was pretty good last season, even with Luke Kuechly out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So next up is the New Orleans Saints?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will improve, but I don't know how much better than 0.500 they can be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aren't they trying to sign Adrian Petersen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is the word on the street, but that probably is not enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The second place team last year was Tampa Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they made the wildcard game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will they do the same this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have improved and have a chance, but I do not see another playoff run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK.     That leaves the Atlanta Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.    Team on the rise, and they might even make the Super Bowl against Houston or New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow!    That's quite a prediction."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are that good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great, you think the NFC South will look a lot like last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Atlanta and Tampa at the top, yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about at the bottom."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it could go either way with New Orleans and Carolina."
