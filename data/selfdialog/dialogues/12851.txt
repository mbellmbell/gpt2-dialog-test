"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think anyone can beat the Patriots this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to think so, but they always seem to come through."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. That huge comeback against Atlanta in the Super Bowl was infuriating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Tom brady isn't going anywhere any time soon, either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, and they should have Rob Gronkowski back at tight end, also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, plys they added Mike Gilleslee from the Bills for backfield help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I am not sure anyone in the AFC can challenge them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely not in the East. the Dolphins may win 9-10 games, but the Bills should only win 8 and the Jets may win none."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. And other than the Steelers, there's no one else who could post a threat in the conference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe the Raiders could. if Derek Carr didn't get hurt before last year's playoffs, they may have beaten New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not. But with Marshawn Lynch getting some carries now, they could maybe do something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be hard for Brady to get away from Khalil Mack on the pass rush."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. But no one else has the talent to beat them in the AFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And who knows if the Falcons can soar again in the NFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that felt like a lucky run. Dallas and Green Bay could emerge from that conference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. And the Buccaneers are vastly improved. But could the beat the Pats?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it. As annoying as it is, we may be loking at another New England Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately. Kinda takes some of the fun out of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But at least there won't be any more Deflategate stories this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but I'd just assume never hear about The Hoodie again."
