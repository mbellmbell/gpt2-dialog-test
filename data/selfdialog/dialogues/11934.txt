"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So isn't it weird that the Rams are in Los Angeles now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it seems like they should still be in St. Louis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I was a kid, they moved to St. Louis, and it seems wasteful that they moved back again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but I'm sure it has to do with money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, someone is getting very rich off the deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you seen the temporary stadium that they are playing in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it doesn't quite look NFL-level, but I know they are constructing a new state-of-the-art stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will probably be crazy how modern it is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the new fields are just insane with how different they look."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The one that just opened up in Minnesota is very futuristic-looking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes that one is nice, but I like the one in San Francisco that they built for the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, that stadium is unique."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So now it seems that the Raiders are leaving Oakland for Las Vegas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I heard that crazy news."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So they will have to build a new stadium in Las Vegas for when they move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you imagine what it will look like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but since it is Vegas and the Raiders, I bet it will be very attention-grabbing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will have a one-of-a-kind place for sports entertainment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, and they'll have no problem filling it to capacity with tons of fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be an event, that's for sure, but ticket prices probably will be astronomical to get in there."
