"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the deepest position in NFL football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Deepest as in has the most talent?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes - which position has the most talent?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I would say that punter has a lot of talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am talking skill positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I would say tight end - it seems like a lot of teams have good ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I somewhat agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like tight end usage comes down to implementation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots have always used tight ends well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That might just be Brady doing his thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You make a good point - they have amazing offensive schemes, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So yeah, it definitely comes down to utilization and scheme type."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I would also say that running back seems pretty solid now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are fewer feature backs, and more specialty backs - but a lot of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right - there are a ton of solid running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With that said, the higher end talent seems more scarce."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems that the playing field is more even, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if these trends will continue this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as passing is so highly touted, then I think so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I agree. We will see what happens."
