"__BEATLES__ What do you think of the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ They're not my favorite band, or my favorite type of genre, but music today wouldn't be the same without them."
"__BEATLES__ Agreed completely - there wouldn't even be the same types of music if they weren't around."
"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite song?"
"__BEATLES__ I think Hey Jude or Yesterday, which are the classics, but really any of their top songs are great. What about you?"
"__BEATLES__ I think Eleanor Rigby might be my favorite."
"__BEATLES__ That is a classic. Have you seen Paul McCartney or any of them in concert since they stopped the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ No, it would be a classic one to go to, but I have not."
"__BEATLES__ I think that's one of my all time dreams would be to go back in time and be able to see the beatles live."
