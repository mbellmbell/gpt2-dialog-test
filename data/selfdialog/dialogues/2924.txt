"__MUSIC__ Are you into progressive rock at all?"
"__MUSIC__ What is progressive rock?"
"__MUSIC__ You might be familiar with it from bands like Yes, Rush and Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ I'm definitely familiar with Pink Floyd, but haven't listened to Rush or Yes, although I've heard of them. What makes the music so 'progressive'?"
"__MUSIC__ I think the term is used because some bands from the 60s and 70s experimented with a lot of styles and sounds to try and create very unique music. Progressive music is also characterized by a high degree of musical prowess."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of musical prowess do you mean? That's kind of vague."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. In the case of progressive rock, it has more to do with the instrumental parts and the highly-developed abilities of the performers."
"__MUSIC__ You mean they can play a lot of notes, basically?"
"__MUSIC__ There's the technical ability, and it's also the willingness to expand the chord structure and use different time signatures and rhythms."
"__MUSIC__ So it's much more complex, kind of like progressive jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ That's exactly right. In fact, progressive rock has a very obvious influence from jazz that you can hear in the music at times."
"__MUSIC__ Which bands do you think really epitomize this kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think some of the less mainstream bands are more progressive sounding. Bands like Gentle Giant, King Crimson and Yes are much more complex and experimental sounding."
"__MUSIC__ Which albums do you think are good examples of this."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you like Pink Floyd, you will find that some of their earlier albums, before Dark Side of the Moon, are much more experimental. A good example is Ummagumma."
"__MUSIC__ That's a weird name. It sounds like something a caveman would say."
"__MUSIC__ In general, I would say the late 60s and early 70s is a time of experimentation and you will hear albums with some really weird stuff going on."
"__MUSIC__ What else do you think characterizes this music style?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, in the mid 70s I think these bands became more serious and started releasing albums with long tracks that were up to 20 minutes long. Rock was transforming into a fine art genre, but people began to lose interest and sales dropped."
"__MUSIC__ That's always the case. When an artform progresses to a more sophistocated level, it takes more specialized people to appreciate it."
