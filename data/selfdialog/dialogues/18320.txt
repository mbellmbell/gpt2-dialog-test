"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Your Name?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really interesting. Thanks for recommending it."
"__MOVIES__ I figured you'd like it. I was in Japan when it came out last year and people were going crazy over it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a heartwarming story."
"__MOVIES__ And it was so pretty! All of those colorful shots."
"__MOVIES__ I was surprised by it. Especially the scene in the cave, when the art style changes."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that was a really unusual choice."
"__MOVIES__ There were some parts I didn't understand though."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, what actually happened at the end, with the power station?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they tried to keep that secret on purpose."
"__MOVIES__ I hate when movies are withholding like that."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm. Can you give me another example."
"__MOVIES__ Like, Donny Darko kind of does that too. You really have to read between the lines."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen that. Think that I would like it?"
"__MOVIES__ You'd probably like it more than I did."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, I'm glad you liked Your Name! I was sure you would."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a really great experience."
"__MOVIES__ Let me know if you want to see it again."
"__MOVIES__ I will!"
