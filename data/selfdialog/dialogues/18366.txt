"__MOVIES__ Have I ever told you about my favorite movie, True Romance?"
"__MOVIES__ No!  I didn't know that was your favorite movie."
"__MOVIES__ It totally is!  I actually own a copy which is rare because I don't usually buy movies."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember what that one was about.  It was a Tarantino movie, wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't think he directed it but I think he wrote it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember hearing something like that.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, right?"
"__MOVIES__ It definitely has one of the Arquettes.  I think it's Patricia."
"__MOVIES__ So what did you like about it so much?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I love the romance between Slater and Arquette.  I also love how there are so many different villains all after each other."
"__MOVIES__ Typical Tarantino plot!  Multiple villains in multiple crazy situations."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it is definitely that.  And the humor is great, as well as the action."
"__MOVIES__ Could I borrow it so that I could watch it again? I know I saw it but it's been so many years I can't remember."
"__MOVIES__ Yes of course you can you just have to bring it back!  I would be so upset if I lost it."
"__MOVIES__ For sure I will!  Whatever happened to Christian Slater anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he's still acting."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen him in anything lately though.  What has he been in?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I know he was in something called the Adderall Diaries a few years ago, but I haven't seen him in much recently."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what he's up to."
"__MOVIES__ You never know.  Maybe he's just burnt out?"
"__MOVIES__ He is getting a little old.  I guess that's possible."
