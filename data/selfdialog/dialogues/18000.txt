"__MOVIES__ Something weird I noticed about movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ What, that they still make them? Did you think YouTube would replace films?"
"__MOVIES__ No, nothing like that. It's just, it seems like some years nothing good comes out."
"__MOVIES__ That can't be true, there have got to be at least a few good films every year."
"__MOVIES__ Well, of course, but I mean more like summer action flicks and stuff; blockbusters and whatnot."
"__MOVIES__ There's your problem. You've got to expand your horizons. Watch something other than cape flicks."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, yeah, but just listen. It's like, some years the summer movie season is just awful."
"__MOVIES__ What is coming out this year?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, standard stuff. A few kids movies, a few superhero films, and sequels like Transformers, Pirates, and Planet of the Apes."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of see where you're coming from. If big summer movies are what you're into, then yeesh."
"__MOVIES__ It feels like everything's getting homogenized, and even then slightly unique films we get like Ghost in the Shell come out early in the year and bomb."
"__MOVIES__ Heck, and even that was an anime adaption! No points for originality there!"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Then you've got a few comedies and horror films here and there, and that's it."
"__MOVIES__ That's it? For the entire summer?"
"__MOVIES__ Up to August, yeah. After that you start getting the films the studios didn't have a lot of faith in and just need to push out."
"__MOVIES__ So these, these movies we're getting now are the cream of the crop?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. Then come September and October it'll be mostly horror films."
"__MOVIES__ Like I said, pal, gotta expand your horizons. Digital only films are where truly original tales are being spawned."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, but that sounds so boring!"
"__MOVIES__ Says the guy complaining about all movies being bland and the same these days! Ha!"
