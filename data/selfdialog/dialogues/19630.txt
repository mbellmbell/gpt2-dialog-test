"__MOVIES__ Have you noticed a difference in the movies from the 90's compared to the films today?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think that movies back then were much more lighthearted."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, even the suspenseful thrillers were more cheery than the types of movies today at least in general."
"__MOVIES__ There was something about comedy back then that was so much more funny than things were today."
"__MOVIES__ Some of my favorite comedies were from the 90's."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the big lebowski comes to mind."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, that is a classic!"
"__MOVIES__ I also liked the National Lampoon movies."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, it seems like its been awhile since some movies of the calibur have come out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the cult classics have seemed to dry up."
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't name a modern 'cult classic' if I tried."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe Trainspotting 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Its a little early to tell if it will be as big of a success as the first."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, thats the thing, some movies take time to become cult classics."
"__MOVIES__ Another genre that seems to have all but dissapearred is the war film."
"__MOVIES__ True, the last good war films I remember are Fury, Pans Labyrinth, and Free State of Jones."
"__MOVIES__ I like all three of those movies, I don't know why Free State of Jones got such bad reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that movie was practically shunned by the media."
"__MOVIES__ Mathew gave an incredible performance but I hardly heard a peep about that movie."
