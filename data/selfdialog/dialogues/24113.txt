"__SUPERHERO__ Oh it definitely is. Chadwick Boseman was a great choice for role."

"__SUPERHERO__ I wonder if Storm is going to be in Black Panther."
"__SUPERHERO__ She would have to be. That was his wife."
"__SUPERHERO__ True but you know how they sometimes leave important things out. I wonder if Stan Lee will make an appearance."
"__SUPERHERO__ He has in all the majority of the others. It's pretty commonplace for him to show up."
"__SUPERHERO__ My kids love watching out for Stan Lee in the Marvel movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Mine too. They loved when he was trying to convince the bouncer in The Fantastic Four that he was really Stan Lee."
