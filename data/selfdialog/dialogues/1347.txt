"__MUSIC__ You know, it's true what they say: The music you grew up is the music that stays with you throughout your life."
"__MUSIC__ You think so?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Whenever people ask me about my favorites, I'm always referencing my high school faves."
"__MUSIC__ Hm. I guess I do, too. Stuff like Blondie, Madonna, the Go-Gos."
"__MUSIC__ Good stuff. Yeah, mine were like Depeche Mode, Tears for Fears, The Cure."
"__MUSIC__ Great stuff. Gothic and romantic and dark and rhythmic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I just don't think there's stuff today that's as good."
"__MUSIC__ I think you might be right. Of course, we're listening to less now than we did then."
"__MUSIC__ True. Back then, I was open to anything and everything. Now, not so much."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. Some of the new stuff I hear -- Lady Gaga, Drake, Katy Perry -- it just doesn't do it for me."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the only new stuff I like is Taylor Swift. A little of it, at least."
"__MUSIC__ And rap? Rap I don't like at all."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. Don't tell my kids I said that, though. But it's all so aggressive or sexual. Makes me uncomfortable."
"__MUSIC__ I like Eminem a bit. But he's not exactly new anymore, is he?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. He is talented though. Great use of language."
"__MUSIC__ I like him because he has a sense of humor, too. He's not afraid to be silly or to make fun of himself. And others."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and he likes to spoof things, too, which I really appreciate. Makes fun of the culture really well."
"__MUSIC__ He is all-around talented, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Good actor, too. Did you see Eight Mile?"
"__MUSIC__ I did. I was super-impressed with his performance. The passion of it."
