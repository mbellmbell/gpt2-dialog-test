"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite style of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like indie rock and hip hop. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I like a little bit of everything actually. I like to keep things diverse."
"__MUSIC__ That's not something you usually hear a lot, most people are pretty set in their music ways."
"__MUSIC__ I moved around a lot growing up, so I was exposed to a lot of different music."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Fences?"
"__MUSIC__ I do actually, I saw them live a few times. Do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are one of my favorites. Do you have a favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a few, I like Tool, The Misfits, and A Perfect  Circle."
"__MUSIC__ Would you say you lean more towards rock then?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think so. I was just listening to Frank Ocean on my over here."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard of him, is he good?"
"__MUSIC__ He's really good, he's a rapper from Long Beach."
"__MUSIC__ I don't listen to a lot of rap. I just never really got into it."
"__MUSIC__ You should give it a chance, you never know, you might like it."
"__MUSIC__ You sound like my mom trying to get me to eat vegetables when I was a kid."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you eat vegetables now, don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, you got me there."
"__MUSIC__ How about I make you a mix tape? Then you can see what I'm talking about, just keep an open mind."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, thanks I'll take you up on that!"
