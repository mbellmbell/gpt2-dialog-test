"__MOVIES__ My boyfriend and I are so different. We don't even like the same movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I hear you, I love horror movies, but he likes science fiction and comedic movies."
"__MOVIES__ So how do you deal with it when deciding what to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ A lot of the time I will sit through his movies, and he'll sit through mine!"
"__MOVIES__ I can't do that, it sometimes feels torturous."
"__MOVIES__ Also, sometimes the movies cross the genre borders."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ There are certain movies that blend horror and comedy, or horror and science fiction."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see, what are some examples?"
"__MOVIES__ Like Event Horizon. It's one of both our favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Laurence Fishburn and Sam Neil."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it has elements from both the horror and scifi genres."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite movies are romantic ones, and I can't get him to watch one with me!"
"__MOVIES__ I understand. Once he made me watch P.S. I Love You."
"__MOVIES__ Really? HE made YOU watch a ROMANTIC movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, those movies make me want to barf."
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe you will let me borrow him when the next romance comes out."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, but don't get any ideas!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe I'll try hypnosis on my boyfriend."
"__MOVIES__ It's worth a shot, but don't try it on me!"
