"__MOVIES__ Did you hear that Roger Moore died?"
"__MOVIES__ Who is he again?"
"__MOVIES__ The actor. He acted as James Bond back in the day."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm Are you sure?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm 100% sure! I love James Bond! I've seen practically all of the movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, I think you're mixing him up for Sean Connery..."
"__MOVIES__ Sean Connery was James Bond, you're right. But Roger Moore acting as James Bond right after."
"__MOVIES__ Really?? I never knew that! Never even heard of him. I guess I didn't see all 10 of the James Bond movies.."
"__MOVIES__ There's way more than 10! There's actually over 20!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow! That's a lot! You've seen all of them you said?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but most. I've seen all but 5 or so."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones are the best?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite James Bond movies are Dr. No just because it was the first. Diamonds Are Forever. Live and Let Die. And Quantum of Solace."
"__MOVIES__ Oh so you like Daniel Craig then?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he's good actually. Rugged. A different take on the role."
"__MOVIES__ When is the next one coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ It supposed to be in 2019 I think? I'm not too sure actually."
"__MOVIES__ I heard Daniel Craig won't be acting in it."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, he will be. But It may be his last one. Rumour has it that Idris Elba will be taking over the role after that?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! A black James Bond!"
