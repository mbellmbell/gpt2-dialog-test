"__BASEBALL__ Gotcha. Frazier hit a two-run double in the sixth inning and a two-run single in the seventh!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah man, I seen that too and he is MVP right now in my book!"
"__BASEBALL__ Did you know that Frazier started this season as a utility player?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I didn't know that why?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, one reason is because center fielder Starling Marte is suspended until mid-July for violations."
"__BASEBALL__ OH WOW! I did not know about all that. Why was Marte suspended?"
"__BASEBALL__ I had heard on NFL network that it had to do with some drug violation but I don't know any details."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh shoot! That' too bad."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep, Frazier is back after missing nearly three weeks with a strained left hamstring, and is on fire now!"
"__BASEBALL__ You just never know what is going to happen in a season because of injuries and whatnot! Whats Frazier's avg?"
"__BASEBALL__ He has a AVG of .347, last time I checked."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh okay, right on!"
"__BASEBALL__ Frazier, the leadoff hitter, is 10 for 20 in his last four games, so we will see what the rest of the season has to hold!"
"__BASEBALL__ Cool, baseball is my favorite pastime! Thanks for the updates!"
"__BASEBALL__ Mine too! I just wish I had more time to watch it! Cool!"
