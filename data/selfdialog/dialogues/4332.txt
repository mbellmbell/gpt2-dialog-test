"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard any good music on the radio lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really listen to the radio much, but I've heard some great songs on Youtube."
"__MUSIC__ What have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like the song Wagon Wheel by Darius Rucker."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that's an older one but it's great!"
"__MUSIC__ I know.  Did you know he used to be the lead singer for Hootie and the Blowfish?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, really? I had no idea."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I saw them in concert several times in the nineties."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they had a totally different sound from Darius Rucker's music today!"
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I would never make the connection."
"__MUSIC__ He has a new song called If I told You that's pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard that one.  It's not as good as Wagon Wheel."
"__MUSIC__ No, but it still has pretty good lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm not wild about it."
"__MUSIC__ Wonder why Hootie and the Blowfish split up?"
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea.  They were really popular in the nineties and had a lot of hits."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they did.  Then they just sorta disappeared."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but Rucker definitely reappeared on the scene."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  His new music is much better than the Hootie music ever was."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely think so too."
