"__ROCK__ I don't get what distinguishes heavy metal from hard rock."
"__ROCK__ You serious?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I mean. They're both rock music, and they're both loud."
"__ROCK__ Okay, here's the main difference: the blues."
"__ROCK__ The blues?"
"__ROCK__ Rock and roll is built on the blues, right? Hard rock, by extension, is heavily blues-based."
"__ROCK__ Okay, I'm listening."
"__ROCK__ Heavy metal, though -- its (very white) innovation is to take all the swing, all the blues out of hard rock."
"__ROCK__ How did they do that?"
"__ROCK__ Look at the rhythm; there's no swing to it anymore. It's all mechanical, all square."
