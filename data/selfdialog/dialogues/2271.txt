"__MUSIC__ Oh, you have Prince's Purple Rain.  I like some of his songs."

"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a good one."
"__MUSIC__ He was a really good guitar player."
"__MUSIC__ He sure was.  He played a lot of instruments, but I think I enjoy the guitar playing the most."
"__MUSIC__ Same here, you should check out a YouTube video that has him playing during the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame a few years ago."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check it out, what song was he playing?"
"__MUSIC__ It was 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' by the Beatles.  He was playing with a bunch of other guys."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, I will have to check it out.  Do you have any other interesting facts about Prince?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, I heard that Michael Jackson wanted Prince to sing 'Bad' as a duet."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that would have been awesome, I wonder why it didn't work out."
"__MUSIC__ Well, from what I heard, Prince didn't want to sing 'Your butt is mine' to Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's funny!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to have to get some more music facts from you soon!"
