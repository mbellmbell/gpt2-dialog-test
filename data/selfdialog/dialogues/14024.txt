"__BASKETBALL__ What is the most exciting play in basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ College or NBA?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It doesn't matter."
"__BASKETBALL__ The tip-off."
"__BASKETBALL__ ...seriously?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, silly, they don't even try. I like the game-ending three-quarter-court shot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, let me specify. What's the most exciting regularly-occurring play in basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ For me, that would have to be the posterization."
"__BASKETBALL__ Really? I don't like that at all."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why not? One guy jumps up and dunks on top of another. It's humiliating."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's too much showmanship, and it's unnecessary. There are other ways to get two points that don't involve putting someone's head between your legs."
"__BASKETBALL__ So, what's yours?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I like the three-pointer that absolutely kills a rally."
"__BASKETBALL__ How's that work?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Say a team is down by 10 with two minutes to go but have been making a comeback. They get it to within two points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay..."
"__BASKETBALL__ Then, as they're about to take the lead, the other team takes control on a fast break and scores a three-pointer."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why's that your favorite?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's completely demoralizing. It crushes the other team, the fans, and the hopes."
"__BASKETBALL__ True...but cruel, man."
