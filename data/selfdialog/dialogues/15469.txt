"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think they did great making Harry Potter into movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I disagree."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why? What was so horrible about them?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The first two or three were fine. I saw number four and it was twisted. Nothing was making sense. It was just flashes of scenes. They weren't connected."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought it was good."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but you never read the books. You don't know what they left out."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Like what?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Who drew the Marauders map? You've seen all the movies now, right? So who drew the map?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ uhhh. I don't know. Did it ever say?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, they didn't. The movies never said who created the map and that sucks"
