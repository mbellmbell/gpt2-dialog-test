"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite classical music composer?"
"__MUSIC__ Are we talking classical as in 'art' music or specifically 1750-1825, give or take?"
"__MUSIC__ You're such a snob, let's do specifically the classical era."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite is Beethoven."
"__MUSIC__ Why? That's so clich√©."
"__MUSIC__ It's really not, he's a transitional master."
"__MUSIC__ Transitional? What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ He 'bridged the gap' between the Classical and Romantic eras."
"__MUSIC__ How so? Or are you just repeating what you heard in your classes?"
"__MUSIC__ His orchestration, text setting, harmonies, and so forth, and combining voice and orchestra are all foreshadowing those who come after."
"__MUSIC__ Combining voice and orchestra? That's called opera."
"__MUSIC__ No, silly. It's not."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, enlighten me."
"__MUSIC__ Well, opera is a very specific genre, and Beethoven DID write those."
"__MUSIC__ So what did he do?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he took a choir and soloists and put them in front of a symphony."
"__MUSIC__ So? Didn't others do this?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but not to this extent. He featured voices DURING his Ninth Symphony."
"__MUSIC__ Ooh, I get it."
"__MUSIC__ No, you don't. But thanks."
