"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you still a San Francisco 49ers fan ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I have a new team this year. I'm tired of waiting for them to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your new team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jacksonville Jaguars, they are not a good team, but I did move to Jacksonville this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wondered if you would start following them after your move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always lived in Florida and followed all the teams, but this is the first time I've lived in a city with an NFL team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How far away from the stadium do you live?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see Everbank Field from in front of my apartment. I think it's about a mile away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's close, I guess I'll be spending some weekends visiting you this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds great, we'll have to plan out some weekends when the Jags are playing at home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully they will play the Tennessee Titans in Jacksonville this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Titans play the Jaguars in week 2 this year, and it's at Everbank Field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will be sure to come and watch that game with you this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That will be a lot of fun, I've never been to an game in person yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will of course have to be wearing my Titans shirt to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will have to buy a Jaguars jersey before I go to the stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to be embarrassed to be seen with me in the Jacksonville stadium with my Titans jersey on?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It depend on which team wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure the winning team will be my Titans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure that you are wrong, the Jags are going to have a great year."
