"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that movie from last year starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling?"
"__MOVIES__ La La Land?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Did you watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did! I watched it in the theater last year."
"__MOVIES__ How do you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ As a jazz music lover, I really enjoy some of the musical pieces played. Did you watch the movie yourself?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did. I am really loving the musical numbers!"
"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about Ryan's and Emma's dance moves?"
"__MOVIES__ I feel like they can do better. But at least they did not suck at it!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think Emma's ability to dance is better than Ryan's at some of the scenes!"
"__MOVIES__ I cannot agree less."
"__MOVIES__ How about their singing voices?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, nowadays there is auto-tune. So I am not sure we cannot judge it based on what we saw in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmmm...good point. And how about Ryan's ability to play piano?"
"__MOVIES__ Did he really play the piano or was it a 'double' playing?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there are some scenes in which, I felt that there are 'glitch' around his wrists when he plays the piano. I think..."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I have to see that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I could be wrong. But again I am a skeptical one."
"__MOVIES__ No, I understand where you are coming from.  As a piano player, there is a certain skill levels and years of practicing in order to do what his character does in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know what? I will try to google it tonight and see whether it was CGI-ed."
