"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who's your favorite player of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine is Walter Peyton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ #34 for the Chicago bears -- one of the greatest of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And he played for one of the greatest teams of all time too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 1985 Super Bowl Winning Chicago Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, coached by Mike Ditka."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Jim McMahon was quarterback. I remember him being sort of a bad boy. Always wearing a headband and sunglasses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And so many lineman on that team too who went on to make the Hall of Fame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember Richard Dent, Mike Singletary..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And don't forget 'Refrigerator' Perry! he was such a character."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you also remember the Super Bowl Shuffle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was everywhere at the time. I used to have it memorized."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the modern day game, who's your favorite running back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's tough. So many great players. I'm a Colts fan though so I'd have to say Robert Turbin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good pick. He's not flashy like others, but gets the job done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Even though the Colts had a rough season, he did his part and got the TDs and yards when needed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's hope they can get their stuff together for next season. They were pretty pitiful last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, seems like we've either been on or off since we let Manning go. Either do pretty decent or terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough to be a Colts fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially when Brady keeps winning Super Bowls!"
