"__THRILLER__ I just recently saw the movie Se7en and I am very conflicted."
"__THRILLER__ What are you conflicted about? Are you upset that there wasn't a plot twist at the end?"
"__THRILLER__ Well I guess, yeah I am. I was getting really into the lives of the two detectives, especially Brad Pitt's character. At the end of the film, I was hoping that there would be a plot twist, and that the wife wasn't actually killed, but I knew that wouldn't be the case."
"__THRILLER__ It's a fantastic ending. Idealism is corrupted and proved almost as irrational as psychosis."
"__THRILLER__ Can you eleborate on that? Help me understand because I'm not entirely sure why things happened the way they did in the movie."
"__THRILLER__ It's actually pretty simple, Brad Pitt proves Kevin Spacey right, but Morgan Freeman rededicates himself to justice, so maybe he was wrong too. I suppose the point is that anyone can succumb to dark impulses, not just someone who is insane."
"__THRILLER__ Ok what is seemed like Kevin Spacey's character was almost punishing Brad Pitt for a Sin that he was going to commit in the future, which I think sort of plays against his 'holy' reasoning for the murders he committed."
"__THRILLER__ You're thinking way too much into the script. Keep it simple, The only reason this is sticking out in your mind is because there isn't a solution."
"__THRILLER__ Why didn't Brad Pitt just kill himself at the end?"
"__THRILLER__ Brad Pitt faces a choice between a vengeance that is literally nothing but wrath, or a moral high ground that still feels like failure. The way Pitt performed that scene I believed that though he understood this choice, he could only kill Kevin Spacey and not himself."
