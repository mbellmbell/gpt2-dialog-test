"__FASHION__ Did you enjoy the fashions Met-Gala this year?"
"__FASHION__ Yes it was great! How did you enjoy the red carpet looks?"
"__FASHION__ I loved them. Rhianna was my favorite."
"__FASHION__ Yes. She really stuck to the theme of the night, which was to celebrate fashion designer Rei Kawakubo."
"__FASHION__ Certainly. Her dress was big, bold, and very unique."
"__FASHION__ Yes it was. I had never heard of the designer Rei Kawakubo until now."
"__FASHION__ I have never heard of her either. I think this year's dedication will really bring her a lot more recognition."
"__FASHION__ I agree. I also enjoyed Rihanna's makeup that went with the dress."
"__FASHION__ Yes. The elaborate pink eye shadow was a great touch and really brought out her facial features."
"__FASHION__ Also her hairstyle really topped it off as well."
"__FASHION__ Yes. The bun on top of her head was incredible."
"__FASHION__ Interestingly her hair and makeup did not take away or conflict with the dress."
"__FASHION__ No, they didn't. All 3 went together perfectly."
"__FASHION__ I wonder if she chose this dress herself?"
"__FASHION__ Possibly a stylist, however it would not surprise me if she chose it on her own."
"__FASHION__ Yes. She has a unique, wicked style all on her own."
"__FASHION__ Yes. I think that is why she was able to pull this look off."
"__FASHION__ Right. We are already used to seeing her in flamboyant outfits."
"__FASHION__ I think she was best dressed of the night."
"__FASHION__ I agree. Well done Rihanna!"
