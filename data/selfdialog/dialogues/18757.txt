"__MOVIES__ Let's talk about Mel Gibson."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man. This'll get dark."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about him?"
"__MOVIES__ As a person, director, or actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Any and all."
"__MOVIES__ He's a brilliant director, a decent action actor, and an absolutely horrible person."
"__MOVIES__ Really, why?"
"__MOVIES__ You know about his drunken rant, right?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what happened?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, almost a decade ago, he got drunk and pulled over by a cop and went on a long tirade against women and jews."
"__MOVIES__ At a traffic stop?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup. Great guy, right?"
"__MOVIES__ But what about his movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They're very well-directed and action-packed. Hacksaw Ridge was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ You know I don't watch action."
"__MOVIES__ So what did you see?"
"__MOVIES__ What Women Want."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that the one where he can read minds and learns to deal with it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was pretty funny but got serious enough."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it when it came out but can't remember if I liked it or not."
