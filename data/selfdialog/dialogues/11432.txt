"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Falcons can bounce back after that crushing Super Bowl loss?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think they'll use it as motivation to practice and play harder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their defense will also be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've added a lot of speed on defense. And having Poe in the middle of the line will be an improvement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and they'll get Trufant back. That will take some pressure off the other defensive backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the offensive coordinator situation? Do you think Sarkisian is as innovative as Kyle Shanahan was?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sarkisian is unproven, but I've heard good things from a lot of insiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I blame Shanahan for the Super Bowl loss. I'm sort of glad to see him go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me, too. Run the ball and eat up clock when you're up 28-3!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Ryan will have a harder time this year. He's getting used to a new offensive coordinator, and the line is a little shakier than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they have to keeps a clean pocket for him to be effective. Especially on downfield throws."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the line can keep the pocket clean for five seconds, Ryan will find someone open. They have so many good pass catching options."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, teams can't double Julio every play or the other receivers will burn them one on one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Julio stays healthy, this will be another special year for him and Ryan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Julio is a beast when he's healthy, but he's had a lot of foot problems. I hope he's getting proper treatment and training to prevent foot injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Arthur Blank really wants a championship in the inaugural season at the new stadium. If they don't make it back to the Super Bowl, I think he'll make major changes in the front office."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Quinn is safe as long as it's clear the team is listening to him, but Dimitroff is deservedly on the hot seat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The front office has done a better job under Dimitroff the past couple of years, but they were lousy for the few years before that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm surprised he kept his job so long after all those draft busts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's seemed to have added good front office personnel, and I think Quinn has helped selecting players, as well."
