"__MOVIES__ I can't believe I watched that stupid movie Passengers."
"__MOVIES__ Ha! I told you not to waste your time!"
"__MOVIES__ I still wanted to see it cause I LOVE Chris Pratt! Andy Dwyer really let me down this time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he let both you and Johnny Karate down."
"__MOVIES__ And Laurence Fishburne was in this movie! What a waste of talent!!"
"__MOVIES__ He was severely underutilized."
"__MOVIES__ And was that captain at the end Andy Garcia?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was. Another waste."
"__MOVIES__ I felt like this movie was re-edited and cut out all the best parts."
"__MOVIES__ Horrible, just horrible. I was actually nauseated when Jim woke Aurora up."
"__MOVIES__ It was Disgusting! It was such a violation to wake her up knowing you doom her to a life on that ship."
"__MOVIES__ It was made worse by the fact she intended to return to earth."
"__MOVIES__ Did that actually make sense? It's 120 years each way, so when she gets back everyone she knows is already dead."
"__MOVIES__ That was a weak plot point."
"__MOVIES__ Well she stayed awake and wrote her story."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it only cost her life."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I thought this movie was going to be more action packed."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing was action oriented for the first hour or so."
"__MOVIES__ I kept waiting for the movie I was promised."
"__MOVIES__ Too bad for you that promise was broken."
