"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wanna get into hip hop, where do you suggest I start?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh man, that's an incredibly tough question. I'm not sure there is a best place to start, but I'll make a recommendation anyway."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Okay, where do you think I should start."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think you should start with Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d. city. It's recent, sounds recent, the storytelling is great, the sequencing is great, the lyrics are great, and the songs are great."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Where does that fall in his discography?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's his second official album out of a total of four."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think it is his best?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think it's his second best, but it's more accessible than To Pimp A Butterfly which is my favorite."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So you're saying I shouldn't start with his best album?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly, I know it sounds counter intuitive, but you'll have a much deeper appreciation if you start with good kid, m.A.A.d. city."
