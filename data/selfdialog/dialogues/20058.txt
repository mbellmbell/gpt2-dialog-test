"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the Shrek movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness yes!  They are my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they are some of my favorites too.  I just got done watching all of them together."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ That's impossible to choose!  The first one is hilarious, but the others are truly great too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, plus Puss In Boots is awesome, did you see that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it's hilarious too.  I love how they keep the characters going through all of them."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I thought Forever After was great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it got a little more complex.  That was definitely interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Shrek Forever After is the one where he had the babies, right?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so.  It was the one with Rumplestiltskin."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I get them all mixed up.  They are all fabulous, though."
"__MOVIES__ I think the first was my favorite.  I love the Gingerbread man."
"__MOVIES__ Gingie? Yeah that is absolutely hilarious and so original."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, plus Pinnochio cracks me up."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he is a riot."
"__MOVIES__ In Puss In Boots do you remember Kitty Soft Paws?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she's awesome!  She's his girlfriend right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes his partner."
"__MOVIES__ They should do a follow up to that movie."
