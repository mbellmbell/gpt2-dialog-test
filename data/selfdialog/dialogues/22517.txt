"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite Disney movie when you were growing up?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd probably have to say Lady and the Tramp."
"__DISNEY__ What makes you pick that one?"
"__DISNEY__ I remember it so well from my childhood. I really liked some of the songs too."
"__DISNEY__ Did it make you want a dog of your own?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course it did. Wouldn't all children want a dog after watching it?"
"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite part of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it when the tramp broke into the house to save the baby from the rat."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't the people think the tramp was a bad dog?"
"__DISNEY__ Aunt Sara certainly did, but everything turned out in the end when they realized he was protecting the baby."
