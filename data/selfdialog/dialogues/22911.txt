"__DISNEY__ Which Disney princess movie came first?"
"__DISNEY__ I believe it was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, okay. I never really liked that one too much."
"__DISNEY__ Why not? Some of the songs are decent."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but the story never really interested me too much."
"__DISNEY__ It's a little bit duller than some of the others, but you have to remember how revolutionary the animation was."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that's true, but it doesn't mean I have to be a big fan of it or anything."
"__DISNEY__ I know. I just appreciate it for what it was."
"__DISNEY__ That's cool. I respect that."
"__DISNEY__ Plus, I like to whistle while I work!"
