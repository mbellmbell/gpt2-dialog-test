"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the Crosby hit the other day?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that looked kind of dirty."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't think that it was."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Why not?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He was already falling to the ice and the guy just stuck his hands out. He wasn't trying to hurt him."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't know if I agree about that. He didn't have to hit him with his stick."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sure, but it was just instinct."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe, but I still think he was trying to hurt him."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, either way, Crosby was out."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It doesn't seem like it mattered that much though. They still won the series."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, they always seem to beat the Caps."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ovechkin just never seems to show up when he's needed."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, even in the Olympics he hasn't been very good."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, they were pretty terrible in the Russian Olympics. They didn't even medal. I'm sure Putin was pleased."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't have them taken care of."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't blame them too much though. Canada looked really good that year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, Canada has looked very strong the past few Olympics, but that one was pretty amazing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They always have pretty stacked teams"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Indeed. They could field two teams."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's kind of too bad they had to split them up for the last tournament."
