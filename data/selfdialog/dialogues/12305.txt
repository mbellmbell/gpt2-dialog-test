"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So i noticed some odd things with Tampa's schedule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, for starters They play The Falcons twice as well and the Panthers and the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that is a bit strange."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Serious. Especially since the Falcons and the Saints are in our division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it sounds like the Bucs better have it together in those games just for ranking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, by why such limited diversity?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, in the beginning, the Bears should be no problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now the Patriots are gonna give us a bloddy nose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldnt it be great if we got lucky and beat them hard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it would. After that it's gonna be Arizona and Buffalo. Shouldnt be that hard to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Arizona maybe, Bills, no problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then it's Panthers, Saints...... where the divisional rivalry begins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the Bucs will have to be cautious those next 5 or 6 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are the games that are gonna define playoff position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The last three games are the same way, Falcons, Panthers and Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh, lot of stress in those last three games."
