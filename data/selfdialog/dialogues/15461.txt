"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree. He seemed like such a creep!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But he loved Lilly."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Huh?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry's mom."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, yeah."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really did like that plot twist."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Very fun, indeed!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wonder what would have happened if Snape an Harry's mom got together instead."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry Snape?!"
