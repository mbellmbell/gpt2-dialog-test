"__ROCK__ Have you listened to anything good lately?"
"__ROCK__ Actually I've been listening to some older stuff."
"__ROCK__ Oh really?  What have you been listening to?"
"__ROCK__ Stuff from the 70s and 80s.  I've really been into Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers."
"__ROCK__ Tom Petty had some really good music.  He had a really distinctive voice."
