"__ROCK__ What kind of rock music do you like to listen to?"
"__ROCK__ Lately, I've been listening to a lot of old stuff like The Cure. I also have always listened to AFI, if you've heard of them."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I remember AFI from the early two-thousands. They've changed so much since then, I can't really bring myself to listen to them."
"__ROCK__ I actually like their new sound. I guess that's just to be expected when you've made music for decades though."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I guess that is right. It would be hard to think up so many songs in one sub-group that long."
"__ROCK__ I've come to love their newer stuff. I started listening to them when Miss Murder debuted and then just started listening to all of their stuff."
"__ROCK__ I first heard of them way before that, probably when the Sing The Sorrow Album came out."
"__ROCK__ Well, that wasn't too long before, but I went back and listened to that album too after falling in love with their December Underground album."
"__ROCK__ The only song I liked on that album was actually Kill Caustic. It sort of reminded me of their old sound."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, that is one song which stands out in the album against the others."
