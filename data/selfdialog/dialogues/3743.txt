"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Beyonce?"
"__MUSIC__ She's a bad mom."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you see the way she lets her daughter walk around with that hair?"
"__MUSIC__ You have to to be kidding me!"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, serious right now is what I am being."
"__MUSIC__ How can you say such a thing? That woman dedicated a whole song to her daughter for crying out loud!"
"__MUSIC__ No, she didn't. With the way the media follows her every move, surely I would've heard about that."
"__MUSIC__ Don't take my word for it. Google it then."
"__MUSIC__ What am I supposed to be searching for on Google?"
"__MUSIC__ Just type in Beyonce Blue song,"
"__MUSIC__ Wait, you're not joking at all."
"__MUSIC__ This is what I've been trying to tell you."
"__MUSIC__ Well I figured because you're a member of the Bey hive, you're just trying to make her look good."
"__MUSIC__ Being a loyal fan doesn't equate to me telling lies."
"__MUSIC__ Ok well you've made your point then."
"__MUSIC__ You're not going to at least listen to the song?"
"__MUSIC__ I will."
"__MUSIC__ When?"
"__MUSIC__ I'll listen to it the next time I think ill of her as a parent."
