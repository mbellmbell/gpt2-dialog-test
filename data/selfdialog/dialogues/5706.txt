"__STAR_WARS__ I heard a cool ending for the Return of the Jedi that was never used."
"__STAR_WARS__ What ending was that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess George Lucas toyed with the idea of having Luke go to the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  Interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  Darth Vader would die and Luke would put on his helmet."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would have been straight nasty!"
"__STAR_WARS__ He would then say 'Now I am Vader' and assume the position."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would have been an easy cliffhanger to move forward."
"__STAR_WARS__ They scrapped it at the end as they wanted a happier ending."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darn.  I love that kind of stuff!"
