"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sometimes watching the NFL really bothers me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because of the lack of color options for the uniforms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Be serious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought you were going to talk about something important like injuries. Not uniform colors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's important to me! It really bothers me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What exactly bothers you about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are so many teams that share colors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ so each team should have original colors. Not 100 teams being blue and white."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't understand why it matters. It's just colors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both the cowboys and the Giants shouldn't be blue. They're supposed to be their own teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are their own teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they are, they should be different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We would run out of colors eventually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they have to be blue, they should all have to use a different shade of blue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, then they can't say 'blue' they should say 'teal'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ you're ridiculous."
