"__MOVIES__ I need to get some movies to play on rainy days at a kids camp. Any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Can the movies be rated PG or do they just have to be rated G?"
"__MOVIES__ I probably need to find both rated G and PG movies."
"__MOVIES__ For younger kids you probably can't go wrong with classic Disney movies, and people you know probably have DVDs at home that they could bring."
"__MOVIES__ This camp is an overnight camp in the woods, do you have any nature themed suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ The original 'Parent Trap' starts out at a summer camp and they go camping in the woods as a family."
"__MOVIES__ Was there more than one version? I saw one about 20 years ago I think."
"__MOVIES__ You must've seen the one with Lindsay Lohan. The original one starred Hayley Mills back in the 60s."
"__MOVIES__ This camp is a church camp so I probably need some movies with a vaguely Christian theme."
"__MOVIES__ You could always watch one or more of the Narnia movies."
"__MOVIES__ I saw 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe', were there more than that one made into movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They made the next two in the series, the ones where Lucy is a main character and still a little kid."
"__MOVIES__ So is that 'Prince Caspian' and the 'Dawn Treader'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the first two got pretty good reviews but 'The Voyage of the Dawn Treader' didn't get good reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Any thoughts on Christian movies for older kids or teens?"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't there a movie by the newsboys?"
"__MOVIES__ 'God's Not Dead' by the Newsboys probably would be good for older kids."
"__MOVIES__ When did that come out? If it's fairly recent that might be a good choice. How about 'A Walk to Remember'?"
"__MOVIES__ .'God's Not Dead' is less than 10 years old now."
"__MOVIES__ 'A Walk to Remember' is a little bit older and it is about teens who are Christian."
