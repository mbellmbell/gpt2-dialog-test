"__MUSIC__ So have you been to any concerts lately?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I would love to go soon.  It's been a while..."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  I heard Billy Idol might be touring outside of Vegas soon!"
"__MUSIC__ Excellent!  Would you like to go?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, I'm a huge fan.  80's music was the best!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you there!  What's your favorite Billy Idol song?"
"__MUSIC__ Pumping on Steel."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a hidden gem.  What else?"
"__MUSIC__ I liked his cover of Don't You Forget About me."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I enjoyed that as well!  Of course he had a lot of great hits!"
"__MUSIC__ Certainly!  Rebel Yell never gets old!"
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget about Eyes Without a Face!"
"__MUSIC__ How could I?  He has aged well and still puts on a great show!"
"__MUSIC__ I heard the same.  Steve Stevens is with him again as well!"
"__MUSIC__ Excellent!  So when is the show?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure.  I would have to look online."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I'll look as well.  In the meantime, could you lend me a CD?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, my Best Of is around here somewhere..."
"__MUSIC__ Sweet! Just let me know and we'll have a blast!"
"__MUSIC__ I can't wait!  Talk soon!"
