"__MOVIES__ How often do you go to the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I go probably two to three times per month. It just depends on what's out at the moment and if friedns are going."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't really like going to the movies by myself either. What movies are you into?"
"__MOVIES__ I generally like action and comedy movies the best, but I'm pretty open to whatever."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm the same. Not too picky."
"__MOVIES__ Any movies you're looking forward too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really want to see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool, yeah, I've heard those movies are really good. I've only seen the first one and really liked it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're awesome. They seem to be really popular."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know if you were into movies based on comic books, but did you hear the director for the Justice League movie stepped back from the project?"
"__MOVIES__ I like movies based on comic books and no, I hadn't heard that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think his daughter past away very recently. She must've been pretty young because the director doesn't look very old."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, that's awful. It's completely understandable that he'd want to step away from work for a while."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, hopefully he can make a come back after such a tragedy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, definitely. Speaking of movies, I hope this doesn't make me sound immature since I'm an adult, but I'm really looking forward to Despicable Me 3."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, I'm an adult and I like those kind of kids movies. I haven't seen any of the Despicable Me movies, but I generally enjoy computer animated kids movies."
"__MOVIES__ Okay cool, yeah, I know they're for kids, but they usually make the humor and action pretty enjoyable for adults too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree. I've liked those kinds of movies going way back to the first Toy Story movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great series of movies. I'm pretty sure the first Toy Story came out in the mid-90s."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, has it really been that long? It doesn't seem like it's been over 20 years since it came out."
