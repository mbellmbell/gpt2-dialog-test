"__COMEDY__ What is a good comedy?"
"__COMEDY__ I like Groundhog Day."
"__COMEDY__ Really? Who is in that?"
"__COMEDY__ Bill Murray is in it. He plays a weatherman."
"__COMEDY__ That is wild. What does he do in the movie?"
"__COMEDY__ He is reporting on Groundhog Day and enters a sort of purgatory that he can't get out of until he fixes his life."
"__COMEDY__ Wow! That sounds like something I need to experience!"
"__COMEDY__ Are you talking about the movie or the purgatory? The concept is so great that it makes you think like that!"
"__COMEDY__ I am talking about both!"
"__COMEDY__ Awesome. Go check this movie out now. It will change your life."
