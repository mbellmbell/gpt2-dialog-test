"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the projection for the nest year? Who's the best team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's hard to say."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guess. Or make an educated guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now that's even harder. Educated guesses in this scenario require us to look at the team's strengths and weakness and whether or not the draft did anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Dak Prescott is going take the Cowboys to the Superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hah. No way man. Prescott is good, but not that good. I can see the cowboys winning their division, but probably won't get past the conference championship"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do yo think will win the NFC then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either the Packers or Seahawks. Unless they both get a bunch of injuries, then Cowboys might win the NFC"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a very real possibility."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, but it's also very real possibility that Cowboys may suffer injuries as well. So..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. man, I want the Cowboys to win the superbowl so bad, they haven;'t been to one in years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last one was back in 1996. They've won that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the triple X game. That was hilarious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Roman numerals suck. They should just change to numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ no way man, it's a tradition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They didn't stick with the tradition for the 50th, now it's pointless"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know I think it's cool. Anyway. So who's gonna win the AFC? Pats again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I'm thinking. They got picked up Brandin Cooks to add to their receiving core."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Cooks is overated. he only ranks high because Brees loves to throw and Cooks is his favorite target"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That just says he's a good receiver..."
