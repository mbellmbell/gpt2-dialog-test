"__BEATLES__ Okay, guess this one. 'Help! I need somebody. Help! Not just anybody.'"
"__BEATLES__ 'Help!' by The Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ You got it. Do you like this song?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm a huge Beatles fan and this is one of my favorite early Beatles songs."
"__BEATLES__ I know, such a great Lennon and McCartney collaboration."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, and it's all about how we're not all really completely independent."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, it's about how we need each other. Humans are social animals."
"__BEATLES__ Exactly, I respect that. There's a lot of egotism in contemporary music."
"__BEATLES__ Right, I like that the Beatles were able to right a song that's about self-doubt and needing others."
"__BEATLES__ I wonder if that type of song will crop up again eventually. Hip hop is currently dominant and the boast is such a staple of the form."
