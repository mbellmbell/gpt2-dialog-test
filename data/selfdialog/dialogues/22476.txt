"__DISNEY__ Mate, have you seen the live action Jungle Book."
"__DISNEY__ The one directed by Jon Favreau."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that's the one."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah why?"
"__DISNEY__ Do you know who played King Louis?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I thought it was all CGI."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that animals were but they had real actors voicing them. Anyway King Louis was voiced by Christopher Walken."
"__DISNEY__ Christopher Walken. No way."
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha, you do such a great Christopher Walken."
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha, everyone needs to learn to do a Christopher Walken expression. You could say it's the bare necessities of life!"
