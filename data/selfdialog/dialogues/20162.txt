"__MOVIES__ One movie genre I tend to enjoy is actually versus movies. For example, Freddy vs Jason."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that movie when it first came out. I assume you have seen it, as well?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! I was a huge fan of both series back in their hay-day."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Even though I was more of a Freddy Krueger fan, for I felt those movies were a bit more fun."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. I think Friday The 13th was more fans of gore and just straight up slasher flicks."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree. Freddy was a bit more creative but eventually he became a bit of a pop icon, actually."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that. But getting back to Freddy VS Jason, what are your thoughts?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's a movie that came a bit late, but it was a lot of fun to watch it finally happen."
"__MOVIES__ Have you recently seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I remember watching it with a couple of friends a year or two ago. It doesn't hold up greatly, but it is still entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that statement. Do you kind of wish they had fought more?"
"__MOVIES__ To an extent, yes. I feel at times less is more but it felt more Freddy-focused until they actually fought towards the end."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I thought when I recently sat down and watched it again."
"__MOVIES__ But that being said, I do think their ending fight was pretty cool and I still enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ I think the gore was a little over the top at times, but do you think that was the point?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, definitely. The director knew what he was doing when he made this."
"__MOVIES__ I hate to keep overusing the word 'fun', but I think that's the best word to describe this movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree. Even after all of these years later."
"__MOVIES__ Plus, it's Robert Englund's last time playing Freddy in a motion picture."
"__MOVIES__ That is right! Good point."
