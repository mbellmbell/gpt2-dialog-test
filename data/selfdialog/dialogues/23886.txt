"__SUPERHERO__ Do you watch superhero movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I am a big fan indeed. I have watched quite a few DC comic and Marvel comic superhero movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Great. Do you like Avengers movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, there are two Avengers movies. The first one is really great, but the second one is somehow boring."
"__SUPERHERO__ I totally agree with you. The second Avengers movie has too many action scenes."
"__SUPERHERO__ I heard about that the next Avengers movie will come out next year."
"__SUPERHERO__ I hope it is better than the second Avengers movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Marvel Studio changed the director of the next Avengers movies. So I think the quality could catch up."
