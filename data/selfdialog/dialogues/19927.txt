"__MOVIES__ My son-in-law's birthday is coming up in two months, and I was trying to think what to get him for a present."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of things does he like?"
"__MOVIES__ He loves movies, and has a bunch of dvds. For his last birthday, I bought him three dvds, and he loved them so much."
"__MOVIES__ Which movies did you get him?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Smokey and The Bandit,' 'Smokey and the Bandit 2,' and 'Pitch Perfect 2.'"
"__MOVIES__ I love Burt Reynolds. 'Smokey and the Bandit' was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ He watches those all the time. So I was trying to think what movies I could buy him that he would like as much as those."
"__MOVIES__ Does he like Adam Sandler? Burt Reynolds was in 'The Longest Yard' with Adam Sandler, and it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ He has that one already, He has all the Adam Sandler movies. He also has every movie Will Smith has been in, and the 'Rush Hour' movies."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Oh, I know- what about 'Cannonball Run?' Burt Reynolds was in that, and it was a comedy. I think there were two of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot about those movies. Wasn't Dom DeLuise in those? He was in 'Smokey and The Bandit 2.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he was. Oh, you know who else was in 'Cannonball Run?' Jackie Chan. You said he had all the 'Rush Hour' movies."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember Jackie Chan being in that movie. It's been so long since I saw it, I really don't even remember the movie that well."
"__MOVIES__ It's about a cross country race in their cars."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, he will love that then. He likes car movies, he has all the 'Fast and Furious' movies."
"__MOVIES__ You could probably find the dvd on Amazon and order it for him, they have all kinds of old movies on dvd on Amazon."
"__MOVIES__ That is a great idea, thank you so much!"
"__MOVIES__ Just make sure you order them early, because sometimes shipping takes awhile."
"__MOVIES__ I will, amd I'm going to look and see if there was a 'Cannonball Run' sequel and order that too."
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure there was, and you should be able to find it on Amazon."
