"__POP__ I read Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez might be getting back together- to work on a song."
"__POP__ I thought she was dating someone else now."
"__POP__ She is, but they are on friendly terms nowadays The song was found on SoundCloud, but it turns out it's an old song they were working on before they split up, and it's unfinished."
"__POP__ How unfinished is it?"
"__POP__ Justin has very few vocals, it's mostly Selena's lyrics laid down."
"__POP__ What's the song about?"
"__POP__ It's called 'Steal Our Love.'"
"__POP__ Oh, I doubt she would want to finish working on something like that if she's seeing someone else."
"__POP__ It would be really nice if they worked on it together, and Justin somehow managed to steal their love back."
"__POP__ I think he's grown up a little bit, they would probably do a lot better if they gave it a second chance."
