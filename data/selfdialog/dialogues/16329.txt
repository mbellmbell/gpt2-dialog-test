"__ROCK__ Rock music is stupid."
"__ROCK__ Oh, yeah? Studies show that rock music have the most intelligent lyrics of all types of music."
"__ROCK__ It just talks about sex, drugs, and partying-like all other music."
"__ROCK__ Listen to Rush. They don't deal in those types of lyrics. 'The Pass' is a great example."
"__ROCK__ Why would I want to listen to people without talent and just make noise?"
"__ROCK__ Rush's Alex Lifeson took a 5th century monastic tune and turned it into a melody for one of their songs. Neil Peart is regarded as one of the greatest rock drummers ever. Watch his solo videos."
"__ROCK__ All you talk about is Rush. What about all the others?"
"__ROCK__ From Buddy Holly, to the Beatles, to Led Zeppelin, their music stands the test of time. Most other music (except country) won't be relatable in the next 5 years."
"__ROCK__ Well, it's all noise to me."
"__ROCK__ Just listen with an open ear and mind, and you'll laugh at the hiphop and rap stuff after a while."
