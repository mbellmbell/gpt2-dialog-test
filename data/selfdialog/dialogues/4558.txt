"__MUSIC__ I hate classical music!"
"__MUSIC__ You ever see Yuja Wang?"
"__MUSIC__ You'd Ja Wang -- what!?"
"__MUSIC__ She's one of the greatest ivory ticklers in the world and still in her 20's."
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen her?"
"__MUSIC__ About 9 years ago at the San Francisco Symphony."
"__MUSIC__ What did she play?"
"__MUSIC__ Prokofiev's 'Piano Concerto No. 2' -- it was almost as much an athletic as artistic performance."
"__MUSIC__ Was she wearing sports attire?"
"__MUSIC__ She was decked out in classical music gown chic."
"__MUSIC__ What was so good about it?"
"__MUSIC__ All I remember is the seemingly endless blizzard of 16th notes of the second; the swirling arpeggios, the extreme swings in dynamics, the frantic tirade of galloping chords up and down the keyboard..."
"__MUSIC__ I'm tired just listening to you talk about her."
"__MUSIC__ You were born half-asleep, so that doesn't tell me much."
"__MUSIC__ Go on."
"__MUSIC__ It was only the sturdy, persistent structure of the orchestra kept the tornado at the front of the stage from burning the house down."
"__MUSIC__ Were there fire extinguishers on stage?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but there should have been."
"__MUSIC__ I actually might check her out."
"__MUSIC__ You won't fall asleep, I promise you!"
