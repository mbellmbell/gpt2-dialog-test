"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Are you going to catch the new Fast & Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Nah. They stopped being good when they stopped being about street racing and turned into cheesy spy flicks"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Same. And when Paul Walker died, it kinda made the whole street racing thing seem like a bad idea."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, it sucks when you get killed trying to do the same dumb stunts in reality as in your movies."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I mean, at least they still got Vin Diesel, but he's gettin' kinda old, ya know?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Same for Jason Statham. they need new movies, not more of the same old stuff."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you know Diesel play the voice of a robot?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wait, seriously?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, he was the robot in 'The Iron Giant.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I can see it now: '*BEEP BEEP* I AM GOING TO DO SOME DRIFTING AND MAKE JASON STATHAM LOOK GOOD.'"
