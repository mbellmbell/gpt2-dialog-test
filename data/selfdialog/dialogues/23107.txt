"__DISNEY__ Did you know that I haven't seen Lion KIng in years"
"__DISNEY__ Really? Me too! We should really watch that one of these nights."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, maybe watch Aladdin too."
"__DISNEY__ Good choice, man, Disney had a lot of good movies in the 90s"
"__DISNEY__ I know! They just couldn't miss for the longest time."
"__DISNEY__ Even the direct to video sequels were pretty good. They could have made a lot of money if they released them in theaters."
"__DISNEY__ Toy Story was the only exception, that series made a lot of money."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they're going to make a new Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ I'd think so, it's still pretty popular."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, maybe they'll make a new Toy Story once Frozen's run it's course."
