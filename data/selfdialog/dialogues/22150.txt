"__DISNEY__ Well I loved the animated so much when I was younger hard to accept the new one."
"__DISNEY__ I can see that. I loved christopher walkin in the new one."
"__DISNEY__ He was a good choice for sure. I did think they did a great job casting."
"__DISNEY__ Yes they did scarlet johanson's voice was such a smart choice as well."
"__DISNEY__ I did like that they turned it female. Made sense with the seduction aspect."
