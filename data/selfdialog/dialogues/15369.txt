"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No. Should I?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes! There's action and magic and drama and a bunch of other stuff. It's great."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sounds nice. Maybe I'll check it out."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You should. You like Alan Rickman, right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he's in the series?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he plays Snape. You might or might not like his character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah? Why not?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Watch the movies for yourself and see! Spoilers, or maybe not spoilers, but there's a plot twist involving him in The Half-Blood Prince if I remember correctly."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Alright, I'll keep an eye out for it."
