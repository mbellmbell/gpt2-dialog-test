"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are the best teams in the AFC going into this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Denver has the best defense, but no franchise quarterback. So their good but not top contenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without injury the Oakland Riders would have done even better this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does Oakland still have a team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but Las Vegas is building a tow billion dollar stadium for them to play in within the next three years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But right now they're still in Oakland?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right and they have a good team.  If Carr had not gotten hurt, they might have been in the AFC championship game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What other teams are good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kansas City is consistently good and Baltimore should not be counted out. But they're not the best teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are the best teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both teams have franchise quarterbacks which is one of the most important factors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, you need at least a good quarterback to win in the playoffs.  What else makes them good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both teams are proven winners and both teams are well coached."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who comes out on top?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, New England is the team to beat, but the Steelers have an even better chance than they did last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And don't forget about Las Vegas, I mean Oakland right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I would not count out the Raiders, might come down to the inevitable, whoever stays the healthiest."
