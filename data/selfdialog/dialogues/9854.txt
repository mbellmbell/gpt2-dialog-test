"__COMEDY__ I'm thinking of going to see that Baywatch movie. What do you think of The Rock as a comedy actor?"
"__COMEDY__ I think he can be funny. He was pretty good in Central Intelligence."
"__COMEDY__ Really, you think so? I think Kevin Hart had more funny lines."
"__COMEDY__ Of course Kevin Hart had more funny lines. He is actually a comedian. But The Rock did a good job too."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, I think you are right. He is still getting his comedy acting chops."
"__COMEDY__ Central Intelligence was good because he got to focus mostly on being an action star, doing stunts and fight scenes."
"__COMEDY__ But wasn't it funny to see him wearing that fat suit?"
"__COMEDY__ It looked so fake. I could never see Dwayne Johnson as being chubby."
"__COMEDY__ That was part of what made it hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ That and his jheri curl. It was also weird to see Kevin Hart trying to be a nerd."
