"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hi are you reading the NFL page on ESPN.com?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I am! I am catching up on news for my favorite NF team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas cowboys. I really love Zeke!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I do too! Zeke Elliot is such a great running back for the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is one of the reasons that the team did so great last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea I know Dak Prescott and Zeke are just what the Cowboys needed to get back in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is a shame that with the regular season they had that they bombed in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! I really though the cowboys would make it to the superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it just wasn't the cowboys year. I really wish someone would win besides New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Tom Brady is hot but after deflategate, I just do not like him or that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that besides the Raiders really have a chance next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are ok. The defense is looking better with Bruce Irvin and Karl Joseph."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea but the Raiders QB isn't too bad either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea Derek Carr isn't too bad. If he is healthy this year, they will have a chance to go far in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea can you imagine the Cowboys vs the Raiders in the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea that would be great since Raiders are AFC and Cowboys are NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would take a miracle for both teams to win their conferences though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably. It seems when both team are starting to have a good season, a injury occurs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets hope for a great season for both!"
