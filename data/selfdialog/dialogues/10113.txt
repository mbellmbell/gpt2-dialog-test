"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Would you consider The Beastie Boys to be rap?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They were a rather unique act, largely hardcore punk early in their career, absolutely rap influenced in the middle and later, would say more hip hop."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hip hop is a good way of putting them I would think, how did you like them?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They were good, but I'm more into things like Run DMC."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow that's a group I've not listened to in ages, classic stuff though"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Classic as it gets, was a shame what happened to Jam Master Jay though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Didn't he die sadly?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He did was shot and killed."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow that's awful, it seems sometimes the greats go too early."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah it's a shame, but at least we have their stuff to enjoy. Speaking of which the track Sucker M.C.'s is calling my name."
