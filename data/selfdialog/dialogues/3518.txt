"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Rise Against album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I thought it was pretty good, stuck to the roots of their previous music, what did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ About the same. It's definitely got some catchy tunes on it."
"__MUSIC__ They are coming in concert soon, are you going."
"__MUSIC__ No, I think I'll be out of town. Are you?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I'm planning on going to the City and Colour show the week before that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? I didn't know you liked him"
"__MUSIC__ Yes - he is the best! I can't wait for him to put out a new album."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think that's going to happen soon?"
"__MUSIC__ It seems like he has been playing some new songs at shows, but I'm not sure if there is a new album in the works."
"__MUSIC__ It seems like since he has quit Alexisonfire, he seems to put out a new album every two years or so."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and it's been two years - it's time!"
"__MUSIC__ What band are you most excited about that has a new album coming out?"
"__MUSIC__ I dont know any in the future, but the new Ryan Adams album is good, but not my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ The porches album was really good, did you hear that?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and I heard Radiohead too"
"__MUSIC__ That's a band that I just can't get behind - them and Coldplay, it all sounds the same."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that."
"__MUSIC__ There's just a lot of really bad music on the radio now, I don't even know where people find new music."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely agree - pop music has mostly forgotten about actually singing or any sort of harmonies."
