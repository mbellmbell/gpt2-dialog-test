"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Bon Iver's new album, 22, A Million?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't listened to him in a while."
"__MUSIC__ It's really different, I'm not sure how I feel about it."
"__MUSIC__ Different how?"
"__MUSIC__ It sounds a bit like he's been doing drugs."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of music sounds like that now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's just really different from his first two. The lyrics also make no sense."
"__MUSIC__ They probably make sense to him somehow though."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, and he's always been a 'read between the lines' type artist."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the lyrics have gotten progressively more vague album after album."
"__MUSIC__ They have, absolutely. The new album is worth a listen though."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'll check it out."
"__MUSIC__ It's really good background music to just relax into."
"__MUSIC__ Does it still have that way of making you emotional without knowing why?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, a lot of tracks do. It's no For Emma, but it's pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ I'll take a look into it then. Do you prefer any specific songs?"
"__MUSIC__ #29 Strafford Apts is probably my favorite right now, it's also one of the most normal titles you'll see."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check it out. Normal titles?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a lot of them are very cryptic and make no real sense."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that sounds pretty interesting."
