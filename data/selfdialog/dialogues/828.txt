"__MUSIC__ You know Lemmy, from Motorhead, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, of course I do. Lemmy is God!"
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, before Motorhead, he was in a band called Hawkwind."
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of them"
"__MUSIC__ They were well known in certain circles. Kind of a Space/Art/Psychedelic Rock band."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds interesting. Did Lemmy sing?"
"__MUSIC__ No, he played Bass. Anyway the band was very influential and lots of rockers and hardcore fans talk about Hawkwind."
"__MUSIC__ What's their best album?"
"__MUSIC__ I personally prefer Warrior on the Edge of Time."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds epic! Kind of a Moorcock vibe!"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! That's another thing. The band members were huge Michael Moorcock fans and Moorcock himself wrote lyrics for some of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ No way! Moorcock wrote rock songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They have another album titled Chronicle of the Black Sword."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, Elric. Do any other Moorcock characters turn up in their songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Chronicle of the Black Sword is mainly about Elric, but Jerry Cornelius also makes an appearance."
"__MUSIC__ So, Moorcock's Eternal Champion cycle shows up in Hawkwind. Led Zeppelin had songs with Tolkien references."
"__MUSIC__ Tracing the influence of Science Fiction and Fantasy on rock would be an interesting project."
"__MUSIC__ Surely, it's been done, though."
"__MUSIC__ To some extent, but I'm not sure how far or how deep anyone has taken the idea."
"__MUSIC__ That would be a cool project! Maybe even something that would be worthy of a book."
