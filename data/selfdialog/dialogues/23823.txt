"__SUPERHERO__ What did you think of Captain America: Civil War?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought it was great."
"__SUPERHERO__ It had a great cast, and is probably the best ensemble superhero movie in history."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree with that. They did well with such a large cast of characters and not losing the viewer with too many stories."
"__SUPERHERO__ Everyone got their moment to shine, but Spider-man was probably the crowning glory of the movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ I really like the new Peter Parker. I'm looking forward to the next Spider-man movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ He played well off of Robert Downey Jr."
"__SUPERHERO__ And the big fight scene between the two factions in the middle of the movie was outstanding."
"__SUPERHERO__ Great action and great interplay between the heroes."
"__SUPERHERO__ I saw X-Men: Apocalypse right after this, and it couldn't really compete at all. Marvel is just too good at what they do."
