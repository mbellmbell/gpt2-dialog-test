"__MOVIES__ What do you want to do this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we could go to the movies."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like fun. What would you want to see."
"__MOVIES__ How about Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm...I don't know about that one."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really a fan of all these Disney, live-action, remakes."
"__MOVIES__ I think they're cute."
"__MOVIES__ I like most of the originals. It seems like a money making scheme to me."
"__MOVIES__ I guess."
"__MOVIES__ I say leave well enough alone."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Jungle Book."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately."
"__MOVIES__ Huh?!"
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't anywhere near as good as the animated version."
"__MOVIES__ I admit it wasn't quite as good, but the CGI was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was pretty good, but that is difintely not something I rate movies on."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's a little over used these day, and most the time, not to a good affect."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, well, what do you want to watch this weekend?"
