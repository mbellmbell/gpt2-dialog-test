"__MOVIES__ Do you know of any good movies coming out soon?"
"__MOVIES__ I really want to see Sofia Coppola's new movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I've heard of that. What is it called?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called The Beguiled."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Elle Fanning, Kirsten Dunst, Nicole Kidman, and Colin Farrell are the main stars."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, neat. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a civil war drama."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know if it's gotten good reviews?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they've been pretty good. Sofia won an award for Best Director for it at Cannes this year."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. I feel like her films can be sort of hit or miss, but I think I'll give this film a try."
"__MOVIES__ It's also interesting because apparently Colin Farrell is the only male actor in the film really."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that is interesting. I love how Sofia's films always have such strong and prominent roles for women."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. It's way too rare in Hollywood to have films with good female characters."
"__MOVIES__ How many times have she and Kirsten Dunst worked together now?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a good question. I'm not really sure."
"__MOVIES__ They also worked together on The Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette so at least three times now."
"__MOVIES__ They make a really good team."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning are wonderful as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it should be a really great film I think."
