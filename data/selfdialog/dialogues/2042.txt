"__MUSIC__ I'd do jazz for my wedding."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a little low-key."
"__MUSIC__ Well okay like... jazz during low-key stuff like eating."
"__MUSIC__ You're thinking of like a big band setup instead of a DJ?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! It's classy!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess. I'd kind of want some pop music though."
"__MUSIC__ Pop music isn't timeless like your wedding is."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I want everybody to dance and have fun in the moment."
"__MUSIC__ People dance and have lots of fun with a big band."
"__MUSIC__ Do they, though?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Oh my god, have you never been to a bar hosting a big band?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh, no. I mean, I go to concerts, but..."
"__MUSIC__ I'll take you some time. There's this bar that does it every couple of weeks."
"__MUSIC__ This isn't like sad, The Wedding Singer-type bands, are they?"
"__MUSIC__ No dude they're like legit musicians that work in orchestras for their careers."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds really interesting. Do you need to know how to, you know, swing dance or whatever you do?"
"__MUSIC__ You don't swing dance. I mean, you can, but... it's just like fun couples dancing."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. I'm willing to give it a shot but don't blame me if I look like an uncomfortable 8th grader at the school dance."
