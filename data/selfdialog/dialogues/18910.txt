"__MOVIES__ Hey have you ever seen any French movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I heard my friends mention a good French movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really, do you remember what it was called?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think they said it was called Amelie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a great film, I've seen that, you really should watch it!"
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a French lady living in Paris and she tries to improve peoples lives."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds really cool!"
"__MOVIES__ It really is."
"__MOVIES__ Who is the director?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really sure, but it's shot in a very beautiful way."
"__MOVIES__ So it's an arthouse movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I suppose you could say that but it has a sensible plot and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's good, I hate movies where it is really difficult to follow what's happening."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they are a bit silly. I think Amelie is playing at the cinema this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right, do you want to go together?"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a good plan to me, I could watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ Great, I look forward to seeing the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, see you on Saturday."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, see you then!"
