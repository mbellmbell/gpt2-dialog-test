"__STAR_WARS__ I was just reminiscing about when I saw 'The Empire Strikes Back'. You know, I felt pretty helpless after watching that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't see it when it was in the theaters, I was too young. Didn't it come out in 1980?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I was in ninth grade back then. I saw it because I loved 'Star Wars: A New Hope' so much."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think I saw it on TV. So what made you feel so helpless?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well for one thing, Mark Hamill's character, Luke Skywalker wasn't the focus of the film, he was only half of it."
"__STAR_WARS__ And what else? I mean, didn't he spend time with Yoda, and do Jedi training?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well yes, he did, but following Han Solo, Chewbacca and Leia was starting to get on my nerves. They seemed pretty unfocused."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and then they got into trouble in Cloud City, when they hung out with Lando Calrissian. Though Billy Dee Williams was interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ I found the ending to be the most shocking thing, ever. Luke, losing his arm to Darth Vader, and Han being encased in carbonite - it was really too much for me."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was the end of times. The seventies were over, the oil crisis past, the war in Vietnam complete - people didn't know what to expect, and 'The Empire Strikes Back' reflected all of that."
