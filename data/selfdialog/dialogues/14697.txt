"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So, what's up? Are you glad it's Friday."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm so glad. I'm so ready for the weekend."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah? Are you doing anything interesting?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I might go and see a movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Is there anything good playing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There's a lot out, actually."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. I've been seeing a lot of movie trailers lately."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yep. There's Wonderwoman, Pirates of the Carribean, Guardians of the Galaxy and a bunch more."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, Wonderwoman is a bit of a change, I guess."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. I kind of feel like they just keep remaking old movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. They remake them or do sequels constantly."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wonderwoman hasn't really been done in such a long time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Also, there's the Aquaman movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I heard about that. It's supposed to be a whole new twist on that superhero."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, and they haven't really done an Aquaman movie yet."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He has dark hair and looks completely different for the new movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's funny how far they've come with superhero movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They've been making them since those old black and white Superman movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Think of all the money they spend to make one of those movies these days."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. It's hard to imagine they even spent much money on Superman's costume in those old black and white movies."
