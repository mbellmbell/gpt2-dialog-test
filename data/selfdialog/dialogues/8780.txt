"__BEATLES__ With the Sgt.Pepper album cover some say it was creepy with occult overtones?"
"__BEATLES__ Most definately I could see why they are saying that."
"__BEATLES__ Care to clarify?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes,well for one Aleister Crowley the godfather of Satanists was on that cover."
"__BEATLES__ Wow! I could see why that album is a little creepy."
"__BEATLES__ Speaking of creepy the wax models of the Beatles creeped me out on that cover!"
"__BEATLES__ Do you think having Aleister Crowley on the cover was really a sign that the Beatles were opening up the door to occultism?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, this was a peak. Also Lewis Carrol who Crowley loved was also on that cover."
"__BEATLES__ Who knew?Everybody back then thought the Beatles were innocent lads from Liverpool."
"__BEATLES__ They were very far from four innocent lads from Liverpool."
