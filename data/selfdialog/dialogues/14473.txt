"__HORROR__ Did you watch the Jason movies growing up."
"__HORROR__ I did, those Friday the 13th movies scared me to death."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I had nightmares about Jason all the time growing up."
"__HORROR__ I don't think our parents knew what we were watching during all those sleep overs."
"__HORROR__ I think if they had they wouldn't have let us watch them."
"__HORROR__ Which one was your favorite out of them all?"
"__HORROR__ Friday the 13th, the final chapter.  It was the first one I saw."
