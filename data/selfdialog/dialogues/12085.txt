"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, are you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Can't wait for the first game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You. I can't wait to see Green Bay run the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Green Bay, get out of here. They are not going to the superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that? They have one of the best quarterbacks in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you talking about, Aaron Rodgers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it. He has a ranking with touchdown to interception ratio of 4.12."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what does that really mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That means for me, that Rodgers is number 1 quarterback in the NFL, and he can take his team to the superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you are forgetting the team has to do their part too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. Ha Ha, it just sounds like I'm getting ahead of myself. Looking forward to a good season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm going to stick with my boys from Houston Texas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your a Houston Texan fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it. They may have never made it to the Superbowl, but there is always potential."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is their quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe this year they are using Deshaun Watson from Cleveland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they ever make it to the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know they did 3 or 4 times, but there could be more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'll make sure to keep an eye out for these Texans you talk up so much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, and I hope your team has a good season. Peace."
