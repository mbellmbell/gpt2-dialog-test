"__BEATLES__ Hey Dad, remember when you used to tell me to 'turn that garbage off' when I was listening to the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, why do you ask?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, I just noticed you singing along to 'Elenore Rigby' on the classic-rock radio."
"__BEATLES__ So?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, 'Elenore Rigby' is a Beatles song."
"__BEATLES__ It is?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. It was in their movie Yellow Submarine, way back in the mid-sixtys. I was in high school then and you hated everything I listened to."
"__BEATLES__ Well, it sounds so much better than anything else being played now, I guess I've kind of gotten used to it."
"__BEATLES__ Come on Dad, admit it. You've more than just 'gotten used to it.' You've actually learned to like the song."
"__BEATLES__ Okay, I'll admit it. Just don't tell your Mother. She still says no music worth listening to has been released since 1955."
