"__DISNEY__ Disney did a version of Peter Pan too, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that was a good one."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed. Though being a kid forever doesn't sound as good as it once did."
"__DISNEY__ No, the immortality thing is maybe a bit frightening. That's why Wendy ultimately has to return home."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe Peter should have taken a page from her book."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah maybe. But I think his role was to be a foil for Hook."
"__DISNEY__ Someone had to keep him in check."
"__DISNEY__ Right, and that wasn't going to be Smee! Or the Lost Boys for that matter."
"__DISNEY__ You'd think that Tinkerbell could hold her own - fairy dust and all."
"__DISNEY__ I'm still very unclear on what fairies can and can't do."
