"__BASEBALL__ Who do you think the front runners for the World Series are this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I think obviously you have to start with the two teams that were in it last year, the Cubs and the Indians."
"__BASEBALL__ But both of them are struggling a bit right now, and other teams are surging."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, yes they aren't leading either of their perspective leagues, but I think they are still frontrunners."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you think that is?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Indians are a little banged up, and coming off a long year, and they are still in the lead of their division."
"__BASEBALL__ What about the Cubs?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Cubs still have one of the most dangerous and young lineups in Baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they don't have great starting pitching and their bullpen is not great."
"__BASEBALL__ That is true, but they can always go and get someone at the deadline."
"__BASEBALL__ What about Encarnacion not playing well?"
"__BASEBALL__ He has traditionally gotten off to slow starts, but I think he will pick up where he left off last year. Who do you like?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I think that the Yankees are a year ahead of schedule and they are young and powerful lineup that can really do damage."
"__BASEBALL__ You think the Cubs pitching staff is bad, but you are okay with the staff of the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ Of course not, just like Cubs, their starting pitching is pretty bad. But they have a lot of ammunition for midseason trades."
"__BASEBALL__ That is true, they do have a lot of young talent, but will they be willing to part with it, for rental players?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think they will move some pieces."
"__BASEBALL__ What about in the National League, anyone you like?"
"__BASEBALL__ Other than the Cubs, I guess the Dodgers would be the favorite. Best pitcher in baseball and also that lineup."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes the Dodgers are always a threat to win it all."
