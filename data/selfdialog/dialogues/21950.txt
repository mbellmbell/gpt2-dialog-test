"__DISNEY__ I miss old-school Disney animation."
"__DISNEY__ I can see that. Which do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Stuff like The Little Mermaid or 101 Dalmatians."
"__DISNEY__ You're right. No cartoon films look like that anymore."
"__DISNEY__ I like their 3D stuff, but I just miss the classics."
"__DISNEY__ There is something to be said for appreciating the old way of doing something."
"__DISNEY__ I can't even remember the last time I saw an animated film that wasn't all 3D."
"__DISNEY__ Even the ones I have seen look like they were all done with computers."
"__DISNEY__ I miss that hand-wrought style of the 80s and 90s."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if Disney will ever go back to it!"
