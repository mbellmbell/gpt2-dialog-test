"__ROCK__ So rock is pretty old, I know--my dad used to go on about itâ€”but I feel confused about how the genre really started?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah me too, but I took a couple classes on American Popular Music in college and that really cleared some things up."
"__ROCK__ So what did you learn?"
"__ROCK__ Well, I think a lot of it has to do with marketing categories, how the industry sold music to consumers. Which surprised me."
"__ROCK__ Whoa, I didn't realize the music business was so commercial back in the day."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, it's super ridiculous when people talk about music being commercial today....It's ALWAYS been commercial in American Popular Music this century."
"__ROCK__ So what were some of these marketing categories? That influenced rock music?"
"__ROCK__ The way I understand it, rock kind of emerged as a confluence between Rhythm & Blues and Country& Western."
"__ROCK__ Well, that kind of makes sense."
"__ROCK__ But I was even more fascinated to learn that those categories don't divide up as neatly along racial lines as some of the pop culture stories (especially about Elvis) might make you think!"
