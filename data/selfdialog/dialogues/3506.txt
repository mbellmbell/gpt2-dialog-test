"__MUSIC__ Do you remember the good old days of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Here we go again, what good old days are you talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ The 90's man!  Every genre was great back then."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of like the music of today better."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe you. Name one band that's better than the 90's grunge scene."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think Imagine Dragons is better."
"__MUSIC__ So you're saying Imagine Dragons is better than Nirvana or Pearl Jam?"
"__MUSIC__ I hate Nirvana, so yeah that's what I'm saying."
"__MUSIC__ How can you say the guys who sing about radioactive are better than one of the greatest rock bands of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Now you're pushing it, there's no way Nirvana is one of the greatest rock bands of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Everyone knows Smells like teen spirit."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but they aren't even close to being on the same level as Queen."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say they're pretty close."
"__MUSIC__ You've lost your mind.  Anyways beside's Nirvana, who else is better than the bands now."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I already said pearl jam, but what about the Smashing Pumpkins?"
"__MUSIC__ The smashing pumpkins were good, too bad Billy Corgan is a crazy person now though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, didn't he join a cult or something?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so.  But back to the original topic, I feel like the 70s and 80s were the good old days in music, not the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I could agree with that."
"__MUSIC__ Finally you're using your brain."
