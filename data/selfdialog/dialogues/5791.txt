"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they will find some on to replace Carrie Fisher in the Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, or they will use old footage."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like they did in Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, showing a young Fisher."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they should replace the guy who played the young Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hayden Christianson?Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, they need to have Vader show up some how, in a flash back maybe."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not think they will."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe in a Jedi ghost form, as they did in the Empire Strikes back."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the new films are trying to distance themselves from the first three episodes."
