"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously dude, I am still cleaning up fireworks from the fourth of July."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That means were more than halfway from the end of last season to the beginning of next. I cannot wait."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How far away is the season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just a mere two months before we have weekly television broadcasts for seventeen glorious weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite team again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Surely you jest. The Pittsburgh Steelers of course!  What other teams are there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah, the New England Patriots, the Dallas Cowboys, the Green Bay Packers, the San Francisco...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I know. I know there are other teams, of course, I am just saying the Steelers are my favorite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they playing any really good teams this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They play the Packers in a Sunday night game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the big game is in December. They are at home against none other than Tom Brady and the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mark that down as a loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you talking about?  No way the Steelers lose that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way? The Steelers never beat the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's just not true.  I admit they haven't beaten them lately; but the series is actually tied 15-15."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the Steelers and the Patriots have played thirty times and neither team has a winning record?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's absolutely correct.  They have each won fifteen out of thirty games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I never would have thought that; I thought the Patriots beat everybody all the time. Live and learn."
