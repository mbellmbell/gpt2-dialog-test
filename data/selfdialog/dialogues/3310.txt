"__MUSIC__ What do you think are the best all-time Rolling Stones songs?"
"__MUSIC__ How about Beast of Burden? I think that's the name, isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a good one. I like Start Me Up."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can definitely imagine Mick strutting around for that one."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe he's still going. He just had a baby."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if he ever imagined how successful the Stones would be."
"__MUSIC__ You've got to give him credit. But don't forget Keith Richards."
"__MUSIC__ Or the drummer? I think it was Charlie Watts."
"__MUSIC__ I think so. He always had a cool vibe."
"__MUSIC__ I think Charlie Watts was supposed to be the sane member, the straight man, as they say."
"__MUSIC__ Usually the drummer is the crazy one."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I think they just get in a rhythmic zone and don't have to think too much."
"__MUSIC__ I should have been a rock drummer. But I'd probably lose my hearing."
"__MUSIC__ I don't even think you need to hear. You can just feel the beat through your body."
"__MUSIC__ Who are the other great rock drummers?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Neil Peart, from Rush."
"__MUSIC__ I think he wrote most of their lyrics too."
"__MUSIC__ I always liked their lyrics. I don't get why so many people hate Rush."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. They kind of did their own thing for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ They make make you think, even when you're having a good time."
