"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, here's my pick for the Superbowl this year.  Dallas vs New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All right.  I think it will be Carolina vs Denver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, so you don't think the Patriots will make it this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope not.  I'm getting pretty tired of the New England Cheaters winning year after year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's what happens when you win all the time.  I remember when my cowboys used to get that kind of hate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some of us still hate on them pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's for sure.  All teams that dominate a decade get that.  The Steelers in the '70's and 9ers in the '80's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And part of the '90's too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and the boys in the '90's.  But as America's team they have had haters for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like the Raiders.  You either love em' or hate em'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, who wins the AFC East then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I think that New England will win that.  I think they will lose to Denver in the AFC Championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, What about the AFC north?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Pittsburgh and Big Ben got another year in them and will take the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the South."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think any team from there is going anywhere but Tennessee will probably win that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably.  Who is going to give Denver trouble in the West?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably KC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not the Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not even sure they will be called the Raiders, much less them being much of a challenge for a while."
