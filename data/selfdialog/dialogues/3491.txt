"__MUSIC__ I always like to think that Grace Slick made Jefferson Airplane, but they actually had a lot of their sound before she got with them."
"__MUSIC__ I know. She's so strange, you want to give it to her, but Marty was actually pretty weird and had some great songs already there."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like Comin' Back to Me."
"__MUSIC__ Her boyfriend wrote White Rabbit. I mean her husband -- before she joined Airplane."
"__MUSIC__ What a song.  Did you know they played on a rooftop before the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ No, did they?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally.  I wonder if that's where the Beatles got the idea."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. The rooftop concert is great, though, isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Paul and John look like they are having a blast!"
"__MUSIC__ They sound so amazing, too!"
"__MUSIC__ Paul's voice is so incredibly big and round at that time!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! Jim Morrison was the same way.  I wonder if it had something to do with their big beards then?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha! I don't know, but Morrison is the same way on L.A. Woman. Just this HUGE voice!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! Changeling always blows my mind."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love that song.  It's just ALL THERE."
"__MUSIC__ It totally is.  I don't think there's a bad song on that album."
"__MUSIC__ It's my favorite Doors album."
"__MUSIC__ What an album to go out on."
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree."
"__MUSIC__ He really died at the peak of his powers."
