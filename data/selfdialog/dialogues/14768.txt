"__ACTION__ Which of the Die Hard movies is your favorite?"
"__ACTION__ I'm going to go ahead and actually pick a somewhat recent one."
"__ACTION__ Please, not the one in Russia."
"__ACTION__ Oh, of course not. That was ridiculous."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, A Good Day to Die Hard was insanely awful."
"__ACTION__ Live Free or Die Hard, with Justin Long"
"__ACTION__ That was pretty good, yeah."
"__ACTION__ Which was the one with the racist sign that he had to wear?"
"__ACTION__ I think that was Die Hard 2. Timely with the riots."
"__ACTION__ That was kind of stupid and disturbing but we got to meet Samuel L Jackson!"
