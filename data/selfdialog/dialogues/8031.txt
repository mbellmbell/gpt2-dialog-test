"__POP__ I kind of don't care for her."
"__POP__ Why not?  She's a great singer."
"__POP__ Oh, she's good.  Her music is just boring."
"__POP__ She has so much emotion in her music though."
"__POP__ I think she does, but it's just not for me."
"__POP__ I guess we all have our opinion."
"__POP__ Don't get me wrong though, she deserves all her awards."
"__POP__ You wouldn't buy her album though."
"__POP__ Nope.  Not me."
