"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL Season starts in exactly 2 months with Pats, and Chiefs. Who you got?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on man, you can't bet against Brady and the Pats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true but it's the regular season, the Chiefs are winners of the regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, they really are, but I'm more looking forward to the Sunday night game with the boys, and Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak and Zeek are fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mix that in with OBJ and it should be a fun watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you think will take the NFC east this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You gotta go with the boys, because Eli stinks, The Eagles are young, and who knows what you will get out of the Skins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was hoping Cousins and the skins turn it around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is getting a raw deal in Washington. I want to see him go somewhere else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean like Cleveland?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HAHA! Now that is a funny joke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't know when the Browns will turn it around, but it has to happen one day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You would think law of averages would be on their side but them and the Lions always seem to be bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, neither have been to the Super Bowl ever, and both haven't won a championship since the 50's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly I wonder sometimes what it's like to be a fan of those teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has to be rough as you are constantly bad, or just never win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least the Lions have some talent and are bareable to watch. The Browns are just awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lions actually have a decent chance to win a few games, but the Browns are still far away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Which means the NFL is all the same this year and the Patriots will win another Super Bowl."
