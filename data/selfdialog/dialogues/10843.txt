"__FASHION__ I need to dress business casual for work tomorrow. I'm not sure what that means."
"__FASHION__ Business casual definitely means different things in different places."
"__FASHION__ I don't want to wear jeans. Even if they're nice I don't think they're dressy enough."
"__FASHION__ I agree. What about slacks or some relaxed trousers?"
"__FASHION__ I have a beautiful pair of navy blue trousers."
"__FASHION__ What about a top that is made out of a nice fabric?"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure. What fabrics are you thinking of?"
"__FASHION__ Well, I think cashmere and jersey are inherently classier. Don't you think?"
"__FASHION__ I agree. I have some solid short sleeve cashmere sweater tops."
"__FASHION__ What colors?"
"__FASHION__ Well, I have a dark grey, a black and a brown."
"__FASHION__ I think that dark grey would be the best color to wear with navy blue pants."
"__FASHION__ I do too. I love that color combination."
"__FASHION__ What about a jacket?"
"__FASHION__ I'm going to wear a blazer."
"__FASHION__ Ok, will you wear jewelry?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, I'm going to wear something classic like pearls or diamond studs."
"__FASHION__ Classic is always a good choice!"
"__FASHION__ True, but I may actually go with jewelry that makes a bit more of a statement since its casual Friday."
"__FASHION__ I would go with a statement necklace."
