"__HORROR__ Have you seen any new horror movies in theaters lately?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, my sister and I watched 'Life' the other day. It's a Sci-Fi horror."
"__HORROR__ Oh I watched a trailer on that one. It kind of looks like an off-shoot of Alien."
"__HORROR__ Oh I watched a trailer on that one. It kind of looks like an off-shoot of Alien."
"__HORROR__ Give me a quick run down of Life?"
"__HORROR__ No! I will do better then that. How about I take you on Saturday after we get off work."
"__HORROR__ I would love that, as long as it does not have a lot of jump scares. I love to see Ryan Reynolds in a Sci Fi movie as well. I loved him as Dead Pool!"
"__HORROR__ Oh he is a great actor, but then so is Jake Gyllenhall. You won't be disappointed. And 'Life' as a few good jump scares, but you will be fine. A good horror movie is not good without a few of them to keep you on your toes."
"__HORROR__ True. Now you have me all psyched to see it. Saturday won't come soon enough."
"__HORROR__ Gives you something to look forwards too!"
