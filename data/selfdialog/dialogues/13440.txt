"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you excited about the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I am!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been waiting since last year when it ended."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So have I. I've been ready for it to start every since it ended last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait to see how the Dallas Cowboys do this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes me too. I'm anxious to see what's going to happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As well as they did last year, this year should be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping it is. Last year Dak Prescott did an awesome job as quarterback,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know he really did. He was only backup quarterback and looked what happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know he became the Cowboys number one quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know and he is awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really is. He really showed Romo up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did he put him to shame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Romo started out being a good quarterback but started staying injured all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. He cost the Cowboys a lot of games too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really did with all those interceptions he threw."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. He had started looking really bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know he really looked awful and was making the whole team look awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's going to do better with ending the playing career and moving to what he is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too. He's a likable guy. His playing days were just over."
