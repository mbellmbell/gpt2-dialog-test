"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Tin Cup?"
"__MOVIES__ I have. It's a classic golf movie"
"__MOVIES__ It sure is. What's your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite part is the end when Kevin Costner is down to one golf ball and needs to hit an incredible shot."
"__MOVIES__ He put on a pretty good show for the fans. I'm surprised he made it"
"__MOVIES__ you had to expect he was going to put that last ball on the green. It's hollywood!"
"__MOVIES__ that's true. I kind of thought he would make it on the first shot and win the tournament"
"__MOVIES__ I did too, but as soon as that didn't happen I thought he might hit a bunch in the water!"
"__MOVIES__ I have watched that movie so many times it's one of favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Mine too. I watch it about once a month or whenever the wife is out of town."
"__MOVIES__ who was the female actress in that movie?  I can never remember her name."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's Susan Sarandon?"
"__MOVIES__ that sounds right."
"__MOVIES__ She's fairly attractive in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes she is. I don't know if she helped shooter out or hurt him in the long run."
"__MOVIES__ I think she helped in with the psychology of the game, but hurts him with the love interest."
"__MOVIES__ I would agree."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what kind of golfer Shooter would have been if she wasn't in the picture."
"__MOVIES__ I guess we'll never know."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right!"
