"__MUSIC__ Do people even listen to the radio anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ I try to, every time I'm in the car. But I just end up turning off the radio, feeling frustrated and annoyed."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you feel frustrated?"
"__MUSIC__ Because all the stations play the same songs over and over. I swear if I hear Adele sing, 'Water Under the BREEDGE' one more time... Just say BRIDGE!"
"__MUSIC__ Very funny. Yeah she is very overrated. I mean she has a beautiful voice and all, but...."
"__MUSIC__ But the truth is her songs are boring as hell. She only really had two good ones, 'Rolling in the Deep' and 'Someone Like You'."
"__MUSIC__ But everything she releases seems to be a hit."
"__MUSIC__ People don't know any better! That's all they hear, day in, day out. They're brainwashed by advertisers into thinking this is talent."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm.. that could be true."
"__MUSIC__ And all the classic rock stations I listen too.. they play the same songs by the same bands over and over!"
"__MUSIC__ For example?"
"__MUSIC__ The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Journey and The Eagles. Oh and lately there's been a Def Leppard revival but only with their worst songs."
"__MUSIC__ You should start your own radio show."
"__MUSIC__ If I did, my playlists would be radically different. I'd teach people about classics that haven't been done to death."
"__MUSIC__ So if you did do your own classic rock radio show, you wouldn't play any Stones or Led Zep?"
"__MUSIC__ I might, but I wouldn't be caught dead playing, 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' or 'Stairway To Heaven'. And no Aerosmith either?"
"__MUSIC__ You wouldn't play any Aerosmith? They're one of the biggest bands in the world."
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately. I might play Dio's cover of 'Dream On', which in my opinion is superior to the original."
"__MUSIC__ Is it? I'll have to check that out."
"__MUSIC__ You can find it on youtube, you'll see what I mean..... radio needs something new to keep it going into the new era..."
