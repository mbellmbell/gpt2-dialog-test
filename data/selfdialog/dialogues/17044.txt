"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, are you kidding? We went together."
"__MOVIES__ Oh...right. Awkward. Anyway, how would you compare that to the first?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought that this movie had a better villain overall than the first, but the silliness was overwhelming."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, everything was a massive joke. It's fine at times, but here the epicness was brought down by the humor."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can see that, but the characters were better."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree, of course. Gamora's character was completely misused."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ Because I felt that way, silly. And because she wasn't used in the plot; she just fought her sister until they agreed not to anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a bit odd. I see that now."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad you do. What did you like most about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved baby Groot! He's so cute."
"__MOVIES__ You're such a child. Groot did nothing the whole movie except dance during an action movie."
"__MOVIES__ No, he caught the one bad guy and threw him off the bridge."
"__MOVIES__ You're saying a baby tree flat-out murdering someone is fine because he's cute?"
"__MOVIES__ You like ruining movies, don't you?"
"__MOVIES__ I should work at CinemaSins."
"__MOVIES__ What are you  most looking forward to going forward?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Star-Lord saw the whole universe and now has infinite knowledge that doesn't go away now that he's no longer a god. How will he use that in the final Marvel movies?"
