"__BASKETBALL__ Did you ever play basketball growing up?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, I was in the kids leagues until 8th grade or so. You?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I played until early high school. Why did you stop?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I was forced to do it in the first place. And, bullying."
"__BASKETBALL__ What happened?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They made us play shirts vs. skins, and the team captain every time said skins for us so I'd have to be shirtless."
"__BASKETBALL__ So?"
"__BASKETBALL__ So, I'm fat. The point was to humiliate me."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's awful. I'm so sorry."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I hard-fouled him a lot. I also just wasn't very good, despite my mom's assertions."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, parents are dumb and don't see truth a lot."
"__BASKETBALL__ So why did you quit?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I got to the high school level and had stopped growing. You can't play high school basketball at 5'9'"
"__BASKETBALL__ Ha, true, unless you can dunk for the show. I was 6'1 when I quit and I wasn't tall enough anymore."
"__BASKETBALL__ I also had a lot of injuries."
"__BASKETBALL__ What did basketball do to you?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I was the fat kid, remember? Wind sprints destroyed my knees. One time I hurt them bad but my brother convinced my family I was faking it."
"__BASKETBALL__ How are they now?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They still hurt. And I have rotator cuff issues. You?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No injuries for me, luckily. Sorry about your experiences."
