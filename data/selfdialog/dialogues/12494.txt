"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want to watch more sports this year. I think it will bring me closer to my boyfriend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What type of sports do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like to watch gymnastics and table-tennis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are these the sports he likes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately no. He really only watches football but I have never liked football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should give it a try, you may be surprised. I didn't like it much either when I was young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What changed your mind?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I just didn't like it because I didn't know the rules! It just seemed that they were starting and stopping constantly and it made me feel impatient and annoyed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's exactly how I feel! I don't know the rules at all!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can teach you the rules. It's not hard at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thank you so much. I can't wait!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No problem. In fact if you'd like we can go to a Steelers came when the season starts. My cousin is usually able to get me tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, NFL football doesn't happen all year round?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, there are seasons. The season starts in September and end with Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Superbowl is usually in February right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! How did you know that ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My boyfriend made me watch it with him and his friends the past couple of years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure you had no idea going on, but at least you may have enjoyed the halftime shows"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did! Do all NFL games have great performers like that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not big celebrities like the Superbowl would, no. Usually just a local singer, a marching band, and cheerleaders dancing."
