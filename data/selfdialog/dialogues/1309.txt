"__MUSIC__ So who do you like better, Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears?"
"__MUSIC__ Gosh, that's a no brainer!  I love Britney Spears' music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, her music is definitely great, but I like Christina better as a person."
"__MUSIC__ Well Britney definitely has had some bad press.  But her music is just incredible."
"__MUSIC__ I did like the originals.  Oops I Did It Again is amazing and so is Hit Me Baby One More Time."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I don't think Christina has anything similar."
"__MUSIC__ No, you're probably right.  Her best song was probably Genie in a Bottle."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah exactly, and while catchy it doesn't compare to Britney's hits."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they were both on that Mickey Mouse Club back when they were children, remember?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wonder if they knew each other."
"__MUSIC__ I do not know.  They both have children now, don't they?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't think they're making music anymore.  I'm not sure."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I wonder who the next pop princess will be."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure.  Seems like there's always someone new coming up."
"__MUSIC__ Miley Cyrus definitely fell short."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she seemed good at first but then she went off the deep end."
"__MUSIC__ Kinda similar to Britney, I'd say."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say she's much worse than Britney.  Britney got bizarre but never downright offensive."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's a good point.  No, I guess it's not the same."
"__MUSIC__ No.  And Miley's music was never as good."
