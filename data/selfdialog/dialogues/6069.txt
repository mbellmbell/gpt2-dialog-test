"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think the Phantom Menace movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was really bad and really good at the same time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ How was it bad?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar Binks is a joke of a character and the special effects seemed like they were really trying too hard to make everything use CGI."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a fair point, what did you like about them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Maul was awesome, and the new double sided lightsaber was really cool as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea I liked that too."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hated that they killed Maul off though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea he was one of the more interesting characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope in the future they bring back that race of characters.  I'd like to know more about them."
