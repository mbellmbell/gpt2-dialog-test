"__SUPERHERO__ Did you ever see the original Hulk directed by Ang Lee?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No.  It was a massive bomb I think."
"__SUPERHERO__ It did not do well.  I think they were way too focused on making it serious."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, these movies are supposed to be fun and escapist."
"__SUPERHERO__ Edward Norton should never be a Hulk."
"__SUPERHERO__ Agreed there.  Weird casting for sure."
"__SUPERHERO__ Are they planning any more Hulk movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think he's in the next Avengers if I remember correctly."
"__SUPERHERO__ It'd be cool if they killed him off."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's a pretty morbid thought!"
