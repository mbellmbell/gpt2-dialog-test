"__LADY_GAGA__ Are there any Lady Gaga songs you totally hate?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like some but I do not like 'Born This Way' or 'Poker Face.' I totally loathe 'Bad Romance.'"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Why's that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her manly voice n those songs bugs me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, I see. I actually agree."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like 'You and I' because her voice is better on that one."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It is. I agree. She is a good singer when she tries."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She is. I wonder why she doesn't always sing like that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm ot sure because it's better."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Maybe she thinks that makes her sound edgy."
