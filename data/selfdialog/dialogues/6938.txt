"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite Star Wars movie from the franchise?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why that one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the two new main characters Rey and Kylo."
"__STAR_WARS__ I enjoyed that one too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like those two characters?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did but I think at least right now with what we have to go on they're lacking a bit."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well the old characters Luke, Vader they had so much lore and story behind them after it was all said and done it's hard not to put them way ahead as of now."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah maybe with the future movies we will get more in touch with these new characters."
