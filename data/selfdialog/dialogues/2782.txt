"__MUSIC__ We've been having these weekly movie discussion lunches for many years."
"__MUSIC__ Well, technically we talk about other things--sports, family."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, yeah, but mainly movies and anyway, we've gone from mainly seeing movies in the theater to seeing them at home."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, but I still enjoy the in-theater experience."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and it's getting nicer all the time.  Have you been in a theater with the new seating?"
"__MUSIC__ I have--just like the recliner at home."
"__MUSIC__ And they haven't raised the prices yet where I've gone."
"__MUSIC__ I think they'll have to eventually, especially since it's cut down on the number of seats."
"__MUSIC__ And what about the reserved seat situation."
"__MUSIC__ That is weird to me--it's kind of intimidating trying to pick out your seats while the cashier is impatiently trying to move the line along."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but it does work out nicely when you can order online."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't gotten in to doing that, although my son does when we go to the movies with him on a visit."
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty efficient."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and a little odd when he gives the ticket taker his phone to scan."
"__MUSIC__ What I can't stand is the snack prices.  Do you sneak stuff in?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I don't always buy anything, and I used to really enjoy food at the movies."
"__MUSIC__ It's the chain theaters that gauge you; some of the independent theaters aren't so bad."
"__MUSIC__ I know--there are nice independent theaters that we go to when visiting Santa Cruz and Eugene that are reasonable."
"__MUSIC__ You've said that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is your favorite movie--let's talk about Redford next time."
"__MUSIC__ O.K, I know how you love hearing me talk about old movies, but then Redford is still going.  We can talk about his new movie."
