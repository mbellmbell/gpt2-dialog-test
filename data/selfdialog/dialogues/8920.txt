"__BEATLES__ Do you think that we could put on some music?"
"__BEATLES__ Sure, what do you want to listen to?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm actually in the mood to hear some of the Beatles, if that's okay."
"__BEATLES__ Eh, any song in particular?"
"__BEATLES__ Hey Jude is always a classic!"
"__BEATLES__ I know everyone loves that song, but I really can't stand it."
"__BEATLES__ Seriously? Well, which of their songs do you like, then?"
"__BEATLES__ I Want To Hold Your Hand is a nice one."
"__BEATLES__ I thought you were going to say Yellow Submarine."
"__BEATLES__ That one's fine, too."
