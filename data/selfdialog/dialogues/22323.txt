"__DISNEY__ So I've only just found out that there were Pongo and Perdy only had like 20 dalmations in '101 Dalmations'."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, so what?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, firstly why's it called '101 Dalmations' and secondly how is Cruella de Vil supposed to make a coat out of them."
"__DISNEY__ Firstly, they meet 80 more Dalmations when Cruella kidnaps them hence the coat."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that makes sense."
"__DISNEY__ Wait have you not seen it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, never got round to it."
"__DISNEY__ Really, you're missing out on one of the all-time classics."
"__DISNEY__ OK, well should we watch it this weekend."
"__DISNEY__ Sorry no can do, making a Dalmation-skinned coat."
