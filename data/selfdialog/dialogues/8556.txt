"__BEATLES__ I can't think of any group today that even comes close in talent to The Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ I have to agree.  From the time I bought their first U.S. album 'Meet the Beatles' till their end with 'Let it Be' I always looked forward to getting their records."
"__BEATLES__ Remember how great it was to get an album instead of downloading an MP3?"
"__BEATLES__ How can you even  compare the experience of  looking  at the cover of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band while playing the album to just putting it on your Iphone?"
"__BEATLES__ I associate so much of my growing up to the different phases of their music.  When Rubber Soul came out in 1965 it sounded so different from everything else."
"__BEATLES__ That is one of my favorite albums.  I heard Paul McCartney live doing 'I've Just Seen a Face' from Rubber Soul and he still sounds great!"
"__BEATLES__ Funny to think of how people made a big deal of what they thought were drug lyrics in Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
"__BEATLES__ Seems so innocent compared to what you hear now.  And people used to play the songs backward on the White Album or Magical Mystery Tour."
"__BEATLES__ Some of the more mainstream artists like Frank Sinatra even covered them.  I know he thought George Harrison's 'Something' was one of the best songs ever written."
"__BEATLES__ We were lucky to grow up with The Beatles.  I will never throw out my albums.  I just wish I had their 'Yesterday and Today' album with the original butcher cover.  I hear it's worth alot of money!"
