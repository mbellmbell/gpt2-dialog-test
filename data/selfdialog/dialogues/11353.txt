"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the Raiders situation this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In terms of the game, or their off the field issues?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was looking at more of the off-the-field issues, but interesting to know what they will do on the field as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe they are still in Oakland again this year and are moving to Las Vegas the year after."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that a sure thing? The Las Vegas move?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, last time I checked. Who knows, though, things could have changed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kind of sad to see them leave Oakland again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that would be the second time they left. I bet the fans will be furious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their fans are furious and passionate to begin with. Wonder how they would handle this?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably with riots on the streets and inside the stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't surprise me. How do you think they'll do on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are still either the second or third best team in the AFC with Derek Carr back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that. They definitely have a good balance on offense and defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a shame that Carr got hurt last year. They had a chance to beat New England, I believe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would have been a good matchup. They probably would have given New England a better game than the Steelers did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anybody could have. Steelers went into New England and things went south quickly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wonder what would happen if they won the Super Bowl this year and then moved out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Difficult to tell. Wonder if the fans would be more behaved and send them off on a good farewell or even be more infuriated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would guess infuriated. Those Raiders fans are crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are definitely the craziest in the NFL."
