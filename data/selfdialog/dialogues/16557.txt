"__MOVIES__ I'm currently watching Waterworld laying on the couch."
"__MOVIES__ Was it on television or did you find it on Netflix?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually neither. I own this movie on DVD."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I haven't really watched a DVD in so long!"
"__MOVIES__ I know. This movie is great though so I try to see it a few times a year."
"__MOVIES__ What is the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is about a guy who can breathe underwater. The entire Earth is flooded with water."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty cool. Can everyone breathe underwater?"
"__MOVIES__ No. There is only a select few people who can."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a super power or something?"
"__MOVIES__ No. I guess he evolved that way."
"__MOVIES__ That is kind of like a super power I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Sort of, but he doesn't use it that often."
"__MOVIES__ I would use it all the time. That is really awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ The people in this new Earth don't like people with gills I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Why would you not like somebody who could breathe underwater if the whole world is water?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually don't know and that is a great point."
"__MOVIES__ You would think that they would ask him to do certain things to help them out."
"__MOVIES__ Now that you mention it, I'm not sure why they wouldn't do that."
"__MOVIES__ I really want to see the movie though. Maybe we can watch it next time together."
