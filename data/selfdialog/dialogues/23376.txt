"__DISNEY__ You like Sleeping Beauty?"
"__DISNEY__ As in, the princess or the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Both, I guess."
"__DISNEY__ The Princess is okay, the movie is....also okay."
"__DISNEY__ I barely remember the movie, to be honest with you."
"__DISNEY__ That's because not much happens, she's asleep and then she wakes up."
"__DISNEY__ It's one of the less climatic movies of Disney."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed, so much more could've happened."
"__DISNEY__ Well, at least her pink dress looks nice in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Sure, she had good fashion, I guess."
