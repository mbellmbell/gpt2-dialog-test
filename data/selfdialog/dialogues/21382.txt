"__THRILLER__ Have you seen that thriller movie, 'Split'?"
"__THRILLER__ Is that the one about a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps some girls?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah. James McAvoy did a really good job playing that character. I was creeped out every time he came on screen."
"__THRILLER__ It's an M. Night Shyamalan film, isn't it?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that's the director."
"__THRILLER__ He's pretty famous for his thrillers."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, he even directed 'The Sixth Sense.' That's got to be a classic by now."
"__THRILLER__ Would you say 'Split' measures up to his other films?"
"__THRILLER__ I'd say it's one of his best. It's actually a sequel to the thriller movie, 'Unbreakable.'"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, yeah. That's the one about people with superhuman powers."
