"__MOVIES__ Are you watching Goodfellas? That's one of my all time favorites!"
"__MOVIES__ Mine too! I can quote this movie almost by heart."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite part of this film?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, too many to mention. For one thing, I love the scene with Tommy and Billy Batts."
"__MOVIES__ I like when Billy Bats says 'Go home and get your shinebox!'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That's such a hilarious scene, even though it's quite brutal too."
"__MOVIES__ I like when they're all sitting around the table in the restaurant, and Joe Pesci is telling stories."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and they're all laughing hysterically!"
"__MOVIES__ It makes you laugh hysterically too, even though sometimes you don't even know the context of the story."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, it's Joe Pesci's New York/Italian accent, the way he tells the stories, and the way everyone cracks up when he tells them."
"__MOVIES__ I also love all the food in the movie. It makes me salivate!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I get so hungry, especially when Ray Liotta is cooking that big feast at the end."
"__MOVIES__ The part when Ray Liotta says 'I had some beautiful cutlets I was gonna cook up before dinner just as a appetizer' always makes me want chicken cutlets."
"__MOVIES__ I also like when they go to Joe Pesci's mother's house and she shows them her painting."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that part is so funny for unexplainable reasons. Joe Pesci says, 'I like this. One dog goes one way, the other dog goes the other way.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's funny but I don't really know why. Maybe it's his voice again."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know the woman that plays the mother is actually really Martin Scorsese's mother?"
"__MOVIES__ No kidding? Wasn't she in Casino too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think she was."
"__MOVIES__ What a nice bit of trivia. I never knew that."
