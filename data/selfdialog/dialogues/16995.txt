"__MOVIES__ I honestly have never seen Pulp Fiction."
"__MOVIES__ Really? No way."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Not even once."
"__MOVIES__ So you don't understand any of the references I've ever made?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I've always called a Quarter Pounder a 'Royale with Cheese' for example."
"__MOVIES__ I thought you were French Canadian."
"__MOVIES__ I'm from Minnesota, Burt."
"__MOVIES__ You're the one that never lets me know it's a reference."
"__MOVIES__ Well you don't wanna be obnoxious with it."
"__MOVIES__ How could you be obnoxious making a fan reference?"
"__MOVIES__ You could punctuate every single reference with 'get that reference?'"
"__MOVIES__ I have some friends that do that sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly and what does it result in, usually?"
"__MOVIES__ An awkward moment--even if anyone does."
"__MOVIES__ Even if someone does understand the reference, they have to either acknowledge it and play along. Or they have to respond like 'Yeah. I get it.'"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds painful."
"__MOVIES__ It's even worse when you involve alcohol into the mix."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't recommend you going to a film festival."
"__MOVIES__ I loathe them."
