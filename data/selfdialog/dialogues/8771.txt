"__BEATLES__ Okay, so, I saw a friend of mine once at the local park.  Him and his band were performing various songs including some tunes by the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's cool, what ones did they do?"
"__BEATLES__ You know,  I can't recall off-hand, but it was kind of weird.."
"__BEATLES__ What do you mean?"
"__BEATLES__ They're were playing this one song where the guy is mentioning suicide and stuff and I'm like, 'Whoa... is this the same band that song 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' and 'Let It Be' and all those?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, they've gone their share of sad songs before.  Like 'Yesterday' and 'Long and Winding Road'."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, plus I asked my friend about that after the show and he explained that the particular was from the White album.  And I'm like, 'Oh, that makes sense.'"
"__BEATLES__ How so?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, I've been told that's kind of an odd album in Beatles discography. Among other things, it's the one Charles Manson was claiming he was hearing 'secret messages' from."
"__BEATLES__ Meh... I'm not sure Manson is someone we should turn to for any sort of reliable info."
