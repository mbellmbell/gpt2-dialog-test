"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you see Lady GaGa at the Superbowl?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yup, and I'm so glad she did Poke Face as an opener."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me, too. It's one of my favorite songs by her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What did you think of that Bad Romance performance?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I thought it was great, but Telephone was the stand-out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I was so impressed with how she sang and danced at the same time."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's crazy. I couldn't even hear any backing track."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It was there, but it was very faint."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You know she's not even the best dancer, but she killed it that night."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. She totally blew me away."
