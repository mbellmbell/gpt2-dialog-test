"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts on the San Francisco 49ers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have been awful since they lost that Super Bowl a few years back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That they have, but do you think their new coach is going to do better or worse than the last one?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think you can do much worse than Chip Kelly did last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of Chip Kelly, you remember how he made the Eagles good for two seasons then destroyed the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was brutal if you are an Eagles fan to see all those players go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Back to the 49ers, you think Brian Hoyer has a shot at winning some games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it, he always gets hurt no matter how productive he is for a few games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would take his place if he gets hurt?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would think CJ Bethard the rookie from Iowa would take over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bethard was decent in college if I remember correctly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah not too bad in the Big Ten, he did lead the Hawkeyes to an undefeated season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it will be interesting to see how their QB situation plays out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a definite weak point for that team, plus no one knows how Carlos Hyde the RB will be this year after injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot he got hurt at the end of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I had him in fantasy, only plus is that his injury didn't require surgery"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't they pick up a RB in free agency also?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got Tim Hightower who played good for the Saints last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may have a decent role in the offense then, especially if Hyde isn't fully recovered."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is probably true but both have similar power run styles."
