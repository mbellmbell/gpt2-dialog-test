"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man! Did you see where the Jacksonville Jaguars signed Tim Tebow to replace Bortles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?! What are you talking about?  They did not!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha! Naw, they didnt! I'm just messing with you.  But they should have.  Jacksonville I'd going to bad again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! Quite true. They will be the worst team in the NFLs worst division if you ask me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Jags, Colts, Texans, and the Titans. Who do you see winning that division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well starting at the bottom, as I said will be Jacksonville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And working your way up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Argh! It's tough. I'm torn between Houston and Indy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? You don't trust Andrew Luck?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I trust him! But he has absolutely nothing to work with!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.it's such a shame to see him wasting away there. Imagine him with Houston or Denver!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is one of the very best and is being wasted. I think Deshon Watson will start early and lead Houston to 9-7 and a potential playoff spot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting. You think he's already ready?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. Out of Watson , Trubisky, and Mahonnes, I think Watson will prove to be the most field ready"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but our boy Mahonnes in KC will be the first to win a Superbowl! !!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Word! But not this year. He will lead KC to glory in a about 3 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, who is going to win it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Calm down. I'm getting there. The team that will lose the Superbowl this year is the Tennessee Titans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow! You think they will make it that far?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. It's Marcus Marriotas 3rd year, and the have made all the right off season moves. They will make it only to lose to...the Green Bay Packers"
