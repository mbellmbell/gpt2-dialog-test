"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a tough one. I guess I'd say Titanic."
"__MOVIES__ Because you have a crush on Leo?"
"__MOVIES__ Not just because of that! I thought it was really well done."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it did win the Oscar."
"__MOVIES__ I just think it kind of had a little of everything."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there was romance and action and it was even based on something that happened in history."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I heard they did a lot to make it accurate."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the characters even existed in real life."
"__MOVIES__ Not Rose and Jack."
"__MOVIES__ No, of course not."
"__MOVIES__ The scene of that mom putting her kids to bed knowing what was coming always gets me."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right? I can't imagine what that'd be like."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you're reminding me why the movie is about more than just Leo."
"__MOVIES__ Ha! Seriously though, the sets alone make it worth a watch."
"__MOVIES__ But maybe not worth the length of the watch."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you might have me there. It is a really long film."
"__MOVIES__ Then again I'm not sure what I would cut out."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely no scenes with Leo!"
