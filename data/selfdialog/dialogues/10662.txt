"__FASHION__ Who wore it better on the red carpet, Jessica Findlay or Andie MacDowell?"
"__FASHION__ I personally liked Andie MacDowell's dress better."
"__FASHION__ I like Jessica's dress better, its more fitted and gives a lot more shape than Andie's dress."
"__FASHION__ But the black belt on Andie's really ties the whole dress together."
"__FASHION__ I think the black belt reminds me too much of a kid's dress."
"__FASHION__ Really? I think its a really good accent and allows the bottom of the dress to flare nicely."
"__FASHION__ I just like the black straps on Jessica's dress more. I think its a much more subtle statement."
"__FASHION__ Yea it's nice, but I guess I just like more of a statement. I think belts look more professional"
"__FASHION__ Exactly! This is red carpet not a business ball!"
"__FASHION__ Yea I guess Jessica's dress does look more red carpet and Andie's looks more like a ball gown"
"__FASHION__ I just think Andie's has to much fabric . The bottom looks heavy and plain."
"__FASHION__ Yea Jessica's dress is more slimming."
"__FASHION__ It's a more modern style too!"
"__FASHION__ Well she is much younger"
"__FASHION__ That's true, I think both dresses look beautiful given each individual's style, but I personally like Jessica's better"
"__FASHION__ Yea I guess if I was to wear one I would probably wear Jessica's, I think they're both nice though."
"__FASHION__ They're probably both equally as expensive too"
"__FASHION__ oh definitely! I couldn't wear them even if I wanted to"
"__FASHION__ That scarlet color is really gorgeous and would look great on you though!"
"__FASHION__ Yea I really love the color, it's extremely eye-catching"
