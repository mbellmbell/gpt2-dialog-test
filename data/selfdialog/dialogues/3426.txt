"__MUSIC__ You know what I miss? Eighties music."
"__MUSIC__ For real. The eighties were so unique and so timeless."
"__MUSIC__ That was back when music was not commercialized and anybody could make it big."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. How many obscure bands or singers came out of nowhere to make it big."
"__MUSIC__ Plenty. Today you see the popular singers come up as youngsters and it's almost as if the industry forces them to become stars."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it does seem that way."
"__MUSIC__ Just think of some of the obscure bands from the Eighties: Dexies Midnight Runners, Social Timex, A-Ha."
"__MUSIC__ All one hit wonders there, but timeless music."
"__MUSIC__ Who could ever forget the A-Ha song, take on me."
"__MUSIC__ I still remember the video."
"__MUSIC__ It's a song that's transcended generations. I still listen to it today."
"__MUSIC__ I think most of the youngsters these days recognize that song today."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if that song would be a HIT today if it was released today."
"__MUSIC__ It would be if someone remade it. But, I think you're asking if the song never existed and came out today."
"__MUSIC__ Correct. That's what I meant."
"__MUSIC__ Hard to tell. I would say yes."
"__MUSIC__ Come on Eileen probably wouldn't be a HIT if it came out today."
"__MUSIC__ That song is redundant and would get lost today in the endless availability of music. I would agree. It probably wouldn't be a HIT today."
"__MUSIC__ It screams eighties. They struck it lucky releasing it in 1982."
"__MUSIC__ Sure did. I think lots of bands did back then."
