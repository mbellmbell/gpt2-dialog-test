"__MUSIC__ I realize that I don't really 'get' punk music."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of punk music are you talking about? First wave 70s punk, or more modern stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Any of it, I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think the main thing is that it's nihilism in musical form."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess I don't really understand, then."
"__MUSIC__ Punk music was a response to the bombastic, somewhat corny music of the late 60s and early 70s."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I'm with you so far."
"__MUSIC__ People saw music getting more sappy and overwrought, and wanted to get back to the spirit of Rock n' Roll."
"__MUSIC__ Meaning what?"
"__MUSIC__ Stripped down production and musicality, simple lyrics, embrace of chaos and anti-establishment feelings."
"__MUSIC__ I see. So groups like The Ramones and Television were the early punks?"
"__MUSIC__ And then it became huge in England, with groups like The Clash and Sex Pistols."
"__MUSIC__ I guess what's turned me off about Punk music is that sometimes it sounds like they can't play their instruments too well."
"__MUSIC__ It's true that Punk doesn't care that much about musicality. It's more about energy and enthusiasm."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'm someone who appreciates the former more than the latter."
"__MUSIC__ Then it's definitely possible that Punk music isn't for you."
"__MUSIC__ I expect that it's not. But at least I understand it a little better now."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad I was able to help out."
"__MUSIC__ Now, can you explain the philosophy of Jazz music?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, you're on your own for that one!"
