"__DISNEY__ I finally saw Bambi the other day with the family."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, how did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved it. I can't believe I didn't see it until now."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I'm surprised you have only just now seen it. It's a classic."
"__DISNEY__ I'm behind on all the Disney movies, to be quite honest."
"__DISNEY__ You should rent a bunch of them and binge watch."
"__DISNEY__ Now that's an idea."
"__DISNEY__ Your kids will love them."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure they will."
"__DISNEY__ When you're finished, tell me what you thought of Frozen. That's my favorite one so far."
