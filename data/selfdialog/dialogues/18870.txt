"__MOVIES__ So what do you think about video game movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I've never really seen any, so I'm not sure I can really give an opinion on them."
"__MOVIES__ That's good. Trust me when I say that you're not missing out on much."
"__MOVIES__ Are they that bad?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're pretty awful."
"__MOVIES__ What are some examples?"
"__MOVIES__ Off the top of my head, there's the Super Mario Bros. movie."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that already sounds silly."
"__MOVIES__ It is. Mario and Luigi are two Italian immigrants living in a dystopian city, and the goombas are essentially dinosaur people."
"__MOVIES__ What? Now that sounds just plain bad."
"__MOVIES__ There's also the Mortal Kombat movie series."
"__MOVIES__ Series? There was more than one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and one was bad enough. Laughable costumes, cheesy acting, and absolutely awful special effects."
"__MOVIES__ You're really not giving me much to look forward to."
"__MOVIES__ Like I said, you're not missing out on much."
"__MOVIES__ You'd think that they would just go off of the stories in video games."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but they don't. They always try to change it up."
"__MOVIES__ Seems typical for Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ To always try to change something to fit the ideas of directors and producers instead of the source material?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, this exactly."
