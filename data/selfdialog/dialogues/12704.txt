"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been following the NFL thjis off season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yes, some ... Marshaun Lynch to the Raiders, the Raiders moving to Los Vegas, and the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be interesting to see if the Raiders QB will come back after his injury. Also, they lost their RD to Minnesota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Raiders may still be up there, but Brady and the Patriots are the team to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I know. I'm a Bills fan, and NE picked up the Bills best cornerback in free agency. That's after the Chris Hogan disaster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So NE improved on a Superbowl team. That's impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the Bills have a new coach, but have some rebuilding to do. They won't end up in last place with the Jets in their division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, the Pats are the team to beat, but who can do it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ KC looks strong, with Andy Reid, if they stay healthy. The Raiders, if Lynch still has something left. Pittsburgh is always in the hunt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some team will shine, like Denver did with that defense a couple of years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I 'm an AFC fan, and don't follow the NFC much. Who's rising there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carolina, maybe the NY Giants, seem to be up on top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team got the best from free agency or the draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NE got Buffalo's Safety. A lot of changes, but nothing that seems to be a turnaround."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Vikings got the Raiders best RB. Watch out for the Jaguars, Tom Coughlin is back down there, to work on things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be interesting to see which of the new coaching staffs do well. Example Buffalo's or Jacksonville's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will be watching Coughlin. He put together teams several times, he'll do it again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't leave out Pittsburgh. In November there always looking at playoff positioning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's wait and see for now. I'll have to read more on the pre-season predictions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the sports editors write a lot, but sometimes they miss things like Denver's defense 2 years ago.  See ya."
