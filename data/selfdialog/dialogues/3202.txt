"__MUSIC__ You going to the Linkin Park concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Hell yeah I'm going to the Linkin Park concert. Wait, when and where is it?"
"__MUSIC__ August 26th at the Chesapeake Arena if I remember correctly."
"__MUSIC__ Chesapeake Arena... didn't that used to be the Ford Center."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like forever ago. It was still that when I saw my first concert there."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! Who'd you see?"
"__MUSIC__ Metallica with Godsmack as the opening band."
"__MUSIC__ Sweet! That had to be a killer concert!"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. What's your favorite concert so far?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a toughie. I really have fond memories of the first time I saw Buckcherry during freshman year but... probably Three Days Grace. You?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember how The Brew used to be The Buzz? My favorite concert and memory was one of the last Buzzfests."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember the exact year but AFI, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Papa Roach, and Soasin were there. Oh my god it was incredible!"
"__MUSIC__ I bet. You always were a huge AFI and Papa Roach fan back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Totally! To this day Decemberunderground is one of my favorite AFI albums. Haven't kept up much after that though..."
"__MUSIC__ Thought they were dead to be honest. Not literally but the band split or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, they actually had three new albums since then - one of which JUST came out not too long ago."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was completely surprised. Haven't given the other two albums a chance thus far but think I may actually check out their newest one that came out this year, AFI, next time I'm at the record store."
"__MUSIC__ If you do let me know. I totally want to borrow the hell out of it for old time's sake."
