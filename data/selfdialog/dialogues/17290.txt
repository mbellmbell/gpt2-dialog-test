"__MOVIES__ You have to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Is it the sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is and it is excellent."
"__MOVIES__ Is it as good as the first?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe not on the same level but it's close."
"__MOVIES__ So what's new in number 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Kurt Russell joins the cast."
"__MOVIES__ I'm a big fan of his, I love Escape from New York"
"__MOVIES__ He's great in it, maybe not what you'd expect."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, do tell."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I won't say anything more as to not give you spoilers."
"__MOVIES__ Gotcha, that's cool. So is everyone on the Guardians team back?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes they are."
"__MOVIES__ Any new members?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's a couple but I don't know if they're official members."
"__MOVIES__ Like who?"
"__MOVIES__ Nebula seems to have a lose connection to the team and then there's Mantis."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of her."
"__MOVIES__ She's an empath and pretty funny too."
"__MOVIES__ Very cool, I can't wait to see it."
