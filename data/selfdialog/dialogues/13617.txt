"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotta go with the Falcons!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, they nearly won the Superbowl last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but a lot of the teams who make the Superbowl but lose end up having a bad year the next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that true?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anecdotally, it feels true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm, I'd be interested in seeing the data on that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm looking here, and a surprisingly large number of Superbowl losers don't even make the playoffs the next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yikes, guess maybe my Falcons pick is risky!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They seem like they'll be good next year, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely believe that. Their offense is so versatile."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan makes all the right decisions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. And Julio Jones is a beast of a wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The catch he made in the Superbowl was superhuman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe a human is capable of doing some of the stuff he does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely one of the players worth watching a game for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do kind of worry about the defense, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a nice year last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but it's easy with that offense running the way it did."
