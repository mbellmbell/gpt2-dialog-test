"__FASHION__ Have you seen the list of The Best and Worst Dressed at the People's Choice Awards 2017?"
"__FASHION__ I haven't seen the list, but I did see the show. Who were the best dressed?"
"__FASHION__ Jennifer Lopez, Yara Shahidi and Priyanka Chopra were among them. They all looked modern, and very gorgeous."
"__FASHION__ Oh, yeah! Jennifer Lopez was wearing a gown with an embellished illusion bodice. She looked breathtaking."
"__FASHION__ Priyanka Chopra looked comfortable yet stylish wearing that peach, fringed dress."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, it looked really good on her. I bet it would look bad if I wore that."
"__FASHION__ The Disney star was on the list, too... I can't recall her name. She wore a blush cocktail dress with floral things attached to it..."
"__FASHION__ Oh, the short dress with the black floral sequin-like things? I think you mean Peyton List."
"__FASHION__ Did you see what Ruby Rose was wearing?"
"__FASHION__ The matching orange suit and pants?"
"__FASHION__ Haha, yes! That's what. With of course, a low-cut, an matching heels."
"__FASHION__ She looked like  a prisoner. I think that was the goal."
"__FASHION__ One of the worst dressed were Gwen Stefani."
"__FASHION__ Oh, yeah. Yikes! What was that? It looked like a curtain threw up on her..."
"__FASHION__ It's apparently a clown-inspired ruffled blue dress with a cut-out panel on the tummy."
"__FASHION__ And that's not all, she even wore fishnet tights. Talk about topping the list of the worst."
"__FASHION__ Jodie Sweetin's on the list, too, but I beg to differ. I think she looked amazing!"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I agree. I guess it's just quite unorthodox to wear a floral ball gown with a leather jacket."
"__FASHION__ And, of course, Chris Sullivan definitely made heads turn and eyes bulge out of their sockets with his look."
"__FASHION__ My eyes hurt to look at his pants... paint-splattered pants... I hope he chooses better next year! If he's still invited, that is."
