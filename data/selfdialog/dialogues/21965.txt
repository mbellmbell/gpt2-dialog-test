"__DISNEY__ I think Frozen might have the most iconic songs Disney's ever created."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, definitely not. Think of all the songs in the classics!"
"__DISNEY__ I was never much a fan of some of the older ones, though--Snow White is such a bore."
"__DISNEY__ I'll give you that, but that was their very first film. What about Aladdin?"
"__DISNEY__ What songs does it have?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, most obviously there's A Whole New World!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that one is iconic! And that song the genie sings, too!"
"__DISNEY__ But of course, the most important one in my opinion is The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ She's got Part of Your World, right?"
"__DISNEY__ And Under the Sea, and Poor Unfortunate Souls, and Kiss the Girl--you get the idea. It's easily the best."
