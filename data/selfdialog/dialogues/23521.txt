"__DISNEY__ Dis you know that Mel Gibson was in Pocahontas?"
"__DISNEY__ WHat who was he?"
"__DISNEY__ John Smith."
"__DISNEY__ Oh no wonder I thought John Smith was dreamy growing up."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, I had a big crush on him. I loved that movie anyway but now I have to re-watch it."
"__DISNEY__ Yea we should do that some night. It's been too long since I've heard any of the songs."
"__DISNEY__ Oh we should have a singalong with Colors of The Wind."
"__DISNEY__ I love that song! It's such an underrated Disney song."
"__DISNEY__ I know, I didn't think that was possible. Just around the river bend is pretty amazing too."
"__DISNEY__ Oh man now you make me wish I was in a canoe with Meeko."
