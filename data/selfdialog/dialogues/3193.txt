"__MUSIC__ So what are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Nothing right now, I'm trying to make up a conversation."
"__MUSIC__ ... okay then... anyway, what have you been listening to."
"__MUSIC__ Mostly children's music."
"__MUSIC__ That's right you have a son, don't you."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've been playing a lot of cds for him."
"__MUSIC__ What's his favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ The Do Re Wee name song."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of that one."
"__MUSIC__ It's a song that names all the friends in the room and has motions to the verses."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Surprisingly, I'm not as fed up with it as I could be after hearing it for the millionth time and sing it for the houndred thousandth."
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha ha..."
"__MUSIC__ It's actually pretty good for a children's song."
"__MUSIC__ What do you listen to when he's not around."
"__MUSIC__ When is he not around?"
"__MUSIC__ ... well... when he's napping and stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I usually have it quiet so as not to disturb him."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can hear myself think, but I wonder about the thoughts sometimes, because it's like I'm talking to myself."
