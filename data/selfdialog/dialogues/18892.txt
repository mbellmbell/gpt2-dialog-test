"__MOVIES__ What did you think about Wonder Woman? Did you enjoy it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was okay. Certainly better than Batman v Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree, but it didn't live up to my expectations at all."
"__MOVIES__ It's a DC movie. Your expectations were too high."
"__MOVIES__ The storytelling was good and the acting was great, but I didn't care much for how they handled Ares."
"__MOVIES__ How come?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. He wasn't a very interesting villain or much of an actually threat."
"__MOVIES__ I think I see what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ In the movie Ares is just a glorified arms dealer rather than a credible threat to the world."
"__MOVIES__ How about the way she handled him though? She went all Super Saiyan."
"__MOVIES__ Since when can she melt projectiles and summon beams of electrical death at will? No, I'm sorry. That was poorly executed."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I thought it was cool."
"__MOVIES__ It would have been better if Zeus struck her with a lightning bolt giving her Godly powers for a short time."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds tight."
"__MOVIES__ Then she could have went fist-to-fist against Ares and beat him into submission."
"__MOVIES__ Now that sounds cool. Too bad they didn't go that route. It was still a good flick, though."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. I'm just being picky."
"__MOVIES__ I think you've been spoiled by all those Marvel movies."
"__MOVIES__ Then I probably shouldn't watch the next Avengers movie before Justice league."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't go that far."
