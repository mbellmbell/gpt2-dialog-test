"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best QB in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh thats a tough one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say its got to be Tom brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, there have to be so many more that are better"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like who? Brady has so many rings, so many awards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Montana, Elway, Kelly, Marino just to name a few."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marino? you're nuts he never even won a superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that the measure? Because statistically hes one of the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that has to be part of the conversation. If you can't win a championship how good are you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, lets exclude Marino, Then who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Elway won a couple superbowls, so did Montana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I'll agree with you that those are top level QBs and certainly among the elite but not better than Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were dominant as passers in a league that favored running. Put them in the league now and they are at the top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but so is brady. No other QB has done more with less."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Less? Brady has had elite talent all career. Moss, Welker are all unbelievable recievers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well then Montana had Rice. Who you cant dispute is the best Reciever of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair, But you could plug anyone into the New England system and they could have success"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh youre just out of your mind now its not even worth arguing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm telling you, Brady retires then the next guy is almost as good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose we will find out soon."
