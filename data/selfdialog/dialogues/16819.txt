"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the movie Crash?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that is a great movie!  I think it won some awards, didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it won three Oscars.  It came out in 2004."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's impressive!  It was really deep."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  It had some great lessons to it for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Which were your favorite characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a tough call.  I really disliked Sandra Bullock's character."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she was not very likable.  But there were some redeeming parts towards the end."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, true.  But overall I didn't like her."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and I definitely the cop."
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ The one played by Matt Dillon.  He and his dad were both horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it was also redeeming when he rescued the lady from the car didn't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's true.  There were definitely a lot of valuable lessons in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  That was one of the best parts of it."
"__MOVIES__ It depicted people as so human, don't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you really saw the good and the bad of people in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I think that's what made it so likable and great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably so.  I could watch it again and learn something new every time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too.  I actually own a copy of it."
