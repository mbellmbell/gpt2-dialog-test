"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think Supreme Leader Snoke is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure. I've heard all sorts of theories from Emperor Palpatine to Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure they would go that way. I think it is a new character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, but I bet they will tie the backstory into the Sith we know."
"__STAR_WARS__ You never know, they could do something completely out of left field and make him loosely or non-affiliated with the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Woah, I never thought of that. That could be cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ What if they made it like he thought he was 'improving the Sith'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's an interesting take on things. But I bet they stick to what people know."
"__STAR_WARS__ True."
"__STAR_WARS__ Should be exciting either way!"
