"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you follow the NFL at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, definitely. I love football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say the Patriots, but I have a few that I like."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I don't like the Patriots at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite team, then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a huge fan of the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cool. The Bears might actually do well next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too. I'm excited for the changes they've made."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will definitely be interesting to see. I still think Tom Brady has them beat, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I expected you'd say that. Do you think he really played a part in the deflated football scandal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really not sure how I feel about that situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he at least had knowledge that the balls were deflated during that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I just think it's blown out of proportion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. It seemed like a really big deal for a deflated football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. No one can say that Tom Brady's success is solely due to cheating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll agree with you there. He's got talent and that's easy to see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The last Super Bowl was a pure showcase of his ability to perform under pressure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the biggest comeback I have ever seen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I couldn't believe my eyes. They did exactly what they had to in order to win."
