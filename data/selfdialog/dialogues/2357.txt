"__MUSIC__ It makes me laugh when a band has a greatest hits come out after only releasing two albums."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I know. Savage Garden did that."
"__MUSIC__ I love that band. I didn't know that about them."
"__MUSIC__ I only do because I saw the album on Amazon."
"__MUSIC__ I might buy it."
"__MUSIC__ It was super cheap."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you suppose bands do that?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe to get more money."
"__MUSIC__ My aunt says it's so they can put out a few new tracks without having to come up with a whole new album."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ Like they can put one or two new songs on with all the hits."
"__MUSIC__ Right. I think Martina McBride did that."
"__MUSIC__ She did. There were a few new songs on that."
"__MUSIC__ I have that album."
"__MUSIC__ So do I but now she has a new one called Essential."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. It's a two disc set."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to get it."
"__MUSIC__ I have it already."
"__MUSIC__ Let's listen to it now."
