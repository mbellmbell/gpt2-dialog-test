"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There is something I don't fully understand about 'The Fate of the Furious.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What would that be?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why did Charlize Theron's character need Dominic Toretto for her plan?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I have no idea."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ If you think about it, Dom's only skill is driving.  What use did a super hacker have of a driver?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Dom is also a good fighter, and is the only one who could stop his crew."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ But if Charlize's character didn't recruit Dom in the first place, the crew never would have intervened."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, and then her plan would not have been ruined.  I think you're onto something."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm glad I could get that off my chest.  The rest of the movie, after accepting that premise, was really fun."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The action sequences were so well shot, and the set-pieces were executed flawlessly!"
