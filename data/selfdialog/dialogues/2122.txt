"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Devin Townsend?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't. Who's he?"
"__MUSIC__ He used to be in some really heavy metal band called Strapping Young Lad, but most of his work is his solo stuff and it's so varied."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not too into metal, but what's his other stuff like?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm not into his heavy stuff, but he's got a new age album, lighter rock, an album he calls 'haunted Johnny Cash songs', progressive; basically anything you could imagine."
"__MUSIC__ He does sound quite interesting. 'Haunted Johnny Cash songs?'"
"__MUSIC__ That's one of my favorites. It's quite mellow and ambient at times, which he's also known to do."
"__MUSIC__ Where's he from?"
"__MUSIC__ Canada. Western Canada, I believe."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever seen him live?"
"__MUSIC__ Not yet, but I'd like to. However, he mostly focuses on his more aggressive stuff at live shows, even though he has played a number of shows for his more mellow repertoire."
"__MUSIC__ Does he play any instruments or does he just sing?"
"__MUSIC__ He usually plays guitar along with his singing, but he's said he'd like to focus on bass sometime."
"__MUSIC__ How's his voice?"
"__MUSIC__ Really good. His clean singing sounds awesome, and he also does a bunch of screaming in his metal stuff, but the clean singing is what I like most."
"__MUSIC__ How old is he?"
"__MUSIC__ In his mid-40s, I believe. He started out young as a singer with Steve Vai, with most of his solo stuff coming to fruition in the late 90s."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds pretty cool. What's his new age album called?"
"__MUSIC__ You'll want to listen to Ghost. He's never sounded more new-agey than on Ghost."
"__MUSIC__ It reminds me of Kip Winger a little. Kip Winger was a metal guy and made a new-agey album."
