"__MOVIES__ Ever seen the movie Snowpiercer?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've never even heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it's a pretty cool movie!"
"__MOVIES__ What's the premise?"
"__MOVIES__ The idea is that the entire world has become inhabitable, and all of humanity that remains is stuck on a self-supporting train."
"__MOVIES__ What on earth?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a pretty weird premise. But very neat, too."
"__MOVIES__ So the idea is that the train can support life by itself?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much. Though life is not easy on the train."
"__MOVIES__ I can imagine not! So would you call it a science fiction movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess that might be accurate. It's definitely not realistic."
"__MOVIES__ Who is the main star of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Chris Evans is the star, but it also has Ed Harris and Tilda Swinton."
"__MOVIES__ Ohhh, I love Tilda Swinton."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's pretty great. Her performance in Snowpiercer is delightfully unhinged."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, that alone kind of makes me want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ It's worth a watch."
"__MOVIES__ Is it currently in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's been out for a few years now."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I'll see if it's on Netflix then."
