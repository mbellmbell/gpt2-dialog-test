"__MOVIES__ It's a classic Tarantino film. Everyone dies- you would really like it."
"__MOVIES__ Hah, spoilers much?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a Tarantino film. You already know that everyone does, and there is lots of blood."
"__MOVIES__ All right, point sort of taken. You could have at least let me pretend. Wait, even Jackson."
"__MOVIES__ Especially Jackson."
"__MOVIES__ Aw, that's not cool. Was it a fun movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but the music was not as memorable or enrapturing as the soundtrack they used for Django."
"__MOVIES__ What was wrong with the music?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you remember how Djano's music was not necessarily from the time period of even when spaghetti westerns were being made?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but they still felt thematically right."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but that was not the case in this movie. Sometimes, you might get sucked out of the flow of things because a song comes up which feels like it doesn't belong."
"__MOVIES__ Tarantino really has his tastes in music, and I don't think he cares whether you like it or not."
"__MOVIES__ Right? He hears some new song and it feels like he just wants to include it into a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Give me an example of a bad song you heard in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I can't remember the song- like I said, they were not as good as Django. However, I remember when it happened."
"__MOVIES__ Was it inappropriate music while people were trying to use an outhouse?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, it sort of was."
"__MOVIES__ No it wasn't- you're just about to make something up now."
"__MOVIES__ No, I am serious. There was a scene in which someone ran into an outhouse to hide, and the person who was chasing after him walked out into the snow to the tune of some music that sounded like it belonged to a Brady Bunch soundtrack."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, was Tarantino trying to be ironic or something?"
