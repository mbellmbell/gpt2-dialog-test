"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have always been a big Steelers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's awesome. I like the Steelers, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also really enjoy the Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants are fun to watch with Odell Beckham Jr."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he has to be one of the best wide receivers in the entire league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree there. I think he might be the strongest player on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's a shame the rest of their team doesn't play on his level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also accepts a pretty low amount of money to play for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw that. He doesn't get comparable pay to other receivers of his caliber."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is strange because, like you sad, he's probably one of the best in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really only think he's beaten out by Antonio Brown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Antonio brown is inhuman. The Steelers are going to be strong this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm really excited about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. It would be good to see them go far into the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would be buying some game tickets if that happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're telling me. Another good receiver I was thinking of is Julio Jones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot about him. He's really impressive, also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say he's right up there with Odell Beckham Jr."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. He might even prove to be better this year."
