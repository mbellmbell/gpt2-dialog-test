"__DISNEY__ I can't believe they finally made a sequel to Finding Nemo!"
"__DISNEY__ They did? What's it about?"
"__DISNEY__ It's called Finding Dory. So they're gonna focus on her."
"__DISNEY__ Was that the blue fish in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the one who keeps forgetting things."
"__DISNEY__ Do you remember who did her voice?"
"__DISNEY__ I think she was voiced by Ellen Degeneres."
"__DISNEY__ Ellen is so funny. Do you think it'll be good?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I'm really excited about it. I loved the first one."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, as do my kids!"
