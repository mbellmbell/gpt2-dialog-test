"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So something i've always wondering."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, when Field Goals are kicked, If you are in a stadium, even unenclosed, where does the wind come from that pushes the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've thought of something like that. i can see it in unenclosed stadiums but in an enclosed stadium it should not happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But i have seen games in enclosed stadums where it HAS happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, at least 2 or 3 times last seson alone i saw it on TV."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is definately strange."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure there is some kond of air flow in both kind of stadiums just so fans and players can breathe but to make a ball move?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, think how much force you would need to force air thru aa 60,000 seat stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I presumed it was done in sections."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i honestly do not know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ hm.... something we should look up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess the question is how do kickers and punters DO make it with breezes and air flow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, other than LOTS of practice they watch the flags on the goal post to look for breeze."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, you see them adjust a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also see a lot of balls curving real close to the end zone but straight and true up until that point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that always puzzles me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could be just the knetic energy fading out from the kick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a possibility."
