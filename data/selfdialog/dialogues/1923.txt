"__MUSIC__ How do you feel about the current state of rap music?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a really good question. I have always been a huge fan of rap music."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I figured you would be the perfect person to talk with about this subject."
"__MUSIC__ I certainly feel that there is some great talent out there right now."
"__MUSIC__ Who would you say are some great young rappers at the moment?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say Meek Mill is up there. He is still in his twenties and has already put out some great material."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't he have a beef with Drake at some point?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes he did and that certainly did not do him any favors in regards to his career."
"__MUSIC__ He released a pretty decent album a few years back, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes he had some success with an album called Dreams Worth More Than Money."
"__MUSIC__ What other rappers do you have some confidence in? In terms of the future of rap music."
"__MUSIC__ Vince Staples and Young Thug are a couple of talented musicians as well."
"__MUSIC__ It just seems like rap is not the same these days as it used to be."
"__MUSIC__ I can see what you are saying. However, you really have to temper your expectations in terms of the future in general."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that exactly?"
"__MUSIC__ Well you used to have so many great legends like Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G, and others leading the rap game."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, it would be unfair to expect rappers of today to turn into those guys."
"__MUSIC__ That is pretty much what I am saying; we just have to enjoy rap music as much as possible while also celebrating its past."
"__MUSIC__ I think that is a smart approach! I wished guys like Eminem would also make more music."
"__MUSIC__ Eminem is very talented, I still think he is the leader of the rap industry right now."
