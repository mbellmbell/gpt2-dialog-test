"__BEATLES__ What is your favoriate Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ Definately Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  So influential and unique.  How about you?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm a big fan of the White Album.  I think the band really got into their artistic side in that one."
"__BEATLES__ Well I can't argue with that.  The White Album is iconic.  What's your favorite overall Beatle song?"
"__BEATLES__ I'd have to say it is Hard Days Night.  It's so upbeat and kinda funny.  How about you?"
"__BEATLES__ A day in the life.  Again, Sgt. Pepper's is my favorite album and this song is near perfect to me."
"__BEATLES__ Not a bad choice.  Did you ever watch any Beatle movies? Like Yellow Submarine or Hard Days Night?"
"__BEATLES__ I actually can't stand Yellow Submarine.  You do know that the voice parts are not the actual band members right?"
"__BEATLES__ Well yeah, but you've got to love that crazy 70's animation though."
"__BEATLES__ Actually, the drawings kinda creep me out."
