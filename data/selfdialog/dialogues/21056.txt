"__THRILLER__ What is your favorite thriller about serial killers?"
"__THRILLER__ That's a really tough question, I would have to think about it."
"__THRILLER__ Well, anyway, mine is Silence of The Lambs."
"__THRILLER__ Wow, that is a great one. It's really intense too."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it is. Do you remember the scene where he beats the two guards and escapes?"
"__THRILLER__ Of course! That part was crazy."
"__THRILLER__ He literally took one of the guys faces off and wore it."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and the paramedics actually took him out thinking he was one of the guards."
"__THRILLER__ That was so ingenious and disgustingly perfect."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah the main character in that movie is truly insane."
