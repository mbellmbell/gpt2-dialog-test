"__DISNEY__ You know in some of the older Disney movies, they reused a lot of the film?"
"__DISNEY__ Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ They reused the dance sequence from Sleeping Beauty in the Belle movie."
"__DISNEY__ Beauty and The Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep, they just covered it, but used the same film."
"__DISNEY__ How did they do that?"
"__DISNEY__ Pre-Pixar, before they merged most of the Disney animation was done by hand."
"__DISNEY__ Even stuff like the Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep. There were computers involved by then, but most was by hand."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that makes the movies even cooler."
