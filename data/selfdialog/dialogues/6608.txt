"__STAR_WARS__ A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're both great, that's like asking me to pick my favorite child."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well if you absolutely had to choose one, which of those is better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay I would say Empire Strikes Back is the better of the two but they're both excellent."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you prefer Empire Strikes Back over A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, there's just so many memorable scenes. There are also a lot of beloved characters that make their debut in Episode Five."
"__STAR_WARS__ What new characters from Empire Strikes back did you like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well you have to go with the introduction of Yoda obviously. When Luke travels to Dagobah to find Yoda, that's an extremely entertaining part of the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was fun seeing Luke expecting to find what he thought a powerful Jedi would be only to discover that this small little creature was actually him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah Yoda was hilarious. Also, the actual puppet used for Yoda looked really good, much better than the CGI versions of Yoda in later movies."
