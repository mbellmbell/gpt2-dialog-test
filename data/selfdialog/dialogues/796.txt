"__MUSIC__ I feel like writing a letter to Metallica."
"__MUSIC__ Um, why would you do that?"
"__MUSIC__ Their music is really starting to bug me."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the thing is I actually think they're really good but I don't like any of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ That's a little confusing. Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ The vocals are excellent, and so is the band but the way they write songs is seriously annoying."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, what's annoying about it?"
"__MUSIC__ They have really cool songs like Nothing Else Matters which is classic and haunting and awesome, but then they write things with three tempo changes which are a year long!"
"__MUSIC__ Well now you're exaggerating a bit."
"__MUSIC__ Ok they're 9 minutes long but that's long enough to be two songs, and since they're changing between two tempos they basically are writing two songs!"
"__MUSIC__ And you have a problem with that?"
"__MUSIC__ Just write two songs, separate songs, that I can listen to one at a time without it taking so long!"
"__MUSIC__ I can see you're pretty worked up about this."
"__MUSIC__ It just really bugs me when a good band gets all artsy and ruins the enjoyment of listening to their music."
"__MUSIC__ But they're writing it. I'm sure they're writing it the way they want it to be."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe but it's long and gets boring and then I turn it off."
"__MUSIC__ Right, but they're being artistic which as artists is kind of what they're supposed to do isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess. I just don't like their art maybe."
"__MUSIC__ There are plenty of other good metal bands out there."
