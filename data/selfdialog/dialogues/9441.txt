"__BASEBALL__ The Senators play again tonight."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you know when the Rangers play again?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think they play on the road tomorrow."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not getting a good feeling about their chances on the road."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I think they weren't even that good before they made that trade."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they didn't even get much in return that they could use right now."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they're preparing for next year, to be honest."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I don't know why teams are willing to give up on a season like that."
"__BASEBALL__ It seems like they aren't concerned about the fans who invested this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they will even have the same coach next year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm pretty sure they won't blame this year on Girardi."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, how can all those injuries be his fault?"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly, plus they're young."
"__BASEBALL__ True, they should be fine at most positions next year."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they could use a good closer though."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they have a really good one in triple-A right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he would be ready to come up for next year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think he could be ready now, honestly."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they could use him now."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he could be too young and could get hurt like the other players."
