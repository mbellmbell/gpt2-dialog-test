"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, what did you think about the last Harry Potter movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was very good, I was sad for the whole movie set to be over though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know the feeling, it's so easy to get emotionally involved in all of the movies!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ At least I have the whole set now and can rewatch them when I want."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So jealous! I've been wanting to get my hands on the movies set, myself."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You can order it online like I did. You won't regret it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'll have to do that. So what was your favorite character throughout the whole film."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I honestly loved Dumbledore more than any of the characters, he was so wise and kind (most of the time)."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He was one of my favorite too, but I loved Harry Potter, personally."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I was just so sad when Dumbledore died..."
