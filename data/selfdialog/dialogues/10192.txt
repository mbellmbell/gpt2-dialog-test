"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you think is the most underrated album by a rapper?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It would have to be 808s & Heartbreak by Kanye West."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, right? People are always talking trash on that one, but it's probably my favorite one of his."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, my favorite Kanye album is still College Dropout, but Heartbreak is still excellent."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Remember when Through the Wire came out?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes! I had MTV on, and I was just cleaning house. That song came on, and I swear I'd never heard it before in my life. I just stopped what I was doing and watched the whole thing."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, it was really different from anything out at the time. Kanye kind of took over after that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He did. It's too bad he ends up saying so much outlandish stuff on TV now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I feel really bad for him. He can't enjoy the negativity that comes from all that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, but maybe it gives him more stuff to write about."
