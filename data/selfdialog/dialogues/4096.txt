"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Childish Gambino is retiring from making music?"
"__MUSIC__ Who's Childish Gambino?"
"__MUSIC__ A rapper. It's actually Donald Glover's stage name."
"__MUSIC__ I thought he was an actor, I didn't know he was a rapper as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's actually been a rapper almost as long as he's been an actor. His first album came out in 2008."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's cool. He's pretty funny on 'Community.' What's his music like?"
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like a lot of modern rap, but there's definitely a quirky and sort of nerdy personality in his lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he makes a lot of obscure references and plays on words. He also has a sort of ironic persona as a rapper."
"__MUSIC__ What's ironic about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes he likes to be a little outrageous and over-the-top in a way that makes it clear that he's not being serious."
"__MUSIC__ So he's kind of mocking other artists who are mainstream right now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but he also has a serious side. A lot of his lyrics are soul-searching, and he can be romantic as well."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty unusual for a rapper, isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, it's not uncommon for rappers to release some kind of 'ballad' single that appeals to a wider audience."
"__MUSIC__ How does that make him different then?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he never really loses the complexity and subtlety when he's going in that direction. Even the radio hits are still appealing on many different levels."
"__MUSIC__ That's impressive. It seems like so much music on the radio right now is catchy, but pretty dumb when you get down to it."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! Sometimes it seems like you can't have music that's both catchy and smart, but I think Childish Gambino manages to pull it off."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check him out then. Too bad he's retiring!"
