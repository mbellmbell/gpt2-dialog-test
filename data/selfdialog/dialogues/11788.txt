"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't see the television!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't want to see this!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened? What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cleveland scored again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No!  Not again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they didn't even use their first string quarterback!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding me? Who was it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They used that Heisman-winning QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Johnny Football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Johnny Football!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he was canned."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Apparently not. Rehab maybe?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess. Why is it that so many NFL football players get a little money and then go off the deep end?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not just football players.  THis happens with players from alot of different types of sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but football players always seem to get a bad rap.  Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A violent game breeds violent people maybe? Or maybe it's Jealousy..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jealousy is probably a part of it, and self-control is no something you are born with, but I think it is because players bring attention to themselves when they are a 400-lb offensive lineman or the starting quarterback of a professonal football team, with a gazzillion dollar contract. Hard to hide your indescretions when you are famous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose so.  But you never hear about all the good things these players do off the field!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like all the charities they start or support. I wish society valued that as much as who can throw a ball the farthest!"
