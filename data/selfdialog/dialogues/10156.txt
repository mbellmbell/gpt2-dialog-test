"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So, anyone rap artist I kind of like is Wyclef Jean."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, what songs do you like?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, I really like 'Perfect Gentleman' because of the way it blends the symphony with his rap lyrics is a really neat combination."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not sure I've heard that song."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, it's the one that goes, 'Just cause she dances, mo fo, don't make her a ho, no.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Dunno.. maybe I'd recognize it if I heard it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Maybe.  Another interesting song he did was a duet with Kenny Rodgers.  They did a remake of the 'The Gambler.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Say what??  The Kenny Rogers?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, the country star!  They have him doing the original lyrics and Wyclef raping along with it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, that just seems rather bizarre."
