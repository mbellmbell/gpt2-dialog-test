"__MUSIC__ Hey Joe, what are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, hey Mark, I'm listening to Def Leppard."
"__MUSIC__ Def Leppard?  I've never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ What?  You've never heard of Def Leppard?  They've only been around for like 40 years!"
"__MUSIC__ Really?  Maybe I have heard them and just didn't know it."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard 'Pour Some Sugar on Me?'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I have.  Is that a Def Leppard song?"
"__MUSIC__ It sure is, Mark!  Here, listen to this song, 'God's of War.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, this has a nice beat.  The drummer is really good."
"__MUSIC__ He only has one arm."
"__MUSIC__ No way!  One arm?  How does he do it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, when he lost his arm he started off using electronic drums and started to use his feet more, but now he uses a regular set."
"__MUSIC__ Does he still use his feet a lot?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, more than other drummers anyway."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, I am really enjoying this song.  Do they have a lot of albums?"
"__MUSIC__ They have quite a few.  I would recommend Hysteria and Pyromania."
"__MUSIC__ Nice, I will have to check those out."
"__MUSIC__ Good, you should.  I actually like all of their albums, including their latest one."
"__MUSIC__ What's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Def Leppard, and it was released last year I think."
