"__HORROR__ I wasn't too thrilled with the movie we watched last night."
"__HORROR__ Which one was it?"
"__HORROR__ The horror film, Ghost Ship."
"__HORROR__ Not sure if I saw that one."
"__HORROR__ It was okay, but I wouldn't tell anyone to watch it."
"__HORROR__ That bad."
"__HORROR__ Well it had it's moments. Like when a cord came down across deck and cut people in half."
"__HORROR__ Sounds a little gory."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, a little, but other than that, nothing to brag about."
"__HORROR__ Guess that's why I don't know that movie."
