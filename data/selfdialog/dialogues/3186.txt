"__MUSIC__ are we still meeting at the snap bar today?"
"__MUSIC__ not really,we might have to change venue and meet at rasper instead"
"__MUSIC__ oh, why the change?"
"__MUSIC__ i reckon today is raggae night at snap bar and you know i don't really dig raggae music not when it even then had to be what i would listen to all  night."
"__MUSIC__ i don't as well though, raspar does plays pop music and a mix up from genre."
"__MUSIC__ yeah,reason why i thought we should rather do rasper."
"__MUSIC__ that's ok."
"__MUSIC__ oh talking about raggae, dancehall king sean paul new video just came up now on mtv,sounding really groovy."
"__MUSIC__ are you talking about 'whyne for me'."
"__MUSIC__ yes that's the tittle"
"__MUSIC__ oh the song isdoing really great i must say,its like the lastest dancehall anthem."
"__MUSIC__ i'm sure the dj at rasper might bump it today."
"__MUSIC__ i suppose so, its trendy and beside its very groovy ."
"__MUSIC__ that's true."
"__MUSIC__ please don't forget to come with the 'little mix' album you'd wanted me to listen to"
"__MUSIC__ sure right i won't."
"__MUSIC__ oh great mate."
"__MUSIC__ let me go freshen up and start getting ready"
"__MUSIC__ alright mate no worries"
"__MUSIC__ see you soon,"
