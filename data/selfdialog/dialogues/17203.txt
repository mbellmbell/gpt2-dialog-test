"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ That would be To Kill a Mockingbird, 1962, with Gregory Peck, based on the book by Harper Lee."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen that one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you must see it sometime. I think everyone should see it at least once."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think it's such an important film?"
"__MOVIES__ It addresses the complicated issues of prejudice and poverty and morality in a really meaningful and absorbing way."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is set in the 30s, during the Depression, and it centers around a small town lawyer defending a black man against a charge of rape."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a really charged subject."
"__MOVIES__ The movie, and Lee's book, tackles it by looking at the story's situations through the eyes of the lawyer's two small children."
"__MOVIES__ Children are so innocent, but that gives them a kind of wisdom because they haven't yet picked up flawed perspectives about prejudice."
"__MOVIES__ The lawyer, Atticus Finch, is a widower and he is this wonderful nurturing presence, teaching the kids by example how to live a good and conscientious life."
"__MOVIES__ So the kids watch the trial that their father is in, defending this black man of rape?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they sit up in the cheap seats with all the blacks in town, who of course aren't allowed to sit with the white folks down on the main floor of the courtroom."
"__MOVIES__ Do the kids understand what's going on?"
"__MOVIES__ They understand their father's job, but they are getting a big ugly look at racism and prejudice as they watch this unfold, and it makes no sense to them, the people who think blacks are a lower form of life."
"__MOVIES__ Are they proud of their dad?"
"__MOVIES__ Mostly, the story shows how they think he's just a dad - he doesn't let them do stuff, or they're surprised to find out he's a crack shot, because he's just their boring father."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like an interesting film."
"__MOVIES__ Gregory Peck is outstanding. He richly deserved the Oscar he won for this movie."
