"__BASEBALL__ Could you tell me who played the Cubs in the 2016 World Series?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. It was the Cleveland Indians."
"__BASEBALL__ Didn't the Indians play in the World Series in recent years?"
"__BASEBALL__ They last played in 1997 against the Florida Marlins and lost."
"__BASEBALL__ Seems like a long time since both the Cubs and Indians won a World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ Indeed. The Cubs last win prior to last year was in 1908, and Cleveland last won in 1948."
"__BASEBALL__ I recall the 2016 World Series went all the way to seven games."
"__BASEBALL__ That seventh game took extra innings to decide."
"__BASEBALL__ It took practically all night because of the extra innings, and there was a rain delay in addition."
"__BASEBALL__ When will the World Series start this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ It is scheduled to begin October 24."
"__BASEBALL__ Who do you think will play in the World Series this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe the Astros and Cubs, but its too early in the season to tell."
"__BASEBALL__ Have the Astros been to the World Series before?"
"__BASEBALL__ They were once back in 2005 against the White Sox."
"__BASEBALL__ That's confusing because both are American League teams."
"__BASEBALL__ That's true now, but the Astros were in the National League back then."
"__BASEBALL__ Did the Astros win it that year?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, the White Sox won it all."
"__BASEBALL__ So both of the Chicago MLB teams have now won the World Series in recent memory."
