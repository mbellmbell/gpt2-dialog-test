"__MOVIES__ Did you ever get around to seeing Passengers?"
"__MOVIES__ No, man. I couldn't figure out what it was about judging by the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ The trailer was just like, 'Hey watch Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in space.'"
"__MOVIES__ Haha exactly. Although I like both actors, but..."
"__MOVIES__ Eh. Jurassic World was awful."
"__MOVIES__ Oh shut up, it was fine. Nothing's going to be the original Jurassic Park."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know Harrison Ford was slated to be the paleontologist?"
"__MOVIES__ No way! Why wasn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he just bowed out for another project. Sam Neill got hired instead."
"__MOVIES__ Sam Neill was great though. He was incredible in Event Horizon, too."
"__MOVIES__ That film scarred me."
"__MOVIES__ Teddy dying was a disturbing death scene..."
"__MOVIES__ I remember getting chills from the corrected latin translation, remember that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not 'save me,' it's 'save yourselves'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! So freaky. But at any rate - so are you going to at least try seeing Passengers at some point?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe if it comes out on Netflix.`"
"__MOVIES__ I think Jurassic World just came out on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Not that exciting."
"__MOVIES__ I think Netflix is doing a good job with the documentaries it airs, though."
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah. At least there's that. The movies it's showing, though? Eh."
