"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Ya I watched through the Matrix trilogy the last few nights."
"__MOVIES__ How are they? I've never seen them before but people always talk about them."
"__MOVIES__ They are some of my favorite movies of all time."
"__MOVIES__ What makes them so good?"
"__MOVIES__ When The Matrix came out it was a trendsetter when it comes to graphics and CGI."
"__MOVIES__ Things have really advanced since then huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea they have but for when the movies were made these graphics were innovative in a lot of ways."
"__MOVIES__ How about the rest of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The story line was amazing in a lot of aspects. I think it's better than the action parts."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the story has a lot of symbolism in it and there are a lot of different themes going on at once."
"__MOVIES__ OK, that sounds like my kind of the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Ya I'm sure you would like it. A lot of the themes have shallow meanings as well as deeper things that go over most people head."
"__MOVIES__ I love a movie that can make me think. Do you think it would be OK for my son to watch it with me?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea I think he would like it too. There are themes that a kid can handle and it will keep him entertained."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. We will have to check it out later."
"__MOVIES__ You might have to explain a few things to him if he doesn't understand though."
"__MOVIES__ That's not a problem, he's pretty smart. Thanks for giving me some information on it."
"__MOVIES__ Not a problem. I hope you guys enjoy."
