"__MOVIES__ What movie older than 30 years should I definitely see if I haven't seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Have you seen Jaws?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I didn't think it was that great. I guess sharks don't really scare me."
"__MOVIES__ OK, how about The Shining?"
"__MOVIES__ Now that was a great movie! Extremely creepy. Loved Jack Nicholson's performance."
"__MOVIES__ At least I named one that you liked. Alright, have you seen the Godfather Trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't, though I've heard a lot about them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man! Those movies are epic! Well, the first two are."
"__MOVIES__ Not the third one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the third one is really bad. Just pretend that it doesn't exist."
"__MOVIES__ What's so great about the Godfather movies."
"__MOVIES__ Where to begin? First of all, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Rober DeNiro."
"__MOVIES__ Those are some darn good actors, I'll give you that."
"__MOVIES__ I'd say the main thing is that it's such a cool world they create, of the Mafia back in the early to mid 20th century."
"__MOVIES__ I've enjoyed some Mob movies I've seen in the past. Casino, Donnie Brasco."
"__MOVIES__ These have a different feel to them. It's almost like Feudal Europe or something, with the Godfather as the King."
"__MOVIES__ Who is the main actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Al Pacino is Michael Corleone in both movies. He's probably the main guy, but Brando plays his father as an old man, and DeNiro plays his father as a young man."
"__MOVIES__ I will definitely check them out."
"__MOVIES__ Just remember - the third one doesn't exist!"
