"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You ready for football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hell yeah. Raiders are going to win it all this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys will be tough too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's see if Prescott is the real deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he proved he is last season and so did Elliott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm still not a believer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also think Carolina can return to Super Bowl contenders this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It all falls on Newton's shoulders."
