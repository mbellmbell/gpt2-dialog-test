"__MOVIES__ The last time we talked you said you didn't like the old time Hollywood musicals like Singing in the Rain."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's why I wasn't that impressed with La La Land."
"__MOVIES__ Well, do you like any musicals?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, yes there are several."
"__MOVIES__ O.K give me one--what's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I feel like I may betraying my male gender, but--Mama Mia."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, maybe more popular with women, but a solid choice."
"__MOVIES__ I just love how all the ABBA songs propel the story line and are not just random."
"__MOVIES__ And you like ABBA?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really do."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it would be hard to enjoy the movie if you didn't like the songs."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, for sure, but there were other things."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, for one, the beautiful scenery."
"__MOVIES__ And the plot line--your child becoming an adult and moving on."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I cry when Meryl Streep sings 'Slipping Through My Fingers'."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, you like the movie, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I confess."
"__MOVIES__ Well, then you're crying when she sings 'The Winner Takes It All'."
"__MOVIES__ Afraid you got me there, too."
"__MOVIES__ Streep, is there anything that woman can't do."
