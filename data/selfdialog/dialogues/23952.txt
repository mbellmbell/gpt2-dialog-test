"__SUPERHERO__ How many Superman remakes have their been so far?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think three."
"__SUPERHERO__ I only remember two."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, they had the original with Christopher Reeves and the relevant sequels."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right."
"__SUPERHERO__ Then they had the one that Bryan Singer did - Superman Returns."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh yeah, totally forgot about that one."
"__SUPERHERO__ Then they had the new one with Zack Snyder directing that setup the rest of the DC movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Okay, it all makes sense now."
"__SUPERHERO__ It's all overkill.  Superman's not that cool anyway."
