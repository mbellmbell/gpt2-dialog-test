"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch the NFL Draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it was boring though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean? The Browns got their first pick!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns will still be at the bottom of the league, they are awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Years of mismanagement and bad contracts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Johnny Manziel? That was a disaster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You aren't even a Browns fan - imagine how we feel about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, true. Steelers are still going to win their game against the Browns though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, we'll see - Ohio sports have had a revival recently - The Cavs, the Indians, the Blue Jackets - all are competitive teams now!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too bad the Browns can't get any of their players!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, Very Funny. Who do you think will win the Big Game, though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has to be the Steelers. Big Ben is getting old and he needs another ring before turning it in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has to stay healthy, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it, he is made of glass."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I never hope for injuries, but I wouldn't complain if we had to go against your 2nd string in our meeting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steelers can beat the Browns with a cardboard cut out of Big Ben!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Good luck this season - I think we both agree - anyone but the Patriots!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely! I just hope it's my boys in black and gold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And I hope it's my Browns! Good to talk to you!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You Too! Go Steelers!"
