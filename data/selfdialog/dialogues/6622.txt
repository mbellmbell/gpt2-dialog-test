"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think the new Han Solo movie will be good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I sure hope so! Han is my favorite Star Wars character."
"__STAR_WARS__ It will definitely be weird to see Han as someone other than Harrison Ford"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. The two are practically the same in my mind."
"__STAR_WARS__ Alden Ehrenreich seems to be good though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I watched some of his movies after he was announced as the actor. He definitely has talent."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm worried about the chaos with the director job lately."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard they just found someone to head the project. Ron Howard."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, he's good! I loved Apollo 13."
"__STAR_WARS__ With any luck, he'll have things back on track soon."
