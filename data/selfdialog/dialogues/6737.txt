"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen The Force Awakens yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I loved that movie!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too!  Who was your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved Finn, he was pretty funny and I kind of want him and Rey to be a couple."
"__STAR_WARS__ He does seem pretty protective of her and is very worried about her. I loved Po."
"__STAR_WARS__ Po was great!  I was so excited when we found out that he didn't actually die in the crash."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, I hope he sticks around for a while in the next one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also really loved Kylo Ren.  He was kind of corny but I also loved it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think I am most excited to see where his story line goes. Especially since he is Han and Leia's kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know!  I am also hoping they will say who Rey's parents are or where she came from."
