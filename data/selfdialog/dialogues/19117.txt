"__MOVIES__ So, have you seen Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that's not my kind of flick."
"__MOVIES__ I bet you mean that it's a comic book based film, and you think they're childish."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Although somebody dragged me to Dr. Strange, and I liked that."
"__MOVIES__ That was good too. But Wonder Woman is even better."
"__MOVIES__ Why? It seems like most of those flms are sort of simple-minded. The good are really good, the villains really evil, and the ending really happy."
"__MOVIES__ It's more of a biography, of a feminist. I mean, it's a fantasy, sure, with strong action elements, but its values are excellent."
"__MOVIES__ She's strong, and wise, and independent. But, let me guess, she's also beautiful, young, well-off and well-dressed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. You want to watch ugly people? Living in misery?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure. Elephant Man. Midnight Cowboy."
"__MOVIES__ You do know movies are supposed to be entertainment, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure. But I want to be entertained, not intellectually insulted."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I think you should go see it before you call it stupid.It got great reviews."
"__MOVIES__ But I bet it won't in ten years."
"__MOVIES__ So go see it now."
"__MOVIES__ No. I'll wait."
"__MOVIES__ It has a gorgeous romance, with a handsome male lead."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. What actor plays that part?"
"__MOVIES__ Chris Pine. From Princcess Diaries, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. I guess I could stand to see it."
