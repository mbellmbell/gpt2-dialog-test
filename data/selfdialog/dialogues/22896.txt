"__DISNEY__ I really liked the movie Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I saw it last week and didn't think it was anything special."
"__DISNEY__ It's one of the best movies I've ever seen! What didn't you like about it?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, it just didn't hold my interest."
"__DISNEY__ I loved it because it taught me about a different culture and just felt different from most other movies."
"__DISNEY__ How was it different from other movies?"
"__DISNEY__ It didn't have a love story, which was kind of refreshing."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe that's the reason it didn't hold my interest."
"__DISNEY__ I guess you could be right. I loved it though!"
"__DISNEY__ I won't be seeing it again anytime soon."
