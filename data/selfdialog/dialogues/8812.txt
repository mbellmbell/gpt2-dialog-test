"__BEATLES__ How do you feel about Eleanor Rigby?"
"__BEATLES__ It's okay I suppose, but a little too out there for my tastes."
"__BEATLES__ So you like the more traditional Beatles stuff?"
"__BEATLES__ I do indeed, I'm partial towards something like I want to hold your hand."
"__BEATLES__ See that's where we differ, I get bored sometimes with their more traditional stuff."
"__BEATLES__ I just feel some of their less traditional stuff was akin to them going off the deep end."
"__BEATLES__ I can certainly see how it wouldn't be for everyone, and don't get me wrong I still enjoy all their stuff, at least to some extent."
"__BEATLES__ Who's your favorite Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ John Lennon hands down."
"__BEATLES__ I'm a George Harrison person myself, also really like Ringo Star."
