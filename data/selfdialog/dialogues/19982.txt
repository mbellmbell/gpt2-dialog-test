"__MOVIES__ What's up? Have you seen the latest xman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one? Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh is that out now? I meant apocalypse."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Well yeah, I saw apocalypse but I think Logan is out now."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about apocalypse?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it but i thought that first class was better"
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting, I liked days of future past best so far"
"__MOVIES__ That one was pretty good. What do you think they will do next with the series?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm pretty sure Deadpool has places to go but I feel like wolverine and his storyline is dying down"
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Speaking of, did you ever see Deadpool? What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was hilarious, even though it was a bit dirty"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wasn't sure how it fit into the Wolverine back story when striker makes the 'deadpool' that is all the mutants combined."
"__MOVIES__ I always thought it was interesting how the only way to kill all the mutants was to make something with all the mutants capabilities."
"__MOVIES__ Thats so true, its like, why not just let mutants be?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess its hard when theres mutants like Magneto out there."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wonder what happened differently after the president was saved by mutants."
"__MOVIES__ I always wondered that. I guess apocalypse has some of the answers"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but not many, it goes into its own story more"
"__MOVIES__ Thats right, well we should go see the next one that comes out together"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great!"
