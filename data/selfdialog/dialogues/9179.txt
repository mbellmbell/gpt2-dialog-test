"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the game between the Giants and Mets yesterday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, it was on really early on the West Coast, but I was able to watch it online at work."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, that's some dedication you have."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I am a fan of the Giants, and work wasn't too busy."
"__BASEBALL__ Can you believe the Giants were able to come back in the 9th inning like that?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I was really surprised.  They have been on a horrible losing streak."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, the Giants have looked really bad lately.  What is going on?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well they have had some key injuries, and some of their free agent signings aren't working out."
"__BASEBALL__ True, it's quite a shame what happened to Bumgarner and how he got injured."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, but I mean the Mets are in the same boat."
"__BASEBALL__ That is true.  Giants and Mets met in the playoffs last season, and this year they both look like they've regressed."
"__BASEBALL__ Well the Mets had a really promising pitching rotation.  But injuries have really hurt them."
"__BASEBALL__ Harvey, Syndegaard.  Yea, you are right."
"__BASEBALL__ For a while there the Mets looked like they were going to be a dynasty."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, and now, all bets are off.  They just can't keep their pitchers healthy."
"__BASEBALL__ What happened to Matt Harvey is such a shock.  He looked destined to be the next big star."
"__BASEBALL__ This is true.  Well at least the Giants won 3 World Series already, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  Our fanbase can't complain too much when we've done so well in this decade."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, I think the Giants are due for some bad years."
"__BASEBALL__ Well I wouldn't go that far.  But yea, there is that fear that the window might be closed."
