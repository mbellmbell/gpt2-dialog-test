"__MOVIES__ Let's talk about crappy movies."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome! What would you like to discuss?"
"__MOVIES__ Crappy movies--I just said that. Anyway, what is your favorite movie that has awful reviews, say, 35% or below on Rotten Tomatoes?"
"__MOVIES__ Oooh, I love this. For all its ridiculousness, 2012 was hilariously bad with beautiful action sequences."
"__MOVIES__ It wanted to make me scream! You can't outrun a volcano!"
"__MOVIES__ Hahah, I know, nor can you catch up to a moving plane on foot while outrunning a volcano explosion."
"__MOVIES__ Plus John Cusack's acting was awful."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that brought it to its peak. What's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I LOVED, loved, Ninja Assassin."
"__MOVIES__ You just said a certain word twice. What about that movie did it for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Grow up. I read over and over that it was horribly edited with a thousand cuts per scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a bit of a headache."
"__MOVIES__ But, it was a fantasy battle, like the Crazy 88s in Kill Bill."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it with my good friend. We were laughing our butts off!"
"__MOVIES__ Plus the gore was so incredibly over-the-top, it was perfect."
"__MOVIES__ Plus, there had to be a love story."
"__MOVIES__ Ninjas killing each other rapid-fire wouldn't work otherwise."
"__MOVIES__ Which of the two do you think was more over-the-top?"
"__MOVIES__ Ninja Assassin, because it defies physics. You?"
"__MOVIES__ 2012, because the whole plot is set into motion by something that's impossible. At least Ninja Assassin had a useable storyline."
