"__MUSIC__ I just heard 'Shut up and Dance.' I haven't heard that song in over a year."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good song. I like 'Walk the Moon.'"
"__MUSIC__ Thanks. I couldn't remember the band's name."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They're an Ohio band, from Cincinnati; I think. That song was all over the radio when it came out in 2014."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have any other hits?"
"__MUSIC__ They're kind of a new band, not even 10 years old. 'Anna Sun' was popular back in 2011, but not quite the hit of the song you mentioned."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think that I've ever heard 'Anna Sun.'"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you have, you just didn't know it was that song. 'Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges my feet are still sore my back is on the fringes'"
"__MUSIC__ That sounds familiar. I just can't place it right now."
"__MUSIC__ They're style is definitely unique. They say that their influences are 'The Police,' 'Tears for Fears' and 'Phil Collins' but they don't really sound like any of them."
"__MUSIC__ I remember seeing them on that New Year's special last year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. That was the show that Dick Clark hosted. They performed 'Shut up and Dance.'"
"__MUSIC__ I had never seen the band before that.  It's a pretty big sound for such a small band -- 4 members."
"__MUSIC__ There have actually been 9 members since they formed in 2008. But you're mostly right. At one point in 2008 to 2009 they only had 3."
"__MUSIC__ What's the singer's name?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be Nicholas Petricca. He also formed the band."
"__MUSIC__ I wanted to see them in concert, but something happened that year."
"__MUSIC__ Last year they canceled their 'Work This Body' when Petricca had to spend more time with an ill family member."
"__MUSIC__ I describe them as a dance band, but they've got other sounds too.."
"__MUSIC__ They've been categorized as alternative rock and pop rock at the awards."
