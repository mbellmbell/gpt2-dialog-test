"__BASEBALL__ Have you watched much baseball yet this season?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I've been busy wrapping up the school year.  I'm looking forward to having some time now."
"__BASEBALL__ Can you believe that the Twins are leading the AL Central?"
"__BASEBALL__ I saw that the other day.  How is that possible?"
"__BASEBALL__ Last year they were so bad.  Guess that left no where to go but up."
"__BASEBALL__ Still, it's surprising.  Wonder how long they can hang on."
"__BASEBALL__ Who knows?  Nobody in that division is killing it, so they may be ok throughout the summer."
"__BASEBALL__ Who's in second place right now?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Indians and the Tigers are a game back, while the White Sox and the Royals are under .500."
"__BASEBALL__ Crazy how the Royals have stumbled so far.  I think everyone expected them to be better."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I guess sometimes it's hard to sustain success."
"__BASEBALL__ And injuries haven't helped them out much."
"__BASEBALL__ True.  Maybe they will get things turned around by the All-Star break and make a push in the second half."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, maybe.  But on another note, how about those Astros?"
"__BASEBALL__ No kidding!  They have been on fire so far.  By far the best team in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ It's the pitching.  They have a pretty good rotation."
"__BASEBALL__ Their bats aren't bad either."
"__BASEBALL__ It would be cool to see them in the World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ A Houston/Milwaukee match-up would be an advertiser's nightmare."
"__BASEBALL__ But baseball fans would love it!!"
