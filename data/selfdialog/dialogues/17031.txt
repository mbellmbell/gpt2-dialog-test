"__MOVIES__ So have you seen any new movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I saw Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I saw it last week."
"__MOVIES__ I love it! What'd you think about it"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay."
"__MOVIES__ Just okay? What didn't you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the story felt a bit rushed."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I thought that this movie should have been the third or fourth sequel rather than part two. They fought a planet, and a god."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but I loved that we got a bit more back story."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the this reveal should have been at the end of the series, plus it would have given more time for the love story to develop."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you''re saying, I think the series will keep being popular. If that was just an okay movie for you, what does an excellent movie look like?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved Logan, that was a great film."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I loved Logan too, tell me about why you liked it?"
"__MOVIES__ Great setting and atmosphere, great character development, great pacing, great action, just perfect."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that the action was so believable."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that reminds me, did you see John Wick two?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did, I give it 7/10 stars."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, it felt a tad bit over the top."
"__MOVIES__ No where near as good as the first John Wick!"
