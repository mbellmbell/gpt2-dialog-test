"__HARRY_POTTER__ How powerful do you think Dumbledore really is?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, they've said a bunch of times in the movies that he's the most powerful wizard ever."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but it doesn't seem like he does all that much."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you mean? He's done a bunch."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe in the last few movies, but in the first few he seemed useless."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, true but I think that's because the first few movies were meant more for little kids."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That doesn't make sense though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Agreed, but it's kinda how it is. The later movies got darker and he got more powerful."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I agree. From the Voldemort/Dumbledore battle in Goblet of Fire it seems like his power ramped up exponentially."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's my point, yeah till then he hadn't done much, after that he was unstoppable."
