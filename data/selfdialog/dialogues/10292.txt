"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Did you get a chance to see Straight Outta Compton?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, I didn't how was it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I liked it a lot. It felt like they really stuck to the story of NWA."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I heard they had to cut a lot of stuff out of the movie."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They did. One of things was when Dr. Dre's beat up Dee Barnes, among other things."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wonder why they did that? All of the true fans know what happened."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I heard that the movie ran too long and they had to trim it down."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That makes sense. I wonder how long it was."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think the final cut was over 3 and a half hours long, so that's why they trimmed it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, that would be like watching a hip hop Lord Of The Rings!"
