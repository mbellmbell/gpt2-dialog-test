"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about animated movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh boy. To be honest, I can't remember the last animated movie I've watched."
"__MOVIES__ I've been watching a few lately with my family, and I've found some of them to actually be pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Odds are I won't know much about them. The last good animated movie I remember watching is Up."
"__MOVIES__ At least that movie was good."
"__MOVIES__ 'Good' doesn't do that movie justice. It was fantastic!"
"__MOVIES__ Hard to argue with that. Such a good story being told in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I also remember Wall-E being a really great movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I remember too much about that one, if I'm being honest."
"__MOVIES__ Watch it if you get the chance. It's just as good as Up, if not better."
"__MOVIES__ Well, back to what I had said. I've been watching some newer animated movies lately with my family."
"__MOVIES__ Right, sorry about cutting you off. Do you have any recommendations."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! For starters, Big Hero 6 is pretty fun."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that a Marvel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is! It's a much different take on your typical Marvel movie, or just superhero movie in general, though."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'm interested. What else?"
"__MOVIES__ Finding Dory is also a fantastic movie."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot that they even made a Finding Nemo sequel! Please tell me it's good."
"__MOVIES__ Like I just said, it's fantastic. If you get the chance, definitely watch it."
"__MOVIES__ I actually think it's on Netflix! Well, I know what I'm doing tonight!"
