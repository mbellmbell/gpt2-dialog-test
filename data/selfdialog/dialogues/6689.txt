"__STAR_WARS__ Have you heard about the latest rumor for episode 9?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Is this is about the crazy fan theory concerning Darth Sidious and Supreme Leader Snoke?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, this is an even crazier rumor!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh really? Please, do tell!"
"__STAR_WARS__ The newest crazy theory is that Supreme Leader Snoke is actually Ezra from the Star Wars Rebels series."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ezra? Isn't he pre-episode 4 and a good Jedi in training?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the rumor goes that Ezra loses everyone by Empire and gets trapped in the Unknown Regions while being pursued by Thrawn. He gets corrupted by the dark side and becomes Snoke."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a pretty crazy theory. Do you have anything to back it up?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nothing solid, just rumors on social media."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's too bad. It's a pretty crazy idea to have Ezra turn dark and become Snoke."
