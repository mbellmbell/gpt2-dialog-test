"__MOVIES__ So, what movie should we go to?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't care, as long as it's not from a series."
"__MOVIES__ I think you mean a franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I hate franchise movies. They're so predictable."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree. They give you a new situation, a new adventure, but you still kind of get to know what to expect."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you can expect, violence, meaningless dialog, and things blowing up. Also improbable special effects to keep you amused."
"__MOVIES__ The Disney franchises are not like that. Films like Finding Nemo and Toy Story are sweet"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, too sweet."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I bet you loved Disney once."
"__MOVIES__ I did, but I don't now. It seems like a lot of franchises are Disney-simple, even though they're supposed to be for adults."
"__MOVIES__ Everything doesn't have to be deep and complex. Movies are entertainment."
"__MOVIES__ Simple is for kids. Adult franchises can feel like a mass-produced commodity, a product, and that 's not entertaining to me."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it is to me."
"__MOVIES__ I want to experience something strange and new, not the same old stuff."
"__MOVIES__ You might sit through the longest film you ever saw instead though, like Meet Joe Black. You're gambling."
"__MOVIES__ Two hours of elves feels long to me, or two hours of pirates, especially dead pirates. Down with Pirate movies!"
"__MOVIES__ What about Bond? He's no elf."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Is there a Bond movie playing?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think so."
"__MOVIES__ Well, now. Let's go to that."
