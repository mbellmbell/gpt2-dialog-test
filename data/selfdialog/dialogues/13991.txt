"__BASKETBALL__ Looks like it's going to be the Warriors vs the Cavs in the finals"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah just like most people thought"
"__BASKETBALL__ I was really hoping for something different but oh well"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah me too. Who do you think wins it all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Warriors win in six games."
"__BASKETBALL__ I say the Warriors win in seven games"
"__BASKETBALL__ I just think the Warriors have too much firepower"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, especially with the addition of Kevin Durant to their lineup"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that has made them even more potent"
"__BASKETBALL__ It just going to be hard to overcome all of that talent"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I think the Warriors are just too good"
"__BASKETBALL__ In the end they will wear down Lebron James"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I think Kevin Love needs to have a huge series in order for them to have a chance"
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree and their bench needs to play well also"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's the only way they have a shot at this"
"__BASKETBALL__ If Lebron pulls this off I think it puts him a little closer to Jordan"
"__BASKETBALL__ I believe that as well. This is a huge challenge to take on"
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably the biggest challenge that he has ever had"
"__BASKETBALL__ We are talking about beating a potentially all-time team"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that would be an amazing accomplishment"
