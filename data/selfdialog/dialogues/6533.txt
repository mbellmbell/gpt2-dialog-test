"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the Star Wars prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like them, but some things bother me."
"__STAR_WARS__ What sort of things do you have trouble with in the films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In particular, I dislike the character of Jar-Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you dislike that particular alien character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar-Jar acts silly, and I found the accent more than a bit racist."
"__STAR_WARS__ What else do you dislike about the prequel trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did not care for the way Annakin turned so quickly to the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't you think the emperor explained the turn well enough?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not feel the Emperor's evil was evident enough.       The Jedi should've noticed his rapid aging."
