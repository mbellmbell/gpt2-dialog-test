"__MUSIC__ I really miss 80's and 90's type music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! Music nowadays is so much different than it was back in. Different meaning worse."
"__MUSIC__ I agree...and don't even get me started on music videos now."
"__MUSIC__ They're horrible! I remember so many awesome music videos from the 80's and early 90's. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I do. I remember specific videos because they were so engaging and when I think of them it creates a feeling of nostalgia for me."
"__MUSIC__ Can you give me some examples?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like 'Take on Me' by A-Ha, 'Sledgehammer' by Peter Gabriel, 'Land of Confusion' by Genesis, and the list goes on. Any specific music videos you like from the 80's or early 90's?"
"__MUSIC__ The ones you mentioned are good examples. I remember all of them! What about 'Money for Nothing' by Dire Straits?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I remember watching that when I was a kid! It was like, one of the first music videos I had ever seen!"
"__MUSIC__ Same here. Now it seems all music videos are about is who can show the most skin. It's disgusting. Either that or who has the most money."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you on that. I used to love watching music videos all the time and now I don't like them at all."
"__MUSIC__ I think radio stations are going downhill too. The stations I used to love are playing songs that don't even seem like they fit into the genre of the station. Like Laser 99.3 is supposed to be rock music and I swear they've been playing borderline rap and pop for the last few years!"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I know. I used to love that station. Now it's not even on my presets in my car!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I just thought of another music video I loved! 'Opposites Attract' by Paula Abdul."
"__MUSIC__ Haha yeah with the cartoon cat. I liked all of Paula Abdul's songs. She was great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she was. Hmm...what about New Kids on the Block?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha how can anyone forget the New Kids? They were all the rage in the early 90's!"
"__MUSIC__ That reminds me of another band that was all the rage in the early 90's...but not for long. Millie Vanilli."
"__MUSIC__ Haha yup, as soon as they were found lip syncing on stage to 'Girl You Know It's True', they were done with!"
"__MUSIC__ I never liked them anyway. Not as much as Paula Abdul."
