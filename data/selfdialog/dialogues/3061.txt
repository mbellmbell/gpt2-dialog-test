"__MUSIC__ sup mate,what you up to?"
"__MUSIC__ nothing much ,watching mtv"
"__MUSIC__ your parents in?"
"__MUSIC__ nah, am alone, you coming over to mine?"
"__MUSIC__ not immediately,i'm just heeding from work so need to freshen up and all that before i can holla at you."
"__MUSIC__ okay no worries then"
"__MUSIC__ oh yeah i had wanted to ask what's the beef between weekend and wizkid all about"
"__MUSIC__ oh that, its kinda childish to me on weekends part"
"__MUSIC__ why do you say so?"
"__MUSIC__ wizkid had been known as starboy for over 5 years before weekend did this new song 'starboy' and then starts saying he's the real starboy."
"__MUSIC__ i do not see it that way though,with what i understand about it, it was wizkid who took to twitter and like he's the real starboy on the same day weekend release the single 'starboy'"
"__MUSIC__ hmm really he did that?"
"__MUSIC__ yeah, that was were i think the whole beef might i sprang from"
"__MUSIC__ funny though they both do different kind of music,weekend rnb and wizkid afro-pop so don't see why the competition"
"__MUSIC__ these days one can't tell, it might just be a marketing stunt to promote the single which is not really doing well."
"__MUSIC__ that's some thought, they might just be aware what's what their doing"
"__MUSIC__ true because it all started on the starboy single release day,so might have been planned."
"__MUSIC__ i'm not swayed though, i still don't like either of them,staying true to my raggae root hehe"
"__MUSIC__ oyeah rastaman hahaha"
"__MUSIC__ i wouldn't mind that hahaha"
