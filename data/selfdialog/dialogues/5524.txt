"__STAR_WARS__ Are Star Wars movies just science fiction?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, they have fantasy elements too. The Force is basically just magic."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's what I thought, too. Yoda might as well be an elf."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda's not an elf, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's a pointy-eared wise, mystical person who lives in harmony with nature. If this were Lord of the Rings, he'd be an elf."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought about it that way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Obi-Wan Kenobi was originally inspired by a ronin samurai, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jedi own their lightsabers like fantasy knights own swords."
"__STAR_WARS__ So Star Wars seems like it's just as much a fantasy as a science-fiction movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought about it that way. But you're right."
