"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you like the Fast & Furious movies"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I did, up until number 6.  They just got too crazy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree.  They are what got me into cars."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, they were so cheesy but it helped get a whole new generation into the car scene."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yep, I was even crazy enough to get street-glow on my car"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, I am so sorry.  You must regret that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I really do.  Have you seen the new one yet?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No I haven't.  I doubt I will."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's just not the same without Paul."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree.  They need to stop making them."
