"__MOVIES__ Have you watched A Cure for Wellness?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, welll you really should. It was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I'm afraid it'll be too scarry."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the same thing but it's really not too spooky."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay, what was the creepiest part?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I don't want to spoil it but there's this part where he's in a tank with eels that creeped me out."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay, that doesn't sound too bad."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, not awful. Just had a pretty dark feel to the whole movie though."
"__MOVIES__ What was the best part of it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh there was this girl in the movie and she was really mysterious and interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, did it have a good ending too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really wasn't expecting it."
"__MOVIES__ Good, I like unexpected stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's my favorite part when movies send me on a loop."
"__MOVIES__ Well don't tell me any more about it, I'll just have to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you should, you'll like it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure I will."
"__MOVIES__ Let me know what you thought about it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I will."
