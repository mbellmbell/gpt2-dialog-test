"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you know that Fast and the Furious chronology was different from it's story chronology?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you mean by that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Like the movies do not all go in order."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I had no idea about that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, there were 2 short films that were released, one bridges the gap between the first and the second and one the second and the fourth."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That is interesting, I had no idea."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Tokyo Drift was the third released but actually takes place after the sixth movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That is just strange, why would they do that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They probably did not plan on the franchise lasting this long when they made the third."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They were definitely wrong about that."
