"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who all has Dr. Dre made famous?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think two of the most prominent people are Eminem and Kendrick Lamar."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, I didn't realize he helped Kendrick Lamar!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, they're both from Compton and Dr. Dre put Kendrick on early."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Interesting. He seems to have an ear for great artists."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, those are two of the most iconic rappers of the past twenty years."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's interesting that both of them have staked a good deal of independence from Dre. They don't overuse features or production by him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I think that was important for both of them, to not be seen as leaning too heavily on Dre."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right. YG, another Compton rapper has this line about being the only rapper to make it out of the West without Dre, and while Dre helped Kendrick, I think it's kind of unfair to imply that he wouldn't have done it without Dre."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, it's not as if Dre was the only one who was recognizing Kendrick."
