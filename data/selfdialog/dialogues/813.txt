"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to pick out music for our road trip to Minneapolis tomorrow."
"__MUSIC__ The one you're going on with Bill and Dave?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I'm not sure what they'll like."
"__MUSIC__ What do you have on it so far?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I put on some nineties rock, and some stuff from the early 2000s. Daft Punk, that sort of thing."
"__MUSIC__ I bet they'll like that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. But now I'm stuck. Do you know what kind of music either of them likes?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I'm not sure. A little bit of classic rock is usually a safe bet."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe The Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ That's such a throwback. It could be good though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. And then maybe something you guys can get really into."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I'm not sure we have anything like that in common."
"__MUSIC__ What about that party where you guys all sang karaoke together?"
"__MUSIC__ What about it?"
"__MUSIC__ What song was it?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was something by The Cranberries."
"__MUSIC__ That's a safe bet then!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay! Oh, that's right. It was Zombie."
"__MUSIC__ That's perfect."
