"__BASKETBALL__ The Warriors and Cavs sure are dominating the playoffs so far."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, nobody has been a challenge, they've both won every game so far."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess the rest paid off for Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he's as dominant in these playoffs as ever before."
"__BASKETBALL__ What about Durant? Looks like the warriors made a good move in picking him up."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, seems like he was worth giving up some of the depth they had."
"__BASKETBALL__ They still have some good role players. Javale Magee is playing great."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he's great on the boards and I love when he dunks those lobs."
"__BASKETBALL__ David West has been giving the Warriors good minutes lately too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, well, seems like they just have too much talent to lose this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, even if Curry or Thompson aren't playing well Durant and Green can take over the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it helps that Durant doesn't rely on the three as much."
"__BASKETBALL__ Cleveland made some good acquisitions this year as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, Korver and Williams have become a major part of their regular rotation."
"__BASKETBALL__ Korver had 18 points in the last game against the Raptors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, signing Bogut didn't work out too well though."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, can't believe he broke his leg right away. I think they're still set up pretty well though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it's hard to imagine anyone can stop either the Cavs or the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, especially since the other teams look like they could both be in seven game series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, once they advance, the Cavs and Warriors will be waiting and well rested."
