"__BEATLES__ Do you like the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ I love them! I used to listen to them when I was young; my uncle gave me a bunch of their albums."
"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite?"
"__BEATLES__ Probably the White Album. I know that's an unusual choice, probably. It's so weird and experimental."
"__BEATLES__ Not me, I found that too weird for my taste. I like their earliest stuff. So sweet, melodic and romantic."
"__BEATLES__ I dig it. But for me when they started to get more...I don't know, spiritual and psychedelic, that's when they got really interesting."
"__BEATLES__ Hmm. I do tend to like a band's 'experimental stage.' Like, if they are talented enough, eventually they start to really push the envelope in their own way."
"__BEATLES__ True. For the Beatles I think it was maybe Revolver that was the turning point there, or maybe Sgt. Peppers'."
"__BEATLES__ I did really love Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, one of the greatest albums of all time."
"__BEATLES__ They were a true gift to music, for sure."
