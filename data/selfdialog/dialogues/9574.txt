"__COMEDY__ Have you seen the movie 'Bridesmaids?'"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, it's one of my favorite comedies."
"__COMEDY__ I saw it recently, and I really enjoyed Kristen Wiig.  I have seen her on Saturday Night Live before, but I had never seen her in a movie."
"__COMEDY__ I think she may have had something to do with the writing of Bridesmaids."
"__COMEDY__ I think so too.  The airplane scene is priceless.  'Help me, I'm poor.'  That was so funny."
"__COMEDY__ And you just can't beat Melissa McCarthy as the groom's sister."
"__COMEDY__ Did you know that McCarthy's real life husband is in the movie?  I think he often has parts in her movies."
"__COMEDY__ No!  Which character did he play?"
"__COMEDY__ He was the air marshall on the airplane; the one McCarthy's character interacted with."
"__COMEDY__ Oh. That is so cool.  They were really funny together."
