"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of The Paper Chase?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. What are they like?"
"__MUSIC__ They're hard to describe! They use a lot of horror themes in their music, and they're kind of experimental. The frontman started in production work."
"__MUSIC__ Experimental how?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, their stuff is more something that incorporates music than it is music per se. They use a lot of sampling and unusual instrumentation, and they mostly made concept albums."
"__MUSIC__ I like concept albums a lot! What are they about?"
"__MUSIC__ Most of them have horror themes, and the songs often tell a story, but it's usually vague and out of order."
"__MUSIC__ I like horror, but I like sci-fi more. Do they have anything like that?"
"__MUSIC__ If you like sci-fi and want to get into them, their Ctrl-Alt-Del-U is a must-hear! I think it's about space colonization, but it's up for interpretation."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds interesting. Is that a good album to start with?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it is, but people usually seem to start with Now You Are One Of Us or God Bless Your Black Heart."
"__MUSIC__ Are those albums good?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they're very good! I like all of their albums!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you have favorite songs from those two I could check out?"
"__MUSIC__ I like '...And All The Candy You Can Eat' on Now You Are One Of Us, and 'Dying With Decent Music' on God Bless Your Black Heart."
"__MUSIC__ I'll give those a listen! Do they have any new albums coming out?"
"__MUSIC__ They broke up in 2010, but John Congleton has a new band with a similar but different sound."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad, but I guess I could check them out, too."
"__MUSIC__ You should! And listen to Someday This Could All Be Yours pt. 1, it's the last Paper Chase album and they kind of reference each other."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, it sounds like I'd have to make an evening of this!"
