"__STAR_WARS__ So, I watched the Force Awakens, I am lost."
"__STAR_WARS__ By what? Good film."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it, but was the force sleeping before?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, it just means that a new Jedi had emerged."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, if it is Rey, then why did it not wake when Klyo came into power."
"__STAR_WARS__ Klyo went to the dark side, he is not a Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ If he is not a Jedi, why was he at Jedi school."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was Luke's Padwan, but he turned. It has not been shown why. He is no longer Jedi, he is sith now."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait, I thought sith was a race."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, Vader was human, well pretty much, but went from Jedi to Sith. Like Yoda is whatever he is, but is also a Jedi."
