"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you heard Gaga's latest album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, I think!  Unless she's released something recently."
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, I think this album came out last year."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Then yes, I have heard it.  It's very good."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I like it.  I just wish she'd go back to the first two albums' sounds."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, while it's noble that she likes to sing about causes, they aren't really fun to dance to in the club."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You aren't in the club for inspirational messages?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Haha!  No!  Not really."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I totally understand this."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You can't beat Just Dance.  It's one of my all-time favs."
