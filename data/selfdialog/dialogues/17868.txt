"__MOVIES__ How about La La Land winning best picture?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is made like an old time Hollywood musical and I don't like them, so I wasn't that crazy about this one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can understand that."
"__MOVIES__ And the trouble is the academy likes to give awards to movies about show business."
"__MOVIES__ Wait a minute, La La didn't win."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right, the snafu--it was actually Moonlight."
"__MOVIES__ How could we forget."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think the issue about black artists could have had something to do with Moonlight winning?"
"__MOVIES__ Could be, I didn't see, the movie and it is supposed to good, but then I'm sure Hollywood would like to be in the forefront of social awareness"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's hard to know."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like any other of the nominated movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really liked Hidden Figures.  It was educational, entertaining, and fascinating."
"__MOVIES__ There was your racial and gender issue--a real political winner if the academy wanted to go that way."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I suppose--I liked that aspect and the little known history was wonderful and pretty factual I read."
"__MOVIES__ See any of the other movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I saw Arrival and fell asleep in it, but the people I was with thought it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ It is pretty weird--I had a hard time with it, too.  Any others?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Lion, it was a real feel good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one where the boy from India gets separated from his family?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, not academy award winner quality, but really good--you'll enjoy it."
