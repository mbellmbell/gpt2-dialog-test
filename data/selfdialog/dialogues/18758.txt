"__MOVIES__ What do you think about Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice?"
"__MOVIES__ Saw it, loved it."
"__MOVIES__ I loved it too.  Went on a little too long I think."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no!  I think it was timed right."
"__MOVIES__ On the whole I really liked it.  It spoke to the dawn of their league, coming together."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  Ben Affleck was a good Batman."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too.  He's a tough character to get right."
"__MOVIES__ Such a rough background.  Affleck was downright moody."
"__MOVIES__ Superman was okay."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  Can't beat Christopher Reeves."
"__MOVIES__ That Lois Lane, not so great though."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Totally miscast."
"__MOVIES__ The highlight was Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Gal Godot, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's her."
"__MOVIES__ She's great in the role."
"__MOVIES__ A modern take on Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ She's not modern you know.  She's from the Amazon."
"__MOVIES__ And really skilled.  I'd love her lasso."
"__MOVIES__ She has her own movie coming soon."
