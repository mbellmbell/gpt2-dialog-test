"__STAR_WARS__ what did you think was better, return of the Jedi or the empire strikes back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I actually liked return of the Jedi better"
"__STAR_WARS__ seriously, why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ without Jedi, there is no conclusion to the story, and therefore empire is pointless"
"__STAR_WARS__ yeah, but all of the best drama is in Empire"
"__STAR_WARS__ I disagree, the most eventful action takes place in Return of the Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ but the best light saber fight of the middle three happens in in empire"
"__STAR_WARS__ light saber fighting isn't the only thing that made me enjoy the serires"
"__STAR_WARS__ you are crazy for liking Return of the Jedi more than Empire Strikes Back"
"__STAR_WARS__ you are just saying that because of that scene in the movie clerks!"
