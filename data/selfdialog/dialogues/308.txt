"__MUSIC__ I need a new workout playlist. The playlist I have now just isn't motivating me anymore."
"__MUSIC__ What do you listen to now?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I have a mix of mostly EDM and rap but with a few rock songs mixed in."
"__MUSIC__ What type of rap music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Wiz Khalifa, Eminem and of course the originals like Biggie and Tupac."
"__MUSIC__ Eminem is one of my favorite rappers. I love the way his songs are almost always an entire story you can see in your mind."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I don't like a lot of rap music where the lyrics only talk about cars or money. I like more substance than that."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, songs about money, cars and women get very old very quickly."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Eminem song?"
"__MUSIC__ There's just no way that I could pick one. The Eminem Show is one of my favorite albums though."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked that album."
"__MUSIC__ Superman and Sing for the Moment were great singles on that album."
"__MUSIC__ My all time favorite Eminem album is Recovery."
"__MUSIC__ I actually think that might be mine too now that I think of it."
"__MUSIC__ I must have listened to that album for about three months straight when it first came out."
"__MUSIC__ I actually went and bought the CD. I don't think I'd actually purchased a CD for years before that."
"__MUSIC__ I played Love the Way you Lie and No Love a ton."
"__MUSIC__ I liked those a lot and I thought they were great collaborations. Rihanna and Lil Wayne were amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Those songs will never get old to me."
"__MUSIC__ I couldn't agree more."
