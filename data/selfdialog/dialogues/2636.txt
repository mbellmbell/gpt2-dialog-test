"__MUSIC__ Did you hear the new Ellie Goulding song?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't. Do you think I'd like it?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so! She's so talented, I have a hard time believing anyone wouldn't like her."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me about it, and her, then."
"__MUSIC__ Okay! Well, she started out as an indie folk type singer, do you remember the song Lights?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, I do! I remember liking it, but I didn't bother listening to anything else of hers."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she's taken a natural evolution since then and her latest album is more electronic dance now."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? Not like in a mindless way though, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all! Her lyrics are still really meaningful, and of course her voice is one of a kind."
"__MUSIC__ I think I remember that she was with Skrillex, is her music like that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a little less dubstep, but she is not afraid to experiment at all!"
"__MUSIC__ What do you think your favorite song of hers is? If you can pick, that is."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, that is a hard choice! I guess I'd have to say Anything Can Happen."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like the most about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, her acapella in the beginning sounds amazing for one thing. It would have to ultimately be about the lyrics, though."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like most about them?"
"__MUSIC__ That it explores her fear at things changing, but also being open to the randomness of life."
"__MUSIC__ I think I would like it! Is there anything else I need to know about her music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, just that to keep an open mind, I feel like you will love her!"
"__MUSIC__ Thank you, I'm looking forward to it now!"
