"__MOVIES__ Hi there, are you a fan of the director Peter Jackson?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I love Peter Jackson's work! What's your favorite movie he's directed?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely the Lord of the Rings trilogy, they're some of my favorite movies ever."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, those movies were truly epic."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't quite as keen about the series of Hobbit movies unfortunately."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I feel the same way, they didn't quite capture the old magic."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The visuals and special effects were spectacular but it felt like they rehashed a lot of the Lord of the Rings material."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I don't think think that it quite lived up to expectations."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of his earlier work?"
"__MOVIES__ Not a whole lot, but I know he was really into campy gory, B-movie type films."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that too, I'm interested to check them out, they sound like they'd be entertaining to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like other fantasy films as well, like Harry Potter?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! The Harry Potter movies were pretty great."
"__MOVIES__ I liked them too. Daniel Radcliffe has really branched out since the Potter days as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's went on to do some amazing work, but I think he'll always be best known for his work on the Harry Potter films."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably true. It must be pretty crazy for those kids in the movies to watch themselves literally grow up on screen."
"__MOVIES__ It must be! Speaking of the Harry Potter kids, have you seen Emma Watson as Belle in the new Beauty and the Beast remake?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did, I thought that she was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ So did I! They really did a terrific job with the reboot."
"__MOVIES__ They certainly did the original film justice. It was a great family movie."
