"__MOVIES__ Ah it's movie night tonight.My husband and I take turns picking the genre."
"__MOVIES__ So who's turn is it tonight? Who is in control of the remote?"
"__MOVIES__ That would be MEEEEE! Yesssss! So what am I going to pick."
"__MOVIES__ What do you feel up for. Comedy? Sci Fi?"
"__MOVIES__ So hard to choose but you know I am going to be nice to my husband and go for comedy. But it's going to be something I can handle."
"__MOVIES__ And who are you going to choose? Old school comedy or more recent?"
"__MOVIES__ I am going with old school. Mel Brooks is going to be the purveyor of our snickers tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Oh great so pretty much you are going to act like juvenile delinquents in your choice of humor. He did put out some funny stuff."
"__MOVIES__ You would not be far from wrong on that assumption! We just recently watched Blazing Saddles."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah the classic campfire fart scene is always sure to get you going! Cleavon Little as the black sheriff is a hoot."
"__MOVIES__ Yes there are so many famous actors and oh yeah 'that guy' moments. Madeline Kahn just blows me away with her characters."
"__MOVIES__ Oh her song (I'm so tired) and how she sings it is priceless. She hits a home run every time!"
"__MOVIES__ Here's something you may not know about the movie. Mel Brooks ask John Wayne to be in the movie but he turned it down."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think he did that? Was it beneath his stature in life to do that level of crassness in a movie?"
"__MOVIES__ He was quoted as saying 'Naw, I can't do a movie like that, but I'll be first in line to see it!' That was pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess for the kind of actor he was he had a n image to uphold. His fans may have not liked that coming from 'the Duke'."
"__MOVIES__ Their loss I say. It could have been pretty hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Hey he still would have been playing a cowboy. But I guess the purists would have freaked out if he racist jokes."
"__MOVIES__ Well wish me luck on my second choice. Should it be Princess Bride or Young Frankenstein?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it depends if you want to watch a second one with Wilder and Kahn. Maybe go with Princess Bride."
