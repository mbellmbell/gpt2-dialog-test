"__COMEDY__ Best comedy movie to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars?"
"__COMEDY__ There aren't that many.  Comedies are mostly ignored by the Academy."
"__COMEDY__ Why?"
"__COMEDY__ I guess they figure making people laugh is easy and doesn't deserve recognition.  But if you make them cry while some kid stands up to a bully while dancing ballet and being raised by a single mother in World War II.. then you've accomplished something."
"__COMEDY__ Tootsie is really funny and it got nominated for Best Picture."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah but it didn't win."
"__COMEDY__ A lot of good movies don't win, not just comedy movies."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah but they're usually better than the ones who do."
"__COMEDY__ Do you think we'll ever see a Will Ferrell movie or Jim Carrey movie get nominated for Best Picture?"
"__COMEDY__ Hahahahaha, not a chance"
