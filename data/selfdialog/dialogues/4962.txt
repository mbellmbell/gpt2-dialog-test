"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you watched the latest Fast and Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes I have. Actually I only watched the first one and the last one, that is until Vin Diesel decided to make another one haha."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you like it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I liked it. It was pretty good. I like Vin Diesel turning kinda bad in some parts of the movies, but I don't want to give away the ending if you haven't watched it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Any good car chases?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Obviously! There were a few. One was where they were going through downtown and ended up in a stand off and another big finale was towards the end of the movie. It was a bit over the top though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I also like Ludacris' character, he adds comedy to the movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think they all did. I loved the love and hate relationship between The Rock and Jason Statham."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah the tough guys good guys thing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think they're all a good team."
