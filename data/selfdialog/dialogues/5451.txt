"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the new Disney star wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was OK I guess, but not as good as the hype."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really I thought it was awesome, what didn't you like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it was basically a retelling of the first movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think it was a reboot, there were new characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe not a reboot per se, but a re-marketing to a new generation of fans."
"__STAR_WARS__ There was a bit of marketing overload for it I guess."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the older characters just seemed shoehorned into the story."
"__STAR_WARS__ The effects were still awesome though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah and Rey was a good character, hopefully the next one is better."
