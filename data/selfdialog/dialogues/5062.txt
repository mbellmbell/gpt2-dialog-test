"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen the newest Fast & Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No. I thought that the trailer made it look really silly."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What makes you say that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I just find it silly that it evolved from street racing to basically vehicular warfare."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Okay, well that does sound pretty silly."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ My point exactly. That's why I didn't watch the new one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh. Well, I watched it, and I definitely thought it was alright."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Was there anything too remarkable about it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It had great looking action scenes."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's about what I expected."
