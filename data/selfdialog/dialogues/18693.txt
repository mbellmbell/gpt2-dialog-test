"__MOVIES__ What;s the last good movie you saw?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the movie Logan about a week ago."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the movie about Wolverine from the Xmen?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, exactly."
"__MOVIES__ How was it? I heard it was not the typical Xmen movie."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't anything like the typical Xmen movie. It was alot more graphic and gruesome."
"__MOVIES__ Oh...I see.  Sounds like more of an adult Xmen movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, even though the only characters from Xmen were Professor X and Wolverine (Logan)."
"__MOVIES__ I might have to check it out.  The last good movie I saw was Star Wars Rogue One."
"__MOVIES__ I heard it was a good movie, even though it wasn't really part of the Star Wars Trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ Actually it was a story from the time shortly after Anakin becomes Darth Vader."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really a Star Wars fan, so alot of the characters and lingo is lost on me."
"__MOVIES__ Even if you not a Star Wars fan, you could still watch this movie and keep up without being too lost."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess I can relate, because when I saw Logan I went with my girlfriend who has never seen an Xmen film."
"__MOVIES__ Really? How did she like it?"
"__MOVIES__ She loved the movie.  She was able to follow along as if the movie had no ties to any of the characters being Xmen."
"__MOVIES__ That's how Rogue One was.  Films like that make people who are not familiar with a particular movie series, interested in seeing the old films."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess you're right.  I had never seen any of the Iron movies, until I started watching the Captain America films."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly what I'm talking about. Iron man, Captain America, The Avengers, and now Spiderman all tie into each other."
"__MOVIES__ You're right....I may have to go back and start viewing the old Star Wars movies"
