"__POP__ What's your favorite pop song that came out so far this year?"
"__POP__ Oh, my current favorite has to be Closer by the Chainsmokers."
"__POP__ I have heard that song so much lately, but haven't gotten tired of it yet somehow."
"__POP__ Me neither. I've also heard a good amount of Lady Gaga on the radio."
"__POP__ Really? I didn't think she had come out with any new songs lately."
"__POP__ That's true. They are some of her older songs like Paparazzi and Bad Romance."
"__POP__ Oh, I see. I like those. My favorite that came out this year is probably the new Coldplay song."
"__POP__ I haven't heard that one yet actually."
"__POP__ It's a good one. It's a good crossover between rock and pop."
"__POP__ Yeah, Coldplay is really good at that."
