"__MOVIES__ You know what else is gonna be a great movie about Russia?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. I do."
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ You first."
"__MOVIES__ Ok I think it will be a great movie to see how the Soviets collapsed."
"__MOVIES__ We already have a ton of movie about that. They're called documentaries."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I haven't seen any."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that doesn't surprise me."
"__MOVIES__ ok what's your idea?"
"__MOVIES__ Life and death of the last Tsar family."
"__MOVIES__ They already made that. It's called Romanov's."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I know, but I want it to be an English epic saga. Based on facts until the executions, every action recreated. And the burial and the finding of their bones in... when was that?"
"__MOVIES__ 2015. They found the bones belonging to the Alexei and Maria. Those were the missing bodies."
"__MOVIES__ That's just so sad."
"__MOVIES__ Even the Russian government tried to give them a proper burial, which they did in 1991. But they just couldn't find these two bodies."
"__MOVIES__ That's even sadder."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding."
"__MOVIES__ But in the end, all family members that's been murdered are buried together?"
"__MOVIES__ Um, i think so."
"__MOVIES__ We should go watch that movie. The Romanovs. It's in Russian. We have to read the subtitles. I love to read at the movies."
