"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a fan of the Buffalo Bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think their new coach will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think McDermott will really struggle this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he'll do better than Rex Ryan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's a better coach, but they still won't win much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I think that offense can be pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't have much faith in Tyrod Taylor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Taylor is pretty good. He doesn't turn the ball over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's because he doesn't take any risks even if he needs to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. Atleast you have LeSean Mccoy to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Mccoy carries the offensive load. If he gets hurt the season is done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Injuries always seem to mess up a bunch of teams every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well football is a pretty rough game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know what teams will do if the NFL adds more games to the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're already allowed very little practice time. The quality of the games would get worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL really needs a farm league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. It would really help the talent level grow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Young quarterbacks would really benefit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know how much it would have helped the Bills. They always seem to pick terrible quarterbacks."
