"__DISNEY__ Did you hear that The Lion King is playing in theaters for it's 20th anniversary?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but that's sounds really cool! I loved The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. When Simba meets Timon and Pumba is probably my most favorite part of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. Hakuna Matata!"
"__DISNEY__ And then I'll never forget the sad part when Scar says to Mufasa, 'Long live the king.'"
"__DISNEY__ Of course, who could forget that?"
"__DISNEY__ It's a masterpiece. I'm going to go see it next week."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think I'll go see it, too."
"__DISNEY__ Do you want to go together?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, absolutely. Hakuna Matata!"
