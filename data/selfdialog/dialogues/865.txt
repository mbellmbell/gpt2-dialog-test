"__MUSIC__ Have you heard that the Gaslight Anthem went on hiatus?"

"__MUSIC__ I agree, that one was probably their best work."
"__MUSIC__ Did you see that Pearl Jam was inducted in the rock and roll hall of fame?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they deserve it, they have so many good albums."
"__MUSIC__ Right? And they have been together for almost 30 years."
"__MUSIC__ I know and the music that they are still putting out is still good."
"__MUSIC__ Did you see that Gene Simmons is trying to trademark the devil horns sign?"

"__MUSIC__ Yea, he is a lunatic."
"__MUSIC__ And kiss makes terrible music."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, it is so generic and underwhelming."
"__MUSIC__ And their fans are insane."
"__MUSIC__ I hope that he loses his claim and it costs him a lot of money."
