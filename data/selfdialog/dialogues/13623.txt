"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to get season tickets for the Bengals this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I don't think they are going to do that well this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, they lack the depth ofr roster I am looking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will be watching how the Raiders do moving down to Las Vegas then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I wonder how the season tickets there must be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From what I heard they are pretty reasonable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Raiders will do well being in the new stadium?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I'm sure that will affect them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but that might get them more exciting to turn things around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The fans also will be some of the same but many new ones, so they ought to play well to get those new fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really need to be looking for a franchise player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah,  I can't remember the last Raider franchise player since Charles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Teams like the Colts, or the Giants, or the Patriots have just had such consistency in their franchise players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, they have had the chance to build the team around those guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe Oakland could get it through a trade, but really they just need to have another good draft year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't remember who they got the past few years, but that probably tells you something about the quality."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the drafts have not been too good recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping there will be some more star players to begin replacing some of the older guys in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally agree, I feel like we have had Brady, Manning and Roethlisberger for forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe this will be the year when the younger talents pick up the torch."
