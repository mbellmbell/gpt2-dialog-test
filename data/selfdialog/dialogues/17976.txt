"__MOVIES__ Did you hear that they're going to make a bunch of 'Avatar' sequels?"
"__MOVIES__ That's really exciting."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I really loved the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, though the plot was literally the same as 'Pocahontos.'"
"__MOVIES__ True, but nearly every movie is like every other movie that's been made."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you mention Pocahontos.  But that was also basically 'Dances with Wolves' and 'Last Samurai.'"
"__MOVIES__ Good point."
"__MOVIES__ I also think that since film is a visual medium, something as beautiful as 'Avatar' is to be admired.  Even if it wasn't that original, plotwise."
"__MOVIES__ I could agree with that. Like I said, I still really liked that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It blew my mind the first time I saw it in IMAX 3D."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it in IMAX 3D as well.  It's the only movie I ever paid extra to see it in."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder where they'll take the sequels though."
"__MOVIES__ I guess the world Cameron created is so vast that they can keep exploring the rest of Pandora."
"__MOVIES__ But who will be the villain this time?  Other tribes in Pandora, or will Earth people come back?"
"__MOVIES__ My money is on the Earth people, but I hope I'm surprised with an antagonist that is completely different."
"__MOVIES__ That would be cool.  Though I'll definitely miss Scott Lang as the villain from the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he was the best.  Plays an excellent villain."
"__MOVIES__ I sort of wish Scott Lang plays Cable in the next Deadpool movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  That would be incredible."
