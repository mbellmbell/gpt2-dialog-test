"__MOVIES__ Hey do you know what my favorite movie is?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is is that one with the guy who flies the F-16 around?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Iron Eagle!"
"__MOVIES__ What ever happened to that guy, what was his name? Jason Gedrick?"
"__MOVIES__ He went on to do a bunch of TV shows like Dexter and Bosch."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I thought he died."
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm pretty sure he's alive."
"__MOVIES__ So back to Iron Eagle, who was the black guy in it? Morgan Freeman?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that was Louis Gossett Junior."
"__MOVIES__ Are you sure? I thought it was Morgan Freeman."
"__MOVIES__ No, Louis Gossett Junior is the guy with the shaved head."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is he still alive?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah as far as I know."
"__MOVIES__ So was anyone else famous in Iron Eagle?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm pretty sure no one else in the cast really went on to be a big star."
"__MOVIES__ Didnt they make a bunch of sequels?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it got a little out of hand, they made like 3 more after that."
"__MOVIES__ That's more than a little out of hand, that is just unnecessary."
"__MOVIES__ The last one was the worst, it even had the guy who married Tori Spelling in it."
"__MOVIES__ Dean McDermott? Wow, it must have been a disaster."
