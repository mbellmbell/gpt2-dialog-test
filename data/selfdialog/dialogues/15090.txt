"__ACTION__ So, Mark, what's the best action movie of all time?"
"__ACTION__ Easy, it's Gladiator. Great hero, great effects, exciting action."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, great effects, those digital animals in the arena were  amazing! But I preferred those Bruce Willis ones."
"__ACTION__ You mean all those Die Hard movies. He's gonna be making one when he dies."
"__ACTION__ And I'm going to be watching that one when I die."
"__ACTION__ Don't you think he's kind of old for an action hero?"
"__ACTION__ Tom Cruise is too short for an action star, Danny DeVito is too ugly, and Jason Statham is too bad at acting. So what?"
"__ACTION__ Jason Statham is an excellent actor. Did you see his movie War? It's epic."
"__ACTION__ Nah, I never saw it."
"__ACTION__ Well, hey, I've got it right here. Let's watch it."
