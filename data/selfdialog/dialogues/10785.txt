"__FASHION__ It's so hard to choose the right wedding dress."
"__FASHION__ Yes it is. A bride wants to look stylish,  but she knows her children will be looking at those pictures in twenty years."
"__FASHION__ Yes. She wants to look appropriate now, and later too."
"__FASHION__ At the same time, she doesn't want to wear something bland and boring."
"__FASHION__ But she doesn't want the aunties to gossip about her outrageous dress, either."
"__FASHION__ It's a question of balance."
"__FASHION__ You're right! Don't show too much skin, but don't cover up like a nun, either."
"__FASHION__ Don't wear too much sparkle, but wear a little something that makes it all pop."
"__FASHION__ Make your mother happy, but please the groom, too."
"__FASHION__ Oh, and the bridesmaids. Choose something for them that they can wear again, somewhere, somehow."
"__FASHION__ Maybe something bright, instead of those dull pastels."
"__FASHION__ I went to a wedding where the bridesmaids wore black."
"__FASHION__ I bet that caused talk."
"__FASHION__ It did, but everybody I heard seemed to  approve. They wore elegant, summery, black dreses."
"__FASHION__ And I bet the contrast helped the bride stand out, too."
"__FASHION__ Yes. She looked just gorgeous."
"__FASHION__ Sounds lovely. I saw some print bridesmaid dresses in a magazine."
"__FASHION__ Ooh. That sounds a little distracting."
"__FASHION__ I thought so too. People would be looking at  the bridesmaids insteead of the bride."
"__FASHION__ No fun for the bride, I guess."
