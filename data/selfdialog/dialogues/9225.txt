"__BASEBALL__ So you're going to be on my new baseball team, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. When are practices?"
"__BASEBALL__ Saturdays at ten A.M."
"__BASEBALL__ I will definitely be there and if you want we can meet on other days to practice. My pitching is a big rusty."
"__BASEBALL__ That's an area I'm great in so I will help you with it."
"__BASEBALL__ Thanks. I want to be able to pitch really well."
"__BASEBALL__ You already bat well and you are a good catcher also."
"__BASEBALL__ Right so if I can learn to pitch I'll be a triple threat."
"__BASEBALL__ You will indeed."
"__BASEBALL__ I've never been as good at pitching, though."
"__BASEBALL__ You weren't bad in school."
"__BASEBALL__ No, but I wasn't great either."
"__BASEBALL__ We'll get you there."
"__BASEBALL__ I appreciate that. I'm sure if anyone can you can."
"__BASEBALL__ I helped Cam get a lot better when we used to practice."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, Cam is great now. That was ouy helping him?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was. We used to practice a lot."
"__BASEBALL__ Well if you can get me as good as him I'll consider you a miracle worker."
"__BASEBALL__ Cam plays for the Stars now."
"__BASEBALL__ Hopefully we don't play against them."
