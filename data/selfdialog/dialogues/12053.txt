"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey the NFL preseason is coming up!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, when is the Hall of Fame Game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thursday August 3rd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is playing in it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cardinals and Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The should be a good one. Who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite team is the Chicago Bears even if they are terrible. You?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite team is the Detroit Lions so I understand what you mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you guys have a chance of making the playoffs again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but we never win. At least you guys have a Superbowl win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but it was over 30 years ago. No recent success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's better than no success at all!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, who do you think will win it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Falcons win in a redemption story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I don't know if they'll make it again. The NFC is always competitive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I think they'll be motivated from last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots could repeat, or maybe the Packers if they get a better defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't stand the Packers and I bet you can't either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, that's something we can both agree on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they always win the division."
