"__THRILLER__ So, have you seen any thriller movies lately?"
"__THRILLER__ Not lately, but I really liked Taking Lives with Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that was a good one as I remember."
"__THRILLER__ It had a complex plot and everything.  I remember I screamed when Angelina Jolie laid down on his bed and he grabbed at her from beneath and his arms went around her."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that was creepy..."
"__THRILLER__ And it didn't even fit into the plot that much!  I mean, what did that have to do with anything?  It was just from out of nowhere."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it's like they did it just to startle you."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it was funny how I screamed and everything."
"__THRILLER__ Did you see it with anyone else?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, my parents went to see it, but my stepfather left near the beginning, when he killed that first guy."
