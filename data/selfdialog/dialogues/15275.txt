"__HARRY_POTTER__ So who were your favorite casting choices in the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, Daniel Radcliffe was perfect for Harry. I also think Emma Watson nailed Hermione's character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How about Alan Rickman?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he played a wonderful Snape. Not quite how I pictured him from the books, but he played the part so well that it didn't matter."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Luna was good, too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, for sure! I don't remember the actress's name, but she did really well as a character that was both dreamy and fiercely intelligent."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Don't forget about Professor McGonagall."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course! Maggie Smith was perfect!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also thought the Malfoys were portrayed really well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I totally agree."
