"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which of the Harry Potter movies was your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know I really liked the Prisoner of Azkaban. That movie and book marked a poignant time in the characters direction."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it definitely took a turn for the dark. I kind of think as far as the movies, the first was really good."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was. The special effects were amazing. I really enjoyed seeing everything I imagine happening before me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ the special effects kept getting better and better I thought."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought so too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ My only question is that when they could do all these things and it look so good. Why did Voldemort look so lame?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know right? He is not what I imagined either."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ If they can put a dead guys face on someone else...."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know! And they've done it several times! I think they missed the mark on that one."
