"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know which 2 players have caught, rushed, and thrown a touchdown against the same team in the same game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Walter Payton in 1979 and David Patton in 2001. It's pretty incredible! Only 2!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep! It's weird to think that football games usually last around 3 hours, the ball is typically in play for only 11 minutes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. That means the game on TV is devoted mostly to replays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ An NFL game is about 75 minutes, but about 60% of total TV air time, is spent on shots of players standing on the line of scrimmage, huddling, or just walking around between snaps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did not even notice that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, during broadcast NFL games, cheerleaders are on TV for only about 3 seconds. Coaches and referees receive around 7% of the face time in a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the 1930s, NFL game telecasts were just a constant feed of the field. Instant replay became commonplace in the mid-1960s, which helped fill the idle moments of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess with the new tech of TV things began to change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the perspective for fans could be altered."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's great I love getting those detailed plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ By the 1990s, some football broadcasts showed about 100 replays per game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm more aware when I watch that that is the case."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the replays for me it enhances the experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that and high def TVs. Oh and surround sound! It's like being on the field!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still there is nothing like actually being at the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I love being in the crowd and all that excitement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The stadiums are so high tech. There really aren't any bad seats to catch all those great plays!"
