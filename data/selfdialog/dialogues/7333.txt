"__LADY_GAGA__ Will Gaga ever top Bad Romance?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I though she would, I loved Judas and Born This Way"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me too but then she went and did all that jazz stuff"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes and her latest solo album was really slow and acoustic"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No dance music at all"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Maybe she's sick of it or never liked it"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw her at Coachella and she performed the old songs really well"
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's nice, maybe she'll go back to her roots"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I hope so"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me too but Million Reasons was sort of catchy"
