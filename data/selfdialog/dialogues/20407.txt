"__MOVIES__ What do you think of Finding Dory?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Nemo???"
"__MOVIES__ No. Finding Dory. The new one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I didn't know that had come out. What happens?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know how Dory has memory problems?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah"
"__MOVIES__ Well, she swims off looking for her family and gets lost."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought about Dory having a family."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so she swims all the way to California, and Marlin and Nemo follow her."
"__MOVIES__ Where do they go in California?"
"__MOVIES__ The Jewel of Moray Bay. It's a rescue and veterinary aquarium."
"__MOVIES__ Dory is an aquarium fish?"
"__MOVIES__ Sort of. She keeps having memories and finally she finds a tank of other fish like her. But none of them are her parents."
"__MOVIES__ Intense."
"__MOVIES__ She leaves feeling really dejected. And then, the fish steal a truck."
"__MOVIES__ Say what?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's an octopus and he drives a semi truck."
"__MOVIES__ AWesome! I'm definitely going to have to see that!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll let you figure out the ending when you go see it."
"__MOVIES__ Aw man. No fair!"
