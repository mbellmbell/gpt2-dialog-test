"__BEATLES__ I just read that paul mccartney didn't know he was on a rihanna song."
"__BEATLES__ What he was? Like a sample?"
"__BEATLES__ No his guitar playing was on her track."
"__BEATLES__ How does that happen?"
"__BEATLES__ Well I guess kanye west had reached out to work with paul. He was hesitant but did it."
"__BEATLES__ so how did he not know?"
"__BEATLES__ Well he was working with kanye separately.  Kanye speed up his guitar track so paul did not even realize at first it was him."
"__BEATLES__ Crazy, kanye seems sneaky."
"__BEATLES__ A bit.Paul did not even know Rihana was going to be involved at all."
"__BEATLES__ Well I had no clue he was on any song of hers. Different but interesting collaboration."
