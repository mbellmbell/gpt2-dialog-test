"__DISNEY__ So what was the weirdest Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh definitely Pinocchio."
"__DISNEY__ What's your case?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, Geppetto. Why does he want a real boy so terribly bad - that's a bid odd."
"__DISNEY__ Very true. What else."
"__DISNEY__ Well, the fact that a cricket was enlisted to be the conscience for the puppet."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, who ever came up with that?"
"__DISNEY__ Heh someone highly imaginative."
"__DISNEY__ Clearly. I'd say it was a good film though - one of the classics."
"__DISNEY__ No doubt. It just had some bizarre elements."
