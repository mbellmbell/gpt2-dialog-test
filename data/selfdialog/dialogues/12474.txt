"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you got for the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has to be the Patriots again, but I think the Packers will surge this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, do you think Rodgers can win another one?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely, he's got the arm, their team got better on defense during the offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw that, they could make a run, but not the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, who do you have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots as well, but I think the Falcons are good for the repeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know that never happens, repeats of Super Bowls..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but there is a first time for everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right, the Super Bowl went into Overtime for the first time ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was an incredible game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, except I was in Atlanta, and it was really depressing for the fanbase."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fortunately you are a Dolphins fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fortunately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think the Dolphins will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I say 9-10 wins, they could win the division, but they have to beat the Pats twice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That won't happen, you can't beat the at Gillette."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're probably right, but I think they are improved from last year, and they added new pieces."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well for your sake, I hope you are right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, all I want for Christmas is a Dolphin playoff game."
