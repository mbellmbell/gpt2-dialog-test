"__MOVIES__ Mom, I just saw The Beguiled. It's set in the South during the Civil War. It's Gothic and funny, and all about sex, really."
"__MOVIES__ You mean with Clint Eastwood? Did you see it on TCM?"
"__MOVIES__ No, mom, in the theater last Friday night. You're thinking of the old version. This one is Sofia Coppola's version."
"__MOVIES__ The Eastwood one was sexy, but morbid. This soldier hides at a girl's school, and the women all fight over him. Kind of depraved."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. This one's depraved too. But it doesn't take itself so seriously. It's like it knows it's a B movie."
"__MOVIES__ So it's not Eastwood, obviously. Who plays the man?"
"__MOVIES__ Colin Farrell. He's not as creepy as Estwood was, I bet. And he's sexy, too. And there are good women's parts."
"__MOVIES__ So it's not so much about how they all want him, and they turn bitter and strange about it?"
"__MOVIES__ It is, and they turn strange, but in a more modern and self-aware way. They have agency; they're not passive."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember them as real passive in the old one. There was a surgery scene that was rather hard to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they've still got that.  Plenty of sex too, and an unhappy ending."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the old one was plenty sexy. Maybe not so graphic, though."
"__MOVIES__ This one has sex. But it has love too, although that part doesn't really work out."
"__MOVIES__ I remember the women, they were so innocent. Yet they fought so viciously over him, I think."
"__MOVIES__ These women are collegial. They support one another. And yet--"
"__MOVIES__ Yet they still compete, don't they?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he's the only man. And he's a scarce commodity. And it's Colin Farrell."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think women still compete for men? Do you think it's a mistake?"
"__MOVIES__ .Yes. Life's about cooperating, mom, like you always said."
"__MOVIES__ I know. But this was just a movie."
