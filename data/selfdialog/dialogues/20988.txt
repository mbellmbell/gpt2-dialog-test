"__THRILLER__ Have you seen Batman Begins?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, Bale was the best Batman."
"__THRILLER__ Either that or he was just given the best plot."
"__THRILLER__ That too.  Raz Agul was a good bad guy and Liam Neisan was perfect to play him."
"__THRILLER__ I know right?  I like the realism that was brought to it too."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and almost the whole movie was genesis movie."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, not a quick few minutes in the start.  The whole thing was becoming Batman."
"__THRILLER__ That's what made it so good."
"__THRILLER__ Some of the lines too."
"__THRILLER__ Like Bruce Wayne 'does it come in black?'"
