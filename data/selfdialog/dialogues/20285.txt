"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie yeti?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I wanted to go this past weekend to see it but got busy and had no time."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet either an I will probably wait for the Blu Ray DVD to be released."
"__MOVIES__ I probably wait too.  What is your favorite super hero movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I have always liked the Superman movies.  You?"
"__MOVIES__ I just saw Civil War and it was absolutely Amazing."
"__MOVIES__ So is that your favorite one?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say yes but before I saw Civil War, I really liked The Batman movies."
"__MOVIES__ I really have never been a big fan of Batman and I don't know why."
"__MOVIES__ So you probably didn't care for Batman vs Superman?"
"__MOVIES__ You are correct because Batman beat Superman."
"__MOVIES__ I think that is why I liked it a lot."
"__MOVIES__ I imagine that is why the movie did not have rave reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Are you saying there are more Superman fans then Batman fans?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think a lot of people like both characters and didn't enjoy seeing them go against each other."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought of it that way but you are totally right."
"__MOVIES__ I have to admit though that I do like the bat mobile."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the  bat mobile is one cool mode of transportation."
"__MOVIES__ I love that Superman can fly and that he wears a cape."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely is a cool attribute that Superman has."
