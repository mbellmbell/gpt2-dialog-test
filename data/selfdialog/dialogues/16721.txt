"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of Adam Sandler?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I am. I've seen almost all of his movies, most of them multiple times."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Sandler film of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow that's a really hard choice, there's so many. I don't think I can choose just one."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, what would you say are the five best Sandler movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Let me see. In no order: Little Nicky, Big Daddy, Grown Ups, Jack and Jill, That's My Boy. And honorable mention goes to The Ridiculous Six."
"__MOVIES__ Jack and Jill? Is that the one where Adam Sandler plays a twin brother and sister?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's it. Have you seen it? It's hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it but I heard it's funny. What's the storyline?"
"__MOVIES__ The brother, Jack is a rich man and his twin sister, Jill, drives him out of his mind when she comes to visit him."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds really funny."
"__MOVIES__ Oh it is, every scene in that movie is funny. And Al Pacino is in it too!"
"__MOVIES__ No kidding? That sounds like a strange type of film for Pacino to be in."
"__MOVIES__ You'll think it's even stranger when I tell you Pacino falls in love with the female twin."
"__MOVIES__ Played by Adam Sandler? Oh wow, I think I have to see this movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you certainly do, if you're in the mood to laugh your face off!"
"__MOVIES__ I noticed you only mentioned one of Sandler's early movies, Big Daddy, in your top five."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I'm not too crazy about his really early films. It's mostly the later stuff that I think is hysterical."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like The Water Boy?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh come on, even you have to admit, that was terrible!"
