"__BASEBALL__ The Cubs play the Cardinals Friday, Saturday and Sunday."
"__BASEBALL__ Are you going to attend?"
"__BASEBALL__ I wish I were."
"__BASEBALL__ I have some extra tickets."
"__BASEBALL__ I would love to go, but I can't afford the tickets."
"__BASEBALL__ I will sell them to you half price."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I wouldn't  feel right about allowing you to do that."
"__BASEBALL__ Hey, we are good friends."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, but I just would not feel good about not paying full price."
"__BASEBALL__ I would love for you to go to the game with me.  I made some extra money this week and can afford to let you have them half price."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, that's so nice of you.  I will talk to Ray and see what he says."
"__BASEBALL__ It would be fun if you go; Mary is going too."
"__BASEBALL__ I will let you know tomorrow evening."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I sure hope you decide to go with me and Mary."
"__BASEBALL__ I know Ray would enjoy going to see the Cubs play."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, he would - he's been a Cub for a long time."
"__BASEBALL__ He sure has - 65 years..."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I sure hope you will go.  We will have a good time."
"__BASEBALL__ I talked to Ray and he said that we will go with you and Mary."
"__BASEBALL__ Great! Just what I was hoping to hear!  We will pick you guys up around 8 in the morning Friday."
