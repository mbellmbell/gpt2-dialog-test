"__BASKETBALL__ Who's better, LeBron or Jordan?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you kidding me?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What? That's a serious question."
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course the answer is Jordan. It's not even close."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not even close? That's not fair at all."
"__BASKETBALL__ What's so great about LeBron?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he's a better overall player."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's a better passer and he's a bigger guy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Right. He's more versatile than Jordan. Jordan was mainly a scorer."
"__BASKETBALL__ But that doesn't make him better. Jordan was a much better leader."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think a lot of the leadership on Jordan's teams came from Phil Jackson."
"__BASKETBALL__ Phil played a big part for sure. But Jordan was a major force as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ People often compare LeBron to Magic, but I don't think that's a good fit."
"__BASKETBALL__ I kind of agree with that. He's not quite Magic, and he's not quite Jordan."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he's something in between."
"__BASKETBALL__ One thing that always bothered me about LeBron was that he never entered the Dunk Contest."
"__BASKETBALL__ You know, I've always wondered about that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why did he never compete?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He said one time that he didn't want to take the spotlight away from other players in the contest."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think that sounds like a lame excuse."
