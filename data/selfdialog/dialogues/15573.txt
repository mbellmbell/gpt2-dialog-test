"__HARRY_POTTER__ Uh... because his parents do?"

"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, the whole point is that the Weasleys are known as the red-headed family."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess that's why they're recognized everywhere."

"__HARRY_POTTER__ Nah, their hair makes them who they are.  They like the attention."
