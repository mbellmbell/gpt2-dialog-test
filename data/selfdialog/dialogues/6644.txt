"__STAR_WARS__ You know whatelse is weird?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh God, now what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why does Kylo Ren have to wear a mask too?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because he's a gradnson of Darth Vader! And Darth Vader wears a mask"
"__STAR_WARS__ But we just said, Darth Vader's mask is wrong."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't say it's wrong. You said the reason for the mask is weird. And it's for the drama of the experience. it'd be weird if he didn't have a mask"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why, because he's a grandson of Darth Vader who wore the unneeded mask?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The mask is needed. The mask is necessary. It defines Darth Vader!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's the wrong and stupid definition, if you ask me. And the same goes for Klyo. He doesn't need the mask. He's just wearign it for no reason."
"__STAR_WARS__ The reason is that he's the grandson of Darth Vader! That's why he has to wear a mask! it defines them both!."
