"__DISNEY__ So did you see the Duck Tales movie from the 1990's?"
"__DISNEY__ I totally did. It was excellent."
"__DISNEY__ I watched it again recently. All I can say is: I want a money bin!"
"__DISNEY__ Ha! And are you going to swim in a sea of gold coins? I think that would hurt."
"__DISNEY__ It's totally doable. If Scrooge can do it, I can too."
"__DISNEY__ Did the nephews ever swim in the bin?"
"__DISNEY__ I can't recall. Huey, Dewey and Louie right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. I don't think Scrooge would let them near the money."
"__DISNEY__ No, he was pretty guarded with it."
"__DISNEY__ Well he's Scottish. He can't help it."
