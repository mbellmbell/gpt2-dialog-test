"__MUSIC__ 'Truly are You really into Bach that much?, I've heard that you are!'"
"__MUSIC__ 'No I mean it's OK, But a little heavy, I like mozart much better!."
"__MUSIC__ So what do you like?, Say fugue, minuette, Or simply period Music sic!....."
"__MUSIC__ I am mainly in interested in music flow, Or if you will sounds and stanzas as my belife is Music should tell a story!..."
"__MUSIC__ I'm very curious to know what do you think about Vocalists, Say Classic or Modern?....."
"__MUSIC__ Hah, 'Thats a bit complicated and I dont expect Caruso but I like a good tonal range with a bit of 'Verb' on High Notes!'."
"__MUSIC__ Still what about say other interests and especially so if vocalists? etc."
"__MUSIC__ 'That takes in a lot of teritory, See in classical I like instrumentals, yet in Modern Music I prefer Volcalists!."
"__MUSIC__ 'Thats great but do you like blends, Or Tonal Shades or recent trends in Electronic Sounds and music!'."
"__MUSIC__ No I mean I like light operetta it's fun, But Merle Haggard is fun too especially the way he carries 'low notes'!."
"__MUSIC__ 'Wow great point and this conversation is really interesting, But isnt Opera and Operetta really dated?."
"__MUSIC__ 'Not really it depends on the Music, Sure in that light 'The Beatles' are really dated too, But some of their songs are neat!."
"__MUSIC__ Sure I mean 12th Century Gregorian Chants were neat too but today except to Historians they are very dated!."
"__MUSIC__ 'Yet but look at modern 'Rap Preformers, where they just belt out words, Remember that too is a type of Chant or Story!'."
"__MUSIC__ Ture and yes I agree there is type of connection tho the meanings are vague, So can you explain?."
"__MUSIC__ 'Surly,' 'As in what ever period Music is both to entertain, But also to send a message or a vocal way to send a Message!....."
"__MUSIC__ 'Then what are you feelings about instruments either String, Wind or even Electronic?'."
"__MUSIC__ Instruments help set up the mood to make the story easier to tell,Plus some like Guitars are both String and Electronic!..."
"__MUSIC__ 'Can you sum up or explain Music to every one, Or whats it all about!."
"__MUSIC__ 'A Good Piece has something for everyone, It's meant to relay a message, But also a feeling like Love Story did it's neat!....."
