"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey there, are you going to watch any NFL games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'll probably tune into a few."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, cool man. What's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah? Are you from the Atlanta area?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I grew up there, but now I live in Detroit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, so do you like the Lions too? They had a decent season last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I root for them too, I like Matt Stafford."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he's a pretty good quarterback. Who are some of your other favorite players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Matt Ryan, and Julio Jones. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I like those guys too. But my favorite player is probably Marshawn Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Beast Mode. Yeah you must be excited that he came out of retirement to play this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure man. It will be weird seeing him playing for the Raiders though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's his hometown though right? Oakland?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think that's why he came out of retirement, to play for his home team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, thats cool, we will see how the Raiders do this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if they will do that well. They are in a tough division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the Chiefs, and Broncos and who else are in that division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chargers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah that's right. They didn't do too well last year."
