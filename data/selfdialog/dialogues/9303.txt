"__BASEBALL__ Who's the best pitcher in the league right now?"
"__BASEBALL__ Kershaw. He's the greatest pitcher of our generation."
"__BASEBALL__ What about Scherzer?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's in the top 5, but Kershaw is in a league of his own."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. He's worth 10 wins per season by himself."
"__BASEBALL__ The only fault against him is injuries."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, but long term I think his arm and delivery are made to hold up late into his career."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he's not really a power pitcher who relies on velocity."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he's more valuable than Trout?"
"__BASEBALL__ A think a pitcher normally is, and I'd take Kershaw over any other hitter in the league, but not Trout."
"__BASEBALL__ Trout has to be the most valuable player in baseball"
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. Mostly because of his age and the fact that he's not even peaked yet."
"__BASEBALL__ He could go on another 12 years doing what he's doing."
"__BASEBALL__ So you'd take Kershaw over Bryce Harper?"
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely. Harper is inconsistent and susceptible to injuries."
"__BASEBALL__ After Harper's terrible season in 2016, I don't know if I could trust him on a 7-10 year contract."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it's like he turns it on when he wants to."
"__BASEBALL__ With Trout, you know what production you're getting every year."
"__BASEBALL__ So the top two players in the game are Trout and Kershaw."
"__BASEBALL__ They're the most valuable right now."
