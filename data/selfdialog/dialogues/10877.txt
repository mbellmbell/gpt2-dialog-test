"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the most underrated head coach in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As far as current coaches go, I think Marvin Lewis deserves credit for taking the Bengals to the playoffs several years running"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but they haven't won a playoff game in something like two decades"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That may be, but plenty of teams people consider better than the Bengals consistently miss the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ John Fox led the Broncos to the playoffs several times only to get fired a few years back"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, and I sometimes wonder if the Bengals will do the same thing to Marvin Lewis some day"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It worked for the Broncos when they brought in Gary Kubiak, so you may be right"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think Marvin Lewis is a good coach and would land on his feet somewhere else if that happened"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely, since Kubiak coached an unsuccessful Houston Texans a couple of years before going to the Broncos"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can we really attribute their success to the coach, or is it more the players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's hard to tell, and I think you can really only give credit to clearly exemplary coaches like Bill Belichick"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Belichick will probably go down as the best coach in NFL history, so it's hard to make comparisons"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else do you think deserves recognition as a head coach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bruce Arians' Cardinals have been struggling the last couple of years, but they came awfully close to their goal a couple seasons back"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Arians won coach of the year recently, too, didn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he did, and for someone who was virtually run out of Pittsburgh I'd say that's quite the accomplishment"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But does that offer him job security moving forward?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will for a while, but if the Cardinals don't make it to the Superbowl in the next couple of seasons, he may end up on the chopping block"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that doesn't bode well for Marvin Lewis if his Bengals can't even win a playoff game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not, but the NFL community works in mysterious ways, so I guess we'll see"
