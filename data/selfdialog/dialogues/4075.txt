"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any good albums lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I am not sure. I think Adele's 25 is the newest album I have been listening to."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, really? Didn't that come out a couple of years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it is so good. I can't stop listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Adele is pretty amazing. I have only heard a few songs of the new album, though."
"__MUSIC__ Really? You have to listen to more of it them."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I will!"
"__MUSIC__ You can borrow my CD if you want."
"__MUSIC__ Are you sure? You said it is all you listen to!"
"__MUSIC__ It's fine! I have them downloaded."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, awesome. Thanks."
"__MUSIC__ No problem!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't really listened to them much."
"__MUSIC__ I like them a lot! They are probably my favorite band."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that! I'll give them a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. You may not like them, though."
"__MUSIC__ Why wouldn't I?"
"__MUSIC__ They are just kind of particular. Pretty funky."
"__MUSIC__ Well I will give them a try anyways!"
