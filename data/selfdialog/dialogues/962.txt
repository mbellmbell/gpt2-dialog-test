"__MUSIC__ Do you like rap?"
"__MUSIC__ Some.  It's not my favorite, but there are quite a few songs I like."
"__MUSIC__ Who are your favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ You might say I like older stuff-- like Wu Tang and Tupac.  What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I like some newer stuff, like Jay-Z and Big Sean, and Kanye."
"__MUSIC__ You like Yezzi?"
"__MUSIC__ Just because he's crazy doesn't mean he's not a brilliant artist."
"__MUSIC__ True. Do you like any old school rap?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really.  The rhymes sound corny, and the beats are super cheesy."
"__MUSIC__ I think rap is probably the fastest evolving form of music.  Today's sound is so different from even 5 years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and stuff from the 90s sounds ancient by those standards."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Eminem?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably the most overrated rapper out there."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with that-- his rhymes are good, but his voice is so whiny.  He should just write songs."
"__MUSIC__ Who is your personal favorite rapper?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say Method Man.  Not only do I like his voice and his music, he seems like a really cool guy."
"__MUSIC__ He's a member of Wu Tang Clan right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but my favorite stuff of his was when he worked with Redman."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Redman?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like them both a lot individually, but I think their best stuff is when they work together."
