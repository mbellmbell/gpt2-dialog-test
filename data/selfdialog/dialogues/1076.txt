"__MUSIC__ I was upset when I heard that The Civil wars had broken up."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, so was I. They were one of my favorite bands."
"__MUSIC__ I still listen to so many of their songs. They're timeless."
"__MUSIC__ Likewise, and I think it was such a pity they broke up in 2014."
"__MUSIC__ Their collaboration with Taylor Swift on the Hunger Games soundtrack was sublime."
"__MUSIC__ Goodness, yes. Safe & Sound is such a haunting, unique track."
"__MUSIC__ And who can ever forget Dust to Dust?"
"__MUSIC__ It's another one of their hauntingly beautiful ballads that I could listen to forever."
"__MUSIC__ There are other amazing songs of theirs too that I love, like Poison & Wine."
"__MUSIC__ And also the joyous From This Valley."
"__MUSIC__ They enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top and won four Grammies."
"__MUSIC__ And then they decided to part ways. Whatever happened?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure, but they cited 'internal discord' and 'irreconcilable differences'."
"__MUSIC__ Strange how two people can be so close and make such amazing music and then break up."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they used to have such a positive energy and spark about them."
"__MUSIC__ Now, they can barely stand to speak to each other."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they will ever get back together?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. But for the fans' sake I hope so."
"__MUSIC__ I can't help feeling The Civil Wars aren't about to release a new album anytime soon."
"__MUSIC__ Alas, I would have to agree with you on that."
