"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for another grand season of football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as the Patriots don't win again of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it. They look even better than last year, which is bothersome and scary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems futile to even sit there and hope they do bad. I don't think it's possible until Brady's gone. If he ever leaves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think anyone in the AFC can knock them off?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like to believe that everyone in the AFC West, but the Chargers could do such."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos have definitely had Brady's number very time he plays them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He still won against them last season, but that was mostly because poor QB play by the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as you have a defense like the Broncos you can definitely keep up with Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a matter of being proficient and effective in your drives."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just have 3 or 4 good drives including redzone scores and honestly you can beat them with a Broncos-like defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The problem is the Pats defense has random bouts of greatness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's weird. They had like the 25th best defense, but still won in that comeback victory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were getting torched yet for the last quarter and a half shut Matt Ryan out with ease."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just thinking about that Falcons' choke in the SuperBowl is so depressing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a majority of the country outside of Massachusetts felt that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They literally just needed one touchdown and history would have been declined."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose that is what makes them so grace"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There really is no denying Brady is the best ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate to agree with such, but I have to agree."
