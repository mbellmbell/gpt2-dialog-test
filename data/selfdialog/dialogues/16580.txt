"__MOVIES__ How many movies have you seen in theaters in the last year?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe two, three."
"__MOVIES__ That's it?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't like movie theaters. Much prefer DVD or streaming."
"__MOVIES__ Why? Movies are so much better on the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ I've got a big screen at home and no crowds."
"__MOVIES__ The crowds are part of the experience. The ooh'ing and the ahh'ing with each twist and turn."
"__MOVIES__ The popcorn-covered floors. The woman with the big hat sitting right in front of me. Her six foot three date, sitting right in front of my wife."
"__MOVIES__ It isn't that bad!"
"__MOVIES__ And then there's the tickets. Twelve dollars a pop. And don't even get me started if the movie needs to be seen in 3D or Imax."
"__MOVIES__ Don't tell me you hate Imax."
"__MOVIES__ No, of course not. IMAX is great. I love watching movies in IMAX. I just don't like waiting in line only to pay twenty dollars a piece for a ticket."
"__MOVIES__ But, to be surrounded by the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is great! But isn't worth twenty dollars."
"__MOVIES__ Geez, isn't there anything you like about movies."
"__MOVIES__ I love movies. My wife and I have a huge collection of movies at home."
"__MOVIES__ But you never go to theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ Very rarely. Why bother?"
"__MOVIES__ LIke I said, for the experience."
"__MOVIES__ Pay twenty bucks for dirty floors, uncomfortable seats and so some stranger can spoil it for me. No thanks."
