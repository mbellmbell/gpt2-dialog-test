"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe the NFL season is just two months away ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I can't wait"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How's your team look this year ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Cowboy fan , and I think we win it all this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys look good , but I am a Viking fan and I think we might have something to say about who gets to Minneapolis"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right, the Super bowl is in Minnesota this year isn't it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and that makes it the perfect year for the Vikings to return to the Super bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How long has it been?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Forty years !"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a long dry spell, but I'm afraid it doesn't end this year because the Cowboys will be there"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think makes it from the AFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably New England again. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Pittsburgh is the team to beat and would make a good opponent for the Vikings"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean for the Cowboys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, it's pretty wide open in the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Falcons and Packers should both be tough again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Saints could be unstoppable if AP comes back to form"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really a lot of teams have a decent shot"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I hope it ends up with the Vikings and Cowboys in the NFC championship, and it easily could."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If it does, it's big bet time for you and me."
