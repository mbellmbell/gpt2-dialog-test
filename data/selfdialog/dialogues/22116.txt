"__DISNEY__ So I saw Cars 3 today?"
"__DISNEY__ And?"
"__DISNEY__ I can't figure out why they keep making these things."
"__DISNEY__ Boys seem to like them more."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but they just don't have the magic of the other Pixar films"
"__DISNEY__ That's true, but at least it was better than Cars 2."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that was horrible.  Probably worst Pixar movie ever."
"__DISNEY__ With the exception of Up."
"__DISNEY__ Up?  You're crazy!"
"__DISNEY__ Nope, just opinionated!"
