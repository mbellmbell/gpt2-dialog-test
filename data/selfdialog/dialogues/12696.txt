"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know where they are gonna have next super bowl at?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no clue. Not like my team is gonna be there..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Miami dolphins. They aren't so hot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They aren't that bad either. Besides things can change with the draft..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know, but they haven't been good for some years now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm still a Giants fan and I really am rooting for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, they may have a chance though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. Another team I like is the Titans. I used to live in Nashville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, they surprised us last season! They were good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I love it when a young team like that do so well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, they are kind of an under dog."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mariota is pretty impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is he recovered from his leg injury?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I forgot about that. I would think so. He had a lot of time to recover..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ...and he is young and healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I have high hopes for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better than the Dolphins? haha..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better than the Browns, Duh!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's mean! Hahaha, but so true!"
