"__MOVIES__ I saw the new Transformers movie last night."
"__MOVIES__ I heard it was a box office dud this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ It didn't do as well as they had hoped."
"__MOVIES__ Probably because they're simply not very good movies."
"__MOVIES__ That outstanding, it was a pretty bad flick."
"__MOVIES__ I'm shocked.  Not really of course."
"__MOVIES__ Your sarcasm is noted."
"__MOVIES__ What was the worst part of it."
"__MOVIES__ For this one, like most of them, is the action."
"__MOVIES__ Usually people like the action the best in these movies."
"__MOVIES__ But it's so repetitive.  Metal crashing, loud sounds."
"__MOVIES__ Buildings getting wrecked, unnecessary explosions."
"__MOVIES__ Michael Bay 101."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's what the man is known for."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't help that the human characters don't have much to them."
"__MOVIES__ They've never really been known as thought provoking."
"__MOVIES__ They just serve as a background so the real stars can take flight in the robots themselves."
"__MOVIES__ That aside, how were the visual effects?"
"__MOVIES__ Quite good.  They always are in these movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's why they're so expensive to make!"
