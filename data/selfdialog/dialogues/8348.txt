"__POP__ Hey what's your favorite pop band?"
"__POP__ My favorite pop artist probably is Tove Lo."
"__POP__ Oh yeah, isnt she from Norway?"
"__POP__ No she's from Sweden!"
"__POP__ I thought she was from Norway, maybe you are right."
"__POP__ Her English is pretty good - its hard to tell its not her native language when she's singing."
"__POP__ Yeah that's true, I dont think I would have known had I not read about it online."
"__POP__ My favorite song of hers recently is My Gun."
"__POP__ Oh that's her? I heard that on the radio the other day."
"__POP__ Yeah, I heard she records a lot of her music on her phone when she's on tour and so that's how she's so prolific."
