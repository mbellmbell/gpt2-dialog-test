"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Malinda Kathleen Reece?"
"__MUSIC__ Not that I know of, who is that?"

"__MUSIC__ It was a mess, and really funny."
"__MUSIC__ I think I saw that video."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Malinda Kathleen Reece is the person behind the channel."
"__MUSIC__ She goes by her full name?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's not unusual."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is. It's really, really weird."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, she has her own YouTube channel."
"__MUSIC__ Is it all just Google Translate over and over and over and over and"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, okay, I get it. But yeah, each one is pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ How's that get funded? Seems like shooting videos independently is expensive."
