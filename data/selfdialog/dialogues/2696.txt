"__MUSIC__ Hey! You are the midnight piano player - I never knew you played!"
"__MUSIC__ Hey, haha, I guess it never came up."
"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite composer?"
"__MUSIC__ Umm, I like Debussy. His music is just like an aether through which you glide in reverie."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not too familiar with Debussy..."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know the impressionist movement?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but do you like Liszt?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Liszt, and he has certainly found a formula for orgasmic music, but he is a bit predictable."
"__MUSIC__ What about Bach?"
"__MUSIC__ I really don't like Bach. If you had to describe it, I would say Bach is very geometrical."
"__MUSIC__ And Vivaldi?"
"__MUSIC__ They're both very predictable. I don't really like Baroque period music at all."
"__MUSIC__ More of a romanticist?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think Rachmaninoff is wonderful."
"__MUSIC__ But you play Beethoven so well!"
"__MUSIC__ Thank you, I like the angst in Beethoven's music, but his chords are predictable as well."
"__MUSIC__ Everyone has a signature set of chord progressions?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I haven't really studied any music theory formally, but you can tell there are patterns - you see certain intervals over and over again."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever thought of being a professional musician?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I have, in high school, I practiced for four hours a day because I thought I would be a musician."
