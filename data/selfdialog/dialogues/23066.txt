"__DISNEY__ No, what happened."
"__DISNEY__ Well, we went to the drive inn.  I was 9 and my brother was 7."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds like fun, love Drive Ins"
"__DISNEY__ So me and my brother were on top of the station wagon and I noticed he was gone."
"__DISNEY__ Where did he go?"
"__DISNEY__ So, I get down and hear crying."
"__DISNEY__ Did he fall?"
