"__MOVIES__ Oscar Winner, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, but not Natural Born Killers."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. But you can't deny, Sizemore was the bomb in that."

"__MOVIES__ What about JFK."
"__MOVIES__ I love it, but I saw it the other day. John Candy gives the preformence of a life time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It's so good, I'm willing to believe Kennedy was killed by helicopter salesmen."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, that's the conclusion that Kevin Costner came to, isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. A compelling argument, nonetheless."
"__MOVIES__ What else you got?"
"__MOVIES__ Born on the Fourth of July?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That's perfect."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he really made some class movies back in the day."
"__MOVIES__ Shame he's so terrible now."
