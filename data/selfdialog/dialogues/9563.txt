"__COMEDY__ I'm planning to stream some comedies this weekend, got any recommendations?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes! Watch 'Popstar'!"
"__COMEDY__ Oh, the one with the Lonely Island Boys? I think they're hilarious!"
"__COMEDY__ Not exactly the Lonely Island Boys. Similar concept, but Andy Samberg plays this silly, vain popstar and he has sidekicks, which are the other two guys in Lonely Island."
"__COMEDY__ Sounds funny. So there are a lot of songs too?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, the songs are hilarious! I was crying."
"__COMEDY__ They're that funny? Were there any cameos?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, tons, like Ringo Starr, Pink, Usher. It's sort of like a mockumentary."
"__COMEDY__ I love mockumentaries, like 'Waiting for Guffman' and all of Christopher Guest's movies."
"__COMEDY__ I do too -- my favorite of his is 'Best in Show.' So funny!"
