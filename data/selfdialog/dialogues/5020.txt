"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you think that Dom's car is better than Brians in The original Fast& Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Are you talking about in the end when they are racing"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes Dom has a classic car and Brian has a Japanese car"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think on a straightaway Dom's car wins hands down"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why do you think that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ American Muscle had a ton of horsepower, Brians car would win with a lot of curves but that's the only way"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Brian's car had NOS though which should have accounted for extra speed"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Plus don't forget Dom has been racing his entire life so he could have gotten every bit of speed out of his car"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah I see your point"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Best case scenario they tied"
