"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Radiohead?"
"__MUSIC__ They are one of those bands that I can't decide on."
"__MUSIC__ That's odd, what do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well sometimes I hear a song by them and I like it, then other songs I'm not too thrilled by."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm I wonder what the common element you are not liking is."
"__MUSIC__ Well for one thing I'm not a fan of the singing."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, well yes I could see that being a problem."
"__MUSIC__ But then I quite like some of their music. I really like Jonny Greenwood's film music as well."
"__MUSIC__ But if you are not a fan of the singing then they are never going to be a band that you love."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose that's true, all my friends are Smiths fans but I could never stand Morrissey's voice."
"__MUSIC__ I'm the same way with The Doors, the music can be great but then he starts crooning his terrible lyrics and I have to switch it off."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! That was the only film I ever walked out of the cinema during, the Oliver Stone one."
"__MUSIC__ Luckily I've never seen that. Then again there are singers that I'm not fond of but I got used to over the years."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I can't imagine putting myself through that, sounds too much like homework."
"__MUSIC__ Well you just adjust your ears over time. For example I couldn't stand Bjork when I first heard her."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I get that, I enjoyed The Sugarcubes but I've found most of her solo stuff impenetrable.."
"__MUSIC__ You should give her solo albums another try, sometimes things are worth persevering with."
"__MUSIC__ Again it sounds too much like homework, music should be fun!"
"__MUSIC__ Should it be fun all the time though? Think of music in horror films, that doesn't sound like much fun on its own."
"__MUSIC__ Yes but I wouldn't want to listen to it on its own, leave it in the film!"
