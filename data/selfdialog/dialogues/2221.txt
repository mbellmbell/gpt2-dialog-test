"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Lately I've only been listening to the music my boyfriend makes."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Acoustic guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool. I didn't know your boyfriend was a musician."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he is. He makes acoustic covers of existing music and performs them on the Promenade in Santa Monica."
"__MUSIC__ What's the Promenade?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a street with mainly pedestrians and stores everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ Does your boyfriend make a living off of playing a guitar on the street?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but he gets most of his spending money through his performances."
"__MUSIC__ That's very interesting. It's good that you are able to enjoy his music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's the thing. I'm not so sure I'm a fan."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure he'd understand if you told him."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but he is very passionate about his music."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like hip hop the most, but my boyfriend doesn't like when I play it in the house."
"__MUSIC__ Your boyfriend doesn't like hip hop?"
"__MUSIC__ No, he only likes acoustic music. That's the reason I've changed my listening habits as well."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound good at all."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I get for getting a boyfriend with bad taste, I suppose."
