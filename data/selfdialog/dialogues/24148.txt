"__SUPERHERO__ Who do you think is the worst Avenger?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Hmmm, based on powers, I'd say Hawkeye."
"__SUPERHERO__ My vote is for Black Widow.  She doesn't have any powers either, and not even bow."
"__SUPERHERO__ I always like to identify actors by the roles they've played in superhero movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Go on."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, Thomas Jane played the Punisher, and Alfred Molina played Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ok."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, they appear together in Boogie Nights, and it's fun pretending that Doctor Octopus shoots the Punisher."
"__SUPERHERO__ Haha, that is interesting, but it can get tricky, I'm thinking."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, like which actor is which hero if they've played multiple roles.  I usually go with the better role, like Halle Berry is definitely Storm."
