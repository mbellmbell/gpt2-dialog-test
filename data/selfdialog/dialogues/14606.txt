"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Some kind of weather we've been having lately."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No kidding; one minute it's pouring and the next minute it's scorching!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, it reminds me of that song about extremes."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Which song is that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's the one where the singer says something like you're hot and you're cold."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You're yes and you're no?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah that's the one! Who's it by?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think that's a Katy Perry song."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You're in then you're out... yeah, that's a fun song."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hard to believe it came out almost ten years ago."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wait, really??"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, it came out in 2008."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow. Whatever happened to her?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Actually her next album's about to come out."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No kidding! What's it called?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Witness, it's supposed to come out June 9th."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Huh. Didn't she have a single come out recently for it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, Chained to the Rhythm."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I knew it! I'll have to check it out, she has some good songs."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, she's kinda hit or miss, but yeah, you should."
