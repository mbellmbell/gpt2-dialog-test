"__DISNEY__ When was the last time you watched a classic Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably a year or two ago I watched Fantasia with my little cousins."
"__DISNEY__ I just recently re-watched Snow White and I miss that style of animation so much."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I know the colors and everything."
"__DISNEY__ Can you imagine drawing all those dwarves over and over like that?"
"__DISNEY__ Not at all, but that's what made those movies special, all the hard work."
"__DISNEY__ Very true, if only they still did animations like that."
"__DISNEY__ Imagine if Frozen was animated by hand."
"__DISNEY__ Ahhh it could be beautiful, don't make my heart think like that."
"__DISNEY__ Only in our dreams."
