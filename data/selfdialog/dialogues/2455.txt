"__MUSIC__ Do you have any connections to any booking agents?"
"__MUSIC__ For what kind of act?"
"__MUSIC__ My buddies and I started a punk band."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really into punk music these days."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah the scene has died down in this city, it sucks."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I used to live in a hosue full of punk musicians, but we got kicked out and parted ways."
"__MUSIC__ Do you ever talk to them?"
"__MUSIC__ No, unfortunately. Some of them would probably be able to help out with booking too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm totally new to this field. I know nothing except how to play music."
"__MUSIC__ Have you produced anything?"
"__MUSIC__ We have enough songs for an EP I think, but we don't really play shows."
"__MUSIC__ That's what you gotta do first."
"__MUSIC__ That's why I'm struggling, I'm not sure how to go about finding a place to play a show."
"__MUSIC__ My best advice would just be to do what you're doing- ask around."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, eventually if you keep talking to other musicians, you'll make connections and people will start remembering your name."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks man."
"__MUSIC__ Are you on social media at all for your music."
"__MUSIC__ No, why?"
"__MUSIC__ You gotta start a bandcamp! It's the best tool for musicians to spread their word."
