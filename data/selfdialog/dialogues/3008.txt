"__MUSIC__ So I went to see the Flaming Lips the other night."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome. Did they play a lot of stuff from the new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe three or four songs. When they played 'There Should Be Unicorns,' Wayne came out into the crowd riding a giant mechanical unicorn while singing."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not surprised. He always does weird stuff live."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. He got in the bubble too, and covered Bowie's 'Space Oddity.'"
"__MUSIC__ How was that?"
"__MUSIC__ They definitely did Bowie justice. I cried."
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember that time we saw them and they turned off all the lights and had the crowd point laser pointers at a giant mirror?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! That was when they were on tour after At War with the Mystics came out."
"__MUSIC__ I've never been a huge fan of that album, honestly."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I mean, it's not as good as Yoshimi or The Soft Bulletin, but it has some good songs. I love 'The W.A.N.D.'"
"__MUSIC__ I like that one too. The 'Yeah Yeah Yeah Song' is pretty fun to sing along with too."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the last two or three albums?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really know what to think. They're good, but they don't really keep my attention."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. They're mostly instrumental and not as catchy. I think they're meant to be played live."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I can see that. They've definitely changed a lot since they first got famous in the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. I think I was in eighth grade when 'She Don't Use Jelly' came out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was in high school. I remember thinking I'd never heard anything like that before."
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember the video?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the one where the girl's in the bathtub with a bunch of fried eggs? How could I forget?"
