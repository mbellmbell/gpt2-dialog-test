"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the game between the Warriors and the Spurs last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, I did, Spurs did pretty good the 1st half."
"__BASKETBALL__ They ended the first half a little ahead, and I thought maybe they might have a chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ I had my doubts, as the Spurs are down two to one and don't have Leonard or Parker playing."
"__BASKETBALL__ The youngsters did a pretty good job trying to keep up the second half, but just couldn't quite do it."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's ok, they had a respectable score at the end and there is always next season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hopefully Leonard and Parker can get back next season and bring it home for the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, and the newbies will have increased their skills too."
"__BASKETBALL__ What did you think about Aldridge?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Everyone says he has the skills, but somehow he is not performing up to par."
"__BASKETBALL__ To me, it looks like he just doesn't have the confidence."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree."
"__BASKETBALL__ He sure isn't a Tim Duncan."
"__BASKETBALL__ I really miss him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too, ah well, the Spurs have what they have"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, hoping for a great season next year."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about what Ginobli is doing this season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Way beyond expectations, although he seemed to be off last night"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yah, but he is fun to watch , no matter what"
"__BASKETBALL__ He sure is, he isn't afraid of anyone."
