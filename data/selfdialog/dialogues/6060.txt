"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think Mace Windu was able to best Darth Sidious in the lightsaber battle in Revenge Of The Sith?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it's said that Windu was one of the best saber duelists among the jedi, and that he utilized his special technique called Vaapad."
"__STAR_WARS__ I almost think that the emperor was kind of holding back because he knew his precious Anakin was going to come. And if Anakin came and saw him standing over Mace instead of the other way around, his mind might not have been changed."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's true, you make an excellent point. And the emperor always seemed to be 20 steps ahead of everyone else."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean did you see how easily he took out those other jedi at the beginning of that battle? It was like instantaneous!"
"__STAR_WARS__ He really is powerful. Not even Yoda could stop his rise to power."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was an expert manipulator. No sith has even been on his level in that regard."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well we're in agreement there. It helped that the Jedi were way too proud and arrogant."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. Did you know that the reason Mace Windu had a purple lightsaber was because Samuel L. Jackson personally requested it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh wow I didn't know that. But it makes sense, he always has been the kind of actor who wanted to stand out."
