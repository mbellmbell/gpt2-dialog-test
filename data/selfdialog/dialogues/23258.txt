"__DISNEY__ What did you think about Simba's voice actor from The Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Matthew Broderick voiced him really well. Ditto for Jeremy Irons and Scar."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Scar was a really great character. Disney made him a great villain."
"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite The Lion King song?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm. I think either 'Be Prepared', or 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King'."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that's a really tough decision. But I really liked 'Hakuna Matata'."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's a really upbeat and happy song."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I rate The Lion King 5 stars out of 5!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too!"
"__DISNEY__ It's my favorite Disney movie."
