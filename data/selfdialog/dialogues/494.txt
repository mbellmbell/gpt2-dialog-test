"__MUSIC__ The first ever song I composed was called 'Goin' Back to Phoenix' in the 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really, you mean like 'Goin' Back to Cali'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I must have been in the 5th grade. My friend Franklin and I did this thing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but who'd want to go to Phoenix?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, the line was something like, 'Goin back to Phoenix, Phoenix Phoenix, goin' back to Phoenix, nah it's too hot there..'"
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha, yeah. Did you use a 4 track?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, we just had a keyboard with a 5 piece drum kit and simple bass line. We did it all in real time."
"__MUSIC__ Do you still have it, the song?"
"__MUSIC__ No way, but we took it to school and let the girls listen to it. We became more popular because of it."
"__MUSIC__ This was the 5th grade?"
"__MUSIC__ It was 5th or 6th and we became the 2 white rappers of Tomahawk Elementary."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, so did you do anything else, composition wise?"
"__MUSIC__ Later in my 20's I wrote some score stuff for my 'On the Lot' submission."
"__MUSIC__ 'On the Lot'?"
"__MUSIC__ Spielberg and Mark Burnett got together and did this competition reality show for original video submissions."
"__MUSIC__ I must have missed it."
"__MUSIC__ I did a Sci Fi alien thing and composed the music for it using Cubase."
"__MUSIC__ Really, it was 50's 60s sci fi flying saucer stuff, or like what?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I was trying to copy John Williams style."
"__MUSIC__ Excellent! Jaws on Sci Fi!"
