"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi, guy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi, What's up?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I wondered if you've ever heard of Deanna Durbin?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, who's that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ She was this amazingly popular singer and actress from the forties that nobody has ever heard of today."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Huh! What was she in?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There was a really funny one called 'It Started With Eve'. She pretends to be Bob Cummings's fiancee because his dad is dying. But then the dad gets well, oops."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know Bob Cummings. He can be funny."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, he's really caught in the middle here. He set up the impersonation to give his dad a happy last moment, but then what does he do?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Anyway, so what about this Durbin woman?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, she wants to get out of the situation, but comes to like the father and doesn't want to disillusion him."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That sounds pretty trite."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You'd think so, but the thing about Deanna Durbin is that she makes it all seem really fresh."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You seem to have really developed a crush on her!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, well, maybe. It's just so odd to me that she could have been such a big name and be almost unremembered now."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I guess. Under the old studio system, the actors were a lot more like commodities. Even big stars sometimes had to do two or three movies in a year."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's true, I guess there were probably a lot of actors that everybody recognized then but we don't know now."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I read somewhere that they almost cast Ronald Reagan as Rick in 'Casablanca.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Naw, that's a myth. They were considering George Raft, though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow, that would have been strange."
