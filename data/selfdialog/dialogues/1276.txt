"__MUSIC__ Who names a band 'Rainbow Kitten Suprise?' What a strange name!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, I know. Odd, isn't it? But their music is fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I buy it. What do you like about them?"
"__MUSIC__ They're super chill, but piercing at the same time. It's like a dream that stays with you."
"__MUSIC__ Does it remind you of rainbows? Or kittens?"
"__MUSIC__ Rainbows, maybe. Kittens, no."
"__MUSIC__ Alright then, what songs do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't stop listening to 'Devil Like Me.' But 'All That and More (Sailboat)' is another favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Where are they from?"
"__MUSIC__ The band met at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC. They started in a college dormroom!"
"__MUSIC__ So, like your typical dorm room guitars?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe they started that way, but they're defintiely not like that now. They just played at Bonnaroo!"
"__MUSIC__ When was Bonnaroo? This month, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, earlier June!"
"__MUSIC__ Where else are they playing this summer? Maybe we could catch a show."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, it looks like they'll be at House of Blues in St. Louis on July 5!"
"__MUSIC__ That could work. What do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ It's an awesome venue. I say let's do it! But first you have to stop laughing at the name."
"__MUSIC__ I think they want you to laugh at the name! It's too silly for anyone to take seriously."
"__MUSIC__ I'll give you that. Like really, 'Rainbow Kitten Surprise'?"
