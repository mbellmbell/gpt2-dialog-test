"__MUSIC__ Do you know what kind of music your parents like best?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't. That's kind of a strange question."
"__MUSIC__ Not really. It's kind of interesting to think about."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ I think sometimes there's a tendency to think about your parents as 'parents', not as people. But they are just like anyone else."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's true. I know my mom was a big fan of the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Just like every mom and dad of around that age!"
"__MUSIC__ That's true. My dad was big into Motown, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Ohh, like Marvin Gaye and the Temptations, groups like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he definitely liked the Temptations."
"__MUSIC__ My parentes were huge Deadheads."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I never would have pictured that."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. They followed the Grateful Dead on tour for 3 months at one point."
"__MUSIC__ I'm never going to be able to look at your parents the same way!"
"__MUSIC__ It's funny how music is such a signifier of lifestyle and personality."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, especially with a band like the Grateful Dead."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, they're probably the number one 'lifestyle' band out there."
"__MUSIC__ I still can't believe your parents were Deadheads."
"__MUSIC__ It took some getting used to for me, too!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad my parents stuck with Marvin Gaye and the Beatles."
