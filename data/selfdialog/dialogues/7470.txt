"__LADY_GAGA__ If you had to choose five all time favorite Lady Gaga songs what would they be?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ They would be Bad Romance, Paparazzi, Born This Way, Perfect Illusion, and Monster. You?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like Bad Romance, Judas, You and I, Marry The Night, and Alejandro."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Those are great too. You and I is really fun, but also romantic."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. Why do you like Monster? I never got that one."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think that it comes off as silly as first, but it could be deeper."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you mean?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I feel like it represents this type of guy who starts off as just a fun fling, but then ends up breaking your heart."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That makes sense. I'll give it another try."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You should. A lot of her songs are both relatable and empowering."
