"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What position in an NFL team do you think is the best?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uu that's a hard question. Hmm the QuarterBack?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Quarter Back couldn't work without a Receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, and we can't forget about the Running Games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Defensive players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are very important."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The big guys on the line are the one that make a lot of the big play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, interceptions and sacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The special team are also important."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha you can't forget about the kicker and the punter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the long snapper."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, he is always the one people make fun of, but no one can do their jobs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know that the tight end is the worst paying position in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, that's surprising. What about Gonk?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's an outlier."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah well, they are still a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and no one can work alone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but they still do need a leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So then I vote for the Coach!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, that's correct!"
