"__MOVIES__ I saw the greatest movie on HBO yesterday. It was called Empire Records, have you ever seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, is it a new movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No it came out in 1995 and had Liv Tyler in it."
"__MOVIES__ I maybe saw that when I was in middle school. Was Renee Zellwegger in it also?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It was about a man who owned a record store, and needed to raise a ton of money quickly."
"__MOVIES__ Who was the owner?"
"__MOVIES__ His name is Joe and he is played by Anthony Lapaglia."
"__MOVIES__ Who else was in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Brenden Sexton Jr and Ethan Embry and Robin Tunney was in the movie too, she played Deb and had her head shaved."
"__MOVIES__ That name is familiar, what else was she in?"
"__MOVIES__ Robin Tunney was also in The Craft! What a great movie that was."
"__MOVIES__ I loved The Craft, it made me want to be a witch and cast spells."
"__MOVIES__ No way that is so scary. Speaking of scary witch movies, do you remember The Blair Witch movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I went to the theater and saw that and I was so young."
"__MOVIES__ I was too, it took months for people to convince me that was a movie and not a real documentary."
"__MOVIES__ Can you imagine if The Blair Witch was a real documentary? That would be crazy."
"__MOVIES__ They came out with a second Blair Witch movie in 2016, did you know that?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, but I never went and saw it."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't as good, but it continued on from the 1994 Blair Witch movie with the character in the new movie being related to Heather."
"__MOVIES__ I am glad I didn't see it then."
