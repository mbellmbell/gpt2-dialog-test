"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate watching some of the NFL games, when good teams play against teams that just aren't any good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think most if not all of the teams are good though, aren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some are total trash."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well in any league, in any sport, there will always be teams at the bottom."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, expect in some leagues the bottom teams get relegated if they don't do well. It doesn't work like that in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you had to demote a team, which one would you kick out of the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cleveland Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've never even heard of them!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly my point.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they a new team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all! They've been in the NFL for about 50 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why haven't I heard of them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you heard of the Baltimore Ravens?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I have. You wouldn't demote them as well would you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I wouldn't. The Ravens was actually born out of the Browns as an expansion team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When was this? I don't remember any of this happening."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This happened back in the 90's. Ever since then the Brown just have never been able to hold their own."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's rough. I'm guessing they play in the American Football Conference?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they do. They've never even ever made it to the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going to have to do some reading up on them, but I do see your point. They don't sound like a team I'd want to go see play."
