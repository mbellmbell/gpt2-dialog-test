"__MOVIES__ Who would you say is the best Western actor?"
"__MOVIES__ John Wayne, no contest."
"__MOVIES__ So you'd pick John Wayne over Gary Cooper?"
"__MOVIES__ As a Western actor, yes."
"__MOVIES__ How is John Wayne better than Gary Cooper?"
"__MOVIES__ I will agree that Gary is an outstanding actor and is far more versatile than John outside of Western, but not when there's outlaws up to no good."
"__MOVIES__ Gary Cooper put down bad guys just fine."
"__MOVIES__ That may be, but if it's time to saddle up, the Duke is getting a Winchester and strapping on a six-shooter."
"__MOVIES__ Gary Cooper could hold his own against anybody."
"__MOVIES__ I agree he's good, but not on horseback. Life after Westerns is a different story."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well John Wayne is the better cowboy, but modern was not his style."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he didn't really evolve well."
"__MOVIES__ Take Big Jake, it was still John Wayne gunslinger, but he was around automobiles and semi auto pistols."
"__MOVIES__ I will agree that he should only have be around revolvers, or at most a lever action rifle."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I couldn't see John Wayne in a movie today holding a digital zoom, lazer guided sniper rifle."
"__MOVIES__ Not even a little bit, Though he was ok in The Green Berets."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't horrible, but I stand by what I said, Now Gary Cooper I could see coming back in like a mobster movie, or even a high tech spy."
"__MOVIES__ Ok I see what you're getting at, yes Cooper is the more well rounded of the two."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, but John Wayne is definitely better with a ten gallon hat and a set of spurs."
