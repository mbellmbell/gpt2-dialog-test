"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what do you think of the NLF Hall of Fame class for 2018?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some interesting names, I think Ray Lewis and Steve Hutchinson are the only first balloters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't have Randy Moss as first ballot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he's close but there is such a logjam at wide receivers.  If Owens doesn't make it I don't see how Moss does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Owens thing was for off the court behavior, and besides Moss was better at his prime.  He'll get in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Owens ever gets in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, I am not sure how often two players of the same position get in the same year though, so he may have to wait even longer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That hurts Urlacher too.  He played the same position as Ray Lewis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, besides he is not quite a first balloter to me anyway.  But he will get in.  Who else do you have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Ronde Barber gets in eventually, but he will have to wait?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And what about Richard Seymour?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Going to be tough for him.  His style of play didn't really create the sacks, and people will forget how he changed the flow of a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Tagliabue will get in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No idea.  An argument can be made just to include every commissioner.  Probably not this year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else do you think will get in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not sure, how many slots are there anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is no firm number, but somewhere between 4 to 8 players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In that case I think Tony Boselli and Faneca also makes it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Boselli might deserve it as a player, but I hated him as an annoucer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was pretty bad."
