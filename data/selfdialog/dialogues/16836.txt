"__MOVIES__ Hey what's up?  Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, my husband and I watched something weird the other night.  It was called the Babadook."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I heard about that!  How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was strange, but I thought it was entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It was about a storybook character that came to life.  It was a horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh how spooky!  Yeah, the trailers kinda scared me a little bit."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was definitely scary.  The imagary really haunted me in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I was worried it looked like it might be corny."
"__MOVIES__ My husband thought it was a little corny, but I was genuinely scared.  I was gripping his arm through the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I love a good scary movie like that!  Did the ending turn out okay?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it had a pretty decent ending.  I would recommend watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't recognize any of the actors or actresses honestly.  There's a single mother and her son."
"__MOVIES__ Those are the main characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but they weren't anyone I've ever seen before.  It seemed like a kinda low budget film."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well that's okay.  Those can still be amusing sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah definitely!  I think you should watch this one."
"__MOVIES__ I probably will.  I've been looking for another scary movie to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Well this is the scariest I've seen in awhile."
