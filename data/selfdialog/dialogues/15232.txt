"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry complained way too much in this movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You think so?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Absolutely.  He basically screamed at his friends the whole time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, in his defense, you try being the chosen one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just because he was pressured doesn't mean he should yell at Hermione and Ron the whole time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, look at it from Harry's perspective.  It was a great burden he never asked for."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just because you are facing adversity doesn't mean being rude to people."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ron didn't help things either.  He was always jealous of Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know why.  He got to marry Herimione."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he did get lucky in the end."
