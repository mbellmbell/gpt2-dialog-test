"__POP__ Man, do I hate Justin Bieber?"
"__POP__ Doesn't everyone?"
"__POP__ Of course not.  There's a whole slew of Beliebiers out there."
"__POP__ I don't get why.  He's not a good role model."
"__POP__ To say the least.  He's a punk."
"__POP__ And his music is not that good.  It's all helped by a machine."
"__POP__ Was he really that talented or just a Youtube sensation?"
"__POP__ He wasn't better than anyone else on Youtube, but he looked good and that's all that mattered."
"__POP__ I wish I was talented."
"__POP__ And good looking - burn!"
