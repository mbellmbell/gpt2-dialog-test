"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking of introducing my daughter to Old Yeller."
"__MOVIES__ Good movie.  She's gonna cry though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I know, I'm probably going to cry too."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't everyone at the end of that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I want her to see it but I don't want to see her cry."
"__MOVIES__ She'll be fine."
"__MOVIES__ I know she will but she cries for tons of movies."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that movie in so long I hardly remember it."
"__MOVIES__ I remember the dog not taking the food he set out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I remember that part too."
"__MOVIES__ I remember he was a good dog."
"__MOVIES__ I also remember he saved everyone."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think early in the movie one of the cows had rabies or something."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think so too."
"__MOVIES__ Of course the end is traumatic."
"__MOVIES__ It was. I felt so bad for him."
"__MOVIES__ The dog he loved so much was beyond saving."
"__MOVIES__ And he had to shoot him."
"__MOVIES__ But they got a puppy in the end."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, kind of a small prize to losing Old Yeller."
