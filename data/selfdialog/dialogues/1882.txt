"__MUSIC__ Techno music is awful."
"__MUSIC__ That's a strong statement."
"__MUSIC__ Not at all.  What's better?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, all music quite frankly."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, that's my point.  It's just loud thrashing."
"__MUSIC__ I don't prefer it myself, but I don't dance."
"__MUSIC__ Some people listen to it casually and don't have to be at a club."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but those people have some weird tastes."
"__MUSIC__ Who's the worst artist that does it?"
"__MUSIC__ Techno?  Gosh, so many come to mind."
"__MUSIC__ Well, try and pick just one."
"__MUSIC__ For me, I would say Carl Cox."
"__MUSIC__ Popular, but annoying.  I get it."
"__MUSIC__ I would also put Adam Beyer up there as well.  He just plays trash."
"__MUSIC__ You seem to know a lot about artists even though you hate it."
"__MUSIC__ What can I say, I'm a cultured individual."
"__MUSIC__ I would say that this music would be good if you find a girl who likes dancing to it."
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, but I wouldn't date a girl that listens to techno."
"__MUSIC__ True, it would be a bit odd."
"__MUSIC__ I couldn't handle it.  My ears would fall off!"
