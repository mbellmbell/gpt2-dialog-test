"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think that old Ben kenobi let Darth Vader kill him like that in A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You know I always assumed that it had to do with him becoming a force ghost. But Yoda and Qui Gon became ghosts and neither of them had to let someone kill them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I kind of think maybe it had to do with letting Vader know he had no power over him. That he wasn't going to really win."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that kind of makes sense. But you'd think old Ben could have accomplished a lot more while alive."
"__STAR_WARS__ That may be true, but everyone dies eventually. He became one with the force and still guided Luke to victory."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's also been said that he was able to communicate with Qui Gon Jinn, and that it was all part of some bigger plan. Maybe that's why he did it."
"__STAR_WARS__ You see that's why I love Star Wars. There's still so much of the lore that remains secret and mysterious."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean it was certainly necessary for the plot to advance, for Luke to undertake the hero's journey."
"__STAR_WARS__ But in any good story you need to justify these things. Yes you kill the parents and the mentors for the hero to grow, but you have to make it make sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree with this. The movie wouldn't have been as interesting if Old Ben had stayed alive and fought the empire."
