"__MOVIES__ I watched My Neighbor Totoro for the first time since I was a kid the other day."
"__MOVIES__ Did it hold up?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly it was ever better."
"__MOVIES__ What about it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know how when you're a kid, everything feels larger than life?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, sure."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think my impression of that movie was that all of this big, magical stuff was happening. But I didn't really process what it was."
"__MOVIES__ So you can see it more clearly now?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. And, like, the actual story is fabulous and heartbreaking. It's even better than what I remembered."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Maybe I'll watch it as an adult."
"__MOVIES__ Were there any movies that changed a lot for you from when you were a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Now that you mention it, a couple of years ago I rewatched the live action Hundred and One Dalmatians."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah? What was different."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the puppies seemed more adorable. I guess I think puppies are cuter now."
"__MOVIES__ Anything else?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Did you know that Hugh Laurie is in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ What? Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. He's one of Cruella DeVille's henchman."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I'll have to check that out."
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty hilarious."
