"__MUSIC__ So have you heard Mandisa's new hit?"
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't."
"__MUSIC__ She put a new hit out."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard from her in awhile."
"__MUSIC__ Apparently, she was through a serious depression."
"__MUSIC__ What Mandisa? I love her and she always seems so happy."
"__MUSIC__ From what I heard it was serious."
"__MUSIC__ She never really seemed as if she was depressed."
"__MUSIC__ That was part of what she was saying on the radio the other day. She was able to put a face on and nobody knew."
"__MUSIC__ You would think those close to her would have known. But I mean she seems to have it all."
"__MUSIC__ She went on to say that she had gained a lot of her weight back and that sent her into a very dark place."
"__MUSIC__ So those close to her didn't even know?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that is what she went on to say. For the longest time she faked it."
"__MUSIC__ Depression can put you into a real bad spot. So how did she overcome it?"
"__MUSIC__ She had lots of prayer and she got some counselling."
"__MUSIC__ Amazing how she seemed to have it all. Fame and wealth."
"__MUSIC__ Just goes to show that depression can hit anyone at anytime"
"__MUSIC__ I would say so."
"__MUSIC__ Her new song she tells of how she has overcome her illness. And how she has come through."
"__MUSIC__ I can't wait to hear it."
