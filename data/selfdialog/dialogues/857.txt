"__MUSIC__ What kind of music are you listening to right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I'm listening to metal."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I love metal music. What band are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ You wouldn't know who they are even if I told you."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I'm listening to a Japanese metal band. They are not exactly popular here in the US."
"__MUSIC__ You'd be surprised, I've listened to bands from all over the world. As long as it's metal, I'm a huge fan."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, the band I'm listening to is called Galneryus. Ever heard of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually I have. Their guitarist, Syu, is insanely good. His speed and accuracy is almost legendary."
"__MUSIC__ Ah! So are you a big fan of them as well?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. Galneryus has more of a symphonic metal sound, I'm more into the hardcore stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I see. So what bands would you recommend then?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, since you like bands from Japan, I would definitely suggest you give Maximum the Hormone a listen."
"__MUSIC__ I've never actually heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you're in for a treat then."
"__MUSIC__ Where would I find their music?"
"__MUSIC__ You can always check them out on Youtube. Their music videos on there are pretty wild."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely will do that later tonight. Any other suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever tried Baby Metal?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh no! I'd rather go deaf than listen to that drivel."
