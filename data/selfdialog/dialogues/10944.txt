"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the worst NFL team in the league right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cleavland Browns easily."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Not the Jets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets are bad but The Browns are absolute trash right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think the Jets would beat the Browns if they played right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. It wouldn't be a stomp but the Browns would lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What factors makes you think the Browns are the worst?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my opinion they need a serious roster change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you get rid of first?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their quarterback would be the first to go. He is a detriment to the team's performance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch, thats pretty harsh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm only going off of what I've seen and his statistics. The guy is just bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have seen his stats so I can't argue there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think anyone really can. However he's not the only one at fault."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you'd change out the whole roster?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I would if I was the owner. I would want a fresh start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I'd cut half the team and not the entire roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I see potential in a lot of the players, I just think they aren't enabled to succeed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sort of agree with you, but I'm the kind of guy that wants to start fresh."
