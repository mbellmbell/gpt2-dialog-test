"__DISNEY__ Remember when we went to New York City to watch the Broadway production of 'The Lion King'?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, It was awesome! Especially during the openning scene, when the animals were all around!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. Pretty nice."
"__DISNEY__ You don't sound enthusiastic about your comment. What's wrong?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I was just remebering the movie and the first time I watched it. It made me so sad."
"__DISNEY__ When Mufassa died?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah."
"__DISNEY__ The good news with the movie is that you can rewatch the first part of the movie, before Mufsssa died, and see him alive again."
"__DISNEY__ True."
"__DISNEY__ You just have to stop the video before the bad part!"
