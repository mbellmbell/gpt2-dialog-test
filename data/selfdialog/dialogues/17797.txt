"__MOVIES__ What are some of your favorite Horror films?"
"__MOVIES__ I love most of them! I especially love the Rob Zombie films."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah like House of 1000 Corpses?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and also Devil's Rejects."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked both of those too."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed his Halloween remake too."
"__MOVIES__ So did I! I'm not into remakes all the time but his was phenomenal."
"__MOVIES__ I feel the same. Halloween is one of my favorites so I was worried about him remaking it."
"__MOVIES__ I was so pleased with his version."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. I like how he told the back story."
"__MOVIES__ That's my favorite part. We were missing that in the originals."
"__MOVIES__ And he made everything so gruesome. I was genuinely scared."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, having Tyler Mane play Michael helped. He's larger than life!"
"__MOVIES__ And the kid they had play the young Michael really freaked me out too."
"__MOVIES__ I know! He did such a great job for a young kid."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that he wasn't able to watch anything other than his scenes while they were filming."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good idea. Although, his parts were the most gruesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's true. Sounds like he had a good supportive family though."
"__MOVIES__ That's good. I grew up on horror and turned out just fine."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Most of us 80's kids did."
