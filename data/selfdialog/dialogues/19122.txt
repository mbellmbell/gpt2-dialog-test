"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Sandra Bullock movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I'm going to have to go with Hope Floats."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one where she has to movie back to Texas with her daughter?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! After she finds out that her husband was cheating on her."
"__MOVIES__ Her mother is a real character in that movie, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everyone is pretty eccentric. It's great."
"__MOVIES__ I just remember when she danced with Harry Connick Jr. at a picnic or BBQ."
"__MOVIES__ It was such a romantic moment!"
"__MOVIES__ Do they get together in the end?"
"__MOVIES__ It's complicated for a little while, but they do eventually."
"__MOVIES__ It reminds me of Sweet Home Alabama with Reese Witherspoon."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it definitely follows a romantic comedy formula."
"__MOVIES__ But it's so much fun anyway!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, both movies really are lots of fun."
"__MOVIES__ I love romantic comedies when they are set in the south."
"__MOVIES__ I know! It's such a relief from all of the ones that take place in NYC or California."
"__MOVIES__ A good setting makes a movie much more enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ That is seriously true."
"__MOVIES__ And both Reese and Sandra are southern anyway, so they really pull it off."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, they do!"
