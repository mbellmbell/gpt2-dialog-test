"__MUSIC__ Do you enjoy top 40 at all?"
"__MUSIC__ That really depends. Sometimes there are great songs on there."
"__MUSIC__ Right. But I feel like most of the time it's the most shallow music that get's on the top 40."
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree. I will say though- even though most of the songs on there aren't my taste, there's some impressive stuff to hear."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well for starters, today's upper level of popstars are incredibly talented. Like Bruno Mars has an incredible voice, and he's a great dancer too."
"__MUSIC__ But do you actually enjoy his music though?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. But Uptown Funk was decent."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was fine. I got tired of it really quickly though."
"__MUSIC__ Same.  What else do you like about Pop radio?"
"__MUSIC__ The other thing is more interesting I think. When you listen to top 40 songs, you hear some of the absolute greatest production around today."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, absolutely. Like I would never go out of my way to listen to pop songs, but when I do for whatever reason, the production always stands out to me."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. So that's been good sometimes. Like once, the only station I could find was top 40."
"__MUSIC__ Yikes. But the production was entertaining on its on?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. The I could enjoy just picking out the different instruments and listening to them individually."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. I'll have to try that next time. What song stood out to you recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it wasn't super recent, but 'Roar' by Katy Perry sounds phenomenal."
"__MUSIC__ I'll give it a listen again. This time focusing on the production quality."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I think you'll be surprised how enjoyable it is."
"__MUSIC__ We'll see. Thanks for the suggestion!"
