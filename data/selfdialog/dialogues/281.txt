"__MUSIC__ I found an old AKAI cassette machine today, model GXC-730D. When it was new in 1977 or 1979 it cost about $600."
"__MUSIC__ Holy cow! Probably sells for $50 on eBay nowadays. Probably weighs 40 pounds, too."
"__MUSIC__ It does. But it has a feature of playing tapes backwards. I ran a bunch of my old Beatles tapes through it."
"__MUSIC__ What did you hear when you played the Beatles tapes backwards?"
"__MUSIC__ 'All Together Now' becomes '1984, 1984, 1984'."
"__MUSIC__ Like the George Orwell book."
"__MUSIC__ Right. And 'Bungalo Bill' has 'Hey, Beelzebub, Hey, Lucifer' over and over again."
"__MUSIC__ Yikes. I haven't heard that song in years. And I always thought 'Sexy Sadie' was saying 'Sexy Satan'."
"__MUSIC__ I thought so too, after the first time you hear the phrase."
"__MUSIC__ And 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' has nothing to do with LSD. It's actually 'The Moon, The Stars, and the Sun.'"
"__MUSIC__ Which Lennon used later on. Right. Lucifer meaning the Sun, when people worshiped the Sun not the Moon."
"__MUSIC__ What else did you discover, playing the tapes backwards?"
"__MUSIC__ Well of course on 'Revolution 9', there's 'Turn Me On Dead Man, turn me on..'"
"__MUSIC__ Supposedly a reference to their deceased manager, Brian Epstein."
"__MUSIC__ And I swear I heard 'We're Revolutionary' on George Harrison's song, 'Julia'."
"__MUSIC__ That's a new one on me. The song was for his mother, I think."
"__MUSIC__ And also in 'Revolution 9', backwards, you can hear Paul yelling, 'Let Me Out! Let Me Out!'"
"__MUSIC__ Because he was supposedly killed in a car crash and replaced by a Doppleganger."
"__MUSIC__ Right."
"__MUSIC__ I remember the Lennon and Elton John version of 'Lucy In The Sky' having 'Hey! Paul!' planted in the background, to annoy Paul McCartney."
