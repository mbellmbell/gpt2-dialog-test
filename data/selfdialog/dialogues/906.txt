"__MUSIC__ Do you like country music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm torn. I used to like country, but that was my parents' influence."
"__MUSIC__ So, you don't like modern country?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it depends on what constitutes modern country? I dislike the political overtones of many current artists."
"__MUSIC__ I see.  Well, what artists have you enjoyed in this genre?"
"__MUSIC__ When I was very, very young, I loved Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, and Lorretta Lynn. But, that was mom's influence."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite Dolly Parton song?"
"__MUSIC__ I liked a few, actually.  9-5 was an anthem.  Hard Candy Christmas, Jolene,  Coat of Many Colors, and Islands In the Stream."
"__MUSIC__ What about Willie Nelson?"
"__MUSIC__ Any song by Willie Nelson is great in my book.  I think he's a musical genius."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't Patsy Cline die before you were born?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah!  She died in the early 60's."
"__MUSIC__ So, how did you come to like her music?"
"__MUSIC__ Again, my mom liked her music and when the bio-pic of her life came out, we owned it on VHS."
"__MUSIC__ Same with Loretta Lynn?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  Coal Miner's Daughter was on our mantle with the other movies."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think you no longer listen to country?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, exactly.  Don't get me wrong- Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill,...all great songwriters.  I just have found other tastes, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ I think most people do."
"__MUSIC__ Country music has roots, deep roots, that will keep it around. At some point, I might enjoy it again."
