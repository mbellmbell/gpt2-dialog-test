"__MOVIES__ What did you think of this new remake of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the acting. Emma Watson was a lovely Belle."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The music wasn't great, though."
"__MOVIES__ No, all that auto tuning was painful."
"__MOVIES__ I prefer the music in the original one. Belle had a great voice in it."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I did like how faithful the remake was."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, even most of the speech was the same."
"__MOVIES__ I was glad to see that but it almost seems pointless to have remade it."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure why Disney keeps doing this."
"__MOVIES__ It's like they're out of ideas."
"__MOVIES__ I really wonder if that's it."
"__MOVIES__ They're doing more as well."
"__MOVIES__ I heard about the Little Mermaid one."
"__MOVIES__ Do you plan to watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably but I won't be too hopeful."
"__MOVIES__ Neither will I."
"__MOVIES__ How are they doing the underwater stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they'll skip it."
