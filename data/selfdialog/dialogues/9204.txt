"__BASEBALL__ Tribe play tonight?"
"__BASEBALL__ nah, they were off"
"__BASEBALL__ good, they could use the break"
"__BASEBALL__ yeah, hitting's been a little off, even as the pitching's getting better"
"__BASEBALL__ bullpen's been great though"
"__BASEBALL__ oh yeah, maybe best in the league, definitely is the best in the division"
"__BASEBALL__ you think they're still good?"
"__BASEBALL__ man listen, the twins ain't hanging around much longer"
"__BASEBALL__ tigers neither, I really think by the end of june, they'll be just battling for home field"
"__BASEBALL__ yep, me too"
"__BASEBALL__ hopefully the fans start showing up a little more now that the weather's getting better"
"__BASEBALL__ they've never really shown up though"
"__BASEBALL__ well, in the 90's..."
"__BASEBALL__ and early 2000's sure, but that was a different era"
"__BASEBALL__ different team, different fans?"
"__BASEBALL__ nah, same fans, just different priorities"
"__BASEBALL__ yeah probably, any way, I had these off days"
"__BASEBALL__ yeah, nothing to do at 7pm!"
"__BASEBALL__ I actually went to buy tickets last night and realized they were leaving for the road trip"
"__BASEBALL__ boo! next time"
