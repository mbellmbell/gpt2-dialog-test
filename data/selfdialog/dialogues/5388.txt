"__STAR_WARS__ So what do you think of Kylo Ren?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's a pretty sinister character, and a look-alike of Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ But obviously, he seems weaker right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, he didn't even seem that powerful."
"__STAR_WARS__ But he's got a bad-ass looking lightsaber, tho."
"__STAR_WARS__ YEAHHH!!! His lightsaber was actually an idea of a close friend of mine!!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Could you spare me the details?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No can do! Don't wanna mention anymore Star Wars spoilers from here!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Come to think of it, I haven't seen the Rogue One movie yet."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not that great, honestly, I'll tell you that."
