"__MUSIC__ You see that new Kendrick Lamar video that dropped yesterday?"
"__MUSIC__ I did. Pretty solid stuff, as always."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Kendrick definitely knows how to make a interesting video."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't say that it's as good as the 'Humble' video."
"__MUSIC__ That one would be hard to beat. Lots of interesting visuals."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think of his new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Man, honestly, I liked it OK but I don't think it's nearly on the level of his last two."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, really? I think it's great."
"__MUSIC__ It's an above average rap album for sure, but coming in the wake of two stone cold classics, it was almost boring."
"__MUSIC__ OK, now you're just being unreasonable."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I'm definitely in the minority on this one."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me a better rap album from this year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's easy - Run the Jewels 3."
"__MUSIC__ That one came out in 2016, smart guy."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but it came out on Dec 25, so it's basically a 2017 album."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. That was a really solid album."
"__MUSIC__ Those guys can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned."
"__MUSIC__ They're great, but better than my man Kung Fu Kenny? No."
"__MUSIC__ To each his own, man."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, agreed. But you're still wrong."
