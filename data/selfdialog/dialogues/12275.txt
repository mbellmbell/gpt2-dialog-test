"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ do you think the Seahawks will win their division this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do.  I don't think that they will have too much trouble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think that Arizona will challenge them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, though I think they will do better then San Francisco will"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, probably.  What about the Rams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have improved but I think they still need a piece or two before they are a challenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where do you think they need to improve?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At quarterback and Defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are pretty strong now with their offensive line and running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  But I think Seattle will have no problem beating all them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you see any challenges in the rest of the NFC for Seattle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There will be a couple I think.  Like Carolina and the Lions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't forget about Green bay. They are always there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  Rogers is still at the helm so anything can happen there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the NFC East.  They are usually pretty tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  I think that the Giants may be there and who know's about Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's hard to say which Cowboy team will show up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or if any will now that they are all getting suspended or arrested."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  Well, don't count out their new quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think it will be an issue for the Hawks this year."
