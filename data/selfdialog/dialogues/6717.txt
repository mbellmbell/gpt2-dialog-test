"__STAR_WARS__ Do you remember the forest chase scene in Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The one where they're riding the speeders?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's the one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah man, that was like the coolest scene when I was a kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it was Luke and Leia riding together right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, and then Luke jumps onto his own speeder"
"__STAR_WARS__ But then he eventually falls off"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well jumps off, yes"
"__STAR_WARS__ And then takes out his green lightsaber"
"__STAR_WARS__ And chops off the front part of the speeder which causes him to crash."
