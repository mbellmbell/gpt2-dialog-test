"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how long do you think Brady will play for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  What do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He says he wants to play until 45."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I don't think he will be able to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  He is 40 now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Five years is a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had an incredible season at age 39."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He missed 4 games though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It wasn't due to injury though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it is still less hits to his body."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He eats well and get to bed early every night."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The decline happens fast though.  Look at Peyton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he had neck surgery."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but it could happen to Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he has been hurt since he broke his leg over a decade ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but if he does get hurt the body doesn't heal itself as good and fast at that age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  He is usually able to get the ball out quick so he doesn't get hit a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think New England will keep him for 5 years.  He might get traded."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might with their good backup there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, New England doesn't want to pay big money for a guy to sit on the bench so one of them will have to go."
