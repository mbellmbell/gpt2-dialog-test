"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the movie Old Yeller?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it a few times when I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it a Disney movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so."
"__MOVIES__ They did a lot of those old live actions, didn't they?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think they shifted more toward cartoons in the 80s."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they still do live action films."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, but they have tons of cartoons."
"__MOVIES__ You are right.  Back then, they'd release animated films like once a year."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, if that often."
"__MOVIES__ Now they have at least one animated project per year."
"__MOVIES__ And less of the live action films."
"__MOVIES__ You can't really say that Disney is failing in either area though."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I like some of the cartoons from the seventies and eighties."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, like stuff you grew up watching?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I like their version of Robin Hood."
"__MOVIES__ They had an animated version of that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was great."
