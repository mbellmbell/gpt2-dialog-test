"__MOVIES__ Do you like remakes of old classic movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do like some."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, have you seen the remake of Amityville Horror?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Ryan Reynolds?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! He plays George Lutz."
"__MOVIES__ I have seen that! He played the part SO well!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree, and I think it was way better than the original."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie called IT?"
"__MOVIES__ The one with the killer clown?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is based on a book by Stephen King."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have, that movie was so creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know they have been in the process of making it again?"
"__MOVIES__ No way, when does it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe in September of 2017, you must watch some of the trailers."
"__MOVIES__ Does it look scary like the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say yes, the trailers show that the movie follows the original almost scene for scene."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if it will be as long as the original, I remember that was a very long movie."
"__MOVIES__ I would hope so, in order to capture the original I would think it would be just as long."
"__MOVIES__ We must go watch it when it comes out then!"
