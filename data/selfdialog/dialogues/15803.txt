"__ROCK__ Do you think Bruce Springsteen will put out a new album?"
"__ROCK__ I think he will but I'm sure he's enjoying just touring and relaxing."
"__ROCK__ True, I just love hearing new stuff from him and seeing where his head is at."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of High Hopes though."
"__ROCK__ Agreed, though that was more of a collection of covers and random songs."
"__ROCK__ Wrecking Ball on the other hand though, wow what an amazing record."
"__ROCK__ Wrecking Ball is one of his best outputs ever, which is awesome considering how late it came in his career."
"__ROCK__ Truly a masterpiece, especially after the weaker Working On A Dream."
"__ROCK__ Yeah Working On A Dream was pretty soft and weak."
"__ROCK__ But I think in contrast and in recession to Wrecking Ball, it's almost perfect."
