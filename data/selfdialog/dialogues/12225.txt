"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh my God, I am getting so excited about the Saints season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. But I'm looking at everything with cautious optimism."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally get it. I am too. When you finished 7-9 the past three seasons, you can't overly excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately, I do tend to get overly excited, and it seems to always lead to disappointment"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we were spoiled when we won the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, we got used to winning. And we expected it to be that way every year from that point on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We did have a couple of good seasons after that but then things started going south."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we did have a lot of injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. But all teams have injuries. I'm sure the Patriots have injuries every year, but they seem to have people that can step right in and play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really excited to see Adrian Peterson in action."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. I think he and Mark Ingram make a great pair. I just hope they can both stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And let's not forget Drew Brees. I honestly have so much confidence in him. He's getting older, sure, but I still think he has a few years before he calls it quits."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This will be an interesting year for both he and Sean Payton. If we have another losing season, Payton's gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Brees? Won't he be a free agent?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. I would not be surprised if we draft a quarterback in the 2018 draft, and not just a back-up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew's heir apparent?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and the day Drew is no longer with the Saints is the day is go into a very deep depression."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this whole city will go into a deep depression."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we can't think about that now. We have to think about the upcoming season. And that first game against the Vikings. Oh my God, we have got to win that first game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. And can you imagine the hype, with AP returning to Minnesota. Plus it's Monday Night Football. I can't wait."
