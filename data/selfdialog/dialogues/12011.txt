"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Stafford is my favorite quarterback in the NFL, he just knows how to win games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's been a long time since a Detroit Lions fan could say that about their quarterback. Stafford definitely has been looking really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch the games last year against Green Bay as well as the final stretch of the games to end the season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I did, Stafford was awesome in those games. He basically willed them to those wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He needs more offensive weapons though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't like their current wide receivers or running backs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm okay with them because they're still young and growing. Another year of experience and this season we'll see if they truly are game changers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're offensive line is really good! One of the best in the NFL in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree the Lions have a really good offensive line. That's why Stafford gets to do what he does so well because of the time he gets from his offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Darius Slay looks good for them too and he's coming back stronger than before I heard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Darius is one of the games best cornerbacks. I always feel confident when he's on the opponents best wide receivers. I know he challenged Julio Jones well when they matched up and he's such a game changer forcing turnovers in the secondary too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like him and think the Lions really did well finding him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marvin Jones and Golden Tate are returning so that's promising for me. I thought they did really good as the Lions main wide receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Golden Tate was always dependable in Seattle for the Seahawks. I'm glad to see him get to be the main guy over there in Detroit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he's been terrific for Stafford. He's always getting open or he'll come back to help Stafford on broken plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've seen him bail the Lions out of so many broken offensive plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marvin Jones really spaces and spreads the field so Golden Tate gets a lot of room to operate underneath."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People are sleeping on Eric Ebron. When he was healthy he was one of the best tight ends in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he can stay healthy this season. It'll help out the Lions a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see the Lions probably going 10-6 this season and fighting for that playoff spot."
