"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Finding Dory?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I took my kids to see it last week."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved it! I think that it was as good as Finding Nemo. Maybe better."
"__DISNEY__ That is a very bold assessment. Finding Nemo is a classic."
"__DISNEY__ Well, the story was very sweet and heart warming. Ellen as Dory is the best thing in the world."
"__DISNEY__ I had heard that from other friends. Is it a tear jerker?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but more over it was very funny."
"__DISNEY__ Would you recommend Finding Dory for me then?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. I would go so far as to say buying the bluray is worth the cost."
