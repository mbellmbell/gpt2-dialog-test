"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite position in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think quarterbacks are overrated, but otherwise I kind of like receivers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wide receivers only, or receivers in general?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think in general, since a lot of positions receive passes pretty regularly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some of my favorite plays are running backs receiving passes when no one expects it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I remember a 49ers game several years back where Alex Smith passed to Frank Gore and he was wide open"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sometimes the smaller guys can slip through the cracks and make big plays"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's how Darren Sproles has been so successful over the years despite being below average size"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone under six feet is considered small in the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even Russell Wilson is called short, and yet it aids his elusiveness on the field"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to think of someone so agile like that as just a quarterback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what makes me conflicted about quarterbacks, since in the past they've generally been more one-dimensional"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tight ends are another position that require versatility, since they both block and receive passes"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rob Gronkowski is a beast of a player as a tight end, and he's huge so blocking isn't much of an issue"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only downside is that his size makes him slower on the field"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Slower, but not necessarily easier to stop when you see him dragging defenders several yards like they're nothing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now I'd like to see more tight ends like that, although Travis Kelce and Martellus Bennett make a good case for themselves"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, and so does Jason Witten, another guy who isn't super fast but who always knows how to get open"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the position isn't quite as important as defying expectations after all"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yes, hybrid players have been all the rage on defense, and I can't wait to see who surprises us next"
