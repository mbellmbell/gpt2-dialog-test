"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you name the greatest NFL football players of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?  You are the biggest fan of the sport that I know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The game has changed so much over the years that you cannot name one player as the best of 'All time'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. So it's not so easy.  But you can give it a try!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And there are 22 different positional roles, each with a specialized set of skills and experience making them best for that role.  The best quarterback might be the worst defensive end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. I get your point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the position foquarterback is differnt on each team.  While each quarterbacks call plays, hike, hand off, and throw the ball, each team has their own style of play that makes the QB position different on that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, it's a tough task. I get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A quarterback playing on a team that throws the ball most of the time is different than a quarterback on a team that runs the ball most of the time.  They need a different body type and skill set to accomodate the offensive strategy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright. I get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the mindset of an offensive lineman is quite different than a defensive lineman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the left tackle needs different physical features than the free safety!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. I'll never ask you again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not to mention that the fullback and tailback are uniquely gifted to fill diferent roles in an offense!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok....Ok already!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And some of the best players only played a few years, while other players proved their worth based on steady, reliable, long careers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I give up. You don't have to tell me who the best player of all time was!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But all things considered, I would say Joe Montana was the best.  Hey, where are you going?"
