"__STAR_WARS__ Who is the most annoying person in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it would be Young Anakin"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it's just his acting but he is so over the top with everything"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, like during his pod race?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah he seems so fake."
"__STAR_WARS__ He got a little better though, he wasn't always so inexperienced with his acting"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what that actor is up to now!"
"__STAR_WARS__ He hasn't been in any movies that I know of!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked him in Star Wars, he was just a little kid. I should cut him some slack"
