"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the Dodgers game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it was pretty good."
"__BASEBALL__ It's nice to see Puig producing."
"__BASEBALL__ I had a feeling he would. He's finally getting serious."
"__BASEBALL__ He has another year left on his contract too."
"__BASEBALL__ He needs to realize that he can make some serious money if he gets his act together."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, if he does then all the better for the Dodgers right now."
"__BASEBALL__ His contract is pretty team friendly right now. Only 6 million a year."
"__BASEBALL__ That's why they were willing to put up will all his nonsense. He has value."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see Turner get hurt?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, hopefully it's not too bad."
"__BASEBALL__ At least they have a lot of depth to sort it out."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, there's a bunch of good players that are stuck in AAA because of it."
"__BASEBALL__ They'll just keep rotating guys up and down from the big club."
"__BASEBALL__ Just like they did last year with the pitchers."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they didn't care if they were great or not. As long as they ate up innings,"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, it kind of worked out for them last  year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they had a lot of pitchers hurt and just filled in the gaps with guys up for one start and then back down."
"__BASEBALL__ Either way, management seems to have things under control."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they've planned well."
