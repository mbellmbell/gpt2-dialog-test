"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you consider incomplete to be mediocre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My basis for good includes preseason appearances which he excelled in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course that might not translate when facing the regulars, but apples to apples would indicate a good QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if you think Good requires Franchise QB level play for several years, then I think your standard is a bit high."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm pleased with the QB situation and am anxious to see where things go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If we win half our first six games, then we are in great shape with a distinctly unfavorable schedule to begin the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Watson hasn't even thrown a pass yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will take no touchdown passes over no passes at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lol Watson needs time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either that or he's gonna run a lot to extend plays/generate offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dont want him getting hit like Cam or RG 3rd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bingo! Or worse like Carr, the hits and sacks he took ruined him for the rest of his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even the OL we have now could have helped see if he was as good as advertised."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's football so he's going to get hit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now if you really want him to be protected. Then put him in flag football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ preseason is basically vanilla all across the board."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The game against Dallas he couldn't even read the defense against 3rd and 4th stringers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the game he got hurt in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Savage is a good quarterback. That's my opinion after watching all his film."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I concur ! After watching Osweiller all season, the superiority of Savage was ultra - obvious when he took the reins."
