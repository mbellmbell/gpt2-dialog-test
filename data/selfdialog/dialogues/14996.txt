"__ACTION__ Did you get a chance to see John Wick, Chapter 2?"
"__ACTION__ Yea, but I didn't really like it."
"__ACTION__ Oh, that's too bad. Why not?"
"__ACTION__ Well, it just wasn't as cool as the first one."
"__ACTION__ I thought it was better than the first. It had way more assasins in it."
"__ACTION__ Yea that's true, and that fight scene with Keanu Reeves and Common was pretty good."
"__ACTION__ Yea! That was awesome."
"__ACTION__ I guess it wasn't so bad afterall."
"__ACTION__ Yea, and the next one looks like it will be even better."
"__ACTION__ That's true, the next could be pretty good."
