"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite bubble gum pop princess of the 80's?"
"__MUSIC__ That is either Tiffany or Debbie Gibson."
"__MUSIC__ Those two where definitely bubble gum."
"__MUSIC__ Tiffany's music was not as good as Debbie Gibson's though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah Debbie wrote all her music and played the piano in her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, she is very talented."
"__MUSIC__ I actually like the song Electric Youth."
"__MUSIC__ It had a fun keyboard solo in hit."
"__MUSIC__ Tiffany redid a lot of other hits like I think we're alone now."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that was a Beetle's song."
"__MUSIC__ She did a good job with it though."
"__MUSIC__ It is tough to redo a classic especially a Beetle's song."
"__MUSIC__ I actually didn't know it was a redo until someone told me."
"__MUSIC__ See that is what I mean, Debbie Gibson was original."
"__MUSIC__ So then Debbie Gibson would probably be your favorite pop bubble gum princess."
"__MUSIC__ I guess if I have to go with plain originality, then yes."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, that makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ Yep she is a more talented artist."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite by her is Shake Your Love."
"__MUSIC__ I prefer Out of the Blue."
