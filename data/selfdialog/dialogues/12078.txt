"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a Ravens fan at all but they got a real good one in Baldwin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm mad the Browns didn't get him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a worker and was trained by the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he could fight his way on the field like Norwell last year for Carolina."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did Michael Bennet fall so far in the draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it was a combination of his weight and lingering injury concerns. If a guy slips 10 spots in the first round you can chalk it up to some teams being dumb or missing out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But all the teams passed up on him..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then we have to take our homer glasses off and accept the possibility that they all saw something they didn't like."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just goes to show you, even guys who truly believe they are not homers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I try not to be blinded by the homer glasses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think it was homerism; these things happen sometimes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Simply not a lot of need for the position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bennett will get his chance to shine for the Jags."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess his ability to embarrass offensive guards with his speed wasn't replicable in this draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ C'mon man, that's the kind of homer talk we were just discussing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't help it..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You also have to consider that Bennett had a hamstring problem that teams got to evaluate the combine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And after all those teams pass, the players show up and end up starting"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wasn't flashy, but he put tailbacks on their butts behind the line of scrimmage with regularity last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will say he was where he was supposed to be a lot of times. And that is all that counts"
