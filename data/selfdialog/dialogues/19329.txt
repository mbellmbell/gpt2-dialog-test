"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite movie from the 1980s?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say one of the first two Back To The Future movies."
"__MOVIES__ Do either of them stand out as your absolute favorite from that decade?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say Back To The Future 2."
"__MOVIES__ That is a great movie. It is amazing that in some ways the were kind of accurate to what 2015 and later years would be like."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah their prediction was definitely more futuristic then what actually happened."
"__MOVIES__ Yet at the same time they accurately predicted our reliance on technology."
"__MOVIES__ You are right. It was amazing how accurate they were with video conferencing and how big it would be."
"__MOVIES__ Who do you think is the better actor in this movie: Michael Fox or Chris Lloyd?"
"__MOVIES__ They both did an excellent job in all three movies. This one in particular I think Fox did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ I agree that he was great in this movie. He had to play himself at different ages and as different people and did an excellent job."
"__MOVIES__ Lloyd was my favorite in this first movie but yeah Fox was great in this one."
"__MOVIES__ None of them would have been great without both actors though."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree with that point."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think Back To The Future 3 was necessary?"
"__MOVIES__ I do think it was necessary and kind of wished they also made a Back To The Future 4."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree and think that the series could have even stopped at the end of the second movie if the ending was slightly modified."
"__MOVIES__ The ending of the third movie was great though I was left wondering what happened next."
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely a cliffhanger. As long as Marty ends up happy but that wasn't exactly assured to the fans."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that is what I was hoping they would do but you see there is a chance he may still not be happy."
