"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how do you think your Raiders are going to do this upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they should be able to make the playoffs again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, assuming everyone stays healthy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I hope Marshawn will still live up to the Beast Mode name"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should as he's representing his home town now"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But we'll see if he still has it from the first few games"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as the O-Line holds up, it should be good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carr signed a massive contract extension, do you think it was worth it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, he's still young and is still constantly improving"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's a very smart QB and has the potential to be great"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a great wide receivver corp too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did pick up Cordarrelle Patterson, I think that's a great addition"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, Carr should pick up right where he left off before his injury last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what's your record prediciton for them this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll go 11-5"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm guessing around there too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chiefs will probably battle with them for the division lead"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good prediciton, I gotta go. I'll catch you later!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, see you!"
