"__ROCK__ Hey, did you go see Weezer's recent show?"
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah, it was awesome."
"__ROCK__ Really? I thought they aren't so good live."
"__ROCK__ Oh no, they did a sweet rendition of Surf Wax America mashed up with Holiday."
"__ROCK__ That sounds like it would be really weird."
"__ROCK__ It kind of was, but it sounded fantastic. They also played El Scorcho and Say It Ain't So."
"__ROCK__ Did they play newer music too?"
"__ROCK__ Of course. They played Beverly Hills."
"__ROCK__ What do you think of their new hit about summer?"
"__ROCK__ Feels Like Summer? I love the melody."
