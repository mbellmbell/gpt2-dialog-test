"__MUSIC__ What's the best album of the 2000s?"
"__MUSIC__ Tough question. If you asked me a few years ago I would say Funeral by The Arcade Fire."
"__MUSIC__ That one was one of my tops for the period from 2000-2010, but I don't know if it has aged as well as I thought it would."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I mean, I still love it, but it hasn't aged great for me."
"__MUSIC__ So what's your favorite album of the 2000s so far?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's To Pimp a Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy album! I think it'll go down as being his magnum opus."
"__MUSIC__ It's just so well done. It's black music, there's jazz, there's soul, there's r&b, there's that Compton sound, but there's also stories and poetry."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I had this feeling that he sounds like a beat poet at times. I'm thinking of Fo Free specifically."
"__MUSIC__ Great song. The album has such great emotional depth too."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, U is one of the most depressing but revealing songs I've ever heard by any artist."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's not simply I like this girl and she doesn't like me back."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it's about serious self-doubt and criticism and depression."
"__MUSIC__ He's completely inverting the stereotype of the rapper as needing to be confident at all times."
"__MUSIC__ Which is a very healthy thing. There's more to life than being able to boast."
"__MUSIC__ That's for sure. I think that To Pimp A Butterfly is the best, what's yours?"
"__MUSIC__ Call me out of touch, but my pick is from 2001."
"__MUSIC__ Amnesiac by Radiohead?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, it's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by Wilco. That album does it for me, it's noisy and experimental, but has real depth to it."
"__MUSIC__ I spent a lot of time with that record in college. Nice pick!"
