"__HORROR__ I just saw this great horror movie called Lights Out."
"__HORROR__ I did not see that yet, is that the one with the blind man hunting people down?"
"__HORROR__ No, that is Don't Breathe. Lights Out is way better."
"__HORROR__ What is it about?"
"__HORROR__ A young woman from a dysfunctional family reluctantly goes back to help her kid brother face a supernatural threat, while her mentally ill mother resists her."
"__HORROR__ Is it a haunted house movie?"
"__HORROR__ Not exactly. The being can appear in different places, but only when the lights are out."
"__HORROR__ That sounds like a childhood nightmare come to life! What is Don't Breathe about then?"
"__HORROR__ Don't Breathe is the one with the blind man who turns out the lights to track some young thieves in his house."
"__HORROR__ Okay, I think I know the difference now."
