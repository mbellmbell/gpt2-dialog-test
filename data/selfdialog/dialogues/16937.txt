"__MOVIES__ How many different actor played the batman in the recent times, anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ Define the 'recent' times."
"__MOVIES__ I knew you were gonna do that. Batman comics began in 1939. The TV show was in the 60s."
"__MOVIES__ It ran from 1966 to 1968."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and then in the 90s, we had George Clooney."
"__MOVIES__ No, we had MIchael Keaton as the first reincarnation of the Batman in 1989."
"__MOVIES__ Oh Yeah. Michael Keaton as the action hero, whoda thunk?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, he made 2 movies, and then Val Kilmer played one and then George Clooney stepped in."
"__MOVIES__ And then the trilogy began."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, with Christian Bale."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know who I like the best."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we have Ben Afleck who plays batman in the other series, Batman vs Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I don't like that series too much. it's just not believable."
"__MOVIES__ What's there not to believe?"
"__MOVIES__ the whole ailen superhero gets killed because of this one rock from his home planet, oh my god, the Kryptonite. If their home world blew up how can they even have the rock?"
"__MOVIES__ it's the remnant from the blow up. Only because it blew up doesn't mean the matter disappeared."
"__MOVIES__ So what you're saying is someone actually went and mined the blown up Krypton to find Kryptonite? Oh please, that's so stupid."
"__MOVIES__ Not stupid at all."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we got it in meteor shower, so, there. Not stupid at all."
