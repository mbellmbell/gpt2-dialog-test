"__MUSIC__ What's that that you're listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ This is Rob Crow's new album. Good stuff, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like it. I thought it was Pinback though?"
"__MUSIC__ Rob Crow is the guy who does most of the singing in Pinback, so you weren't far off."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, nice! I can pretty much always enjoy some Pinback."
"__MUSIC__ I think they're super underrated. They don't put out albums that often, but pretty much everything they've released is really good."
"__MUSIC__ So Rob Crow has a some solo stuff too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. He's actually got like 3-4 solo albums out."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, sounds like he's fairly prolific, between those albums and Pinback."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and it's all pretty good stuff. The solo stuff is kind of Pinback-lite, but since Pinback only puts albums out like once every five years, I'll take it."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, true. Here's one for you: have you heard of MacDemarco?"
"__MUSIC__ I keep hearing his name. He seems like a goofball."
"__MUSIC__ He is, but it's mostly pretty endearing. His music isn't super goofy."
"__MUSIC__ What's it like?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly it's this chilled out pop/indie music. Very solid melodies."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll check him out."
"__MUSIC__ Start with 'Salad Days'; I think that's his best one."
"__MUSIC__ How many albums does he have?"
"__MUSIC__ Four albums and an EP."
"__MUSIC__ OK, so he's actually been around for a while, I guess."
