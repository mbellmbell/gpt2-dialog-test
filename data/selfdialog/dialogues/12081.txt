"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ None of those teams have any chance of going to the Superbowl anytime soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a big maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i think it's more important to look at the point allowed compared to points made."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean obviously. The Saint no 2 in terms of points scored per game with 29.3 points/game, but they give up 28.4 points/game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And look at Partiots. They give up 15.6 points/game while scoring 27.6 points/game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how did Falcons do last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They gave up 25.4 points/game, but got 33.8 points/game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ which explains why they were able to lead the Pats in the superbowl by 25 points initially."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yep. It's an offense powerhouse, but defense wise, they need work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obvioiusly. otherwise, Brady woldn't have been able to mke the biggest comeback in history"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We should watch that game again. It's on youtube."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The full game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. Guess the NFL learned a valuable lesson of allowing full games tobe viewed on youtube."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Revenue from youtube is better than no revenue from youtube. It IS a valuable lesson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know this points against vs points for is meaningless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's at least something to go on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But look at the total, Pats are no 2, and Falcons are no 1, with Cowboys not far behind. I think win percent is a better marker"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, because divisions have different strength of schedule. Win percent depends on that also. Pats have the highest win percent and Cowboys are the second. Anythgin can happen in the post season."
