"__BASKETBALL__ The biggest joke of a franchise has got to be the Knicks."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah Phil Jackson hasn't earned any of that big money he is receiving."
"__BASKETBALL__ What an absolutely embarrassing time to be a Knicks fan."
"__BASKETBALL__ They have totally disrespected Carmelo Anthony. Though he has brought some of this on himself."
"__BASKETBALL__ How can you say that? The guy is doing all he can!"
"__BASKETBALL__ No I don't think so. I think Carmelo is a team killer. He has to share in this blame."
"__BASKETBALL__ Carmelo is a scorer that's what he does. He has done his part."
"__BASKETBALL__ What about the other areas of basketball? Defense, rebounding, team leadership? He's failed in all of those categories!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree he has come up short in those areas."
"__BASKETBALL__ And those are large areas. Carmelo is not someone you can build a team around"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe. But I like to see him around a different supporting cast.."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think you would see the same result"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe. Maybe not. I think Carmelo has been dogged so much about Phil Jackson that he's been tainted."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree Phil did do some damage, but Melo didn't have the best reputation before."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well they drafted Porzingis who seems like a keeper. They probably want to build around him."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm sure that's the plan going forward"
"__BASKETBALL__ I definitely think Carmelo needs to move on"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he needs to see if he can go to a team and win a championship"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I think it's not or never for him"
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too. He is not getting any younger"
