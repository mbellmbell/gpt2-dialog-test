"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so confused.  Who was Han Solo's dad?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh?  What are you talking about."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was his dad?  They never say in any movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why does that matter?  I don't get what you're trying to get at."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be great to know his backstory.  They focused on everyone else's."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's a movie coming out next year talking about his origin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh really?  Okay, that's good to know."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's even called Han Solo just so you know it's about him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh sweet.  When is that coming out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ May I believe.  Should be pretty cool!"
