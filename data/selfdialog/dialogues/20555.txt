"__MOVIES__ Definitely better that Pulp Fiction. For one, it was much more innovative."
"__MOVIES__ How can you say that? Hateful Eight was so imaginative."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if you consider the time period in which Pulp Fiction was shot and released, the 1990s, it was definitely ahead of it's time."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I can't disagree with that. But Hateful Eight is by far his best film."
"__MOVIES__ What about Reservoir Dogs?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, now that you mention it, that was his best film. I completely forgot about that."
"__MOVIES__ I don't blame you. Tarantino has so many awesome films that it's hard to keep them straight."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know the local theater is screening some of his films this weekend? Planet Terror, Grindhouse, Kill Bill --"
"__MOVIES__ Which Kill Bill?"
"__MOVIES__ Both of them."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome! I've never seen Kill Bill Volume Two."
"__MOVIES__ You're missing out! For me, it's definitely better than Volume One. The story is much more easy to follow."
"__MOVIES__ What about the fight scenes?"
"__MOVIES__ Epic, man. So epic. By far, the best fight scenes in any movie produced after 1990. Except maybe Inglorious Basterds."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I loved that movie. So dark, but definitely relevant to the times today."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. Brad Pitt was great in it. The whole ensemble was great, too."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what Tarantino is going to do next."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. But I'm sure whatever he does, I'll like it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
"__MOVIES__ See you at the theater!"
