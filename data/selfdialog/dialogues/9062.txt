"__BASEBALL__ I think the Cubs are starting to get a little too confident.  They got shut out again today."
"__BASEBALL__ It's only a matter of time before the bats start heating up."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm just worried that everyone is a bit too relaxed after the World Series win.  It's as if there's nothing to play for anymore."
"__BASEBALL__ Are you serious?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I mean Javi Baez and Wilson Contreras are swinging at everything."
"__BASEBALL__ That's only two guys."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but Rizzo and Bryant aren't putting the ball in play very much either.  Tons of strikeouts."
"__BASEBALL__ I understand, I think it's just too early to judge."
"__BASEBALL__ And then there's the starting pitching problem.  Arrieta got destroyed last time out."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm afraid he might be on the decline."
"__BASEBALL__ Think he's getting a big contract cuz we shouldn't give it to him."
"__BASEBALL__ He'll probably find a suitor, but I think we got his best two years ago."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree.  Lester still can't throw to first base, huh?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nope.  Absolutely incredible for such an elite pitcher."
"__BASEBALL__ It blows my mind every time I watch him."
"__BASEBALL__ You think he'd practice in the offseason or something."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, apparently the organization isn't too concerned.  I'm worried it will bite him one day."
"__BASEBALL__ I feel like it does one way or another in every start."
"__BASEBALL__ Good thing we have four other good starters."
"__BASEBALL__ That's for sure."
