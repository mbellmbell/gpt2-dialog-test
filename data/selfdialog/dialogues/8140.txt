"__POP__ I was really interested in how well Ariana Grande's Manchester show did to help raise money for the bombing victims, so I went to look it up online."
"__POP__ I heard it was a sold-out show. With Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, and Katy Perry joining Ariana, I can imagine those tickets sold really fast."
"__POP__ Yeah, and you know those people are going to need a lot of financial help, funerals, medical bills, follow up care."
"__POP__ So how much did the show raise?"
"__POP__ That was what was confusing. The first ten results on the Google page all showed different results."
"__POP__ Was it because of the difference in dollars and euros?"
"__POP__ No. It said in millions- $13, E2, $9, E2.35, $3, $12, $2.6, $3, and E10. The numbers were all over the place."
"__POP__ That seems strange. You would figure tickets sales would be a pretty static number."
"__POP__ Unless they are somehow adding other donations in there. But it makes it seem suspicious that no one is reporting the same number."
"__POP__ Maybe they just have really bad press communications."
