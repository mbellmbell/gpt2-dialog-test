"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new live-action Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I did see it, but I wasn't the biggest fan."
"__DISNEY__ Why didn't you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ It didn't seem to have the same magic as the animated version."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it did. Why did you think that?"
"__DISNEY__ The songs just weren't the same and I think Emma Watson's acting was a bit flat."
"__DISNEY__ I loved Emma Watson in it!"
"__DISNEY__ She just didn't capture Belle from the animated version very well."
"__DISNEY__ I still think she did a decent job. Oh well, I guess you'll always have the original then."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I won't be adding the new one to my collection anytime soon."
