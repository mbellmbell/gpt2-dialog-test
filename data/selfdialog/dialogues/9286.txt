"__BASEBALL__ The Philadelphia Phillies are a joke!"
"__BASEBALL__ They are one of the worst teams in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't think I would spend 5 dollars to go watch them play"
"__BASEBALL__ They are an awful team with a notoriously bad lineup"
"__BASEBALL__ Their pitching sucks really bad as well. They are just a hard team to watch!"
"__BASEBALL__ I would rather watch curling on TV then to be subjected to their play."
"__BASEBALL__ Right now this team and organization are an embarrassment."
"__BASEBALL__ I just think it is amazing how fast a team can sink back into mediocrity"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it's hard to believe that there was a time when this team was amazing."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah this team used to have a lot of swagger, but now they are pathetic to watch."
"__BASEBALL__ We are less than 40 games into the season and they are already 10 games under 500."
"__BASEBALL__ They have lost 8 out of their last 10 and I don't see that turning around any time soon."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess on the bright side they are playing .500 ball at home."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they struggled horribly on the road and they have played more road games to this point."
"__BASEBALL__ But it won't matter, this team is just not good."
"__BASEBALL__ Very true. It's bad when the season is already over and you just got started."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah this is an organization that needs to start over from scratch."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah this team won't be good for a long, long time."
"__BASEBALL__ But you never know, things can change fast in sports."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe, but it's going to take some divine intervention to change this team around."
