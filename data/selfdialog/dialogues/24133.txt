"__SUPERHERO__ What's the most recent Marvel movie you've seen?"
"__SUPERHERO__ The Avengers: Age of Ultron. I loved it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too. I loved the character of Ultron. He was so much like Tony Stark it was funny."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, Tony Stark if he was much more arrogant than he is.  It's funny that Ultron really believed he was doing good."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's how most villains think. I love Scarlett Johannsen as Black Widow. I loved her in Lucy too."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes that was a great movie. She was the only one who didn't attempt to pick up Thor's hammer in Age of Ultron."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right. It makes me wonder if she would have been able to pick it up had she tried."
"__SUPERHERO__ Vision was able to pick it up with no problem I thought that was awesome."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too. That scene where they were all trying to pick it up was hilarious."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes it was. I couldn't help trying to calculate how much monetary damage they caused in that movie alone."
