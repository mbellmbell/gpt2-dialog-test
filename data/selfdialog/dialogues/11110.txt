"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited for the NFL to start in the fall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am! Training camp starts in just a few weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is looking good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I am a Giants fan, and I am getting worried about Eli Manning's age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, I feel like he has been around for awhile"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he is 36 years old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is pretty old for an NFL player!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really is. Hopefully he can get us to the playoffs one more time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am more of a Redskins fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I don't know much about the Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They weren't too great last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was their record?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They went 8-7 and had one tie actually, which is pretty rare."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that is weird! Who did they tie?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They tied the Bengals in week eight at the game played in London."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I remember hearing that London might get an NFL team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I heard that too. I'm not sure what is happening with that, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. That would be pretty cool though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'd love for the NFL to be more international."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. It would be awesome if other European nations created teams too."
