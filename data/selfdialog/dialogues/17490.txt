"__MOVIES__ So, I watched Good Will Hunting again last night."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ On the whole, yeah. I mean, the cast gives a great performance."
"__MOVIES__ Robin Williams and Matt Damon are both great in it."
"__MOVIES__ They are! But there's this one thing that bothers me."
"__MOVIES__ What is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know the scene, where Matt Damon goes up to the window and asks 'Do you like apples.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember that. It's a very iconic scene."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it goes well in the movie, but it didn't feel very believable."
"__MOVIES__ Because it's too outlandish."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is silly, but my problem comes when I think about what would have happened if he had said 'I don't like apples.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh. It'd turn awkward really quickly. But most people like apples."
"__MOVIES__ I guess. But it bothered me. It brought me out of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Were you able to enjoy it anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I was. The plot is just so magnetic."
"__MOVIES__ The ending is also very satisfying."
"__MOVIES__ It is. I really feel for the characters."
"__MOVIES__ It's tough to make a movie like that come full circle."
"__MOVIES__ If it wasn't for the great acting, it couldn't have happened."
"__MOVIES__ Thankfully it did!"
