"__DISNEY__ My kids loved Disney movies when they were growing up. And I'd sit down and watch them over and over with them."
"__DISNEY__ Mine too. I would think that I would just sit down for a second and then an hour later I was still watching."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. Especially Lion King or Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I loved those. I also loved the really old ones like Lady and the Tramp."
"__DISNEY__ We still have VHS tapes of those movies."
"__DISNEY__ We do too. I don't know what to do with them."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. I can't get rid of them for some reason and nobody watches VHS anymore."
"__DISNEY__ The Disney VHS are the only ones I have kept."
"__DISNEY__ We have some DVDs too but most of ours are VHS."
"__DISNEY__ We'll have to pass them on to our kids and let them worry about getting rid of them."
