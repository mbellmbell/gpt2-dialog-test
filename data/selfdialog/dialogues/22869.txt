"__DISNEY__ Are you a Disney movie fan?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! My favorite Disney movie is Moana."
"__DISNEY__ That's so funny - that's actually my favorite movie too!"
"__DISNEY__ Heihei the chicken is my favorite character - I love when he's hiding in the boat."
"__DISNEY__ The scene right before it was scary for me. I didn't like it when it was so stormy."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! I wasn't sure if she was going to make it, but good thing Maui was there."
"__DISNEY__ Maui's tattoos were awesome - I loved how they kept dancing around his body."
"__DISNEY__ Oh! I also loved when they would push him to do something, like be nice to Moana."
"__DISNEY__ The music was also so beautiful and catchy."
"__DISNEY__ I keep singing the song 'How Far I'll Go' and it gets stuck in my head!"
