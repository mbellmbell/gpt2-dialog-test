"__MUSIC__ Do you like Bruce Springstien?"
"__MUSIC__ Who doesn't?  He's the Boss."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, such a great performer.  All these years and he's still one of the big concerts on the block."
"__MUSIC__ I'd love to see one before he just gets over the hill."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too.  So what songs do you like from him?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Dancing in the Dark."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good one.  Kind of has this feeling of getting through being underprivileged."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I also like Born to Run."
"__MUSIC__ One of the best songs he made."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, seems the older I get the more I like him."
"__MUSIC__ Same here.  Like I understand the struggles in his music more."
"__MUSIC__ You know what else was good?"
"__MUSIC__ Born in the USA for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, just what I was thinking."
"__MUSIC__ I know, the subtlety of the song of both being grateful to be American but at the same time it's not as perfect as propaganda says."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I would like to hear a new one with updated issues."
"__MUSIC__ That would be pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Like about the things that have gone on in our lives recently you know?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, seems other than the occasional country song no one really covers it anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I agree, and then it's usually sunshine and happiness."
