"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will make it to the Super bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Steelers and Falcons have a good chance, how about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going to say the Cowboys and Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think the Cowboys can beat the Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it will come down to who has home field advantage in the playoff game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Dallas will have an off year, they're still a young team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have some great young players though, I think they'll be tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a tough schedule though but you never know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the AFC is definitely the Pats or Steelers though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Pittsburgh just has too many weapons though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they depend on if Bell gets hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's a little injury prone but probably best back in the league when he's healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah I agree but he's never healthy for long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got more protection this year though, so if him and Brown stay healthy I don't see anyone beating them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think Brady takes it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think wins it all though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Pats in a close game, how about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Pittsburgh takes it, I can't see any NFC team competing with the Pats or Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they can stay close but I agree the AFC is going to be tough to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's going to be a good season I think."
