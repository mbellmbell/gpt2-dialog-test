"__SUPERHERO__ Which actor portrayed the Joker the best?"

"__SUPERHERO__ Really? Not Heath Ledger?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Heath's performance was decent, but not that memorable to me."
"__SUPERHERO__ I disagree. Heath did a phenomenal portrayal of The Joker in The Dark Knight."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know a lot of people think that, but I don't see it that way."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why not? What makes Jack better than Heath?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, for starters he was more of a nut and more maniacal."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, what about Jared Leto in Suicide Squad?"
