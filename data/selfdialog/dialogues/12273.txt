"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys VS Rams opener."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts on it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, i think it's going to be a very uneventful game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, nomo Romo for starters, the Rams arent that great so....."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think it's gonna be a non excitement game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it will be so stereotypical that it will be tied at the end and whoever recieves the ball will win it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So a coin toss will determine that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's hard to hear."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sorry, but both teams need a serious reboot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any other teams in the same boat or worse off?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Jacksonville always."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are gonna get clobbered in the Pre-Season opener."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Giants and Jets are gonna struggle Pre-Season too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Giants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, there not bringing the excitement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking more like The Browns."
