"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think Derrick Rose is done?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well I mean he will keep playing basketball but I think MVP Rose is gone."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is such a shame he was so athletic and fun to watch."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, but all those knee surgeries and downtimes are really catching up with him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that same slashing speed seems to be gone."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's what I think too. Plus he is in Knicks purgatory now too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, no one comes back from that dark place."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah and they have two super ball dominant players running the triangle.  It makes no sense."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well it makes sense if it was 1990."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah and you had Michael Jordan to make it all look good."
"__BASKETBALL__ As good as Jordan was I think it was the fact that zone defense was illegal that made the zone viable."
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably. I wonder why they changed that rule."
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably because it made the game less fun to watch."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, that is the same reason they are going to get rid of the hack-a-Shaq."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think you are right but I wish they wouldn't."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why? It is so bad to watch."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree with that but it seems like ensuring you can hit free throws should not be too much to ask of NBA players."
"__BASKETBALL__ That makes sense but I just don't care.  I don't want to watch free throws anyways."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I think a lot of people feel like that."
"__BASKETBALL__ They do and that is why they are going to fix hack-a-Shaq with some rule change."
