"__POP__ What are your thoughts on the Biebs?"
"__POP__ Ah, the Biebs.  He's quite a character."
"__POP__ Yeah, but is he talented?"
"__POP__ I would say that he is quite talented.  Some music is better than other stuff."
"__POP__ He has really been able to ride waves well."
"__POP__ Yes, somehow he gets ahead of the wave and profits well."
"__POP__ Some of his stuff is garbage."
"__POP__ I agree, but some of his younger material was more relevant to that time period."
"__POP__ Would you let your young daughter listen to him?"
"__POP__ Now, that's a whole other conversation for another time."
