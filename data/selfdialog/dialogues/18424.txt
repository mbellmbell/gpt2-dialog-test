"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Inglorious Bastards?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, one of the best Terintino movies out there."
"__MOVIES__ That was awesome.  Brad Pitt cracked me up the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, we're here to do one thing.  Kill Nazis.  Haha."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that part about the Bear Jew.  He comes up with the bat."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that whole movie was one joke after another.  And good action."
"__MOVIES__ And the big bad, the German Guy he's a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was.  He knew all those languages."
"__MOVIES__ One of the funniest parts of the movie was when Brad Pitt was speaking Italian."
"__MOVIES__ I know, with that awful American accent."
"__MOVIES__ That was classic.  Then those other two guys went through and started shooting everyone."
"__MOVIES__ You know what else was great?  That last scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was one of the best parts."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite line 'You'll be shot for this'"
"__MOVIES__ 'No, probably chewed out.  I've been chewed out before.'"
"__MOVIES__ That was awesome.  How about the part where the German guy was so obsessed with the milk."
"__MOVIES__ That was pretty good too.  And when he wanted the cream for his dessert."
"__MOVIES__ That was good.  When the big bad has this odd normalcy to him that makes him extra creepy."
"__MOVIES__ I know, he was extra creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Of course he was a Nazis, and Nazis are always creepy."
