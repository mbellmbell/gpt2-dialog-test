"__MOVIES__ I want to go to the movie theater but I'm not sure what to see."
"__MOVIES__ You should see Rough Night!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I heard it wasn't very good."
"__MOVIES__ The reviews aren't great."
"__MOVIES__ Why should I see it then?"
"__MOVIES__ It's still funny! I don't like to pay attention to reviews before I see a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Why? They're so helpful."
"__MOVIES__ If it's a negative review, it ruins the movie for me."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I see. Who's in Rough Night?"
"__MOVIES__ It's such a good cast! Scarlet Johansson, Ilana Glazer, Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, and Zoe Kravitz."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a ton of good people."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're all so funny."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I will see it."
"__MOVIES__ Also, it's so nice to have a movie like that with a mostly all-female cast."
"__MOVIES__ That's true! Women can be so funny in those situations."
"__MOVIES__ I know. More filmmakers should make that sort of thing."
"__MOVIES__ I will see it then."
"__MOVIES__ Good! It's directed by a woman, too."
"__MOVIES__ That's so great!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you gotta see it."
