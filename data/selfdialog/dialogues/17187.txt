"__MOVIES__ Marley and Me had me crying."
"__MOVIES__ I think Marley and Me had everybody crying."
"__MOVIES__ I just wish it hadn't with Marley's awful life towards the end..."
"__MOVIES__ Eh. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to that movie about the marine and her dog though."
"__MOVIES__ Megan Leavey! It looks so good!"
"__MOVIES__ I just hope the dog doesn't die in it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, dogs die."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but I like that thing where it fades out and then it's the real picture of the dog and they tell you what happened to them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I wasn't even thinking of that-"
"__MOVIES__ It's less gut-wrenching that way."
"__MOVIES__ Totally. Lots of movies based on true stories do that, too, so it's super possible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I'll watch it anyway, though."
"__MOVIES__ Me too - you know there's a website that tells you if the dog dies in any given movie, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's hilarious. So I'm not the only one here?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not at all. Too many dog-lovers."
"__MOVIES__ I bet it got started after John Wick came out."
"__MOVIES__ Probably, haha. That was pretty brutal."
"__MOVIES__ It was. I don't like how so many movies with the dog dying are good."
"__MOVIES__ The writers are getting you where it hurts when a beloved dog dies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, actually I think you're right. It's kinda worse than people dying because it's not as common."
