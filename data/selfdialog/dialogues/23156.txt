"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I loved the new live action version!"
"__DISNEY__ I thought the actors were great. Emma Watson was a perfect Belle."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, her singing really surprised me. What did you think about Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ He was good, too. Did you know he was the guy from Downton Abbey?"
"__DISNEY__ Really? I didn't realize that! I couldn't tell under the costume."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's when I realized it. The effects when he changed back were really great."
"__DISNEY__ You're right; the special effects were really well done, and so were the songs."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I loved that they included the original songs and added new ones, too."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite song was the one by Celine Dion in the credits. That was a nice touch."
