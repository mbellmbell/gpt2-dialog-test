"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the Twilight movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I only saw the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Only the first one?  You didn't like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really.  I don't like Kristen Stewart's acting at all."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, she was perfect as Bella."
"__MOVIES__ I think she is just an emotionless actress.  I didn't want to see her anymore."
"__MOVIES__ So you didn't watch the other movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  I did read the books though."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like those?"
"__MOVIES__ I finished the series in a week."
"__MOVIES__ Wow.  So you never want to see the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope.  I just feel it would ruin the books for me."
"__MOVIES__ All because of Kristen Stewart?"
"__MOVIES__ Not totally.  She's a big part of it, but I didn't like the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about Robert Pattinson?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think he was worth swooning over."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, so you didn't like any of the actors?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought a lot of the characters did not match up to what I had in mind."
"__MOVIES__ Did any of the characters meet your expectations?"
"__MOVIES__ That Taylor guy was okay as Jacob I guess.  The vampires were pretty much off."
