"__LADY_GAGA__ Hey, you know what I haven't heard much about lately? Lady Gaga."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah? I mean, I guess I was still in middle school when she was really popular."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you ever listen to her non-pop-music stuff?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, I didn't have internet back then."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really? That's strange. But yeah, she sang with Tony Bennett once!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ That old guy? That's awesome! What's the name of the song?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ They did 'The Lady is a Tramp' together. It was really cute."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like her voice well enough, but I'm just not that into new-disco."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Definitely check out The Lady is a Tramp with them, then. She sounds like a lounge singer!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Sweet! I'll look up her newer stuff when I get home."
