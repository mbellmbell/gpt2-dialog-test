"__MOVIES__ What do you think is Martin Scorsese's best movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a tough one.  Where do you start?"
"__MOVIES__ You almost have to break it down by the decade."
"__MOVIES__ That would be one way of going about it."
"__MOVIES__ Let's make it easy and just say movies he's done in the last 20 years."
"__MOVIES__ I like that approach better."
"__MOVIES__ For me, I'd probably go with The Departed."
"__MOVIES__ That's a pretty solid choice.  I'd go with Wolf of Wall Street."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but The Departed won best picture."
"__MOVIES__ The best movie of the year sometimes doesn't though."
"__MOVIES__ I get that, but it was a well put together crime drama with some touches of humor and great characters and dialogue."
"__MOVIES__ And Wolf of Wall Street wasn't?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not saying it was a horrible movie, just not as good as The Departed."
"__MOVIES__ Wolf of Wall Street had an even better performance by Leo."
"__MOVIES__ He was good in that movie, not taking that away from him."
"__MOVIES__ The characters were also better and more memorable too.  Remember Matthew McConaughey's character?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the coked out stock broker at the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ That was a great, effective setup and an awesome performance in only five minutes."
"__MOVIES__ But that one scene doesn't make a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ You're missing the point here.  It's an example of why I like the movie more on a whole."
