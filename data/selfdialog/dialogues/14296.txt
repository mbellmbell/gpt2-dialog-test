"__HORROR__ What was your favorite horror movie that came out last year?"
"__HORROR__ Hush. You?"
"__HORROR__ Are you telling me to be quiet?"
"__HORROR__ No, the movie Hush. It's about a home invasion but the woman is a deaf-mute writer and has to survive."
"__HORROR__ Neat! My favorite was 10 Cloverfield Lane."
"__HORROR__ How much did that link up with Cloverfield?"
"__HORROR__ I know they said it's in a 'shared universe' but there was almost no connection."
"__HORROR__ Really? None?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, it seems like the invasion that happens was the same species that fell to earth in Cloverfield."
"__HORROR__ Seems good but I hate that it's the same 'universe' but doesn't work well. Kind of like Prometheus and Alien, right?"
