"__MUSIC__ Now that many of the female singers, I guess so-called divas, of earlier eras are gone, do you think there's anyone current who can take their place?"
"__MUSIC__ Take their place? Definitely not, but fill the diva role? Yes, I think so."
"__MUSIC__ Who is out there now though that even comes close?"
"__MUSIC__ Well you still have Celine Dion for starters."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but she's been around a long time. I'd consider her more one of the earlier divas."
"__MUSIC__ Well, how about Adele?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's a good point. I didn't think about that."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say she's the closest thing this generation has."
"__MUSIC__ She is really amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Her voice manages to be powerful and bold, but still unique."
"__MUSIC__ It amazes me that I thought she originally was going to be a one hit wonder with her first album."
"__MUSIC__ That's right. What was that song called?"
"__MUSIC__ Chasing Pavements. She released it as Adele Adkins."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that. I don't think I know anything else off of that first album."
"__MUSIC__ You probably aren't alone, but her second two turned into huge hits."
"__MUSIC__ They did! There are so many good songs on both of them."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't think anything could get better than what she did on the 21 album, but I think 25 might be even better."
"__MUSIC__ Hello was obviously the song that blew up first, but am in love with Water Under the Bridge."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good one, but I really like When We Were Young."
"__MUSIC__ I like it too. But I think I prefer when she's more upbeat because we don't hear it often!"
