"__MUSIC__ What ever happened to Dizzee Rascal?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, isn't he still making music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. I haven't heard anything new in a while."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmmm. Come to think of it, neither have I."
"__MUSIC__ And you listen to grime all the time."
"__MUSIC__ I do. Radio One for life."
"__MUSIC__ For life."
"__MUSIC__ So now I'm curious. What DID ever happen to Dizzee?"
"__MUSIC__ If I knew I wouldn't have asked, silly. I haven't heard anything from him since about a year after his concert."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, memories! That show was so fun."
"__MUSIC__ I know, we danced the whole night, remember that?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. And if I recall correctly he was doing some flirting up there on stage."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, indeed he was. Giving me and my droogs the old elevator eyes, am I right?"
"__MUSIC__ Right you are, matey. I think he rapped at us disrespectfully too though, so it kinda doesn't count."
"__MUSIC__ Eh. I guess not."
"__MUSIC__ Guys are dogs."
"__MUSIC__ For life."
"__MUSIC__ Still though. That was an excellent show and I haven't stopped loving grime."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither. No worse for the wear, anyway."
"__MUSIC__ So yeah. What ever happened to Dizzee Rascal?"
