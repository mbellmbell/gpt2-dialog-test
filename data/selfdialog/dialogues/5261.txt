"__STAR_WARS__ Of all the Star Wars movies, which one did you like the most?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think The first Star Wars movie remains my favorite. It introduced us to the space opera with wonderful characters that to this day remain relevant."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. I mean Luke Skywalker is going to be in the Last Jedi movie and Kylo Ren is Han Solo's son which makes Han Solo relevant despite his death."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish they hadn't killed him off so quickly after introducing him in the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess they wanted to continue the story with a new generation of Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rey will make a great Jedi but they need to show more of her powers than they did in the Force awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe that's the whole point of bringing Luke Skywalker back for the Last Jedi movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I doubt he'll be as funny as Yoda was with him in the Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ No one is as funny or as wise as Yoda!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It'll be interesting to see how Luke and Rey's relationship unfolds in The Last Jedi."
