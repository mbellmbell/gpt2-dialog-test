"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know what's going to happen to Brock Osweiler?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think Cleveland has talked about what they are going to do yet, but I bet at camp there will be good competition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, I was just worried they might just cut Osweiler before the season even begins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That wouldn't be very smart because he has good game experience and you never know with these young guys how they will do right out of college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right, but I wouldn't be surprised if he is playing backup this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure about that. Cody Kessler is not a starter caliber quarterback, it's too much for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't they draft someone this year, fairly year on?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they ended up with Deshone Kizer out of Notre Dame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, now I remember that. He went in the second round, which I thought was a steal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only time will tell if it was a good pick, but they didn't reach for him and he's talented, so I guess we will see during the preseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's always fun to watch the young quarterbacks be completely overwhelmed by the nfl level play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is, but Cleveland has been striking out at quarterback lately, so I think they are ready to win now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Brock can help them do that? It seems he had trouble in Houston with winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Houston was not the right fit for him. It didn't fit his style of quarterbacking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he was set up to fail in Houston because Bill O'Brien wasn't on board with his acquisition from day one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was definitely evident during the season. They had no chemistry whatsoever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had some good receivers there, but made such stupid mistakes. I can see why his coach was frustrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Denver was much better for him because Elway used his strengths."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Elway had practice since Peyton really looked awful his last season, but found a way to win enough games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Winning doesn't have to be pretty, teams just want that W!"
