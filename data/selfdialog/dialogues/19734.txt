"__MOVIES__ Hey, I rented Hacksaw Ridge. Want to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that about the soldier who doesn't want to actually fight?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's based on the story of a real guy during WWII."
"__MOVIES__ What was his deal? Why wouldn't he fight?"
"__MOVIES__ He was a pacifist and didn't believe in it."
"__MOVIES__ Who plays the guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Andrew Garfield."
"__MOVIES__ That name sounds familiar. What's he been in again?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably he's best known for playing Spiderman. But he's been in a lot of other stuff too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I remember seeing those trailers. I only saw the actual movies with Tobey MaGuire though."
"__MOVIES__ Same, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, Hacksaw Ridge was nominated for a lot of awards, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh huh. It was nominated for best actor, director, and picture at the Oscars."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wait, wasn't this Mel Gibson's movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he directed it."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh. Now I'm not sure I want to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I have that reaction too, but a movie is so much more than a director."
"__MOVIES__ That's true."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, if it was a book or something I wouldn't touch it. But I think movies are different because they're collaborative."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you've convinced me."
