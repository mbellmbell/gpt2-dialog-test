"__BASKETBALL__ So, which teams should blow it up?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Clearly, the Pacers. I just don't think they have the ability to convince PG to stay"
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed, their best chance is to convince the Lakers to give up a good piece to acquire George"
"__BASKETBALL__ Would the Lakers actually do it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What we know from Magic when he joined the Dodgers, the man loves a splash"
"__BASKETBALL__ George would be a splash. But isn't it better to wait?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Definitely. To me, the Lakers should continue to bet young"
"__BASKETBALL__ Draft Ball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. Look into trading Russell for a shot blocker. Figure out George in 2018"
"__BASKETBALL__ That is the wisest decision, but not so 'LA'"
"__BASKETBALL__ Back to exploding teams - what about Toronto?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Tough question. This team can't make the finals if Lebron is around. Is that good enough?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Even further, can it last much longer. Lowry is older."
"__BASKETBALL__ I still don't like DeRozan's game in the post season. And Lowry hasn't been great in the playoffs"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's tough because they can't trade anyone besides DeRozan and who would take him?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean, the Lakers?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Hah. I hope not"
"__BASKETBALL__ Another blow up candidate - Chicago"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep. But they won't because they are the Bulls"
"__BASKETBALL__ Trading Jimmy would give them a fresh start. Which they won't take"
