"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Beyonce?"
"__MUSIC__ She is cool but I liked her better when she was in a group."
"__MUSIC__ What group was she in?"
"__MUSIC__ She used to be the lead singer for Destiny's Child."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of them before. What songs do they sing?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe you've never heard of Destiny's Child. They were one of the biggest groups in the 90's and early 2000's. Some of their songs are 'Indendepent Women', 'Survivor', 'No, no, no'"
"__MUSIC__ I think I remember that 'Survivor' song. I didn't realize Beyonce used to be in that group. What happened to them?"
"__MUSIC__ Beyonce was always the lead singer. She decided she wanted to pursue a solo career and the group fell apart."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think the group might get back together one day?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. She's making too much money as a solo artist and as the wife of Jay-Z."
"__MUSIC__ I know they have done a lot of songs together. What is your favorite song they have done together?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Dangerously in Love."
"__MUSIC__ The song or the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Both, but I was talking about the song because Jay-Z is rapping on it."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that Jay-Z cheated on Beyonce and that's why her sister and him were fighting in the elevator."
"__MUSIC__ Who is her sister?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Solange? That's Beyonce's younger sister. She has had a few hits too."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that Solange was her sister but they do resemble each other now that you say something."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I really like Solange's music. The lyrics are more meaningful than what Beyonce is singing about."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's because Beyonce falls into the Pop/R&B category while Solange is more of old R&B. She just won a Grammy Award for 'Cranes in the Sky.'"
