"__MUSIC__ You know who I think is one of the most overlooked bands of the past?"
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ The Carpenters, do you know them?"
"__MUSIC__ I have heard of them, but I don't think I know any of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I bet you do."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, well try me."
"__MUSIC__ Well to name a few-Sing, For All We Know,  and We've Only Just Begun."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, maybe I do know a few."
"__MUSIC__ Which one did you know?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that I know all of those songs."
"__MUSIC__ See what I mean, they are overlooked. Everyone knows there songs, but no one feels like they really know the band."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to try to get my hands on some of their music because I do really enjoy that style."
"__MUSIC__ I really like a lot of songs from that time period."
"__MUSIC__ I think there were a lot of good, true muscians in the 60's and 70's."
"__MUSIC__ Not like today's music. Half of it is computers."
"__MUSIC__ True, I really do not enjoy most of it. If half is computers, another good chunk is just them talking about crude things."
"__MUSIC__ That is so true, and why I listen to music from the past mostly."
"__MUSIC__ Well you can find some good stuff outside of top 40."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Country still has some good muscians with more wholesome music."
