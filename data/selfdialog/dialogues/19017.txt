"__MOVIES__ So I have an assignment for my history class that I am hoping you can help with."
"__MOVIES__ What is that?"
"__MOVIES__ I have to pick out a movie that represents or is based on a historical event and write about it. What are the best movies like that you know of?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, what time period of movie are you looking for?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe something set in the first half of the 20th century."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, well a few come to mind. What about Pearl Harbor?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Josh Hartnett?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is a pretty good film."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, but there is a little bit too much love story in it for me."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, well how about Tora Tora Tora?"
"__MOVIES__ What is that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is also about Pearl Harbor and the events leading up to it."
"__MOVIES__ Is there a lot of love story in it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it pretty much just sticks to the historical aspects of it."
"__MOVIES__ How old is the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It was made in 1970, but it is a good one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I am not saying an old one cannot be. I love old movies."
"__MOVIES__ I think some of the best movies are 'old'."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I will give Tora Tora Tora a try then. Thanks."
"__MOVIES__ No problem, I hope you enjoy the movie."
