"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think is the worst Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The worst Star Wars movie, in my opinion, was Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to agree. Although that whole set of three Star Wars movies from that time was bad too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, I wasn't a fan of who they cast as the young Annakin and the teenage Annakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! Hayden Christensen's acting was so bad, it was unbearable to watch sometimes."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Jar Jar Binks...I mean come on. Seriously?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Such a stupid character right?!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't understand what they were thinking when they decided to create that character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably wanted him as comedic relief...but that didn't really work."
"__STAR_WARS__ Fail on their part."
