"__DISNEY__ Did you hear about all the new Disney movies based on animated films?"
"__DISNEY__ Other than Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ That was the most recent, but they announced quite a few new ones coming soon. Think 22 give or take."
"__DISNEY__ Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Off the top of my head... Aladdin which I'm most psyched about, Mulan, Cuella, Peter Pan, The Sword in the Stone, Chip n Dale, Maleficent 2, and Jungle Book 2."
"__DISNEY__ Nice to see Hollywood is still out of fresh ideas."
"__DISNEY__ Hey! Normally I'd agree with you, but even though they're based on their animated counterparts they've done a beautiful job bringing them to life and giving a complete modern reimagining to them."
"__DISNEY__ I guess you're right, and I did thoroughly enjoy The Jungle Book with Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, and Idris Elba. Absolutely lost it when King Louie busted out into one of my favorite Disney songs."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, oobee doo! I wanna be like you!"
"__DISNEY__ I wanna walk like you! Talk like you, too!"
