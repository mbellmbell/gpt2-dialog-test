"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you ever listened to Tame Impala?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a band actually I think they come from the UK."
"__MUSIC__ Really? No I don't listen to music from the U.K too much."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me neither, but they are becoming very popular in the U.S."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have some good songs, and honestly they remind me of the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ They are really psychedelic sounding rock, and the singer sounds like Lennon a bit."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That sounds kind of cool. What are some of their song names?"
"__MUSIC__ Elephant, going backwards, I can't think of the rest off the top of my head."
"__MUSIC__ Oh O.K, I will check them out, is it good relaxation music?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, but they will take your mind on a trip, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ How do you figure?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the music is psychedelic rock, so it is very mellow and trippy at times, with the guitar and melodies."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool though, the Beatles were like that too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, totally, check out going backwards first, that's my favorite song by them."
"__MUSIC__ O.K cool!"
"__MUSIC__ Message me what you think of them when you do!"
"__MUSIC__ Will do, thanks man!"
