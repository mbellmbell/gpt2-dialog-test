"__MUSIC__ So you lived in Germany. How's that polka?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, I think Polka is technically Polish..."
"__MUSIC__ But don't they have that accordian-y stuff and slap their shoe dance and stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yes, there is regional folk music that is like that... and Schlager."
"__MUSIC__ Schlager?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's regional and folky but more a 1960s invention I think. Kind of like Lawrence Welk but more German-y"
"__MUSIC__ Like the stuff you see at the Eurovision Song Contest?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, very often that will be a piece of Schlager."
"__MUSIC__ So tell me more."
"__MUSIC__ It's very polka-like, often has a married couple dressed in dirndl and Lederhosen trilling about love. or country."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha sounds absurd."
"__MUSIC__ It is many things haha - silly, goofy, parodiable, charming, cultural and happy."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like Oktoberfest music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes - a lot of Schlager is covered in the tents of Oktoberfest."
"__MUSIC__ I went to it back in 2000. There was a popular song at the time - 'Anton aus Tirol.' they played it in all the tents."
"__MUSIC__ YES, I lived there then, but we didn't know each other yet! Too bad. We were probably in the same tent haha."
"__MUSIC__ And Anton aus Tirol is considered Schlager?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. A bit of a modern parody of it, but Schlager nonetheless."
"__MUSIC__ Do you miss Bavaria?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, like I said stuff like that is goofy but a charming part of the culture."
