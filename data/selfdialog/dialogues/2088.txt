"__MUSIC__ So have you been listening to any new music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really anything new, mostly the same bands I've been listening to for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ I've really been on a Blue October kick lately."
"__MUSIC__ Have they even put out anything new?"
"__MUSIC__ I honestly haven't checked. I didn't like their last album much."
"__MUSIC__ But you like the rest of their stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, mostly. I really like their album 'Sway'."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I didn't care for a lot of their early stuff, though."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, some of it was sort of rough."
"__MUSIC__ I really enjoyed some of their darker albums though."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like 'Any Man in America'?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly. You?"
"__MUSIC__ It was alright. I think that the best years were between 'Foiled' and 'Sway', though."
"__MUSIC__ I can see why you'd think that. They had a much more honest sound."
"__MUSIC__ I'm happy that Justin got his life together and seems happy, but I do think that his music has suffered a little bit for it."
"__MUSIC__ I just couldn't relate to 'Home'. It was too upbeat and family-oriented for me."
"__MUSIC__ Not really what you'd expect from the band, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! It was just so different from the sound they sold us on for so many years!"
"__MUSIC__ Yup! You're the first person I've talked to who has agreed with me about that!"
