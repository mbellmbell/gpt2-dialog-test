"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey the NFL season will be coming up soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I know and I'm pretty excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am too. The Dallas Cowboys were great last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they were. I 'm sure it's going to be an awesome season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet it is. I wonder who the backup quarterback will be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was wonder the same since Tony Romo isn't with them any longer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and that's all good. He just wasn't a good quarterback anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No he wasn't. It was time for him to retire from playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it was. He had too many injuries the past few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes way too many injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott turned out to be the best quarterback ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really did. He's an awesome player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is awesome. He did a lot for the Cowboys last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he did and I think this season is going to be great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too. Romo was good in the very first years of his career but later on he wasn't anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No he wasn't. He was costing the team games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really was. He was throwing way too many interceptions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I couldn't believe how many he had gotten to where he was throwing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, everytime he threw the football I wanted to hide my eyes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ LOL so did I. That's pretty bad isn't it?"
