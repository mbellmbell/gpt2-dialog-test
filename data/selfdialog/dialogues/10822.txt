"__FASHION__ What is in style this season?"
"__FASHION__ I've been seeing a lot of shoulder baring tops lately!"
"__FASHION__ Ah, kind of an 80s throwback?"
"__FASHION__ Definitetly. I'm feeling those Flashdance vibes. I've also seen a lot of bright colorful stripes."
"__FASHION__ I love that color is in right now, I was so ready for it! I've also seen a lot of large bags on the runways."
"__FASHION__ YES, that is so great for those of us who carry around everything but the kitchen sink. Do you like the utilitarian trend?"
"__FASHION__ Honestly, I don't like anything khaki."
"__FASHION__ Oh, me either. It's so boring. There are some interesting shapes, though."
"__FASHION__ I really love the statement t-shirts I've been seeing."
"__FASHION__ I do too, what a great way to show personality! It also helps that they are comfortable. And the big earrings!"
"__FASHION__ I love a good statement piece. I can't believe platform shoes are back, though."
"__FASHION__ I know, it feels very 90s. Not my favorite style decade."
"__FASHION__ I agree - give me 70s inspired fashion anyday!"
"__FASHION__ I'm more of an 80s gal myself. Those colors! I'm also really loving the exposed bra trend."
"__FASHION__ Me too! We spend so much on bras, it's time to show them off!"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure how I feel about the athletic wear trend, though."
"__FASHION__ I don't care for it - it definitely doesn't suit me. I think it would take an athletic person to look natural in those clothes."
"__FASHION__ It's definitely not for everyone, that's for sure. I'm just glad there are so many different things going on in fashion right now!"
"__FASHION__ Me too, there's something for everyone. I'm going to be rocking the bare shoulders all summer."
"__FASHION__ I'll join you!"
