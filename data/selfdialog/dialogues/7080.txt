"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who do you think is going to win the series between Ottawa Senators and Pittsburgh Penguins?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't know but it should be a great series."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, Ottawa won the 1st game so they have the advantage"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, but Pittsburgh is a veteran team and I think they have a good chance of winning the series"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ True, they are veterans, but the Senators seem hungrier this year"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You could be right, but it's hard betting against a team that has Sidney Crosby."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, Crosby is a stud and a game changer."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think he is the MVP of the league"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, he definitely is up for consideration, but they need more than just Crosby."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hear you, but I think there whole team is ready"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So what are you saying? Do you think the Penguins win this series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I think so."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ In home many games?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think the Penguins win this series in 7 games"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So, you got the Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh yeah, I really believe that it is their time"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You may be right, but I feel good about the Senators. I think they are going to win it all."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well if they do, drinks on me next time we go out."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sounds like a great bet! If the penguins win, I'll take you out and do the same"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sweet! Get ready to pay up!"
