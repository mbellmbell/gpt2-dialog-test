"__SUPERHERO__ Who is your favorite spiderman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ For me it is easily Tobey Mcguire. I think he was so perfect for the part of peter parker."
"__SUPERHERO__ I also preferred him over andrew garfield."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I do think it worth saying that the spiderman films with Tobey are just better films than the amazing spiderman with andrew in general."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I agree too. Sam Raimi the director had such a strong vision perhaps a better script and concept as well."
"__SUPERHERO__ Sam Raimi is so good in general. I think stan lee being on the writing team makes a world of difference."
"__SUPERHERO__ Was he not a writer on the amazing spiderman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No he was not at all, to my knowledge. I think that goes to show how much Stan lee  is a genius."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well when you have the creator on your team of course you will be head and shoulders above."
"__SUPERHERO__ But I also think Tobey just gives a better stronger more believable portrayal of spiderman in general."
