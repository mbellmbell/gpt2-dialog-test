"__MUSIC__ I saw Garth Brooks in concert the other day."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  That takes me back."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, tickets were super affordable."
"__MUSIC__ How was the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Spectacular.  They played all the good songs from long ago."
"__MUSIC__ Was their much newer stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Bits and pieces, but mostly stuff from the 90's."
"__MUSIC__ Did he play The Dance?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.  Everyone goes quiet when that gets played."
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of his song I guess."
"__MUSIC__ He's got a lot of iconic songs, but that may be the biggest."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've always really loved that tune."
"__MUSIC__ Thunder Rolls was really cool.  They made it rain!"
"__MUSIC__ You mean literally?"
"__MUSIC__ Right, raindrops started falling around the stage.  Quite cool with the lighting."
"__MUSIC__ I would be afraid of getting electrocuted."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure they had precautions in place."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, that would be a bad ending to the concert."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to listen to him and get some nostalgia."
"__MUSIC__ You should, great stuff!"
