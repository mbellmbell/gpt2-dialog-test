"__MUSIC__ Sure, like do people still listen to them?"
"__MUSIC__ No I dont think its like it used to be."

"__MUSIC__ I think its all ignored"
"__MUSIC__ Thats nuts I remember when they were huge."
"__MUSIC__ I think they died off in the early 2000s"
"__MUSIC__ So it was not viable?"
"__MUSIC__ Peoples music interests changed. I dont think its that big of a deal."
"__MUSIC__ I think a good amount of people still do it"
"__MUSIC__ Do what?"
"__MUSIC__ Want to hear a good soundtrack"
"__MUSIC__ I just think the movie dialogue is better"
"__MUSIC__ That and they dont need a great soundtrack to boot"
"__MUSIC__ They should want to"
"__MUSIC__ It helps move a movie along"
