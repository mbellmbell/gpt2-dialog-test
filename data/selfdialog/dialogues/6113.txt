"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think they'll do in The Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Kylo and Rey will have to team up to stop Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you kidding, then who is the bad guy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke turns bad and they try to turn him good, Snope is also a bad guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes no sense, Luke would never turn bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well bad is relative, I'm sure he thinks he's doing good by ridding the world of Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Regardless, he's training Rey and Kylo and Ren wouldn't be powerful enough to stop Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ That might be a flaw in my idea, but flaws haven't stopped them before."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Kylo goes full dark-side and it's an epic battle between him and Rey, who ditches her teacher like and goes to fight too early."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, they copied Star Wars, might as well copy Empire Strikes Back."
