"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you think Ron and Hermionie were meant to end up together?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, of course! Why, are you a Harry and Hermionie shipper?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, it seemed like they were insinuating some sort of love triangle in the last two movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, but that was really a departure from the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you prefer the books to the movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ For the most part yes, but I am glad they made movies from the series. How about you?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I usually prefer the book the the movies in general but really like the Harry Potter films so it's tough to say."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True, I grew up with the movies so they were a big part of my childhood."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Mine as well. My friends and I would all go to the opening night dressed as wizards."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's nice that they are rebooting the wizarding world with Fantastic beasts."
