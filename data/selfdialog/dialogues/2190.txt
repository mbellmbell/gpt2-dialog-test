"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of that kid who sang Three Little Birds?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean that Bob Marley song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, this little girl sang the song when she was like four and her voice is so sweet."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really into kids singing, but I like that song when Bob Marley sings it."
"__MUSIC__ I think you might like the kid's version, though. It has the same beat and rhythm to it."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but I doubt she sounds as good as Bob Marley."
"__MUSIC__ Do you want a link to the song? I really think you would like it even if you don't like kid music. It isn't like a silly kid's song or anything."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, I'll listen to it.  You're making me want to listen to Bob Marley now, though."
"__MUSIC__ I always think it is cool when I hear kids with a lot of talent doing covers on famous music.  Some of them sound strange, but mostly they are just so amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I agree that there is a lot of talent. I just prefer to listen to music without the 'cute' factor involved."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to put on some reggae now. Talking about Bob Marley made me want to listen.  I think you're right in a way. The little girl doesn't really have that sound."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure she has a great voice. I just always think of them as kind of like little puppets when they sing other peoples' songs."
"__MUSIC__ Like a parrot? They don't really understand what they're singing about?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, because how can a six year old have a clue about all the emotion that is behind a song an artist writes and sings?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a good point. The Three Little Birds song is pretty simple, though. So I think Connie Talbot really nails it in her own interpretation."
"__MUSIC__ That's just it though. It's not really her interpretation. It is something created by the adults around her to give the illusion of it being hers."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever, I guess. I just really think she sounds sweet. Anyway, she's not a little girl anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Do you want me to send you some reggae tunes? I have a lot of music in my library."
"__MUSIC__ That would be great, thanks!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, it'll be just a minute."
