"__MUSIC__ Do you know who Woody Guthrie was?"
"__MUSIC__ Didn't he write 'This Land Is Your Land?'"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he did! He wrote a lot of songs, and I have a Woody Guthrie story that involves my family."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me!"
"__MUSIC__ When he was a boy in Oklahoma, his best friend was my uncle Floyd. Woody's dad was out of town a lot, and his mother had been taken away because of her illness."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't that the disease that eventually killed Woody?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's called Huntington's Chorea. It wasn't understood back in those days, and they thought Woody's mom was crazy, so they put her away."
"__MUSIC__ That's sad. So what happened with Woody and your family?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, because Woody didn't have any parents around, my grandmother told him he could stay with them. So he moved in with them and my grandmother took care of him and made sure he got to school."
"__MUSIC__ How old was he then?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he was in his early teens. I remember my uncle talking about he and my other uncle (Cap) and Woody slept three in the bed, head to toe."
"__MUSIC__ How long did Woody stay with your grandmother?"
"__MUSIC__ It was a while, but eventually my grandmother and the family moved to Arizona, and Woody didn't want to go, so they had to leave him."
"__MUSIC__ What happened to him then?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure, exactly, but I know he traveled around and met a lot of people and wrote a lot of songs."
"__MUSIC__ Did your uncle ever see him again?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so, but when my mom found out Woody was sick and in the hospital in the 1960s, she wrote to his wife, Marjorie, who invited us to come for a visit."
"__MUSIC__ Did you go?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, we drove from our home in Maryland to New York so my mom could go see Woody in the hospital. He'd already lost his ability to speak, but he communicated with her by blinking his eyes. He remembered her, and she wept."
"__MUSIC__ He's an American legend, that's for sure."
