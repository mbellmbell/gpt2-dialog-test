"__STAR_WARS__ Darth maul or darth vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Dude, what kind of question is that."
"__STAR_WARS__ No getting around this, answer the question."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth vader any day."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh come now, you think vader can beat a double edge lightsaber?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he can just force choke anyone who gets in his way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whatever, vaders old and weak, maul would cut him down to size."
"__STAR_WARS__ Old maybe, but weak? Clearly you are short sighted in the ways of the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't get me riled up over this, you know I'm right."
"__STAR_WARS__ Get angry, let the anger flow through you!"
