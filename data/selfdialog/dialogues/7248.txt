"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she's kind of strange, but some of her songs are pretty great."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I think so too. I heard she used to look a lot different before she became famous."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think you're right. She used to have darker hair and looked like your average person."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She doesn't look bad now. She just has a unique sense of style."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I guess you could call it that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her clothes make a statement."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What kind of statement, exactly?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think just a statement that she's different from other pop stars and not afraid to do something outside of the box, you know?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I suppose. Either way, I like her music."
