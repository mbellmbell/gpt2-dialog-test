"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey Mark, are you ready for the NFL season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure am, I can't wait!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here, who do you think will win it all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not entirely sure, but I think the Patriots will have a chance to defend their title."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm afraid I have to agree with you, but I hope some other team wins the Superbowl, I'm getting tired of the Patriots always winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, but you can't deny that they are a great team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure are!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think can beat them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm, well Atlanta should still be a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if they can shake off that horrible loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, true...Green Bay and Dallas should both be pretty good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes!  With their young talent, Dallas should have a great year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For some reason, I also like Kansas City's chances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kansas City?  Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm not sure why, but they always seem to be pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty good isn't always good enough in the NFL though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will definitely be an interesting season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree.  I am so looking forward to the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too!"
