"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only a few more months until the start of the NFL season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I am already getting excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that my Cowboys are going to win it all this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are good, I think that my Seahawks have a shot at the Superbowl too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well maybe we'll play each other in the playoffs for a spot at the big game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be an amazing game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, if it comes to that, we should go watch the game at a restaurant together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that would be great, I can rub it in your face if we win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think my side will be the the victorious side in this match up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I think the only competition for our teams are the Packers and Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't see other teams giving us trouble, one of these four teams will represent the NFC at the Superbowl for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am most worried about the Packers, I still think that Aaron Rodgers is the best player in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is very hard to disagree with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, there is some solace knowing that the Packers defense is not that good though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I think they will have to run up points on the offensive end to keep up with the Cowboys or Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it will be hard for them to run up points though, both teams have good defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am in total agreement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway it should be a very entertaining season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so, I really want to watch some close games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, hopefully we can have that Cowboys versus Seahawks match up in the playoffs, it will be a great game of football."
