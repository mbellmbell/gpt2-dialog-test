"__MOVIES__ Do you like movies with Fred Astaire?"
"__MOVIES__ I love Fred Astaire!  I think he is a lot better than Gene Kelly."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't agree.  I think they are both great but Kelly is more masculine."
"__MOVIES__ Fred is elegant and still manly while Kelly is like a truck driver."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no. Kelly is athletic and can do different kinds of dancing besides tap dancing."
"__MOVIES__ But I don't anything can touch Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth together."
"__MOVIES__ Now I've never seen them in a flim together."
"__MOVIES__ Try You Were Never Lovelier."
"__MOVIES__ I will.  My favorite Gene Kelly move is Invitation to the Dance."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't like that one. I like movies with plots."
"__MOVIES__ Like Singin' in the Rain?"
"__MOVIES__ I like Singin' in the Rain.  But I don't like On the Town."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Pirate?"
"__MOVIES__ That movie is AWFUL."
"__MOVIES__ But the dancing is great."
"__MOVIES__ I don't agree."
"__MOVIES__ But have you seen Yolanda and the Thief?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  It's not THAT terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is, oh yes it is. But I will give you his movies with Ginger Rogers."
"__MOVIES__ Thank you."
