"__BEATLES__ Do you know who the fab four are?"
"__BEATLES__ Of course, they're the Beatles!"
"__BEATLES__ Alright, alright. I just found out today that one member of the Beatles isn't an original member."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, which one? George?"
"__BEATLES__ No, not George."
"__BEATLES__ Who then?"
"__BEATLES__ Ringo Starr wasn't the original drummer."
"__BEATLES__ I didn't know that, who was the original drummer."
"__BEATLES__ A fellow named Pete Best."
"__BEATLES__ Interesting. It's such a weird counterfactual to imagine the Beatles without Ringo. No 'With a Little Help from My Friends.'"
