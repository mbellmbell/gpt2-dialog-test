"__MUSIC__ Someone told me you're a big Beatles fan, is that true?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man i'm a HUGE fan; i have all their CDs; i'm talking albums and singles; live stuff and studio recordings."
"__MUSIC__ Well i have most of their stuff but it sounds like you've got me beat, no pun intended."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! that's a good one.  beat.  anyway, i even have a very rare, valuable copy of 'rubber soul,' autographed by george harrison which came with a letter of authenticity about when and where he signed it."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! that's one of my favorite albums."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  actually i have 3 copies of that album; the autographed one which i have never listened to, an old vinyl copy and a CD."
"__MUSIC__ i don't blame you for not listening to the autographed one; it might get accidentally damaged."
"__MUSIC__ i'll tell you something only my wife has known up to now...i actually bought insurance on that album, in case it was stolen or damaged."
"__MUSIC__ I don't blame you at all; i would have done the same thing.  who was, or is, your favorite beatle?"
"__MUSIC__ I always liked Lennon best, and Harrison was a close second."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, the two beatles who have passed on.  i still haven't gotten over lennon's tragic death?"
"__MUSIC__ I'll never get over it.  hard to believe it was 37 years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Has it really been that long?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was late 1980, we'll never know how many more great songs he might have written."
"__MUSIC__ how true.  what was your favorite John Lennon song?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably 'Mind Games,' but of course i love 'Imagine' as well."
"__MUSIC__ Imagine is my favorite Lennon song and maybe my favorite beatle song by any of them.  were you a fan from their early days?"
"__MUSIC__ practically from the day they came over here in 1964."
"__MUSIC__ did you know at one point they had every song in the top five? all five! imagine that; oh i'm sorry there i go with my puns again...IMAGINE that."
"__MUSIC__ oh that is funny; i didn't even catch that one until you pointed it out.  great talking to you about the best band ever!"
