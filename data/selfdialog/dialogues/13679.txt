"__BASKETBALL__ So who do you think are going to the finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's going to be a rubber match between the Cavs and the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who will come out on top?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well they both have a victory over the other so it's hard to tell, but I want the Cavs to win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron is looking scary but the other star players aren't playing their best and they can't win the championship if he doesn't have help."
"__BASKETBALL__ He makes everyone around him better they'll be fine."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's not going to be enough against the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well the Warriors are starting Zaza so I think were're covered."
"__BASKETBALL__ Neither team has lost in the playoffs yet which is incredible."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's why I say they will meet in the finals again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Warriors don't have their coach Steve Kerr to help them later in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they would need him to win the finals so I hope he gets well soon."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't sleep on any of the other teams. Huston and San Antonio have a chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but San Antonio just lost Tony Parker and they can't win a championship without him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think Huston can contend with the warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the might beat them once maybe twice but could not beat them in a series."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're probably right about that."
"__BASKETBALL__ But it's the NBA anything can happen."
"__BASKETBALL__ Guess we'll just have to wait and see."
"__BASKETBALL__ The sooner the better."
