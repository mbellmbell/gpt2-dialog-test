"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the Braves play St. Louis the other day?"
"__BASEBALL__ I started to but stopped watching after it got to 7 to 0. Did you see the final score?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but I saw that it was something ungodly, like 12 to nothing."
"__BASEBALL__ I bet you're regretting buying those tickets for you and your dad later this month."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I actually had tickets to that blowout they just had but I'm glad I didn't."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I bet, did you get tickets for parking yet?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but I need to. I heard with this new stadium that it's very hard to get parking because they fill up so soon."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it does, and depending on where you park it can really suck trying to get to the stadium."
"__BASEBALL__ Man, the only thing worth watching now is Freeman."
"__BASEBALL__ Isn't he like in the top 5 in a few different categories?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he is and I think they said he's hitting at like .430 or somewhere around that."
"__BASEBALL__ Too bad no one else seems to be able to do anything."
"__BASEBALL__ It looked like things were starting to get better, especially when they were playing at home but it's just gone downhill."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah you would think that with this move that there would be some motivation to play well but I guess not."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, kind of ironic that they built this new stadium to be closer to the majority of their fans and yet, they are playing so poorly. If that causes less people to show up it will be kind of funny."
"__BASEBALL__ Like they made that move for nothing."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly!"
"__BASEBALL__ So who are they playing when you go with your Dad?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Nationals."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh good lord that's gonna suck. We're gonna get killed!"
