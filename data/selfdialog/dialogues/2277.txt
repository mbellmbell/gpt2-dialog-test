"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the music that has been normal since you have been alive?"
"__MUSIC__ Well that is a hard one since there has not really been any good choices."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I was born in 1969 so I missed the culture revolution."
"__MUSIC__ Like the Doors, Beatles, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and those are the ones I listened to in my preteens because my parents did."
"__MUSIC__ What about your teens?"
"__MUSIC__ Wen I became a teenager hair bands were coming into the scene."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, bands like Van Halen, Motley Crue, Poison, Twisted Sister and Whitesnake."
"__MUSIC__ Oh they were the greatest but then following them came alternative music with it's 'whoa is me, life sucks' messages."
"__MUSIC__ Are you talking about The Cure, U2, Depeche Mode and Duran Duran?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and I don't mean all of their songs presented that message but majority did."
"__MUSIC__ And then the grunge bands came in the 90's?"
"__MUSIC__ Bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots."
"__MUSIC__ And what were their message? Hate? Anger?"
"__MUSIC__ Do I think it was more along things need to change but we 'have no clue how'."
"__MUSIC__ Then the next revolution was boy bands or pop on one side with hip-hop and rap on the other."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know and in my taste in music all of those fell short in artistic value. I started listening to 60's music again."
"__MUSIC__ Now who do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't since I think music is no longer music but moraless amalgamations of crap!"
