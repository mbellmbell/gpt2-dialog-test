"__STAR_WARS__ I think Disney is doing a pretty good job with Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ So much better than I expected."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, look at who is directing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who?"
"__STAR_WARS__ J.J. Abrams."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, but I heard he isn't directing 8."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's sad."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm still excited though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too."
"__STAR_WARS__ At least it's not Lucas!"
