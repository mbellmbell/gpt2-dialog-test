"__BEATLES__ Isn't it great that the Beatles just reissued Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?"
"__BEATLES__ I heard about it has something to do with the album's 50th anniversary right?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, they made a regular reissue, a double-cd version, and a super deluxe edition."
"__BEATLES__ What comes in the super deluxe edition?"
"__BEATLES__ It has a total of four CDs, a blu-ray, a DVD, a book, and some other collectible inserts."
"__BEATLES__ Sounds awesome!"
"__BEATLES__ It's so cool to hear demos and alternate versions of some of their classics, especially 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'A Day in the Life'."
"__BEATLES__ Wait a minute, 'Strawberry Fields' wasn't on Sgt. Pepper's originally."
"__BEATLES__ Several takes were included on one of the bonus discs for this collection, since the song was recorded during the same sessions."
"__BEATLES__ That makes sense - I'll have to pick up a copy!"
