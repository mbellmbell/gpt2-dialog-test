"__MOVIES__ So any new natural disaster movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about natural disaster but I know plenty of artificial disasters."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by artificial disaster movies?"
"__MOVIES__ well, it seems hollywood is too eager to end the world."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree. Hollywood seems to be trying hard to end the world."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously! I mean there are so many end of the world movies that it doesn't even click anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know that hollywood has habit of overdoing stuff which sells it you develop aversion of the same stuff."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree with you. Another thing is that the CGI effect seems to such in most such movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes exactly. Reminds me of 2012."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes! CGI effects in that movie was so artificial that it almost looked like an animation movie."
"__MOVIES__ I remember, there was so much hype about 2012 movie, But it ended up being a great disappointment."
"__MOVIES__ Same thing happened with independence day resurgence."
"__MOVIES__ I think people are fed up with all these end of world movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, because there are so many that it has become boring now."
"__MOVIES__ I think the reason the first independence day movie was successful was because it was the first movie to show end of world theme."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, at that time it was a new thing, so it was exciting. Now it has become really boring."
"__MOVIES__ I hope hollywood learns  it lesson and stop overdoing same theme again and again."
"__MOVIES__ I am skeptic about it. I don't think hollywood is going to learn anything."
"__MOVIES__ well, then I guess people have to teach them, if they are not ready to learn by themselves."
"__MOVIES__ That would require unity of all movie watchers, which I find really rare to happen"
