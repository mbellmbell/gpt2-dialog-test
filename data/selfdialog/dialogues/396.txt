"__MUSIC__ So, I went to see a local band last night."
"__MUSIC__ Were they any good."
"__MUSIC__ No. They were just called 'Todd' but none of the members was named Todd."
"__MUSIC__ That's really disappointing."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I was hoping for better. The music felt like a bad version of Travis, or Snow Patrol."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they named themselves Todd to sound like Travis?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, maybe. They weren't as good though."
"__MUSIC__ What's Travis up to lately? I haven't listened to them in ages."
"__MUSIC__ They came out with a new album last year. It's called Everything at Once."
"__MUSIC__ Is it any good."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. I haven't listened yet. I'll let you know."
"__MUSIC__ What do I remember them from? It's been ages since I first looked them up."
"__MUSIC__ They had a song play in one episode of The Office."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's it! That's what it was."
"__MUSIC__ I got introduced to them through that show too."
"__MUSIC__ It's funny how TV can sometimes introduce you to new bands."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think they'll ever introduce me to a band like Todd though."
"__MUSIC__ You should take me with you next time!"
"__MUSIC__ It'd definitely be more fun than going alone."
"__MUSIC__ Then it's a date!"
