"__MUSIC__ What was the best part of the performance?"
"__MUSIC__ I think the best part was the people from the movie coming and joining them. I loved how in tuned they were."
"__MUSIC__ Compared to all of the other BET Music Awards shows, what do you rate this year's show?"
"__MUSIC__ I would probably give them an 8. Simply because music has changed tremendously and it evolving and they are still trying to figure it out."
