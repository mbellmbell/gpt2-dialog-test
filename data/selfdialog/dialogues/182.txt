"__MUSIC__ I was listening to a radio show the other day and they played an old song that I really liked."
"__MUSIC__ What was the name of the song?"
"__MUSIC__ I knew it sounded like Frank Sinatra so I looked it up and sure enough I found it."
"__MUSIC__ If it was a Frank Sinatra song that must be an oldie but goodie."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was called, 'Time after Time'.  Not to be confused with Cindy Lauper's song with the same title."
"__MUSIC__ I remember the Cindy Lauper song.  But, I'm not familiar with this one by Frank Sinatra."
"__MUSIC__ It is such a sweet love song.  Talking about how he is so lucky to be loving you."
"__MUSIC__ Aww..I like a good love song.  I bet it was nothing like today's love song."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, for sure it sounded so pure.  There were no mentions of anything crude."
"__MUSIC__ When was the song recorded?"
"__MUSIC__ I believe it was from 1946 and actually was from a movie called, 'It happened in Brooklyn'."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard of that film, it was before my time."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard of the film either, but I think I may have to look it up as it is probably a good wholesome love story."
"__MUSIC__ If you do find it you will have to tell me about it.  I may even want to watch it."
"__MUSIC__ I really never got into Frank Sinatra type songs, but this one has made me have a change of heart."
"__MUSIC__ Have you found any others that you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I did find another one that I liked it was called, 'Once Upon a Time'."
"__MUSIC__ What was that about?"
"__MUSIC__ Another love song.  Talking about sitting under the willow tree..you know something you would do way back when."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you have certainly educated me about Frank Sinatra that's for sure.  Thanks!"
