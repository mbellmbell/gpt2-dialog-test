"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Were you more of an Snoop Dogg or Dr Dre person?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Absolutely Snoop Dogg, was never huge into Dre."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ While I would disagree Dre as a whole, I'm a fan, would still agree overall"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah Snoop is classic, oddly enough I think the stuff he did with Dre was better than either of their stuff alone."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yeah absolutely. Gin and Juice is essiential."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Renember when he went by Snoop Lion briefly?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Sure do, not sure what he was thinking."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes it was bizzare, I'm glad it didn't last though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Likewise, it seemed like a bad gimmick."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Could'nt agree anymore with you."
