"__POP__ Hey do you like pop music at all?"
"__POP__ Not one of my favorite genres, but it can be okay at times."
"__POP__ Fair assessment I've fallen in love with old 80's pop music in particular."
"__POP__ Oh really? What artists would you recommend?"
"__POP__ Michael Jackson would be first, so many classics."
"__POP__ I will admit I've not given him enough of a chance, I do really like Man in The Mirror though."
"__POP__ That would be my absolute favorite track of his, but also check out Billy Jean, Thriller and Smooth Criminal."
"__POP__ Wasn't there a newer band that covered smooth criminal?"
"__POP__ You're thinking of Alien Ant Farm. Alot of people like the cover, didn't do much for me."
"__POP__ Yeah me neither, Jackson is a hard act to follow, I can even say that given my limited exposure."
