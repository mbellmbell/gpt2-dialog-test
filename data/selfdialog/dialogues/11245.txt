"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think about the Rams moving back to LA?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am strongly against it, I think they NFL should have just created a new team for LA and one for Las Vegas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, did you see they fired Jeff Fisher last week?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is great coach, but he was giving a terrible team to try to win with, and it just could not be done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of Las Vegas, I guess you seen the Raiders are moving there in the next few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now Vegas is going to have the NFL and the NHL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are there enough core people that live in Vegas to support two pro teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no idea, I thought most of the population there was tourists."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder who is going to be the team to beat this year in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the Patriots, like always, and their cheating ways."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably so, but Dallas made a strong showing this past year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That rookie quarter back and the rookie running back for Dallas are great additions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if we have heard the last of Kapernack and his refusing to stand for the national anthem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, with his team that won I think four games last season, I am  not sure why we heard about him at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the 49'ers were terrible last year, almost as bad as the Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am really pulling for Green Bay to have a strong year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Aaron Rodger didn't have the greatest of years this past year, but he is still a great quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Newton is also great, but how his team went from a superbowl appearance one year to a losing season the next is beyond me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they lost a lot of their core players and some were injured."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, hopefully someone can step up and knock the Pats off their pedestal this year."
