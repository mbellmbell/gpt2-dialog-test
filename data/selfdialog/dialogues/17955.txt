"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen a Roman Polanski movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the guy who's banned from the US for raping a teenager?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, him."
"__MOVIES__ No, I would never! I think it's terrible what he's done and as a protest I refuse to ever watch any of his films."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Have you ever seen The Pianist?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! That movie was amazing"
"__MOVIES__ Roman Polanski produced and directed that."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I never knew that. I have to admit it was a good film."
"__MOVIES__ He is a great international filmmaker. He frequently has shows at Cannes and those popular film festivals."
"__MOVIES__ I went to a film festival here in NYC last year. It was called the Tribeca Film Festival."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really nice. It was affordable and showed very many different films."
"__MOVIES__ Were there in English?"
"__MOVIES__ Not all of them. But if not, they had clear subtitles on the screen so it was fine."
"__MOVIES__ How many films showed?"
"__MOVIES__ Dozens. Maybe even a hundred. Not all were full length - many were short-films."
"__MOVIES__ How short do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ For example, I saw one film that lasted only 20 minutes. Thats about one hundred minutes shorter than a regular full length feature."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds very interesting. I wish you told me about it."
"__MOVIES__ I'll be sure to let you know if I'm going again this year!"
