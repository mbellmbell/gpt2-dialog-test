"__STAR_WARS__ How many more Star Wars movies do you think they will make?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, at least make a trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ So two more?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they will of the actual story line after the next one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe add more like back story movies, like the Solo one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope they do not."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do, people love Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the feel of it, but not if it is too much. Too much of a good thing you know?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would still like to see as many as they could put out."
