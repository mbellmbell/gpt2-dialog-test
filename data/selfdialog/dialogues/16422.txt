"__ROCK__ Favorite rock musician?"
"__ROCK__ Oh man! That's a tough one. There have been so many greats."
"__ROCK__ The way they keep dying. The choice will get easier and easier."
"__ROCK__ Just because they're dead, doesn't mean they weren't great: Elvis Presley and John Lennon are both dead. And they're still considered legends."
"__ROCK__ Legends is right. They're dead."
"__ROCK__ Okay fine. So who's your favorite living rock star?"
"__ROCK__ I don't know. Is Alannis Morrisette considered a rock star? What about Lady Gaga?"
"__ROCK__ Oh please don't tell me you listen to Gaga. Don't tell me you think she's a rock star?"
"__ROCK__ Fine. So you tell me, who is a rock star? Miley Cyrus? What about Van Halen? What AC/DC?"
"__ROCK__ AC/DC is rock. Van Halen... they used to know how. And Miley Cyrus is just an embarrassment."
