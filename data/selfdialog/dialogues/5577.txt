"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Good question, I would have to say return of the Jedi. What about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to agree, return if the Jedi had a little bit of everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it did, the original three were the best storie lines, although the recent ones have been very good also."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the force awakens blew me away, it was s good. Apart from the fact Han Solo dies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was suprised by that too. He was always one of my favorite characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have a feeling he will come back somehow."
"__STAR_WARS__ Thatâ€™s hopeful, but I could see it happening. They are trying to be original with the new movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, like them both dieting at the end of rogue one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was suprised by that, I read the book so I knew it was going to happen but I hoped that they would change it."
