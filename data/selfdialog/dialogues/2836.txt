"__MUSIC__ Hey have you ever heard of chiptune music?"
"__MUSIC__ Chiptune? Isn't that like electronic?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they're fairly similar."
"__MUSIC__ What's different about chiptune?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's called chiptune because the sounds are based on old arcade machine sounds, like computer chips."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, think of classic Nintendo games."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I think I have a better idea of what do expect."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes you hear stuff that sounds exactly like a video game, but sometimes you hear some modern sounds mixed in too."
"__MUSIC__ What are some good chiptune artists?"
"__MUSIC__ Dubmood is probably my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like by them?"
"__MUSIC__ Most everything, certain albums have different flavors of chiptune though."
"__MUSIC__ What would you say the different flavors are?"
"__MUSIC__ You have like traditional chiptune, which sounds like a video game and is mainly like the older sounds. Then you have newer stuff which is probably more electronic that chiptune."
"__MUSIC__ Which do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like both, but the modern stuff is especially cool to listen too. It can be really calming."
"__MUSIC__ Is all of it calming?"
"__MUSIC__ No some chiptune can sound like rave music, which can even get scary aggressive."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's very cool. I'll give it a listen."
