"__DISNEY__ Have you ever regretted taking your kid to see a Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No, why? Have you?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, my son is 8 now, but he is still scared from a movie he saw at a noon showing a couple years ago- Finding Nemo."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, all the big fish trying to eat everyone?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. My husband was talking about a friend's aquarium he admired, and said he'd really like to get one for the living room, and my son threw a fit."
"__DISNEY__ Oh my. Maybe he would learn it's not so scary if you just got a few nice fish?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, fish do eat each other sometimes, and they die really easily, so I told my husband it would be too traumatic."
"__DISNEY__ Is your son still really sensitive about that?"
"__DISNEY__ We had to leave during the movie because he started crying when Marlin's wife and their eggs were eaten, and then with the big fish with all the teeth, he kept crying and saying he didn't like it, so we left."
"__DISNEY__ No, I guess an aquarium would not be a good idea."
