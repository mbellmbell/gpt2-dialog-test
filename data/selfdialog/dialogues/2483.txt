"__MUSIC__ What do you think of heavy metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the classics, like Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer, and the like."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I enjoy those bands. I don't like the screamo or death metal stuff you hear today."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite album?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Metallica's ...And Justice for All."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good one. I like the Black Album myself."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people think that's where Metallica began to sell out, but it has some of their best songs."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Enter Sandman is still a favorite of mine and all time great album opener."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think the themes were as unified as in Justice, but it's still a really good album."
"__MUSIC__ It was better than Kill 'em All, at least. That one was a little raw."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was their first album. So that's to be expected."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to their recent stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard the latest album, but I did like Death Magnetic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I thought it was a return to form for them."
"__MUSIC__ It was definitely a message to those who thought they couldn't perform like they used to in the days of Master of Puppets."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever seen them in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it was around the turn of the century and they refused to play any of their classic stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That's a bummer."
"__MUSIC__ It was still a good concert, though."
"__MUSIC__ I need to make it to one. They're getting older, so who knows how long they'll keep touring."
