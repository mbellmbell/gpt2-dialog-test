"__BASEBALL__ Have you been to a ballgame recently?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, last week."
"__BASEBALL__ How was it?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's the first time I've been since I was a kid. It was okay."
"__BASEBALL__ Did the Reds win?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, they lost, but it was still a fun time."
"__BASEBALL__ I haven't been to many games since I was a kid too. I tried going recently, but it just didn't hold up."
"__BASEBALL__ It's definitely more comfortable to sit at home and watch."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, you don't have to pay for food and you can always see what's going on."
"__BASEBALL__ Not to mention you won't get rained on."
"__BASEBALL__ They could still call the game though."
"__BASEBALL__ It makes me wonder why they play in stadiums without roofs."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it's not like someone is going to bounce a ball off the ceiling."
"__BASEBALL__ I suppose it would cost too much to upgrade current stadiums."
"__BASEBALL__ They would have to build new ones."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm surprised they can't, with what they charge for a hot dog."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the cost to taste ratio is not good."
"__BASEBALL__ It's supposed to be sunny for the next game, though."
"__BASEBALL__ It doesn't matter. I'll be watching on TV."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too."
