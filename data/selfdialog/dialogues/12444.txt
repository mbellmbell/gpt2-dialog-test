"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would've ever thought that sports can be scruitinized in such details?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we do love knowing a lot about sports. We need history, stats, the last time this happened, that happened etc"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But we don't even analyze the inancial markets in such details."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course we do. Balcks scholes equation is a stochastic differential equation that models the options pricing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can we do something similar for the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Someone probably already has done it. But what's the point Black Schole equation doesn't work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is why the LTCM went bankrupt. But if we know why it doesn't work, then we can make it work for the NFL and predict the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Toss a coin, that's the simple version of the Black Scholes. it will win half the time at least"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha. You think you're so funny"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, so the ratings, yeah. It's got some issues, but gives us a great correlation as to who the better player is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But better players do not always win the game, so what's the point?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh, like I said, it's a guideline. That's all. It just feels better than betting blindly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Might as well bet blindly, if it only gives you the trends and guidelines."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. It helps a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know would be cool?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh boy, here we go again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want a surface graph of total offense that rate 3 dimensions. Run efficiency, reception efficiency, and one more..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ um... how are you defining the efficiencies?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Run efficiency would be runs attempted divided by yards gained."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL already has this. It's called average yards gained by run. For the individual players as well as for the team. Only thignn new would be to put that in a graph. but you can't it's just one number for each"
