"__MUSIC__ I need some new bands to listen to. Can you give me something I haven't heard before?"
"__MUSIC__ You came to the right person. Have you ever heard Pinback?"
"__MUSIC__ I never heard of them before. What kind of music are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're indie, but very experimental in what they do."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds pretty interesting. How are they experimental?"
"__MUSIC__ They do things that no one else does. They're a 3 piece band that sounds like more than 3 members."
"__MUSIC__ What songs should I listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ You should check out Fortress. Its my favorite song from them."
"__MUSIC__ I will as soon as I get home. What albums would you say are the best?"
"__MUSIC__ My personal favorites are probably their self-titled, and Summer In Abaddon."
"__MUSIC__ I'll make sure I listen to them soon."
"__MUSIC__ I will warn you. Their lyrics can be a little weird at times."
"__MUSIC__ I don't necessarily mind that, but what do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I'll just say that sometimes the lyrics don't make much sense. They're just a really fun band to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I'm very interested. I can't wait to listen to them."
"__MUSIC__ The best thing about them is that the bassist kind of emulates a second guitar, but still gives them the much needed low end."
"__MUSIC__ I love when bassists try to go above and beyond the normal duty of a bass."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. This is why I'm so in love with them."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you for the suggestion!"
"__MUSIC__ Any time. I am always happy to help with recommendations."
