"__MUSIC__ Hey have you listened to the band No Doubt?"
"__MUSIC__ The one with Gwen Stefani? Yeah I've heard some of their stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to them a lot lately.  They have some great music."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely have a unique sound.  They've been around since the mid nineties I believe."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think it was like 1994 when I first heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds right.  I think Tragic Kingdom was the first album."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and it was kinda ska punk.  It was definitely unique for that time period."
"__MUSIC__ They're from California, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Certainly sounds that way to me.  Tragic Kingdom had the Don't Speak single didn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was the one that really caught the nation's attention."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and then Gwen Stefani sorta took off from there."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's what got her noticed I believe."
"__MUSIC__ But then she had Hella Good and Simple Kind of Life and Underneath it All, remember?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, those were great hits too."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't they get some grammys?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm pretty sure they did.  They were pretty famous for awhile there."
"__MUSIC__ I think the Sweet Escape in 2006 was Gwen's solo album wasn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think she had several.  That was a great song too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really like her.  I'm not sure what happened to the rest of the band."
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea."
