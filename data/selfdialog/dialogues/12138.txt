"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are the Chicago Bears looking for this upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Bears are looking pretty bad!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't believe in Mitch Trubisky?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't seen him play a game yet! I've just watched the college highlights but I'm not sold on him being much of an improvement for the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything at this point has to be better then Jay Cutler right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jay Cutler gets a bad reputation from all the media news but he's been solid quarterback for the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's been terrible! I know you're a Bears fan but you have to admit he's one of the worse quarterbacks in the league the past years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know the public perception of him has been bad and the Bears record has been awful but people forget we play in a tough division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll give you the Green Bay Packers as being tough and the Minnesota Vikings when Adrian Peterson was there, even the Detroit Lions as a tough opponent but it's not like the NFC East."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's ridiculous! You know the NFC Central is probably the most competitive division in the NFL with all the teams always playing tough against each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that would go to the AFC Central or the NFC South. The NFC Central has been pretty much dominated by the Green Bay Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lions gave the Packers a good run last year and they're looking better this season too. Matt Stafford is a legitimate Pro Bowl quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Lions have a shot of winning the NFC Central?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I seriously do think they have a good chance. The Packers looked vulnerable last year and you never know about Aaron Rodgers health especially with that weak offensive line he has."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, but I still don't see the Bear challenging any of those teams with your current roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bears' roster is young but I think they're going to surprise a lot of people. These guys are good players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think there's enough talent or experience for them to compete much this year. Didn't you also lose Alshon Jeffery?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes we lost him to the Philadelphia Eagles. He signed this off season with them, but it's all about Cameron Meredith now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right, Meredith is looking promising and at least Mitch gives you some hope now that Cutler has retired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hopeful for the upcoming season and I'm a little sad to see Jay Cutler retire. The pressure definitely got to him."
