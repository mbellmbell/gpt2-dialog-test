"__DISNEY__ Who is your favorite? Tinker Bell or Wendy?"
"__DISNEY__ Tinker Bell, no question."
"__DISNEY__ Why Tinker Bell?"
"__DISNEY__ Tinker Bell has that pixie dust. She can fly and everything."
"__DISNEY__ What about Wendy Darling?"
"__DISNEY__ Wendy is okay, but she leaves Peter and the boys to go grow up."
