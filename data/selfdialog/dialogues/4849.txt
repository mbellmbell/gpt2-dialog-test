"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Tupac Shakur's music?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, what a hard question to answer.  He's definitely one of my favorite artists of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Why is it hard to answer then?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I love his music.  I have so much to say about it."
"__MUSIC__ I love his music too.  Plus there's so much intrigue surrounding him and his biography."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there really is.  Some people think he's still alive."
"__MUSIC__ I don't, but I think his music is great.  I think he wrote some of it in prison."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he did.  That's what I heard too."
"__MUSIC__ And it's weird to me that he kept producing music after he was dead."
"__MUSIC__ I think that was stuff he already wrote that someone else produced and released."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I was wondering how that worked.  Well that makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  It had a different sound to it than his original stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it was great music too.  I love how his music evolved over the years."
"__MUSIC__ It really did, but it always had great beats and great lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I love about it.  His tunes are always memorable."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, not like so much of the bland hip-hop you hear that all sounds the same."
"__MUSIC__ I know it.  He had that great West Coast style, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, in almost all of his songs."
"__MUSIC__ I have a book of poetry he wrote, too."
"__MUSIC__ Man, almost all of his songs were like poetry."
