"__MUSIC__ Hey who do you think is the worst rapper in the business today?"
"__MUSIC__ I can only pick one?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Pick the absolute worst you can think of."
"__MUSIC__ There are so many, but if I had to pick one it would be Nicki Minaj."
"__MUSIC__ What? Why?"
"__MUSIC__ She is one of many rappers that degrade the genre rather than give it a positive light."
"__MUSIC__ How do you come to that conclusion."
"__MUSIC__ Name one song she's made that really had any kind of substance."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean exactly."
"__MUSIC__ You kow, something that has a story to tell or an interesting message to the listeners."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think she's done a song with an actual message in her music."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. It's always about her body, her sexual escapades and her wealth. Nothing of interest."
"__MUSIC__ I get that but whats wrong with singing about that kind of stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Well for one it's been done to death by every other rapper in the world."
"__MUSIC__ I can agree with that."
"__MUSIC__ Two, it's just not interesting. Here answer this. Who would you rather listen to Eminem or Nicki Minaj?"
"__MUSIC__ Eminem."
"__MUSIC__ Want to know why?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure."
"__MUSIC__ Because all of his music, every single song is interesting and a good listen."
