"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm...my favorite Star Wars character would have to be Obi Wan Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why so?  There are plenty of other characters.  What makes him your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like he is morally correct and thinks through his actions compared to others.  Plus, he uses a blue lightsaber."
"__STAR_WARS__ Blue lightsaber?  What makes it better than the other colors?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not more powerful...I just prefer the color blue."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, what about Rey?  She uses a blue lightsaber."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rey is not my favorite.  She's a good character though.  Who is your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like Kylo Ren.  His cross-guard lightsaber is actually really cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ I told you...lightsabers do have something to do with your favorite Star Wars characters."
