"__DISNEY__ Johnny Depp must really love playing Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean movies."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I'm sure he does- hit movies, more fame, more money..."
"__DISNEY__ No, I mean he must really enjoy the character- he turned up in April at Disneyland at the Pirates of the Caribbean ride dressed up as his character."
"__DISNEY__ What was he doing there? Did Disney ask him to do a promo for the new movie or something?"
"__DISNEY__ No, apparently he just wanted to surprise his fans."
"__DISNEY__ I bet there were some really thrilled fans at the ride when they saw him!"
"__DISNEY__ There were dozens of screaming fans. He was interacting with them, and quoting lines from the movies, and had his sword."
"__DISNEY__ Can you imagine how shocked you would be? At first they probably thought it was just a celebrity double."
"__DISNEY__ The fans were quoted as being shocked and surprised, and said he acted just like his movie character."
"__DISNEY__ That would really get people excited. His character is so popular. And having him just pop up out of nowhere must have been amazing for those fans."
