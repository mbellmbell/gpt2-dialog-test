"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of 'A Perfect Circle'?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so... but not sure."
"__MUSIC__ Well, have you heard of Tool?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, APC is the side project of Tool's singer Maynard James Keenan."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, okay! Any big hits I would have heard of."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. One that comes to mind is 'Judith' from 2000."
"__MUSIC__ I'll look it up."
"__MUSIC__ Also '3 Libras' from 2001?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I've definitely heard that one before!"
"__MUSIC__ The reason why I'm asking is because they're going on tour this fall."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? Are they coming into the area?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, at the end of November."
"__MUSIC__ Nice! With who?"
"__MUSIC__ Not sure yet, are you interested in going with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe! Do they have any new music I should be catching up on?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, I think they're working on a new disc right now that's supposed to be out next year."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, well what about before that? What's their latest one?"
"__MUSIC__ Way back in the early 2000's, but it's called 'Thirteenth Step' and worth checking it out!"
"__MUSIC__ Great, I will!"
