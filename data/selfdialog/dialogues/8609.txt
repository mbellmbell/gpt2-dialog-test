"__BEATLES__ Yes, they are all over the internet and T.V."
"__BEATLES__ Well I am just wondering what those woman who are seen crying and screaming think now."
"__BEATLES__ Some are probably embarrassed. Others are probably just to have screen time."
"__BEATLES__ I thought more are they ashamed of making a fool of themself?"
"__BEATLES__ Beatles were huge and these women were girls so I think they probably would just laugh it off. Or recall happy memories."
"__BEATLES__ True, it would be kind of neat to see you younger self in that scenario."
"__BEATLES__ Today I feel people would be much more aware of themselves at concerts."
"__BEATLES__ Girls would be too busy taking selfies to appreciate the musicians."
"__BEATLES__ For a band like the beatles that would have been a  true shame. I wish I could have seen them live."
