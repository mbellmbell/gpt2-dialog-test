"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the favorite to win the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't see, but I'm guessing the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I'd bet that would be the most likely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Dallas, Atlanta, and Oakland will be in the running too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about Oakland?  I like their QB, Carr."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is really good.  Hopefully his broken leg is healed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot about that.  He broke it right before the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and Houston was having QB problems too.  What a bad game to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure was.  I think Houston will be better this year now that Osweiler is gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He seemed like he'd be good, but I think he has confidence issues in the pocket."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still can't believe Houston didn't want Romo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would've been a great fit for both of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Houston has a great defense and just neede and experience QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but I think money was a problem.  Romo calling NFL games should be interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will do okay.  He did get a great job though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure did.  He got in the booth with Jim Nantz."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nantz is great. Like how he calls an NFL game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget the Masters!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does college basketball too, but I think he is best doign the NFL games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he has Romo to carry now.  Hopefully they are a good pair."
