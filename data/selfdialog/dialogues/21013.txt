"__THRILLER__ Have you seen Seven?"
"__THRILLER__ Is that the thriller with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, what did you think of it?"
"__THRILLER__ I really liked it a lot. I was so dark and creepy."
"__THRILLER__ It was especially John Doe's books."
"__THRILLER__ Did you know all of John Doe's books were real books? They were written for the film."
"__THRILLER__ Wow. I had no idea."
"__THRILLER__ To me, that makes the movie even creepier."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that fact that someone had to sit and write all of that out is crazy."
"__THRILLER__ Let's hope they got paid well for it!"
