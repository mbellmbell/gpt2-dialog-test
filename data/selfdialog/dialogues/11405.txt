"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the worst NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, that's a loaded question."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's understandable, it's based on the season, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Like the Raiders was horrible one season, and then they got Carr and just look at them now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. But I think the Browns have been very bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, yeah, they can't pick out a proper QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What ever happened to RG3 and everyone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, both of their defense and offense are just horrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah didn't they have an all lost season the year before that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope they won one game to not have the worst season ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have anyone ever gone 0-16?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the Lions in 2008."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah! But they turn around now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they've been playing much better. Though, I still can't forget that game where Aaron Rodgers throw that Hail Mary and beat them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, that was heart-broken."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, who do you think is the worst team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to go the Browns or the Jacs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, leave it to Florida to have 3 teams and still suck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha quality over quantity, am I right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes sir."
