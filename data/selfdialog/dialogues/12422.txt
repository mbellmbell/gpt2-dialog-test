"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the new celebration rules?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm not that familiar with the specifics."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mostly it is allowing more celebrations after touchdowns as long as they aren't deemed inappropriate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's wonderful, I miss those days of TO and Chad Johnson competing with celebrations."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, I like the group celebrations as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just like soccer!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how much they will actually allow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point, they may say they are going to relax on the rules, but that doesn't mean they actually will."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking they will possibly have some fines for celebrations that they said were going to be legal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, hopefully that doesn't stop the celebrations in the first place!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully we will also see lots of touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More touchdowns equal more celebrations!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm looking forward to some Patriots games and there high-score potential offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Cooks and the revamped running backs, they should put up some good points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A Falcons and Patriots rematch may put up a fair amount of points and have some nice celebrations."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, Cooks' still can't do his bow and arrow!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is unfortunate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I think they should make some exceptions as that is definitely not a modern weapon or anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but you do have to make limits somewhere and it is easier there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose so, but that will still lead to some nice fines!"
