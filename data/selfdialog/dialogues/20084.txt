"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the Cube movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the third one, Cube Zero."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay, so you know kind of the premise of it then."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I wouldn't mind seeing them from the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ The first one I thought was more well done than the third, it definitely has a surprise ending, but I thought Cube 2 was the scariest."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it legitimately made me squirm in places."
"__MOVIES__ Because of the traps?"
"__MOVIES__ No not the traps, the characters. One in particular was very menacing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay. There were some scary aspects of Cube Zero I thought."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. I just remember it being a little more tame."
"__MOVIES__ Incinerating people when they say they don't believe in God doesn't sound very tame..."
"__MOVIES__ True. I just remember psychologically the second one was hard to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I gotcha. Well I really liked Zachary Bennett in Cube Zero."
"__MOVIES__ I don't blame you!"
"__MOVIES__ We should watch them together sometime."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Maybe during the day though, because I know they're supposed to be mystery/sci-fi or whatever but I think of them as thriller, they're kind of scary."
"__MOVIES__ No worries."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait till we get to the watches part!"
