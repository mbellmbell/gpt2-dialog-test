"__STAR_WARS__ Which character in the franchise do you think had the best story arc?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader, by far. He just had such a long journey, especially once the prequels came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ I completely agree. You found yourself wondering towards Empire if this was any hope for him at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely. But I think once it's revealed that he is Luke's father, it becomes a bit more apparent."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is interesting. How did you figure at that point?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because Luke, who is completely fighting the good fight, now knows his father was not murdered, and is indeed Darth Vader. You can't help but feel that Luke will try to help him 'heal', so to speak."
"__STAR_WARS__ Makes total sense. And of course, you do know 'Return of the Jedi' is named after Vader, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course. At the very end, where he saves Luke from the Emperor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. Vader became Anakin Skywalker and a Jedi, once again."
"__STAR_WARS__ By sacrificing himself for his son, he didn't die just a Jedi, but a hero."
