"__SUPERHERO__ Did you see the movie Dr. Strange?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, but I may have fallen asleep during part of it."
"__SUPERHERO__ You're kidding me! How could you fall asleep?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I saw it really late and it just didn't really hold my attention."
"__SUPERHERO__ I loved that movie! Don't you like Benedict Cumberbatch?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, but for some reason he just didn't hold my attention in that movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ He was great in it! He was perfect for the part."
"__SUPERHERO__ I guess I'm not that familiar with Dr. Strange in general, so I wouldn't know if he was good in that role."
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't really know much about Dr. Strange either, but I still thought he was great."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe I'll have to watch it again and stay awake this time!"
