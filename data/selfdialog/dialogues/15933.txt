"__ROCK__ They're having a sale at the record store downtown, do you want to go with me after we get off work?"
"__ROCK__ Sure, I could use some new cds to listen to in the car. What's the sale prices?"
"__ROCK__ It said 30% off of select artist cds and albums, and there were some cool rock band cds in the ad."
"__ROCK__ That sounds good, what kind of bands were they?"
"__ROCK__ They had Imagine Dragons, Breaking Benjamin, U2, and Red Hot Chili Peppers in the ad."
"__ROCK__ OH, I really like Imagine Dragons. I was listening to a song on the radio the other day, Demons, and I loved the way they sang that song."
"__ROCK__ I listen to the radio in the car sometimes, but I got a new car cd player for Christmas, so now I've been listening to a lot of cds while I drive."
"__ROCK__ What cds have you been listening to?"
"__ROCK__ A lot of old rock bands. I was jamming to AC/DC on the way to work this morning, singing yeah you, shook me all night long."
"__ROCK__ That's hilarious. We'll have to play it on the way to the record store when we get off work."
