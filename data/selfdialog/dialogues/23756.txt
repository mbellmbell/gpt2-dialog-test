"__SUPERHERO__ What is your favorite Nolan directed Batman movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think Batman Begins."
"__SUPERHERO__ That is a good one. Where it all started... for nolan anyways with batman."
"__SUPERHERO__ I love a good origins background story. I love to see superheros develop into the new stronger persona."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes agreed. I also thought this film established a new tone to the batman movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ It did, it became more dark and much more serious overall."
"__SUPERHERO__ Which is good and bad. I enjoy the comic book aspect others but each decade seems to have a different take on the batman franchise."
"__SUPERHERO__ I am glad that they got away from the cheese of the horrible george clooney era batman.  Michael keaton I love but george was just no good in this role."
"__SUPERHERO__ Clooney was not as his strongest that is for sure. I thought katie holmes was super good in batman begins, I wish she would not have left."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too. I did not care as much for maggie in that role. Katie seemed better suited and had more chemistry on screen with bale."
