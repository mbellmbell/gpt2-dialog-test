"__MOVIES__ I just rewatched the movie Spy with Melissa McCarthy, have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did. I thought it was hysterical."
"__MOVIES__ I laughed my way through it. My husband thought I was going to have a stroke."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the relationship between the two women. They did a great job of casting that."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed they did. Those two women were perfect together, great comic timing."
"__MOVIES__ I could not believe how much she threw herself around. She is very physical in that role."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I am sure some of it is stunt people, but a lot of it had to be her."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. She isn't up to Daniel Craig's moves, but she was brilliant and hysterical."
"__MOVIES__ Oh speaking of Daniel Craig. He is my favorite Bond ever."
"__MOVIES__ I love him too. Which is your favorite movie."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed Skyfall. The backstory was a great addition to the Bond story."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, it really was great. Casino Royal explained a lot about his character too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, more in the romance department. Skyfall really dipped into his childhood which was very interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I have to admit I cried when M died in his arms. That was so sad."
"__MOVIES__ I cried too. I was sorry to see her go."
"__MOVIES__ The new M and Q are pretty great. I will always Judi Dentch's M best."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. But what a way to wrap up her character."
"__MOVIES__ It was a brilliant script. The actors did a great job giving fans that moment."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I think as much as I love Skyfall that is probably my favorite moment from the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. A very intelligent spin on a Bond woman."
