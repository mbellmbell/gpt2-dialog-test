"__THRILLER__ I watched Saw with my brother last night.  I haven't seen it in forever."
"__THRILLER__ I haven't seen that in years either."
"__THRILLER__ Did you like it?"
"__THRILLER__ I think I did.  I don't think I'd want to watch it now though."
"__THRILLER__ It's pretty gory."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, there are movies that are worse.  This one was about as bad as I could handle."
"__THRILLER__ Did you like the sequels?"
"__THRILLER__ I didn't see all of them."
"__THRILLER__ I have them in case you'd want to borrow them."
"__THRILLER__ I probably will pass on that."
