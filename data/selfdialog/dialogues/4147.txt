"__MUSIC__ Do you know who Testament are?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them. They were popular in the 80s, weren't they?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup. They came around the same time as Metallica."
"__MUSIC__ I've also heard that they're super underrated."
"__MUSIC__ You'd be right in saying that."
"__MUSIC__ Why, though? What's so special?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just that so many people see the Big 4 as the only thrash bands without knowing that there's others that do it better."
"__MUSIC__ Are they still around?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and would you like to know something?"
"__MUSIC__ What is it?"
"__MUSIC__ They're all over 50, and their music is more aggressive than even Slayer's."
"__MUSIC__ That's a very bold claim right there."
"__MUSIC__ Trust me, I can back it up. Just listen to Brotherhood of the Snake."
"__MUSIC__ Is that their most recent album?"
"__MUSIC__ That's right. For having members all above 50, it's unbelievable how young they still sound."
"__MUSIC__ You''re really trying your best to get them over, aren't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. Like you even said, they're super underrated."
"__MUSIC__ Must be really good if you're giving them this high praise."
"__MUSIC__ Like I said, just look the album up. You won't be disappointed."
"__MUSIC__ Alright then. Let's put your words to the test."
