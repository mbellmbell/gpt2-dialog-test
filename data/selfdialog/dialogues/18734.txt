"__MOVIES__ hey, have you seen the list of imdb's top 100 movies?"
"__MOVIES__ oh yes, I have. Why? what about it?"
"__MOVIES__ nothing, it's just that I find certain movies in it to be surprising."
"__MOVIES__ why? what do you find so surprising?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean there are certain movies which I personally found to be horrible are on that list!"
"__MOVIES__ I think that list represents which movies majority of people liked it, not which movie you liked."
"__MOVIES__ Are you sure that that list is based on which movie majority of people liked? I thought that list is based on critics ratings."
"__MOVIES__ well, but maybe they are combination of both."
"__MOVIES__ yes, It makes sense that they would combine both majority and critics ratings."
"__MOVIES__ By the way, which movie on that you list you found to be surprising?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember specific name but there has been many movies on that list that I personally found to be horrible."
"__MOVIES__ well, can you name at least one of them?"
"__MOVIES__ okay, let me remember. by the way have you seen shawshank redemption?"
"__MOVIES__ of course! it's on rank 1 on that list."
"__MOVIES__ you will be surprised to hear that I haven't watched it yet."
"__MOVIES__ what? seriously? you haven't watched shawshank redemption? are you serious?"
"__MOVIES__ yes, I haven't watched it yet. Somehow I don't feel like watching it."
"__MOVIES__ dude, what is wrong with you? that is one of the best movies I have seen in my lifetime!"
"__MOVIES__ okay, I will trust your suggestion and watch it, despite my feelings about that movie."
"__MOVIES__ yes, you won't regret it, watch it today only!"
