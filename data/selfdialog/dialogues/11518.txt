"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When does the NFL season start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think preseason starts early August."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just checked, you are right the first game is Dallas vs. Arizona on August 3rd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is earlier than I thought.  Dallas is going to be good again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if Dak Prescott will improve in his 2nd year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was really good as a rookie.  It will be hard to improve on that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but he will be taking reps with the first team and have all the preparation time he didn't have last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good point, and their O-Line and run game gives them great balance on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What other teams do you think will be good this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots will be, they are always solid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, what about Carolina?  Do you think they can get it together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I was surprised they dropped off so much after a 15-1 regular season where they went to the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Newton must have been injured or something, I think they can get back on track."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would like to see it.  What about Seattle, they are always a contender."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will be good, but with Lynch gone their run game has struggled and I'm not sure how Eddie Lacy will do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lynch is with the Raiders now, coming back out of retirement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Las Vegas Raiders, I wonder how he will be after not playing for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Running backs tend to drop off quickly and go from dominant to unproductive very quickly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just ask Priest Holmes, LT or any of the others."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, I hope he does well though.  He is fun to watch with his running style and skittles."
