"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Avalanche Game last night was amazing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It was exciting. Every time they scored a goal, the Blackhawks came right back."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Both goalees were on fire."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That penalty in the fourth quarter that sent the Avs player to the penalty box had me biting my nails."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I thought sure the Blackhawks would get ahead, but the Avs' penalty kill stopped them cold."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Avs have a good chance to win back the Stanley Cup this year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I  hope so, but the Penguins and the Blackhawks are going to be tough to beat."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ When is the next home game?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Two weeks. We should try to get tickets."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ We should, but I like to be right down on the ice."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too. I like to see all the action up-close."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hope Lewis is off the DL by then. He's my favorite player."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Patterson is my favorite. He has the most shots on goal for any player right now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They did great in the draft this year. The team is really starting to gel."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They are, but they need to stay out of the penalty box."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But that's hockey for you -- everybody's emotions are high, especially as the playoffs get nearer."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, but they need to keep their head in the game. Terchoff had a hat trick two weeks ago -- I want to see more action like that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think he's still healing from that groin injury he got earlier in the season. But he should be back in top form by next week."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hope so. Let me know what you find out about those tickets, okay?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I will."
