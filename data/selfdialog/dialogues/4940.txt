"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you remember which Fast and Furious didn't have Jordana Brewster?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think she was in all of them except 2 Fast 2 Furious and the most recent one, The Fate of the Furious."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I wonder if she'll ever return. I really like her character of Mia Torretto."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Same here, I'm a big fan of hers. I can understand how they would feel it being out of place if she was in there without Paul Walker's Brian."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Such a tragic lost. I know what you mean. It does seem with every Fast and Furious they're introducing a new character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's how you keep a franchise going! You keep the main stars and you slowly introduce new ones so the audience can grow attached!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I am definitely glad the Rock got to be a part of the universe. Ever since Fast 5 I've been on the Rock train the whole way!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The Rock is great! He's beyond ridiculous as each movie goes on but in a fun positive way."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I hope he stays with the franchise until the 10th? I think that's how many they said they were going to make."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I heard 10 also. I bet if they continue doing well at the box office we'll get spin offs. That'll be fun for all Fast and Furious fans!"
