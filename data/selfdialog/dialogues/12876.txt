"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are you rooting for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Baltimore Ravens"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cool do you think they'll win it all this year?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We seem to be in the rebuilding process and I'm not sure we're ready to take the prize, but I'm hopeful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am personally looking for the Eagles to do good things this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you think that'll happen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It looks like they finally got Wentz some receivers he can utilize."
