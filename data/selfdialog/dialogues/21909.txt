"__DISNEY__ What DIsney movies are out?"
"__DISNEY__ I know Cars 3 just got released."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, fun! I loved the first one!"
"__DISNEY__ Me, too. My kids have always loved watching the first one."
"__DISNEY__ Mine, too. But none of us like the sequels."
"__DISNEY__ Nah, but the third one is getting really good reviews."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe we'll try it. It has to be better than Captain Underpants, right?"
"__DISNEY__ I would think so! Let me know how it is."
"__DISNEY__ I will. My kids will probably be quoting it for weeks."
"__DISNEY__ Speed? I am speed!"
