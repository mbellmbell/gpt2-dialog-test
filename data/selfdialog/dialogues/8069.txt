"__POP__ What is the last pop song you've heard?"
"__POP__ I think it was a The Weeknd song called, 'I Feel it Coming'."
"__POP__ Oh, really? I'm not sure I've heard that one."
"__POP__ Yeah, I just so happened to see a bit of the music video the other day."
"__POP__ Is it good?"
"__POP__ Oh, it's alright. It sounds like every other pop song. He tries too hard to sound like Michael Jackson."
"__POP__ Oh, I think I know who you're talking about now. The guy with the wacky hair?"
"__POP__ Yeah, that's him. All his songs sound pretty much the same. So, if you've heard one, you've heard them all."
"__POP__ Well, I guess I won't be checking that song out."
"__POP__ I wouldn't bother. It's not unpleasant like some songs on the radio. It's mediocre."
