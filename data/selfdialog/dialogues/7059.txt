"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you watch the Penguins game last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, I did watch it."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hope the rest of this series isn't like this; although I would be happy if they won if every game is like this."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hear what you mean. That was some brutal hockey."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think Ottawa is playing some sort of 1-3-1 defense."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I heard that it was the trap."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't think it's the same kind of trap that the New Jersey Devils implemented years ago."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They don't have the players the Devils have."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They need to attack this defense another way."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And don't forget, Fleury has to continue to play out of his mind."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, Fleury has been outstanding."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Especially with all of the injuries."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Don't remind me of the injuries."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I've never seen a team with so many injuries in my life."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They are practically down to 5 defensemen."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hopefully Daley comes back tomorrow. Have you heard any news about him."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Haven't heard anything. I think they will bring Streit up to fill Schultz's place."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, most definitely it will be Streit."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If only we had LeTang."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If only."
