"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a couple teams this year that could really make some noise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, a few seem to be on the decline."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Philly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uhhh, I'm not sure. I think they have a a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You like Wentz?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, that guy is a stud."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, as long as they have playmakers around him, they will win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, last year, nobody could catch the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Alshon Jeffrey should solve some of that problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, him and Torrey Smith were nice additions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that with Ertz over the middle. Very nice!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget about their defense either. Fletcher Cox can ruffle some feathers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he better do that or their secondary is going to get torched."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, thats a major weakness. They have to figure that out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I can't name one player on their secondary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come to think of it, I can't name any of their cornerbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have a couple of great safeties, but time will tell if that is enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I don't know if even that will be enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well if they can get some pressure on the quarterback consistently, it just may."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right. We will find out."
