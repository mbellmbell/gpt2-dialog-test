"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been watching any of the playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but I'm not sure why."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, Cleveland just beat the Celtics by 55 and the Spurs are hurt."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that was a blowout.  Up 41 at the half.  Jeez."
"__BASKETBALL__ There is more parity in football."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe, but think about the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think I was already thinking about the finals before these last matchups even started."
"__BASKETBALL__ So you think they should just end the season and then let the Cavs and Warriors play to see who's boss?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sort of.  I mean I don't expect buzzer beaters every game but all the games seem to be one sided, no matter who wins."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, you're right, things have been a little boring so far."
"__BASKETBALL__ But the Warriors-Cavs final should change all that."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hope so, I like watching playoff basketball.  Who do you think is going to win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, LeBron seems like a player of destiny."
"__BASKETBALL__ But the Warriors seem more well rounded."
"__BASKETBALL__ I would never count out LeBron, or bet against him for that matter."
"__BASKETBALL__ You are probably right.  I just hope we see a good series."
"__BASKETBALL__ You don't like 41 point leads at the half?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Not at all.  Give me overtime!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Let's just get the real party started.  The finals!"
