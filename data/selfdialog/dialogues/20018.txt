"__MOVIES__ I plan on catching up on some good movies!"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds fun, I love watching movies."
"__MOVIES__ I do to, and with work and all I do not get the chance to very often."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean! I have been wanting to watch the new Transformer movie but have not got the chance to."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I am thinking that will be a good one. Mark Wahlberg plays in this one as well, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes he is back for his second Transformer movie. I thought he was awesome in the last one."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you! He is really good in most movies however."
"__MOVIES__ Yea he is my husband's favorite actor."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever watched Ted or Ted 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! My husband and I have seen them both a few times actually."
"__MOVIES__ I thought they were both hilarious! I could not hardly stop laughing all through them."
"__MOVIES__ I read that they are making a part three in the franchise. I hope it is true!"
"__MOVIES__ That would be awesome! I think it would do really well at the box office."
"__MOVIES__ No doubt about that, the first two done very well."
"__MOVIES__ I would say that Ted one and two are my favorite Wahlberg movies. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I would actually have to say Lone Survivor would be my favorite from him."
"__MOVIES__ I have never seen that one before. Is that the one that is a true story?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you should really watch it! It was an outstanding film to say the least."
