"__MOVIES__ Did you see what they're showing on LOGO this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't get that channel."
"__MOVIES__ They have a weekly show where they drink alcohol and watch a movie. They call it 'Cocktails & Classics'"
"__MOVIES__ My cousin calls that Sunday afternoon."
"__MOVIES__ Anyways, they're showing Showgirls."
"__MOVIES__ The one with that girl from Saved By The Bell??"
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  They were either scraping the bottom of the barrel or someone in that movie gave them a big check."
"__MOVIES__ Among other things."
"__MOVIES__ Will it be unedited?"
"__MOVIES__ I doubt it"
"__MOVIES__ They better use shot glasses then."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think they do.  Why?"
"__MOVIES__ That is going to be one very short program."
"__MOVIES__ Hahahahaha might make the movie better."
"__MOVIES__ The only reason to watch that movie is for the nudity.  Who didn't grow up wondering what Jessie Spano looked like naked?"
"__MOVIES__ Anyone who watched Showgirls first"
"__MOVIES__ Is there any part of her body she doesn't show off?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Her brain."
