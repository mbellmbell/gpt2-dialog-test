"__MOVIES__ What a really great action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You have to go with the best of all time, Die Hard."
"__MOVIES__ Die Hard was an amazing movie, I have not watched it in many years. That's a good choice."
"__MOVIES__ It's got everything you need in a great action movie and great characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, John McClane and of course Hans Gruber who was one of the best movie villains ever."
"__MOVIES__ I could quote Hans Gruber all night. He had some pretty good lines."
"__MOVIES__ Some people say Die Hard is a Christmas movie. Do you agree?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it takes place during the Christmas season. In the movie a Christmas party in the Nakatomi Plaza is interrupted by the terrorists."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anything you did not like about Die Hard?"
"__MOVIES__ It's really hard to come up with anything negative to say about it. It's almost perfect."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the Die Hard sequels at all?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the next two a lot, Die Hard 2: Die Harder and Die Hard With A Vengeance. I thought both of those were almost as good as the original"
"__MOVIES__ So you didn't like the more recent two Die Hard movies, Live Free or Die Hard and A Good Day to Die Hard?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, I thought both of those were pretty bad movie. They completely abandoned the things that made Die Hard great."
"__MOVIES__ They didn't have a lot of humor in the recent movies. Also Bruce Willis seemed like he didn't want to be there and it showed in his performance."
"__MOVIES__ Also the stunt just got too ridiculous in the later movies. They were always a little ridiculous but they were at least semi-plausible in the early movies."
"__MOVIES__ They also made John McClane into almost a super hero who could do anything in the last two Die Hard movies."
"__MOVIES__ YEah that whole point of his character is that he's supposed to be an average guy who gets thrown into crazy situations."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think they will make any more Die Hard movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I hope not, just let it be. We got three great and timeless movies out of the series and I'm perfectly happy with that."
