"__THRILLER__ Hey! I'm in the mood to see a good thriller movie tonight, any recommendations?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh! Definitely check out Alien: Covenant - it's excellent, really well done, and seriously scary."
"__THRILLER__ Really? I'm not a huge fan of the Alien franchise, though I'm open to reconsider. What did you like so much about this one?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, for one thing, it's got Billy Crudup in it, playing Christopher Oram, the first mate of the Covenant. He's really good - the movie's worth seeing for him alone if you like Billy Crudup."
"__THRILLER__ I do like Billy Crudup. Okay, I'm interested. Any other good cast members?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, I'm not a huge fan, but Michael Fassbender is really good in the movie, playing David 8 and Walter, these android characters. He's really good, and it's interesting fare!"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I do love Michael Fassbender. He's such an interesting actor."
"__THRILLER__ He is in this, certainly. Also, the movie's got Katherine Waterston as 'Danny,' an expert in terraforming. The character is really smart, I think she ups the quality of the movie in general."
"__THRILLER__ Hm, I've never heard of her, but this sounds like a movie that could probably keep my interest. I do like science fiction thrillers in general, so I'm going to give this a try."
"__THRILLER__ Hooray! I hope you enjoy it. Who knows, maybe you will turn out to be an Alien fan after all!"
