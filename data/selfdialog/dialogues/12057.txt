"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Russell Wilson has recovered from those nagging injuries he had last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so and so do the Seattle Seahawks. They'll need him to be 100% again this season if they hope to compete."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They made it through the regular season last year and just got destroyed by Atlanta in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't say they got destroyed but they definitely looked a lot inferior."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true Atlanta was on fire to end the season and that offense was nearly unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not to mention it but Atlanta's defense stepped up in the playoffs, so you couple that up with their offense and Seattle had no chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a healthy Russell Wilson would have made a difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think it would've mattered. The Seahawks last season had so many holes to fill on their team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does it seem weird to you that Marshawn Lynch is going to be in another NFL Jersey playing for another team next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't really surprise me that much, people forget that Marshawn was on the Buffalo Bills before coming to the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but with the Seahawks, that's when Marshawn became the BEAST and was really a public face people recognized."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think winning a Superbowl does that. It puts you into the spotlight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no doubt about that. I think it'll be strange seeing him in a Raiders jersey next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited about that! The Raiders are on a climb and I think they'll really challenge the Patriots this year and might even make it to the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could happen if Derek Carr is back and fully healthy. If not I don't like their chances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're one of the favorites this off season and Carr is young, he's going to recover."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he does, they looked great last year with him!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it'll be even better this year with Marshawn to take pressure off of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks should be able to take the NFC West this year I think. Arizona looks weaker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll have to see. Things change so much each year in the NFL."
