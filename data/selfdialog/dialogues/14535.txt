"__HORROR__ Do you like scary moves? My all time favorite scary movie has to be the original 'Amityville Horror'."
"__HORROR__ Absolutley, that house was crazy. I couldnt imagine living there. It looks creepy to begin with."
"__HORROR__ My favorites are those that could be real. You know dealing with paranormal."
"__HORROR__ Oh so like the 'Exorcist' too?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, calling in the priest, and then stabbing the crucifix in her private part. Terrible, but wicked."
"__HORROR__ I would hate to have been that preacher. Neck turning all the way and projectile vomiting."
"__HORROR__ It was pretty gross. Or how about the move with that little lady who talks in the baby voice. It's creepy."
"__HORROR__ Poltrigiest? That one?"
"__HORROR__ Yess, that movie scared me so bad when i was little. I was scared of elevators and bath time after that."
"__HORROR__ You better watch a cartoon before you go to bed tonight or the little lady will come to you through the tv static!!! Just kidding"
