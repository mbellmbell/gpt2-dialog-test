"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what are going to be the worst teams in the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Bears will be a poor team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Surely you can think of other bad teams!"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that they will have a rough season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A shame, but I can understand why it happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, football is a brutal sport, especially in the NFL."
