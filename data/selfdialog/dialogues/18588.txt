"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm not really in to super heroes."

"__MOVIES__ Well, isn't that the point, to escape reality?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I get that, but there are just too many super heroes."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like Batman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I actually can handle Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Don't you think he's a superhero?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, he's just a rich guy with gadgets."
"__MOVIES__ So you just don't like super powers?"
"__MOVIES__ Basically. I think it's a cheap way to tell a story."
"__MOVIES__ But didn't you always wish for a super power?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it would be cool, but I can't have one so I don't care about the movies."
"__MOVIES__ What type of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Give me a comedy any day."
"__MOVIES__ Any reason for that preference?"
"__MOVIES__ I like to watch a movie to escape the world and laugh a bit."
