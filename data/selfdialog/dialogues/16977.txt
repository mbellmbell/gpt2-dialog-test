"__MOVIES__ Curious did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did. Did you and did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I started watching a version online. I did not like it much and stopped it part way in."
"__MOVIES__ What did  you not like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I did not like the new song belle sings at the start. I thought if everything else is almost exactly the same as the animated why change it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was fairly close to the animated version. I liked it for the visual beauty and costumes."
"__MOVIES__ It was neat to see it brought to life. Maybe I will have to give it another try. Emma is not a great singer though."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you on that, she is not the strongest vocalist. But I love her from the harry potter movies."
"__MOVIES__ Harry Potter films are great . In a fun childish escape way."
"__MOVIES__ What serious or scary films do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I recently saw green room. It is a horror film. It was awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard about that film, but yet to watch it. It has Anton Yelchin right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It was kind of weird to watch him in a movie now that he passed away. He was a very likeable actor."
"__MOVIES__ Totally likeable. He was so cute when he was little too!"
"__MOVIES__ So I assume you saw his early films like Along came a spider?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you guessed correctly. He was also really entertaining in the star trek films."
"__MOVIES__ Ya I liked those movies a lot. Well made and fun action."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how many more they will make?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably as many movie sequels as they can come up with."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose that is typical, if movie is coming in for them, why stop?"
