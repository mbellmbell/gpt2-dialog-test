"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Revenge of the Sith was the best of the prequel?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah only because we know how Anakin turns to the dark side"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish we could have drawn it out longer"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think if we could have embraced Darth Vader as a nice guy longer it would have been better."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean empathize with a villain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I wish we could have done that."
"__STAR_WARS__ It went on for 3 movies"
"__STAR_WARS__ True but I wish it could have been another 3!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Thats way too long to make that story work"
