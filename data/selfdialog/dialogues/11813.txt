"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football please combe back on TV!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, it's been boring just watching baseball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Before we know it football wil be on Thursday, Sunday and Monday night."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thursday games are usually pretty boring but I watch them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it's usually teams like Cleveland or Jacksonville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they are trying to get more exposure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure how those games are assigned, but it is a spot light for two teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Monday night football is my favorite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd have to say Sunday night is mine. I like the NBC guys better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ John Gruden is my favorites so I lean towards Monday night football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I hope both night have some good matchups."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They usually have some good divisional games likes Dalls versus Washington."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do now.  Their team is fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like to watch the Saints throw a lot of passes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Brees can air it out!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Passing is the way of the NFL now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, but some teams have decent running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to have a good running back to throw off defenses or they wil just drop back in coverage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats why I'm liking the Cowboys lately.  Elliot is fun to watch."
