"__MUSIC__ yes. But, BUT! there is one caveat."
"__MUSIC__ oh great, what?"
"__MUSIC__ The rule 2."
"__MUSIC__ `About not repeating stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ yes that."
"__MUSIC__ Ugh We just did a whole exercise on it!"
"__MUSIC__ yes. about a note not repeating. But, is a whole C same as a quarter C?"
"__MUSIC__ um... no?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. So there is some wiggle room here beside repeated notes are beautiful. Why would Shconberg just ban it entirely?"
"__MUSIC__ Mayeb that's why there are other schools of thoughts about it"
"__MUSIC__ And most other composers have developed their own systems."
"__MUSIC__ Now I'm more confused than ever"
"__MUSIC__ Think of it as a suggestion rather than a rule where if you break it, you go to jail"
"__MUSIC__ Hah. That's stupid"
"__MUSIC__ But anyway. So we have the transformation down right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Retrograde(R), inversion(I), retrogradde inversion(RI), and the prime(P) which is doing nothing"
"__MUSIC__ Now think of a row, and think of how many different ways of applying those transformation are there. There are R, I, RI, And P"
"__MUSIC__ Um. I have no idea.l I don't even know where to begin to think about that."
"__MUSIC__ it depends on the length but let's just say one single row."
"__MUSIC__ Ok... There are 4 things. so, 16 combinations that are possible."
