"__BASKETBALL__ What is the deal with John Wall just taking over all of a sudden?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you mean all of a sudden he has been a top point guard for years?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well yeah but now he is really taking over."
"__BASKETBALL__ I suppose but I think you just were not paying attention to him before."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is possible but maybe there is reason if he cannot dominate the Celtics."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well is it really his fault, he has been going crazy but no one is helping him out."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think that is true. I just think the Wizards may not be there yet."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess but the Bulls gave the Celtics the same challenge as the Wizards."
"__BASKETBALL__ I am not sure that is totally sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well the series is likely to end up with the same series score."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe, but the Bulls also had playoff Rondo who was playing out of his mind."
"__BASKETBALL__ True but the the argument is if Wall is really a top point guard, and based on what you said he falls into the Rondo category."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well what i actually said is he falls into the 'playoff Rondo' category which is a totally different thing."
"__BASKETBALL__ True.  I wish he hadn't gotten injured cause who knows what would have happened with the Bulls."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they were clearly the worse team but they were going insane until he went down."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah it makes me wonder if they will bring him back next year."
"__BASKETBALL__ I doubt it.  He wasn't even starting earlier in the year."
"__BASKETBALL__ True but maybe his playoff performance will get him paid."
"__BASKETBALL__ Possibly but he has a history of being inconsistent."
"__BASKETBALL__ That makes a lot of sense."
