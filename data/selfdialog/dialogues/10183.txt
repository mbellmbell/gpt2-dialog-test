"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which artist is your favorite rapper?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know that I can choose just one, but I'd say that I like 90's hip-hop best."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Like Tribe Called Quest and Naughty by Nature?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly.  I do like some of the more serious rap as well, though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Anyone in particular that I should consider?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wu-Tang Clan, of course, Dr. Dre, Jay Z and Nas are all favorites for more hardcore rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I see you're more of an East Coast fan than West Coast, would you agree?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I'd agree I skew East Coast.  Mostly, I like good beats and I like when people have fun or are sincere and lyrical."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So do you like the new hip-hop artists that are more focused on social and political issues rather than gangster issues?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Like Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole?  Yeah, those guys are all great too and they kind of throw back to the 90's."
