"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, are you excited about the new NFL season? I've had enough of trying to get into soccer, let me tell you..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, totally! It's the only sport I follow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't blame you, there's way too much to follow otherwise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team do you root for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well you know I'm a Philly guy, so I'm all about the Eagles!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm from Seattle so I gotta go for the Seahawks every time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Woah, I didn't know that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I was in town for when they won the Superbowl in 2013. It was wild!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like how?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh you know, I was up in the University District so people were practically rioting, but like, in a good way. Tons of great live music and cheering in the streets!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's awesome, dude. How did you feel about the 2014 season though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh God, don't even talk to me about that one! Superbowl XLIX was a rough one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was 2005 all over again, you know? Isn't that the last time the Seahawks went to the Superbowl until the 2013 season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup--I don't remember seeing it though, I was a pretty young teenager back then. Pretty sure Seattle wasn't too happy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being beat by Denver has to be pretty embarrassing too, right? I mean, you West Coast guys aren't really known for your football..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey now, Colorado isn't exactly West Coast! And you always gotta root for the under-dog. I'd do that even if I wasn't a Seahawks man myself..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair enough. Who do you think's the best guy on the Seahawks this year? Any favorite picks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Russell Wilson's always been my man...I don't know too much about any up-and-coming guys this year, though. You?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Carson Wentz can beat out Russell Wilson as a quarterback any day, honestly. We don't have to trade around so much when we've got solid talent!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, I guess we'll see about that then!"
