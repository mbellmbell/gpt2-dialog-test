"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you ever play field hockey?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So just ice hockey, then?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ yes."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I guess that's the price you pay for living in Canada, eh?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, eh?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you ever play DFS hockey?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh Yeah. Every week. Do you?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ yeah I've recently been getting into it a lot, it's fun eh?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I;ve lost a lot of money though, I'm down in a hole for like 400 bucks this year, I think."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm about the same a little less though. Around 300 bucks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Funny thing is that you have to keep track of all the point makers. Like assists, shots, etc for the skaters, and the goalies post points for each saves and wins"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well you don't honestly keep track of all that yourself. DFS sites will do that for you."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well some of us have our own stat sheet to follow different players and choose the players to stack on our own using that data."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What position did you play?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I played left wing mostly. Sometimes, the wings would switch positions on our team, but I played left mostly."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Is there a reason?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm more left handed than left. I can still change easily, but I prefer left handed."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ This has to do with that whole off hand thing, right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Off 'wing.' Right, so If I were to shoot left down right wing, that will be off wing."
