"__DISNEY__ Do you know that The Lion King was essentially Hamlet right?"
"__DISNEY__ Was it now? I did not know that."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes. The plot points and character development are basically identical."
"__DISNEY__ How do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, Mustafa is killed by his brother Scar, just like in Hamlet."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, and so Simba was the Hamlet figure?"
"__DISNEY__ That's right. It's a coming of age and revenge story for him."
"__DISNEY__ But the ending was a little less bleak, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Ha! Yes, the bad guy dies in the end and everyone lives happily ever after."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I suppose that's only appropriate for Disney."
