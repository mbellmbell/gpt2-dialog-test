"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Zeke is a beast! Zeke and Dak should take the cowboys to the Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Here we go again. Cowboys need a better receiving core, if they're to go to the Superbowl, let alone win it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their receivers aren't very good. They could be so much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what's funny? The longest pass Dak's ever thrown in 2016 wasn't caught by their receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, Zeke caught it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, against the Steelers, 83 yards!."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's long for WRs even"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Zeke's gonna be a valuable player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know Dak passes as much as Brady, even slightly more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yep, they're both above 3500 yards for the last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Pat's total rushing is 1872, and Cowboys 2396."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. But look at their TDs. 24 Rushing TDs, and 25 receiving TDs for the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the pats have... 19 rushing TDs and 32 receiving TDs. See that's not that impressive over the Cowboys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's not so much how TDs you have, how many more you have over your opponent when you're playing the game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So then why bother looking at season TD numbers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It shows the strengths and pattern of their plays, which is important to make prediction as to what will unfold this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, man, this is getting too complicated"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, this is what it means to analyze the teams. And there are so many dimensions to look at"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To think there are people who do this for a living"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Football anbalysts work for TV channels and fantasy sites. Unless they're famous, they don't make much though"
