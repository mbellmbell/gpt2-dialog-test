"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you pick a team to root for, is it based on whether or not you think they can win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What sort of team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ An NFL team. Isn't it football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It did just start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, so how do you pick a team to root for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I never really picked. I'm from Wisconsin so I like the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it's just where you grew up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's how it is for most people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. I mean, I grew up in Oregon, but I'm not like a huge Seahawks fan or anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was that the closest team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so? I've never drawn out a map or anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what teams do you like then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Oakland Raiders. They seem like underdogs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So in your case it's the opposite then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Opposite of what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You root for the team you think is less likely to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. I guess I do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it just makes it more exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're a little strange, but I think I understand it."
