"__DISNEY__ I heard you say you are not a big Disney movie fan."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I hate to say it. Disney movies are so corny!"
"__DISNEY__ Are there any you actually like? I think a lot of them aren't corny."
"__DISNEY__ I do like Lady and the Tramp. The dogs won me over."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good one. I don't know anyone who can resist its charm."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I would also have to say that I liked The Sword and the Stone."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, a classic! Merlin is so funny in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ He cracked me up. It was a wonderful film."
"__DISNEY__ I feel like you can't really say you hate Disney movies if there are some you really like."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but there are so many that I hate as well."
