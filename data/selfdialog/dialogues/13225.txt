"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the top wide receiver in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We can argue all day about that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, who do you think are the top tier receivers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Antonio Brown from the Steelers is top I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you think Julio Jones from Atlanta is better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Julio still has a little bit to work on in his game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like the guy breaks open every game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Odell Beckham from the NY Giants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see him in the top ten but he does not have great top end speed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like DeSean Jackson?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a great over the top receiver but not overall plus is getting older."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus he has the big ego and occasional dumb play and doesn't do the possession receiving well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the bigger body receivers who seem to do better overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like Dez Bryant from Dallas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has the kind of build I think a prototype receiver should have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or like Alshon Jeffrrey?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see what kind of year he has after coming off of an injury year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a big threat in the games I've seen him in, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Jordy Nelson paired with Aaron Rogers is great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nelson makes Rogers all the more dangerous when he is on the field."
