"__MOVIES__ So, what's your favorite horror film?"
"__MOVIES__ It's hard to say, there's so many I liked, but I think one of them is definitely Nightmare on Elm Street 3."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, I remember that one!"
"__MOVIES__ I think it really raised the bar on the Nightmare films and horror in general, they way they had Freddy's doing all those transformations and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I remember when he was turned into that giant snake!"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of thought it was a worm, myself."
"__MOVIES__ Well, whatever."
"__MOVIES__ But yeah, that was cool!  And the scene where he turns that kid into a puppet."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man, that was freaking gross!  I remember watching that as a kid, that really turned my stomach!"
"__MOVIES__ Your parents let you watch that stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they didn't mind me watching crazy horror films as long as I didn't a) wake them up at night or b) there's wasn't a lot of nudity."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, interesting moral standards there."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know, right?"
"__MOVIES__ There were some downsides to the movie though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, what's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the whole 'Freddy Krueger cracking one liners' thing got started there, and I think the sequels went waaay too far with it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's kind of true.  They forgot the whole 'less is more' kind of thing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, thought of another, remember the scene where what's her name is running and she's got the little girl in her arms?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and it turns into a skeleton?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that one!  There's a part in that scene, where, even as a kid, I was like 'That's a doll!  She's carrying a doll!'"
