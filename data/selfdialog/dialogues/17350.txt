"__MOVIES__ Do you like any musical movies?"
"__MOVIES__ What does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ They're movies but pretty much just movie versions of a musical play."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. I think I get it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so do you like any particular ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen many, what's a good one?"
"__MOVIES__ I just watched The Phantom of the Opera again, that's probably the best one."
"__MOVIES__ What makes it the best?"
"__MOVIES__ The music is just wonderful, it's so much better than the other musicals'."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that?"
"__MOVIES__ The way each song is written is just so pleasing, and the melodies are incredibly memorable."
"__MOVIES__ Any songs in particular you like?"
"__MOVIES__ The whole scene they do where the Phantom takes the girl to his lair underground to the main theme is great."
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah there's some creepy themes that go on, but it's all really well done."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I'll definitely have to watch it sometime."
"__MOVIES__ Something great about it is that you don't even have to like musicals to enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ That's good to hear, I'm not really a big fan of musicals."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure you'll like it, just watching all the costumes and scenery is enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, sounds like they really did a good job with all of that."
