"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear Derek Carr is finalizing a new deal with a Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I didn't, who did you hear that from?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Per Adam Schefter. Deal is 'close' to done and should be announced by the end of the week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much is the deal for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ $25 million per year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would make him the highest paid quarterback in the leauge, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Currently Andrew Luck is the highest paid quarterback, getting paid at $24.594 million yearly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a lot of money. What % of the team's cap is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 2017 cap is $167 million rite now, so roughly 15%. Next step in Mack I'm sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mack will probably command around $22 million a year I think. Gonna be more than people expect. So two players would command 28% the Raider's cap, but without these two combined, the Raiders probably win 3 games instead of 12 last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah this is all pretty crazy to say about 2 players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Indeed but Carr is the focal point of the Raiders offense and Mack had so many strip fumble sacks to close the game out last year I lost count."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ RIP Raiders' SB chances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't say that. The Raiders are a very young team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As far as being competitive....gonna be tough. Once you commit that much money to 1, or especially two guys, your roster suffers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as they win a Super Bowl in the next four years, the contracts will have no negative effect until then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess everybody is just going to have to wait and see how all this plays out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, can't doing anything about it but in a few years the Raiders will be in Vegas and this could be huge for the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It could be but imagine if Carr or Mack gets hurt, that's all basically dead money at that point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but I think the Raiders have done a great job at protecting Carr when the ball is in his hands."
