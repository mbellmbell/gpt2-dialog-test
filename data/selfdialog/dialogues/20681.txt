"__THRILLER__ I love conspiracy thrillers. They're my favorite kind of movie."
"__THRILLER__ Did you see Operation Avalanche? It has guys from the CIA faking the moon landing in 1967."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I streamed it. Wonderful special effects, though the acting wasn't always top notch."
"__THRILLER__ It was good enoough for me. Did you see the Manchurian Candidate?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, a true popcorn movie. The Manchurian Corporation brainwashes an entire platoon in Iraq to get their guy elected vice president."
"__THRILLER__ They fail, of course."
"__THRILLER__ Right. If they'd succeeded, nobody would dare to make a movie about it."
"__THRILLER__ Or maybe they suceeded, and made the move to make us think they failed!"
"__THRILLER__ Only you would think that. What about the original version?"
"__THRILLER__ The Manchurian Frank Sinatra? I actually liked that one better."
