"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen The Conjuring?"
"__THRILLER__ It doesn't sound familiar. What's it about?"
"__THRILLER__ Well it's a paranormal thriller that takes place at some family's farmhouse and the characters are based on real people, The Warrens."
"__THRILLER__ Ed and Lorraine Warren?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah!"
"__THRILLER__ Oh I've heard of them, and seen some other thriller type stuff based on their work."
"__THRILLER__ So it sound like something you'd be interested in?"
"__THRILLER__ Definitely, I've liked the other stuff I've seen and thriller is one of my favourite genres."
"__THRILLER__ Well then you should like this. I like how it's not your typical thriller in that it takes you almost out of the story and references filming."
"__THRILLER__ Almost like breaking the fourth wall."
