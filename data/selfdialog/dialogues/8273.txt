"__POP__ Remember Natalie Imbruglia's Torn?"
"__POP__ I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel.."
"__POP__ Looks like you do."
"__POP__ Do you know she's not the original singer of it?"
"__POP__ Really?"
"__POP__ Yeah, it's a cover of a song that came out a half decade earlier."
"__POP__ Wow, I had no idea."
"__POP__ Yeah, that version is more rock-forward"
"__POP__ Which is better?"
"__POP__ Natalie's for sure. But then again, Australian pop wasn't a thing until the mid-90's."
