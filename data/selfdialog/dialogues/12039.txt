"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it too early to write off the Panthers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? Dude, you're crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. You think Cam's still got it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dang, man. He's what, 28? Of course he's still got it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright. Just seems like he's too sensitive, you know? Like he's got just a tiny bit of Vince Young in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's crazy, man. Just silly. I mean, how about we start with a decent O-line for him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, ok. I'm willing to go with that. So he's got some big boys blocking up front. He's still going to run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh. Yeah. And that's what's so great. I mean, he's no joke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what about injuries?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Injuries happen. Cam needs an O-line. Then get back to me with your complaints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the division overall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What, the NFC South? Yeah, well, you know, you've got a lot of talent. Maybe too much talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The A going to get back to the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard. That's just hard to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. What do you think though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Atlanta has the best shot to win the division. Tampa will be right in the thick of it. I mean, look, you've got Cam, Ryan, Brees, and Winston? That's absurd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too much of a good thing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good competition. Just only one can get out. Saints aren't going to do it. Really, though, any one of the other three very well could."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you want?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Want? The Falcons. For sure."
