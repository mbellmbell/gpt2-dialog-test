"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I cannot wait for preseaon football to start!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be here in less than a month."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, who do you like this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know me, I am a Patriot's fan all the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok besides them then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Titans have a lot of new talent, should be interesting to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too, I have been by some of the open practices, and it looks like they have a lot of great chemistery."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How important is that really to the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is very important, as important as skills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What part of the team intrigues you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For the Titans, it would be their offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why the offense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last season, their defense was virtually impregnatable, but the offense could never seem to connect."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, their quarterback always seems to lose his arm mid third quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, and with the new running back, I think his energy is going to inspire the whole team to work harder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Titans have not historically had a strong ground game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, Fisher was all about the air game, like he had a few picks that were the entire show."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is no way to run a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their chances are good this year of at least a playoff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do too."
