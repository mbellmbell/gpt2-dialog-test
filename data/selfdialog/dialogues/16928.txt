"__MOVIES__ It is by far the greatest anime film of all time. How can you not have seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, excuse me, I'm not that into Japanese anime. I don't care if you think kitana or whatever is the best"
"__MOVIES__ Akira, not kitana. Katana is a japanese sword. There is no such thing as kitana. And Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ They speak Japanese. I don't speak Japanese. I hate French films too."
"__MOVIES__ That why they have subtitles!!!"
"__MOVIES__ If I want to read at the movies, I'll bring a book."
"__MOVIES__ So for you, only the English language movies are acceptable?"
"__MOVIES__ No, of course not, They can dub the foreign films. I don't care."
"__MOVIES__ But that removes all the nuances of the speech from the actors. That kills the film."
"__MOVIES__ I think you take films way too seriously. Take a chill pill."
"__MOVIES__ What?!?!? The acting is all about the movements, the facial expression, body language, hand gesture and yes voice! Without that, the acting isn't acting at all!"
"__MOVIES__ And voice dubs ARE done by actors, not by the original actors, but those who can SPEAK English!"
"__MOVIES__ Gahhhh. I have no idea why I even talk to you."
"__MOVIES__ You started it. I'm just stating my well informed and very tolerant opinion."
"__MOVIES__ No, if you reject foreign films based on language, that's not being tolerant."
"__MOVIES__ Bah, nonsense. Of course it is. I said I would watch it if it's dubbed."
"__MOVIES__ See that spork? I am going to take that spork and stab you with it."
"__MOVIES__ That's so mature. You're just angry because you lost an argument"
"__MOVIES__ i did NOT lose an argument let alone THIS argument!"
"__MOVIES__ Blah, blah. blah."
