"__FASHION__ What are students wearing now when it comes to interviews?"
"__FASHION__ Well, a lot of students go for the typical business suit but are being told they need something to make themselves stand out."
"__FASHION__ Ah! How are they making themselves stand out?"
"__FASHION__ How are they making themselves stand out and still look professional?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, of course!"
"__FASHION__ They do things like wear a gray suit and match their button up shirt and shoes perfectly. The shoe color is a conversation starter but it doesn't make them stand out in a bad way."
"__FASHION__ What is something that guys can do specfically?"
"__FASHION__ Guys tend to match their socks to their tie or bow tie. There's a company called Happy Socks that has a variety of socks."
"__FASHION__ So are socks a conversation starter?"
"__FASHION__ Most definitely! Designed socks are a huge trend. I've seen them at all types of formal events."
"__FASHION__ What formal events have you seen them at?"
"__FASHION__ Well a big one is weddings. The groom and groomsmen all wear different socks. Sometimes within the wedding color scheme and sometimes something as fun as superheros."
"__FASHION__ Where else?"
"__FASHION__ Prom. Company formal events. I'm even willing to bet if we checked all the guy's socks on the red carpet we'd find something fun."
"__FASHION__ That's interesting. So back to interview attire. For the student who doesn't want to wear a suit or can't afford one, how do they stay 'in?'"
"__FASHION__ For guys I think a suit is a non-negotiable. It doesn't necessarily have to be a matching suit set though. You can probably get away with something like gray pants, a white shirt, red tie and blue jacket."
"__FASHION__ If they can't afford a suit how would they get that combination?"
"__FASHION__ Thrifting or borrowing pieces from friends. Thrifting is a HUGE 'it' thing right now!"
"__FASHION__ Thrifting? could you tell me more about that?"
"__FASHION__ Well fashion comes in cycles so when something retro is back in what better place to find it than a thrift store? That way you truly have the original style."
