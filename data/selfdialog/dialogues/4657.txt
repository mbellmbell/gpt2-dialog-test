"__MUSIC__ Remember that song by Toto, 'Africa'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, kind of dull by my tastes."
"__MUSIC__ I always thought they were singing, 'I took the blame down in Africa.'"
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that right? It sounds right."
"__MUSIC__ No, it's actually 'I bless the rains down in Africa.'"
"__MUSIC__ I wish these singers would learn how to pronounce words."
"__MUSIC__ Or stop screaming 'Baby' too much, like Led Zeppelin."
"__MUSIC__ And I always thought David Bowie was singing, 'That mellow fat chick put my spine out of place.' Not very nice language."
"__MUSIC__ But isn't that exactly what he's singing? In 'Suffragette City', I think it was."
"__MUSIC__ No, it's actually 'This mellow-thighed chick...', etcetera."
"__MUSIC__ What? My mistaken lyrics make more sense. I still can't understand half of 'Stairway To Heaven' either."
"__MUSIC__ Or 'Long Cool Woman' by the Hollies. I still can't get that right after almost fifty years."
"__MUSIC__ 'Just a five nine beautiful tall.'  I looked it up one day. 'Well I heard somebody shooting a gun'."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you. I thought it was, 'When I heard something I shouldn't have known.'"
"__MUSIC__ There's some company on the internet that prints wrong lyrics on beer bottle holders."
"__MUSIC__ Aw, now why didn't I think of that? Or T-Shirts?"
"__MUSIC__ 'There's A Bathroom On The Right'. That's a good one."
"__MUSIC__ What? What's that from?"
"__MUSIC__ Creedence Clearwater Revival's, 'Bad Moon On The Rise'."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I remember my little brother almost fifty years ago thinking that's what they were singing!"
