"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I really miss 90s rap. The music today just doesn't reach me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know what you mean. That was my favorite era of music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who do you think was the best rapper of that era?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Actually, I liked the groups, like Outkast and the Wu-Tang Clan."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hmm, those are two very different groups! Do you like any solo artists?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think the rappers out of New York are the best. I really like Nas."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ His music has such distinctive beats. Grimy, but somehow clear."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ 'If I Ruled the World' is a really touching song."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you like Jay-Z?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, but not as much as Nas and the Wu-Tang Clan."
