"__ROCK__ What is the best part of rock music to you?"
"__ROCK__ I would have to say the guitarists. They do stuff that no other genre can hope to match."
"__ROCK__ What do you mean?"
"__ROCK__ People can usually tell what a particular song is by the guitar riff alone. No other genre can do that."
"__ROCK__ That's true. U2's 'New Year's Day' is a good example of that."
"__ROCK__ I love that song, but I'm not so sure about their new work."
"__ROCK__ You're right. It's not as iconic as their earlier stuff."
"__ROCK__ It depends. I like 'Beautiful Day,' but not 'Vertigo.'"
"__ROCK__ I feel the same way."
"__ROCK__ Want to play a game of 'Name That Song?'"
