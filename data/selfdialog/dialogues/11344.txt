"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How long do you think Tom Brady will keep playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't he like 40 now? Probably only another year or two"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some people think he'll play for way longer than that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wasn't Peyton Manning only about a year or two older than Brady when he retired?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and he wasn't playing all that well in his last season, despite winning the Super Bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd really like to see someone else in the Super Bowl than the same three AFC teams the past fifteen years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do I, aside from the Patriots, Steelers, and whoever Peyton Manning was playing for"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Peyton Manning was a better quarterback than Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady had the better numbers, but I think Peyton Manning was smarter overall"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what even makes someone the best to play the quarterback position?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but I doubt everyone will ever come to an agreement one way or the other"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think people don't like Tom Brady? Aside from all the Patriots fans, that is"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably a mix of his ungodly talent versus low expectations, and all the cheating accusations over the years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he really cheated after all"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may not have, but he destroyed his cell phone when he was under suspicion and likely to be called in for an investigation"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who destroys a cell phone anyway? Maybe it isn't against NFL rules, but it seems fishy to me"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, once Brady retires, we might actually get some parity in the AFC"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And before then, we can always count on Eli Manning coming out of nowhere to lead the Giants to a victory over the Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As a non-Patriots fan, I'll forever be grateful to Eli for ruining their perfect season run"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's pretty cold, but at least Eli will have a legacy when all is said and done"
