"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite Darth Vader moment?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would say at the end of Rogue One when he decimated all those rebels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that was an end to the rebel scum haha."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also basically the whole movie of Empire Strikes back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed, the way he fought Luke, and choked out all the admirals that failed him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also liked when he first became Vader, and killed all the Padiwans at the temple."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it was harsh but marked a moment where truly Anikan Skywalker was dead and Darth Vader had begun."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was also impressive the way he was able to read Luke's mind in Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, dark side to perfection."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess we both know the true power of the dark side."
