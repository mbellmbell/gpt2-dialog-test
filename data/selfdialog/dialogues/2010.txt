"__MUSIC__ So, are you a fan of King Crimson?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I love them, though I think their discography is pretty weird and inconsistent."
"__MUSIC__ Really? How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they had a lot of different lineups in the early years and basically reformed completely in the early 1980s."
"__MUSIC__ And they're still around today, too, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, though I really haven't listened to anything past the early 1980s albums, which I like, but are a little sterile for me."
"__MUSIC__ So tell me about some of their best records."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's 'In the Court of the Crimson King,' which is the debut, full of weird, fantasy-based songwriting, very medieval."
"__MUSIC__ And that has '20th Century Schizoid Man' on it, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, probably the best known King Crimson song, a real epic that shows you where they could go later on."
"__MUSIC__ So, what was next for them? Is there a record where they really evolved further?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, that initial lineup fell apart, and I don't really understand why, but I imagine they all had very different ideas about where the music would go from there."
"__MUSIC__ I think I heard a record of theirs called 'Islands' from that era, and didn't care much for it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there's weird experimental orchestral stuff Robert Fripp, their lead guitarist, tried to do that did not gel at all for me."
"__MUSIC__ So how did they get back on track?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they made 'Lark's Tongues in Aspic,' which is a great, intelligent hard rock album with complex musicianship."
"__MUSIC__ They used a lot of strange time signatures on that one, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and John Wetton and Bill Bruford are an amazing rhythm section, one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Did that lineup last long?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, for a while, and they recorded 'Red,' which is an amazing album, very much ahead of its time! Ot"
