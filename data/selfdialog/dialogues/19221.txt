"__MOVIES__ Hey I heard the new Beauty and the Beast is coming out on DVD soon. Did you want to see it?"
"__MOVIES__ So much, I'm really excited. I love the original so much!"
"__MOVIES__ So do I. It was the perfect film to grow up with."
"__MOVIES__ I might still play the songs and sing along all the time in my car."
"__MOVIES__ No I think we all do that. I definitely do it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw a joke video about it the other day. It was Belle's song she sings in the morning."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's just called 'Belle.'"
"__MOVIES__ Right so it goes, 'There goes the baker with his tray, like always.' And the baker says, 'There goes Belle with her daily mean song.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, that's hilarious. I never thought about it like that."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither. The new live-action film is a musical right?"
"__MOVIES__ It is. I've heard they did incredible."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to hear it. I love Emma Watson so much."
"__MOVIES__ So do I, ever since Harry Potter."
"__MOVIES__ Oh she was totally the sweetest Hermione. What a dork."
"__MOVIES__ But also isn't that the exactly kind of booky nerd that would turn into Belle as an adult?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I think you're right. Who plays the Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Dan Stevens."
"__MOVIES__ Who is that?"
"__MOVIES__ You know Matthew on Downton Abbey. The one who marries the oldest daughter?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh right! He's great!"
