"__STAR_WARS__ I understand that you're not a fan of the Star Wars prequel trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is correct. I hate those films with the fiery passion of a thousand burning suns."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why, exactly? I mean, George Lucas probably thought he was creating another trilogy of masterpieces."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, why do I hate the prequel trilogy, let me count the ways. We can start with Jar Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose you're right there. I don't know anyone who liked Jar Jar, other than the actor who voiced him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm happy the dude got some work, but Jar Jar is such an embarrassment. The unmistakable resemblance to a stereotyped shuffling black servant is just deplorable."
"__STAR_WARS__ You don't think Lucas did that on purpose, do you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course not, but that summarizes what is wrong with the prequel trilogy. From the Imperial Chinese sounding bad aliens to the horribly childish and petulant characterization of Anakin, it's all about what Lucas didn't realize."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess this is why you should surround yourself with good people rather than yes-men."
"__STAR_WARS__ George needed someone to hit him over the head in the story concept stage and straighten him out. Everyone would have benefited."
