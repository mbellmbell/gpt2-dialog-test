"__SUPERHERO__ Want to go see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I can't tonight.  Did you already see it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Opening night!  It was a bit long though."
"__SUPERHERO__ I heard it was CGI overload."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, there were parts that were pretty distracting."
"__SUPERHERO__ Such as?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, not to give it away, but the ending battle took forever and was just way too much special effects."
"__SUPERHERO__ Seems to be the norm these days."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, you should still see it with me.  Does this weekend work?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yep, I'll check my schedule."
