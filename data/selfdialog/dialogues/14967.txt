"__ACTION__ Hey, have you ever seen Never Back Down?"
"__ACTION__ Yea, I thought it was really good!"
"__ACTION__ Really? I thought it was kind of cheesy."
"__ACTION__ Well, yea, but movies like that are supposed to be."
"__ACTION__ That's true, like how this football player who's never had a fight in his life is suddenly going up against top fighters."
"__ACTION__ Yea, that was pretty stupid."
"__ACTION__ Or how about how that guy's girlfriend just dumps him and gets with the new guy so fast?"
"__ACTION__ Yea, the script wasn't well thought out."
"__ACTION__ The fight scenes were great though."
"__ACTION__ Oh yea, the fight scenes were fantastic."
