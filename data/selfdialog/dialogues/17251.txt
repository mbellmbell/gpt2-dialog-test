"__MOVIES__ Do you like any animated movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I do like them, which one is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like Tangled, that was a really well done movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, was it? I haven't seen it before."
"__MOVIES__ It was really popular when it came out, but it doesn't seem like it anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I haven't heard much about it in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ It's still a good movie, it has a lot of stuff about overcoming abusive parents."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, does it really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a pretty heavy theme in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's very cool, especially for a Disney movie."
"__MOVIES__ My girlfriend likes it a lot because her mother is just like that."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, sorry to hear. I'm glad that the movie reaches a good audience though."
"__MOVIES__ It sends a very positive message about being your own person and not your parent's pet."
"__MOVIES__ That's good, what else is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ There's some quirky romance, which is alright."
"__MOVIES__ How is it quirky?"
"__MOVIES__ The girl is fairly silly and clumsy, but in a likable way. The guy is the same way too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. I bet kids like that a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah my younger sister thinks the whole movie is very funny."
"__MOVIES__ Nice to hear that older and younger people like it."
