"__MUSIC__ Do you like Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a really difficult question to answer?"
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ I think her songs are catchy, and she's a really talented songwriter. However, I don't think she can sing that well."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I think millions of people would say differently!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure they would, but I've always thought she sounded awful live."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I've never really heard that."
"__MUSIC__ Now that she's gone to pop especially, it's much more autotuned."
"__MUSIC__ When did she make the crossover from country to pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she was always more of a pop country artist, but I think her album Red really started getting away from country."
"__MUSIC__ I see. Did she ever officially say she was no longer a country artist."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but I know she identified her latest album, 1989, as a true pop album."
"__MUSIC__ It's too bad that she went away from her country roots."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but I guess her subject matter lends itself better to pop anyway."
"__MUSIC__ And she has more commercial appeal as a pop star."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. But I will always love her first two albums especially."
"__MUSIC__ What were they?"
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift and Fearless. They had so many great songs."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't her first single called Tim McGraw?"
"__MUSIC__ I belive it was. Kind of funny, isn't it?"
