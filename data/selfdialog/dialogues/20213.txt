"__MOVIES__ Do you like Jake Gyllenhaal?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he's a good actor, and he seems like a nice guy."
"__MOVIES__ I saw a trailer for his new movie coming out this fall called 'Stronger.'"
"__MOVIES__ What's the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the story of one of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing who lost his legs."
"__MOVIES__ I bet Jake will be good at portraying the character. He's really sensitive looking."
"__MOVIES__ He apparently has become really good friends with the guy he's portraying."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure learning the guy's story was very touching,"
"__MOVIES__ The guy said Jake bought him a present for a housewarming gift."
"__MOVIES__ That's nice! What did he buy him?"
"__MOVIES__ He bought him a toilet. Jake said his friend had one, and it was the best toilet he saw. The guy said it's 'the best toilet in the world.'"
"__MOVIES__ Wow. That's funny. But you know, it sounds like it must have been something he really needed for his new home, so it's a really thoughtful gift."
"__MOVIES__ They did an interview with a reporter on the set where they were filming, and the news article said you could tell they had become good friends."
"__MOVIES__ It's nice to hear something good happening for someone like that who suffered from such a tragedy."
"__MOVIES__ I know, he probably earned some extra money he could use for sharing his story with them for the movie, and he gets to tell friends he has a famous friend."
"__MOVIES__ Whenever people come over his house and ask to use the bathroom, he can tell them this is the toilet my friend Jake Gyllenhaal bought me!"
"__MOVIES__ I hope the movie does well at the box office, so this guy feels like people care about his story."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know, it would be sad if it didn't do well."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to make sure I go see it at the theatre, and post about it on my Facebook and Twitter."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good idea, letting people know if they go see the film, they can send an indirect message of support by seeing it."
