"__BASEBALL__ Aaron Judge sure turned things around this year, didn't he?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he's the biggest thing in baseball this year."
"__BASEBALL__ He performed so poorly last season, I thought for sure he'd be sent back down to the minors."
"__BASEBALL__ I didn't think so. He was just young and nervous, coming in almost at the end of the season."
"__BASEBALL__ True. Remember when he finally almost got a run in, and he tripped at the last second?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that was awful for him. He hurt his ankle too if I remember correctly."
"__BASEBALL__ My heart broke for him.But you're right, he came back with a vengeance this year!"
"__BASEBALL__ Well he probably had A-Rod mentoring him. He's bound to improve"
"__BASEBALL__ He's a really big guy too."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah 6'7'. A guy like that is bound to be a powerful hitter. He could be team captain."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, the Yankees don't have team captains anymore."
"__BASEBALL__ They dpm"
