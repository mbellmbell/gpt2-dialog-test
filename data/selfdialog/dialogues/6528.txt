"__STAR_WARS__ OK, I just don't get this.  If Yoda is in tune with the Force and can see the future, why does he not see that Anakin Skywalker is working for the Smith Lord?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He says in Phantom Menace that his future is clouded."
"__STAR_WARS__ That still doesn't add up.  I'll grant you that he can't see Anakin's future, but he also can't see the future of the hundreds of other people that Anakin kills?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The dark side hides things from him."
"__STAR_WARS__ That still doesn't make sense. The guy kills all the Jedi trainees, Chancellor Palpatine has clone warriors kill hundreds of Jedis and Yoda has no idea it's coming?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I told you, the dark side clouds his vision.  He can no longer get a clear vision of what is going to happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ I still think it's really irresponsible of him.  He should have warned all those people, they all died because he didn't see these things coming."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was he supposed to do?  Say 'Hey I have a bad feeling about all this? Be extra careful?'  That's too vague, it wouldn't have done any good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Look, I'm just saying it's very convenient that a guy who can see the future can't see anything about these cataclysmic events that end up changing and entire galaxy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess you're right, that is a huge hole in the plot that takes up an entire movie franchise."
