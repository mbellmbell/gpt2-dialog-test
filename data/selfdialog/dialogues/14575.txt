"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Let's talk about music and movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'd rather talk about music in movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok. What do you got?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Have you noticed that movie soundtracks rarely have anything to do with the movie, or that the song playing never has anything to do with the scene?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Everyone has. But, since you brought it up, how about an example?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy uses that 'Fox on the Run' song by Sweet."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yep, I really have fond thoughts about that song. It really brings me back to when I was 7. Let's sing it...."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Let's not. So the song is playing in the scene when the Dumpster Panda is trying to get Baby Groot not to push the wrong button."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, it just doesn't make any sense. First of all, Dumpster Panda is some sort of demented raccoon and not a fox. And it's not running from anything noway."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The tree thing was running."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, maybe the song should be dubbed to 'Baby Groot Be Runnin.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You're an idiot. The song has nothing to do with a fox. It's kind of about a girl who is past her prime, not that I'd ever say any woman was passed her prime because women only get better as they age, or so I think."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, of course. I agree completely. Sweet existed during a time when it was proper to make sexist and lewd comments at the expense of women. I'm glad those times are over, even if it meant the death of rock & roll."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So we are agreed? Women are ok in our book. I mean, after all, our mothers are women. And frankly, so are our sisters. I don't want to insult them. And most of the women on the planet are women as well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Absolutely."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So what was the point of all this?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I kind of lost track, but I think it was that the movie soundtracks are arbitrary and the songs are only used to generate additional sales. And probably most of them are already in the public domain so they don't cost the producers nothin' to use."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Right. So someone picked up the rights to the Sweet song for cheap."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Exactly. And women are cool."
