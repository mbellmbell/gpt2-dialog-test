"__STAR_WARS__ Which of the Star Wars droids is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Doesn't everyone love R2-D2?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, although I think C-3PO is my favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I always found him a little too prim and proper."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the accent can be annoying sometime."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not just that, but the whole idea of a protocol droid."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.    Why would a child like Annakin build such a thing?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it was a kit that he was working from."
"__STAR_WARS__ Perhaps.     Maybe best to not take that part of the series too literally."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it is just a space fantasy!"
