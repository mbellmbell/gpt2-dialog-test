"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is 'Ex Machina.'"
"__MOVIES__ I think I've heard of it, but never saw it."
"__MOVIES__ It's phenomenal.  It's about a guy who falls in love with a robot while performing a Turing Test."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, that doesn't seem that interesting to me."
"__MOVIES__ My explanation may not be the best, but you'd have to see it to understand the elements that make it good."
"__MOVIES__ What elements in particular did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well for one, the fact that it's a very self-contained story."
"__MOVIES__ Meaning?"
"__MOVIES__ Everything happens in a small, tight setting.  And it's done with only 3 actors."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, really?  Doesn't it get boring?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all.  The dialogue, core themes, and rising tension all make it an excellent movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who are the actors?"
"__MOVIES__ Domnhall Gleason, Alicia Vikander, and Oscar Isaac."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's an all-star cast.  They're in everything these days."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  And they should be, because they're so incredibly talented."
"__MOVIES__ Now I'm a bit more interested in watching this."
"__MOVIES__ You really should.  It'll really make you think a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'm going to check it out.  Thank you for your suggestion."
"__MOVIES__ Sure thing.  We'll have to talk about it once you've watched it."
