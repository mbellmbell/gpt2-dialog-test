"__HORROR__ Were you ever into the Paranormal Activities movies?"
"__HORROR__ I've watched a lot of them, but I don't know if I was a fan."
"__HORROR__ Didn't they scare you?"
"__HORROR__ Not really.  I mean, they had a scare factor, but the believability wasn't there."
"__HORROR__ Oh, they freaked me out!  I couldn't sleep."
"__HORROR__ I didn't have a problem sleeping.  They were just another movie."
"__HORROR__ You were never scared that your house might be haunted?"
"__HORROR__ No.  I mean, it was just a movie."
"__HORROR__ But there are things that you can't see!"
"__HORROR__ The believability just wasn't there for me."
