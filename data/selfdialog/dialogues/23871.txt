"__SUPERHERO__ What do you like about superhero movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well I grew up reading comic books about superheros so of course I would love the movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too!  How about you...ya got a preference between DC and Marvel movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Marvel movies all the way!  I mean DC is cool with Superman and Batman but that's about their biggest.  Marvel has way more cool characters."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree!  The Marvel Universe is already amazing and it still expanding!  DC is definitely behind on that front.  They waited too long to get started into making movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree!  I do like their tv shows though such as the Flash and Arrow.  Those are really cool!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too!  Nothing beats Smallville though!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes! That was the show back in the day!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Definitely!  Right now, I can't wait to see Spider-man Homecoming!  That is going to be so good!"
"__SUPERHERO__ I gree!  Then I'll have to wait to see the new Hulk movie too!  It looks so diffrent from the others.  I can't wait!"
