"__MUSIC__ Hi, what are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I am listening to P!nk old songs. Haha, I love her so much!"
"__MUSIC__ Which particular song are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I am listening to 'Who Knew'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that is one of her favorite songs. Why do you like her so much?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I love her music because of two things. The first thing is the genre itself; I like her pop-rock-punk style."
"__MUSIC__ That is good. That's the reason why I love her songs too."
"__MUSIC__ The second is because some of her songs are not the usual 'love' songs. She touches so many other subjects"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, like child abuse and death of friends."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I think that is what 'Who Knew' is all about; the death of her friend?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you are correct. Do you know the whole story?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, not really. Tell me."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it was a friend of her who introduced her to drugs when she was underage."
"__MUSIC__ Wow really? That's heavy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and unfortunately he passed away due to overdose."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that is sad. I did not know that."
"__MUSIC__ And it seems that from her lyrics, she really loves this friend of hers."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I remember the last part of the lyrics about how she miss him/her and she will cherishes him/her."
"__MUSIC__ And don't forget the reff."
"__MUSIC__ That is right. Oh wow, from now on I will listen that song differently."
