"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Guided By Voices?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't."
"__MUSIC__ The frontman and master is Robert Pollard. He's one of the most prolific artists in the history of rock."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, kind of like The Who? There's so much variety. He's released 100 LPs under lots of different guises."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a ton. Where are they from?"
"__MUSIC__ Pollard is from Dayton, Ohio. Not really a rock hotbed!"
"__MUSIC__ No, it isn't. What do you like about them?"
"__MUSIC__ It's hard for me to put it into words, the chords he uses just resonate with me. It's like someone made music just for my consumption."
"__MUSIC__ How long has Pollard been active?"
"__MUSIC__ He was a schoolteacher in the 1980s, running the band in his spare time."
"__MUSIC__ When did they become famous?"
"__MUSIC__ Pollard was in his late 30s when they first got noticed in the early 90s. He's nearly sixty now."
"__MUSIC__ That's old!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is, but he's still doing high leg-kicks and slamming Miller Lites like he's 21 at their shows."
"__MUSIC__ Miller Lite? Not exactly a highbrow beer."
"__MUSIC__ No, and GBV isn't a highbrow band, but they're incredible."
"__MUSIC__ When is their next release due out?"
"__MUSIC__ Their next album is called How Do You Spell Heaven? and it's out in August."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I'll have to check it out!"
