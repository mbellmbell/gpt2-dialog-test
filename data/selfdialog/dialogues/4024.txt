"__MUSIC__ Do you like music from musicals?"

"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite musical album?"
"__MUSIC__ No way. That would be so difficult."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, any you really like then?"
"__MUSIC__ I love the music from Wicked, but then you have the classics like the music from Phantom of the Opera that is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ What about the music from Disney movies?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that's great too. And I love that Disney is making more musicals again."
"__MUSIC__ I think they saw how big of a hit Let it Go turned out to be and realized that market was ready to grow."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Now you have the song How Far I'll Go from Moana."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what will come next."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know but I think having music in movies, if it is done rights, can really enhance it."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. Have you heard the music from Hamilton?"
"__MUSIC__ Only once. I wasn't a big fan."
"__MUSIC__ I think you are the only one in the country!"
"__MUSIC__ Probably. But I'm not a huge fan of rap so adding rap to a musical really does nothing for me."
"__MUSIC__ I think people like it because it is unique."
"__MUSIC__ That's probably true."
