"__MUSIC__ Did you like Nirvana?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Pretty good? They were amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't go that far."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean, they had multiple hits."
"__MUSIC__ Well after Nevermind and Smells Like Teen Spirit they kind of fell off."
"__MUSIC__ Because Kurt Cobain died"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess that's right, but I don't think they had staying power."
"__MUSIC__ Man I can't believe you."
"__MUSIC__ Actually the best thing to come out of Nirvana was Dave Grohl"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, he was their drummer"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think they had multiple drummers before Dave"
"__MUSIC__ Right, but Grohl stayed on the longest."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and then went on to form Foo Fighters"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a pretty good follow-up act."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, agree"
"__MUSIC__ Well at least you can agree that Nirvana created grunge rock."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they helped start that."
"__MUSIC__ And move away from hair bands"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, give them credit for that one."
