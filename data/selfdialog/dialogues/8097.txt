"__POP__ So, here's something kind of a weird... music I like but hate the music video."
"__POP__ Huh... can't think of any songs like that off-hand, but one might pop in my mind while talking."
"__POP__ Well, I got one to start with Pink's 'Try'."
"__POP__ I don't think I've seen the video for that."
"__POP__ Well, like I said, I really, really like that song, to me it projects an image of preserving despite adversity and all, but the video has Pink and some random guy beat the crap out of each other while performing dance moves."
"__POP__ Say what?"
"__POP__ Yeah, they're in a room together with all this paint and stuff and they get slapping and hitting each other.  I mean, I get it, it's all symbolic and relationships and stuff and how we can hurt each other real easily, but still."
"__POP__ Yeah... you're thinking, 'They could have found a better way to convey that?'"
"__POP__ Exactly! I mean, I don't know.. just was not what I was expecting."
"__POP__ Well, that's the interesting thing about songs, there's all kinds of different ways to interrupt them."
