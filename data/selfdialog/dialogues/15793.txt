"__ROCK__ I've been listening to Led Zeppelin all week, such great stuff!"
"__ROCK__ Yep, absolutely and it seems to never get old!  What songs have you been rocking out to?"
"__ROCK__ Trampled Under Foot and In My Time Of Dying, both off the Physical Graffiti album."
"__ROCK__ I love that album!  Down By The Seaside reminds me of spending time with my family in Scotland."
"__ROCK__ Jimmy Page's guitar work is incredible.  He can be hard and rock out yet softly strum in the same song!"
"__ROCK__ That makes me think of his work on The Rain Song."
"__ROCK__ What a beautiful song, have you ever seen the video that goes with it?"
"__ROCK__ Yes, Robert Plant is riding a horse and he's like a hero going to rescue the damsel in distress."
"__ROCK__ That is from the Song Remains The Same video, isn't it?"
"__ROCK__ Yes, part of that video is a concert and part of it is an acting/story dramatic thing, must be one of the first music videos ever!"
