"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, are you much of a Star Wars fan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love Star Wars, it makes me think of growing up and watching them with my dad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, takes me back too. Who is your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hans Solo, duh. He was a total stud."
"__STAR_WARS__ Mine is R2D2. If I could have a droid, I would want it to be just like him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, C3PO is cool, but he doesn't do well under pressure. R2D2 seems more loyal and collected."
"__STAR_WARS__ That seems funny, to rate droids. Well, if we are picking droids then I think I would take BB8. Just his design itself is amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, BB8! I so want to buy that remote control toy of BB8 for my son. I think he would love it."
"__STAR_WARS__ You can buy it for me, my birthday is coming up. Did my jedi mind trick work on you?"
