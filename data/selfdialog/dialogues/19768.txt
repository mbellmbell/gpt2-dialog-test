"__MOVIES__ Manoa."

"__MOVIES__ No, he's a demi-god."
"__MOVIES__ Whats a demi-god?"
"__MOVIES__ He's like part man and part god. It's great because he steals this jewel and like nature gets mad and..."
"__MOVIES__ Your confusing me. You said it was about a girl?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's hard to explain. It's animated so you dont really see the Rock but you hear his voice."
"__MOVIES__ No Rock and it's a cartoon or something?"
"__MOVIES__ It's computer animated, like Toy Story only better. Just watch it and you'll like it."
"__MOVIES__ Why would I like a girl's movie thats a cartoon with no  Rock in it or any cool violence?"

"__MOVIES__ You want to see the Rock right?"
"__MOVIES__ You said he wasn't in it, sheesh!"
