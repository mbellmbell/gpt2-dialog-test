"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I just saw 'Inside Out' for the first time this weekend!"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I was completely blown away. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ I said the same thing when I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ I wish that I had a movie like that to watch when I was growing up."
"__MOVIES__ Haha. Yeah, I said that too."
"__MOVIES__ I think Pixar really hit the nail on the head with it."
"__MOVIES__ They really did, they worked with psychologists to make everything as accurate as possible."
"__MOVIES__ I read that there are doctors using this movie to help troubled kids."
"__MOVIES__ They are, there all whole programs developed around this movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think it is a movie that every parent should watch with their kid."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, its Pixar, so they still get the laughs in, but the overall message is a good one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like, sometimes growing up is sad, and it is ok to feel that way."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ Can you imagine how different things would be if everyone accepted that?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure it would help a lot of kids out."
"__MOVIES__ I also read that they way Riley's mind works scientifically accurate."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's pretty neat."
"__MOVIES__ I know."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see what Pixar comes out with next!"
