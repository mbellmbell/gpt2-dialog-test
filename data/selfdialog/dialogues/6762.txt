"__STAR_WARS__ You know what else needs more information?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Let me guess, you're gonna tell me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. Count Dooku."
"__STAR_WARS__ Count Dooku falls to the dark side after QuiGon Jin dies."
"__STAR_WARS__ And that shouldn't make sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not? maybe he was made more sensitive to Sith's tactics by his sadness"
"__STAR_WARS__ So the story, then, is what? This Jedi knight is so saddened by the death of his former apprentice, he become a sith?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Seems likely..."
"__STAR_WARS__ No it's not likely."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, maybe Darth Sidious used some dark force magic to turn him. Anyway, that's not that exciting. He dies anyway."
