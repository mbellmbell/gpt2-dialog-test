"__MUSIC__ What are your feelings on Pink Floyd?"
"__MUSIC__ I know it's cliche but I love them"
"__MUSIC__ Me too, and not just their hits"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I mean Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here are great, but they were so much more of that"
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Floyd Album?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Obscured by Clouds. It came out in 1972, a year before Dark Side of the Moon"
"__MUSIC__ What's so great about it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just so underappreciated. It gets lost because it came between Dark Side, and Meddle, not that many people now about it"
"__MUSIC__ Right, but what makes it so good?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's where Pink Floyd really found their sound, you know"
"__MUSIC__ The long guitar riffs, and the Psychedelic sounds you mean"
"__MUSIC__ Yes exactly. Up until then they were still trying to find an identity"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can see that"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, their first singer Syd Barrett left the Band, and Roger Waters slowly started to take over"
"__MUSIC__ I see what you're saying. So a new singer and songwriter"
"__MUSIC__ Right. Waters was involved in prior efforts, but Obscured by Clouds is where he really took lead stage"
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting, I never thought about it that way"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's not coincidence that Dark Side was released right afterwards and they really hit their stride"
"__MUSIC__ I see what you're saying"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely check it out. It's the first real Floyd album"
