"__HORROR__ So I heard you are a horror movie buff."
"__HORROR__ Yeah I have watched horror movies since I was a kid."
"__HORROR__ What are some of your favorites?"
"__HORROR__ I like several, but probably Amityville Horror and Stephen King's It."

"__HORROR__ Supposed to be.  THere was an actual house and people kept moving out of it."
"__HORROR__ Are you going to see the remake of IT?"
"__HORROR__ Definitely.  I'm a little nervous though, I hope they don't mess it up."
"__HORROR__ What do you mean?"
"__HORROR__ Well I am a big fan of the original.  TIm Curry is an excellent Pennywise and I don't really know if they are going to make the new one look different or act different."
