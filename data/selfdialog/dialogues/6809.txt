"__STAR_WARS__ You know who I wish was still in the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Who?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Boba Fett! He was always my favorite as a child. I was so bummed out when he got eaten by the Sarlacc Pit in 'Return of the Jedi.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, he was everyone's favorite back then I think. Such a cool character, even though he wasn't exactly a good guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, he wasn't, but I always found the bounty hunter characters pretty fascinating."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they were such gray characters. They weren't Sith but they weren't rebels either. They acted only on what would give them the most benefit, and money of course."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, getting Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt was a huge achievement for Boba Fett."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he got the biggest bounty of his career and then died in the same movie, what a bad stroke of luck!"
"__STAR_WARS__ You can say that again!"
