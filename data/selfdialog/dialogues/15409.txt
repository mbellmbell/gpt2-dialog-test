"__HARRY_POTTER__ Whose your favorite teacher at Hogwart's"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh definitely Professor McGonagal. I love her."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She's mine too! She's so proper and elegant. I love Maggie Smith in all her movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too, she's such a cute older lady. I like Dumbledore too but he's a little more distant."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's true. Other than the teachers I'm fond of Hagrid."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh so am I. He's such a sweet soul."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He really is, and always there for the kids when they need him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He's definitely an ally. Loved him ever since he swept Harry away to Hogwart's."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh that was such a pivotal moment. Changed Harry's life forever."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I was just glad to see him get away from the Dursleys. They were awful people."
