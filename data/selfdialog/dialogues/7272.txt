"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like lady gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I feel like her music is good but she doesnt need the gimmic."
"__LADY_GAGA__ what do you mean?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ her outfits!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ oh like her meat dress and all her weird things?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ yes. she is talented enough."
"__LADY_GAGA__ well, it certainly helps. music is so oversaturated."
"__LADY_GAGA__ well, she is huge now so she doesnt need to do that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ to be honest, she hardly does it now."
"__LADY_GAGA__ oh well, that is good."
