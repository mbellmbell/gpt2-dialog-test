"__MUSIC__ What have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been on a bluegrass kick, so I've really been listening to Greensky BlueGrass almost everyday."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't we see them at the Bluegrass Festival a few months ago?"
"__MUSIC__ We did! I really like their take on bluegrass."
"__MUSIC__ Their musical composition and arrangement is not structured like most bluegrass songs which gives it a unique feel."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I wasn't sure I was even going to like bluegrass, so I'm really glad we met."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people don't really understand what bluegrass music is until they hear it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm definitely one of those people, I always thought bluegrass was just country music."
"__MUSIC__ You stop right there. Blue grass is miles away from country music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, now I can see that, but before I really just didn't know."
"__MUSIC__ That's why I like Greensky, they make it very approachable for non-bluegrass types."
"__MUSIC__ I would love to hear more from them."
"__MUSIC__ You should look them up on YouTube. They have a lot of good videos up there."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have a lot of songs out? More than we heard at the show?"
"__MUSIC__ They do! They also have some great covers of songs that you can't imagine being bluegrass."
"__MUSIC__ What songs do they cover?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite cover that they do is Pink Floyd's 'Time/Breath in the air (reprise).'"
"__MUSIC__ You're right, I certainly can't picture Pink Floyd as blue grass!"
"__MUSIC__ Give it a shot! I bet you'll like it."
"__MUSIC__ I will. Thanks!"
