"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard the latest album from Linkin Park?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. What's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ One More Light. It just came out in May."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I haven't listened to it yet, not sure I want to."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the little bit I've heard about it isn't good."
"__MUSIC__ I really like it. What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ People are complaining that it's too poppy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's more pop than some of their others but they've always kind of walked that line haven't they?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. Some of their songs though have been pretty heavy and there's always at least a little of that in their albums."
"__MUSIC__ You can only hear the same thing so many times before you want something different though, right?"
"__MUSIC__ You might be right, and some of their pop-like stuff from before I've really liked."
"__MUSIC__ You might not like the whole album but some of the songs are excellent."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? What's your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably the title track, One More Light. It's beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Chaz's voice is really excellent and it has some great lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite line?"
"__MUSIC__ The chorus. 'Who cares if one more light goes out in the sky of a million stars.'"
"__MUSIC__ Ooh, I do like that. I'll check them out!"
