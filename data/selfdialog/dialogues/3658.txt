"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of Gwen Stefani's music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, how did you know?"
"__MUSIC__ It was just a guess. It seemed like the kind of music you might like."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've enjoyed her music since her days fronting No Doubt."
"__MUSIC__ No Doubt was a good band."
"__MUSIC__ My friends and I used to dance to 'Just a Girl' and 'Spiderwebs' whenever it would come on the radio or MTV."
"__MUSIC__ Do you prefer her solo work, or her work with No Doubt?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd probably say her No Doubt songs."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ I think some of it is probably just my age when No Doubt was performing vs. when she was making solo music."
"__MUSIC__ What does age have to do with it."
"__MUSIC__ At least for me, music that I liked a lot in my teenage years is special for me."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I can understand that. It's sort of the same way for me too."
"__MUSIC__ It's a time when you're sort of trying to figure out who you are as a person, and how the world works."
"__MUSIC__ Which can be a messy experience."
"__MUSIC__ Right. And music can be the thing that makes you feel better when you're not quite succeeding."
"__MUSIC__ And No Doubt was a band you leaned on in that respect as a teenager?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, definitely. They were a big part of my musical adolescence."
"__MUSIC__ I personally like Gwen Stefani's later stuff a little more than No Doubt, but I understand where you're coming from."
"__MUSIC__ Her newer stuff is quite good too!"
