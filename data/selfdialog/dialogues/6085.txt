"__STAR_WARS__ Chewie was a Wooki, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes he was ."
"__STAR_WARS__ The why are all the wookies on Return of the Jedi so small?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Those were ewoks, unrelated to wookies I think."
"__STAR_WARS__ So in one of the prequel, was Chewie in one of them"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I do believe he was mentioned by name, or at least refered to."
"__STAR_WARS__ So was he on screen and did he have lines, ha,ha!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think we was on screen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did have that sash around his shoulder yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it looked the same as always."
