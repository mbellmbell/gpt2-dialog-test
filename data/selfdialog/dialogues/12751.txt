"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you get season tickets for Titans this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I was thinking about that, though. I have a good feeling about them this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah especially if Mariota comes back healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least he's not old like some other QB's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know some of them are getting up there though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right? Like Brady and Palmer...They are gonna need some new QB's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Arizona has been struggling with getting good QB's it seems like..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they had good ones, Kurt Warner, and Palmer's good, too. Just they seem to get them at the end of their career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't that the truth! Speaking of getting old, I think their Wide receivers are getting old too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean Fitz? Floyd isn't that old yet, is he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's no spring chicken, but got some years left on him. Not sure about Larry' though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was slowing down a bit then made like massive comeback last couple of seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, back to the Titans, we can share season tickets maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a bad idea. I can only make it to about half the games anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good, I'll check on the prices and such. I'd like to see who's playing here next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to see Raiders or Arizona."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not Browns? Ha ha! they were horrible last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, to the point it's embarrassing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't mind watching the titans beat the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It may be a boring game though..."
