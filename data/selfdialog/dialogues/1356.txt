"__MUSIC__ Do you ever just listen to film scores?"
"__MUSIC__ All the time. I love Rachel Portman."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of her. What's she done?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so much. But her score for Never Let Me Go must be my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ What's it sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's very orchestral. I absolutely love the strings she uses."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have any other favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the Midnight in Paris soundtrack, as well as Yann Tiersen, but not much beyond that. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been on a big Jon Brion kick lately. He did the soundtrack for Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind."
"__MUSIC__ Jon Brion? He's worked with Fiona Apple and Rufus Wainwright, two of my favorites!"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I love Fiona but I'm not familiar with Rufus."
"__MUSIC__ Rufus is amazing. His voice is so recognizable so you might have heard him and not realize it."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of his popular songs?"
"__MUSIC__ He covered 'He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother' like ten years ago. 'Going to a Town' is getting a lot of play lately."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check him out sometime. Are there any artists similar to him?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, his sister is a singer. Martha Wainwright."
"__MUSIC__ I never knew that. How similar are they?"
"__MUSIC__ A bit, but they're both unique and have their own styles. I guess Rufus doesn't really sound like anybody else in my mind."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's a great thing to be in music: unapologetically unique."
"__MUSIC__ He's that, and it's great. I can listen to him playing piano and singing all day long."
