"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been let down by a concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No why have you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I feel the last counting crows concert I attended kind of sucked."
"__MUSIC__ why ? In what ways?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I felt the song you truly are waiting to hear like round here were re worked in a way that was barely recognizable."
"__MUSIC__ That does suck. I actually feel artist should be more open to the big hits that made them popular in the first place."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are sometimes so reluctant to play fan favorites but I don't get why."
"__MUSIC__ Well not all bands are like that. Thanks goodness."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I have just had some bad luck."
"__MUSIC__ If it has just been one counting crows concert experience It is not bad at all."
"__MUSIC__ If only that was the only time. I went to a jefferson airplane concert this past summer.  Guess what they choose not to play?"
"__MUSIC__ white rabbit?"
"__MUSIC__ No they did play that one at least.. but Nothing's gonna stop us. It was one of the reason I wanted to go at all."
"__MUSIC__ That sucks since it is one of the bigger hits for them but so different from their usual sound."
"__MUSIC__ I agree it was an 80s hit for them for mannequin the movie. But being one of their biggest hits they should have played it."
"__MUSIC__ Did they play rock that city? That was another big one."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I guess they played two of the three songs I really wanted hear live."
"__MUSIC__ I guess they hated that song, or are embarrassed by their 80s phase like many people."
"__MUSIC__ I get that , it is true they don't like playing that song. But I still find that to be wrong, celebrate what you are loved for."
"__MUSIC__ I do agree with you. I hope that all your future songlist wishes come true."
