"__MUSIC__ Did you have fun at the concert last night?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It was a little weird though."
"__MUSIC__ What was weird about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, we didn't realize that it was a cover band."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of songs did they play?"
"__MUSIC__ Lots of different stuff. There was some David Bowie, and then a Sting song."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound like a lot of fun."
"__MUSIC__ It was a little off at first. It got better though."
"__MUSIC__ How?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they started taking requests."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that does sound like fun. Did you ask for anything?"
"__MUSIC__ I was feeling tame. But the crowd really got into it."
"__MUSIC__ So what did you hear?"
"__MUSIC__ There were some songs by The Police. And the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
"__MUSIC__ Was there anything you wish you had requested?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I wanted them to play something silly."
"__MUSIC__ Something silly?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like a Weird Al song or something super girly that wouldn't fit them."
"__MUSIC__ That would have been fun."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sad I didn't go for it!"
