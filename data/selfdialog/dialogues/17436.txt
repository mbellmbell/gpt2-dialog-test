"__MOVIES__ Man, sometimes I just want to leave this planet."
"__MOVIES__ There are movies for that."
"__MOVIES__ Can you give me some of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Dark City?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have. I felt like I was being abducted by aliens while I watched that."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was their intent. You should see the movie Southland Tales."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about that. It sounds interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Donnie Darko? The guy who made that made Southland Tales."
"__MOVIES__ I have seen that movie. Are any of the same people in Southland Tales?"
"__MOVIES__ No, they got new people, but there is a great ensemble cast."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about some of the people in it."
"__MOVIES__ Sean William Scott, The Rock, and Sarah Michelle Geller are all in it."
"__MOVIES__ That is so random! What is this movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is about the world ending. I almost forgot that Justin Timberlake narrates it."
"__MOVIES__ I love Justin Timberlake! Who is he in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ He plays a marine. He goes into some very deep thoughts."
"__MOVIES__ This sounds like a cool movie. So it's about the world ending, is that it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is about it. It is a pretty free form movie."
"__MOVIES__ Those are my favorite kinds. So it is more designed to stretch your brain out as opposed to telling you a story."
"__MOVIES__ You nailed it. Check this movie out soon."
