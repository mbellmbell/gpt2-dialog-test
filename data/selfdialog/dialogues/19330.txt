"__MOVIES__ So I heard Ron Howard is directing the new Han Solo movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's not true.  The guys who did The Lego Movie are doing it."
"__MOVIES__ No, they were, but not anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Did they get fired or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently so.  From what I read, the studio didn't like what they had done."
"__MOVIES__ What was the central problem?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently the movie was becoming too comedic and screwball."
"__MOVIES__ What did they expect by hiring comedy directors?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess so.  So they fired them and brought in Ron Howard."
"__MOVIES__ That's an odd turn."
"__MOVIES__ Two completely different styles for sure.  Will be odd to see how it works out."
"__MOVIES__ It's going to be interesting to see how they cut up the film.  Sometimes it's hard to shift directing styles in the edit room."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Ron's style is a bit simplistic so it might work out just fine."
"__MOVIES__ Wonder how the cast felt about it."
"__MOVIES__ They were apparently okay with the room.  Some rumors suggest they were the ones who recommended the change."
"__MOVIES__ Hollywood can be a tough place I get."
"__MOVIES__ I don't feel bad for any of these guys.  They're all rich."
"__MOVIES__ So when is the movie going to come out now.  Did it get delayed?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, next May still.  Tough deadline."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully they don't screw it up for the fans."
