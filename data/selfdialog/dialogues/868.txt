"__MUSIC__ Was there ever a song that you loved when you were younger and then when you got older you were horrified because you realized what it was about?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Like, I used to love I Touch Myself by the Divinyls. I didn't realize what it was about until I was in my 20's."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow! Yeah, that would be embarassing."
"__MUSIC__ It was, especially because it took me so long to figure it out!"
"__MUSIC__ I had one kind of like that. I used to love Love in an Elevator by Aerosmith."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! That's what I'm talking about."
"__MUSIC__ I thought they meant like romance, long glances, maybe a little kissing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that is not what they meant. I thought the Divinyls were singing about dancing."
"__MUSIC__ Dancing? Yeah that's not what they were singing about."
"__MUSIC__ I know that now! I also went through a big Prince phase."
"__MUSIC__ Oh no. I can see where this is going."
"__MUSIC__ I was singing Cream at Thanksgiving dinner when my mom grabbed me and forbid me to sing anything at all the rest of the day."
"__MUSIC__ She was probably mortified that her kid was singing that in front of the whole family."
"__MUSIC__ Probably, of course now she finds it hilarious and tells that story almost every Thanksgiving."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, moms are like that."
"__MUSIC__ I need to do some new embarassing thing so she can stop repeating herself."
"__MUSIC__ That's still not as bad as my most embarassing moment."
"__MUSIC__ What was it."
"__MUSIC__ I was singing She Bop by Cyndi Lauper in the locker room before Gym when a really mean girl started telling everyone what I was singing about. They called me She Bop until graduation."
