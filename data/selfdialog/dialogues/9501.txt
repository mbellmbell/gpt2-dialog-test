"__BASEBALL__ Hey! Are you going to the ball game today?"
"__BASEBALL__ Whose playing?"
"__BASEBALL__ Seattle plays Baltimore today, but it's a double header!"
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean by double header?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh that means that they will play two games in a row on the same day."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? That sounds exhausting."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, but you get your money's worth as a fan!"
"__BASEBALL__ I suppose that is right.  When does the game start?"
"__BASEBALL__ The first game will begin at noon and the second game will follow."
"__BASEBALL__ Is there a break between games?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, there will be a short intermission for the field to be regrouped, but it won't be too long."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know if I could spend the whole day at the park."
"__BASEBALL__ I know.  I always feel like a devoted fan when I attend a double header."
"__BASEBALL__ Can I just attend one game or do I have to go to both?"
"__BASEBALL__ You can just come to one game.  When it comes to baseball games you can come and go as you please."
"__BASEBALL__ Going to a game does sound like fun, but I have some things to do this afternoon."
"__BASEBALL__ No worries. Complete you tasks and then give me a call."
"__BASEBALL__ Okay."
"__BASEBALL__ I plan on being at the ballpark all day!"
"__BASEBALL__ Great! I'll catch up with you later."
