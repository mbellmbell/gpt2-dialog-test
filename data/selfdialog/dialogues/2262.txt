"__MUSIC__ Remember that Wilson Phillips song from Harold and Kumar?"
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't it Hold On?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so.  Didn't it play in Bridesmaids too?"
"__MUSIC__ Come to think of it, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Okay.  Which movie was it better in?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I liked Bridesmaids a whole lot better, but the song was so much better in Harold and Kumar."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?  Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Because it was totally unexpected in Harold and Kumar and it didn't make sense there at all."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it didn't make sense there.  I don't get why you liked it better in it."
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much nothing in that movie made sense.  That actually was one of the parts I liked."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't Wilson Phillips have a couple other songs that were popular?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a few others.  The only one I remembered was Release Me."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, okay.  Now I remember."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they kind of all sounded the same."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they had that typical 90s sound."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Were you a big fan of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really.  I liked those songs, but I wasn't surprised they faded out."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of was, I mean being who their dad was."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, they were related to the Beach Boys."
