"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they developed a rock scene in the 80s which the government never really approved of."

"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately no, the lead singer died in a car accident in 1990."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad. How many albums did they release?"
"__MUSIC__ They had seven studio albums."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good amount of productivity. Any songs I should look for that you think are good?"
"__MUSIC__ There's one called Zvezda po imeni Solntse, which means The Star Called Sun, I liked that a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Soulful singing and introspective composition?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a pretty good example of what I was talking about. There's another song called Kukushka, or Cuckoo. It's gotten really famous."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ It's been covered by a number of Eastern Bloc artists, and recently was the theme song for a major movie in Russia."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting."
"__MUSIC__ You should give Kino a chance if you ever find the time and interest."
