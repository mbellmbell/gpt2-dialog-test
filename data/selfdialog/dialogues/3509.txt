"__MUSIC__ Did you finish watching that series on Netflix yesterday?"
"__MUSIC__ No, there was a last minute live-stream of one of my favorite singers show in London yesterday that I got the chance to watch."
"__MUSIC__ Who was that exactly?"
"__MUSIC__ Amanda Palmer - you might not know her she is pretty much very alternative and independent."
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't heard of her, what kind of music is it? Alternative is such a generic category."
"__MUSIC__ Well, when she was younger she was in the band Dresden Dolls which was classed a Punk Cabaret. She has been called punk, gothic, avant garde, and the list goes on. She is really fluid in what she creates."
"__MUSIC__ Oh ok. I have heard the Dresden Dolls before. I didn't know she did anything after that or much about her."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she is really extremely indie. She had signed with an indie record label and they wanted her to do things like lose weight and hide her mid-drift in a video. She refused - which is one thing I love about her, she is a real as her music."
"__MUSIC__ So they dumped her I take it?"
"__MUSIC__ Not sure - but she did end up doing a Kickstarter campaign for her next album and got a crazy amount of support. It is my second favorite record of hers - Theatre is Evil."
"__MUSIC__ So she just does Kickstarter to pay for everything now when it comes to production?"
"__MUSIC__ No, she actually set up a Patron that she uses to fund multiple projects. That is how she managed to pay for that live stream of the concert in London that I watched."
"__MUSIC__ So does she just write songs and sing with a backup band?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes. She has worked with a lot of different people. She plays the Piano/keyboard a lot along with the Ukulele and some other instruments."
"__MUSIC__ What album would you suggest I buy if I wanted to check her out more?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she sells all of her stuff in terms of downloads under the pay what you can on her site. But I would start with some of the videos, she has amazing music videos that you can find on Youtube."
"__MUSIC__ What are your favorite videos then?"
"__MUSIC__ Basically the entire Who Killed Amanda Palmer album. It is really moving and powerful."
"__MUSIC__ I will make sure to check it out then."
"__MUSIC__ Oh she also wrote a book and did a really famous TED talk that you can find online to get more of an idea of who she is as a person."
