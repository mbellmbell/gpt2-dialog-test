"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which character do you think changed the most throughout the series?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Nevil for sure."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he started out a pudgy wimp and turned out to be great."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, that goes to show you always believe in people."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know who else changed a lot?  Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well yes and no."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you mean no?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He always was Snape.  To us he changed, but to himself he always was a good guy in disguise."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ One thing always stayed the same though.  That was Dumpledore."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, even in death he was the same old Dumpledore, kind of kind and mystical."
