"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How would you rank Kanye West's albums?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Off the top of my head, I still think that College Dropout remains his greatest work."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Better than Late Registration?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'd say so. Late Registration is good, but too top heavy. Aside from Diamonds from Sierra Leone and Gold Digger, the songs range between average and good."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but College Dropout is also top heavy in terms of hits."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I disagree. While the album has tons of hits like Jesus Walks, Slow Jamz, and All Falls Down, the best songs on the album are the deep tracks like We Don't Care and Last Call."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Last Call is weird because it's a 3 minute song followed by 10 minute monologue."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but it's interesting to hear Kanye talk about how he was able to get a record deal as a producer."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'll have to listen to that track again. Anyways, what do you think of his newer work?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's great. Life of Pablo is a well crafted album."
