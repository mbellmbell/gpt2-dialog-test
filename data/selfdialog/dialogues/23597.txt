"__DISNEY__ Pixar movies are my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! Did you know that Pixar is a subsidiary of Disney?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think I heard that before. What does that mean?"
"__DISNEY__ It means they're under the umbrella of Disney. All of their movies come out under the Disney imprint."
"__DISNEY__ Are you saying that some Disney movies are Pixar, but that every Pixar movie is Disney?"
"__DISNEY__ Exactly."
"__DISNEY__ That makes sense.  I think Finding Dory is my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that's a great one. I actually prefer Finding Nemo."
"__DISNEY__ I have to say, it's honestly a tough choice between the two. I might have a recency bias."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's a tough choice. Maybe I have a nostalgia bias."
