"__MUSIC__ Do you like Kanye West?"
"__MUSIC__ Oooof. That's a tough subject, he's such a contentious figure."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right? His early stuff less so, but his public actions and recent work inspires a lot of love and a lot of hate."
"__MUSIC__ He's definitely a master at curating all these different sounds. Think of The Life of Pablo, how those old gospel samples run behind a Kid Cudi lead and are followed by a Kanye sing-songy lyric."
"__MUSIC__ That song rises and falls so gloriously."
"__MUSIC__ Right! And even if you don't like his lyrics it just sounds so good!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, his lyrics have never been that great to me, but he has gotten so egotistical and crass."
"__MUSIC__ Those lyrics about Taylor Swift weren't clever to me. They were just crude and attention seeking."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. We have to touch on something else though."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, what is it?"
"__MUSIC__ The Life of Pablo is such an interesting concept."
"__MUSIC__ Why because of the gospel of Paul and Pablo Escobar being such disparate figures."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's something, but I was thinking more about how it got updated."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! That was a huge and strange innovation, that the album wasn't done completely and might be updated for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Mmm-hmm. Remember the famous 'Imma fix Wolves' on Twitter?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Ha! Ha! That was the best moment of the whole saga."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it raises some interesting questions though. In the digital age, why shouldn't albums get updates just like games get patches?"
"__MUSIC__ For one, if it gets updated too much, it can get confusing what album one is listening to. Why not just release B-sides and alternate mixes."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's true. A complete erasure of the previous 'version' does make me feel odd."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but I may just be out of touch."
