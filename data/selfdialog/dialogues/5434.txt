"__STAR_WARS__ So, do you think Watto could learn the ways of the force?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, he's a toyderian. I don't know what that means, but he is one of those."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's funny that there are so many classes of people."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Tattoine seems to have lots of different races."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought that Watto was a good character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I liked how greedy he was."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what happened to him after episode 2."
"__STAR_WARS__ He probably just stayed on Tattoine."
"__STAR_WARS__ I preferred the Watto from Episode 1."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. He had like two lines in the Episode 2. That us not enough."
