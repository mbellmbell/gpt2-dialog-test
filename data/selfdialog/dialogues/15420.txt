"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just watched the entire Harry Potter series this past month and it was fantastical!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You are so lucky! I have seen them all but it has been a while. It is so magical."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, the wizards and witches and Hogwarts!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The author J.K Rowling has a fantastic mind to be able to create all of these people and worlds!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree that she is a genius! How did she come up with names like Albus Dumbledore?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right, or the character, He Who Must Not Be Named."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Thats hilarious!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was my favorite of the series, I think."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was a great one but my pick is Harry Potter the Deathly Hallows part two because of all the answered questions."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wonder of they will ever make another to add to the series, I hope so."
