"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw Wonder Woman just last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ What was it like?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a typical super hero movie in some ways but it also went into  Diana's backstory."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What is her backstory?"
"__MOVIES__ Well apparently she was a child of the gods who was created as a weapon against evil."
"__MOVIES__ I never heard that before. I thought she was an Amazon."
"__MOVIES__ She is an Amazon princess and grew up on a secret island with her mother."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that's more like the story I know. What was different about that in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The island was deliberately hidden by the gods so that mankind and their evil ways couldn't touch it."
"__MOVIES__ So how did Diana end up leaving the island?"
"__MOVIES__ That scene was one of my favorites in the whole movie. A plane crashed just off the coast of the island."
"__MOVIES__ So who was in the plane?"
"__MOVIES__ It was Chris Pine's character, Steve Trevor. Diana rescued him from drowning."
"__MOVIES__ So she couldn't get back once she left?"
"__MOVIES__ No, she took him to the island and the soldiers who were after him came to the island too. They fought with the Amazons."
"__MOVIES__ So she never left the island? I mean except to rescue Steve?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she left with him to go and try to stop the war that Steve was fighting in."
"__MOVIES__ Well how did it end?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not going to tell you! You have to go see it for yourself!"
