"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some good old hard-hitting football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've waited long enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you expecting to see this coming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really want to see whether some of these young quarterbacks bounce back or progress."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which ones specifically?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to see Winston and Newton can take over the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Winston definitely has the higher probably of progressing this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think Cam can bounce back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really feel like he's overrated in a way and people definitely hypes him far too much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you look at his previous season outside of his Superbowl season he really hasn't had that great of a career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that is true. People definitely did treat him like he was the best quarterback in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also think Jameis is a much better leader. He is a lot more relaxed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't disagree. Cam definitely looks a lot more frail when you look at his press conferences."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Cam has great potential, but he needs to drop the antics and play ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ever since that Superbowl loss it looks like he never really got it back together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and to be honest their team that year had a lot of luck in my opinion. You don't see a lot of Superbowl teams with that bad of an offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both teams that season had terrible o-lines, but I guess it speaks volume to how important  good running and a great defense is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree, but notice both teams fell apart this season for that very same reason. Their porous o-lines caused poor quarterback play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely! Ultimately, I think the Bucs and Jameis will progress significantly, because they have an awesome o-line and even more weapons on offense. I look forward to seeing the results."
