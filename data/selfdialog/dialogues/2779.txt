"__MUSIC__ What song would you say is the weirdest song on the radio right now."
"__MUSIC__ Weirdest song? What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ Like, you turn on the radio and its a weird song."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I'd have to say Malibu is a weird song."
"__MUSIC__ Is that the new song by Miley Cyrus?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that one. Something about it is just really weird to me."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that, I cant get into it at all."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, its a really strange one. I like her voice, but the song is strange."
"__MUSIC__ I like her voice too, I dont know if i could call the song strange or weird though."
"__MUSIC__ Well, whats the weirdest song for you then."
"__MUSIC__ Swish, Swish. Good voice, but if its about Taylor Swift, I just cant see it."
"__MUSIC__ Thats the new Katy Perry and Nikki Minaj song right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I read it was a hit back after Taylor's, Bad Blood song."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I listened to it for a few seconds but I couldn't stand it."
"__MUSIC__ Neither could I! It's such a bad song."
"__MUSIC__ It really is, like, how?"
"__MUSIC__ I know! If that was her response to Bad Blood, she just needs to stop."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. That song was amazingly bad."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it was, Bad Blood was so much better."
"__MUSIC__ Yup!"
