"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you like Lady GaGa's new album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ The jazz one with Tony Bennet, you mean?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No she recently released a new LP."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, really? What's it called."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's called Joanne. But I don't really like it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I liked Born This Way and Artpop. What's up with Joanne?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well she tried to go country. It's a really odd result."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I can't imagine her singing a country record."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, it's country mixed with pop. It'll time some time to get used to it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ At the very least, she was pretty good at the Superbowl."
