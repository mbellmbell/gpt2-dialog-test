"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know anything about NFL records?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some. Which ones in particular?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm just wondering where the current quarterbacks stand with some of the passing records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, well I can tell you that both Drew Brees and Tom Brady are in the top five for passing yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the leader?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton Manning followed by Brett Favre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok. What about passing touchdown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That looks pretty similar. Manning, Favre, Brees, and Brady in that order."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could Brees or Brady catch up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would probably take at least two more seasons, but I think they could."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady has the most wins though right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has the most career wins overall with 208, and Roethlisberger is the closest active quarterback, but he only has 136."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that is impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is. Brady also has the most regular season wins, playoff wins, and the second highest win percentage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who has a higher win percentage than him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Otto Graham, but he only played five years. He has a 61-16 record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he has as many wins as Brady has losses?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, so that's impressive, but of the quarterbacks with more years, Brady is the leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that is definitely true."
