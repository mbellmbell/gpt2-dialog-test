"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the movie Sully?"
"__MOVIES__ The one about the airplane emergency landing on the lake?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, with Tom Hanks."
"__MOVIES__ It was so good. It had been a while since I had seen a movie with him."
"__MOVIES__ He has done a few lately, but you defenitely watched the best one."
"__MOVIES__ He is an exeptional actor. The movie was so tense though."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, thinking that he was going to go to prison for acting like a hero was nerve wrecking."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. And the fact that it is a true story."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes real life is way more intense than fiction."
"__MOVIES__ It is. You know I read a strange fact about Tom Hanks a couple of weeks ago on Twitter."
"__MOVIES__ What is it?"
"__MOVIES__ That supposedly he is a distant cousin of Abraham Lincoln."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's crazy. He will probably go into politics after ending his acting career."
"__MOVIES__ Who knows? Maybe he'll follow Arnold Schwarzenegger's steps."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it would not be something new."
"__MOVIES__ And according to what I read George Clooney is also related to Abraham Lincoln."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you and I are also related to him."
"__MOVIES__ It's crazy right?"
"__MOVIES__ The world is a small place. But it is awesome to know that some amazing people are related."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I think Tom Hanks and Goerge Clooney both should do a movie about their distant cousin."
