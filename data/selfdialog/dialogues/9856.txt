"__COMEDY__ No, I haven't got a chance yet.  Who is in that?"
"__COMEDY__ Its got Charlie Day and Ice Cube."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yeah,  I saw the trailers for that.  Looked pretty funny."
"__COMEDY__ It was ok, not the funniest thing ever."
"__COMEDY__ A lot of comedies coming out now seem kind of stupid."
"__COMEDY__ The last one I really laughed at in the theater was The Heat."
"__COMEDY__ That's the one with Sandra Bullock?"
