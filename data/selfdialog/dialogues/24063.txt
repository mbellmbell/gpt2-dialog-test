"__SUPERHERO__ It really did not show. I do not even know why they called it that."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, Superman ends up dying, sort of."
"__SUPERHERO__ But not exactly at the hands of Batman."
"__SUPERHERO__ So, maybe it was more of a draw."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think so. The real winner was Wonder Woman, to be honest."
"__SUPERHERO__ She was the best part of that film."
"__SUPERHERO__ Gal Gadot did an amazing job in that movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ She did most her own stunts too."
