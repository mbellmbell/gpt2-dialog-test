"__BASEBALL__ What do you think is an acceptable batting average?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think that question is hard to answer."
"__BASEBALL__ How so?"
"__BASEBALL__ There are a bunch of mitigating factors."
"__BASEBALL__ Like what?"
"__BASEBALL__ How good is the hitter? Is he a power hitter? Contact hitter?"
"__BASEBALL__ Ok lets start with the power hitter."
"__BASEBALL__ Alright since they tend to make contact that is productive I would say .270"
"__BASEBALL__ And how about for contact hitters?"
"__BASEBALL__ Acceptable would be .310"
"__BASEBALL__ Those are some pretty lofty goals."
"__BASEBALL__ Well singles hitters need to spray the ball more and they usually do."
"__BASEBALL__ And power hitters?"
"__BASEBALL__ They make more long outs so thats why I would dip them below .300"
"__BASEBALL__ I just think .310 is too high for an acceptable rate, that would lead the league sometimes"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I think .350 and above should be a league leader."
"__BASEBALL__ How about for a power hitter who leads the league in batting"
"__BASEBALL__ If that were the case I would say .320."
"__BASEBALL__ Its hard to judge based just on batting average I guess"
"__BASEBALL__ Thats where I Was going"
