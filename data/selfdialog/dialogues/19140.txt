"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did, I went and saw it at the drive-in with my girlfriend a couple of days ago."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it! It is probably the best movie thus far in the DC cinematic universe."
"__MOVIES__ You think it was better than Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes definitely. I found both of those movies to be underwhelming."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like about Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Unlike the other films you mentioned, Wonder Woman had a great plot and you really come to care bout the characters."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, to be honest. I was on the edge of my seat."
"__MOVIES__ Gal Gadot really impressed me, I was skeptical of her ability to carry such a huge blockbuster, but she did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ Was there anything you didn't like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I would say that the films climax was a bit weak, and didn't fit with the rest of the film, but it was still fun to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I can agree with that. I also didn't like that there wasn't a clear villain for most of the film."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you didn't really know who to root against, but to me that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"__MOVIES__ Does this make you more excited for future DC comics films?"
"__MOVIES__ I must say, I'm a little more into it now. Although I'm not going to set my expectations too high."
"__MOVIES__ I understand that. I am really looking forward to Justice League, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it will be fun, if nothing else."
"__MOVIES__ I think if Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck deliver strong performances, the movie could be great."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I'd prefer to see more Batman and Wonder Woman than Superman."
