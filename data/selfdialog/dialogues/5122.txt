"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you think about the Fast & Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think that they're basically superhero movies."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How so?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, they're all basically indestructible.  No matter how many car crashes or other accidents, they always leave unscathed."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's a good point.  Pretty much no one in the core group, besides Han, died."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Remember that scene in 'Fast Five' where Dom and Brian drive off a bridge and survive?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, that was pretty ridiculous.  Or the scene in the 7th where they drive through 3 buildings."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm pretty sure the laws of physics don't apply to any of these characters."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Also, now I'm reminded of the fact that The Rock's character gets shot by rubber bullets in the latest movie, and just shrugs it off."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Like I said, they're superheroes!"
