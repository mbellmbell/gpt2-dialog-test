"__MOVIES__ Did you see that movie Enough?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one with Jennifer Lopez."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the one where she was abused by her husband?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I did and I didn't. It didn't seem real in some parts."
"__MOVIES__ What parts?"
"__MOVIES__ Like when she first went to the police and they wouldn't help her."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and like when the detective guy suggested a way to kill the husband?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. You know dang well that's not how it is in this day and age."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. But she did jack dude up in the end."
"__MOVIES__ Dude was a loser. All he wanted to do was control her."
"__MOVIES__ I know that's right. She wasn't having it girl."
"__MOVIES__ How J-Lo go from a movie like Enough to the one where she's messing with the teenage neighbor?"
"__MOVIES__ I know right. Probably hard to get a good role these days."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she is getting older."
"__MOVIES__ I know right. She's very far removed from Out of Sight."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, with George Clooney? Now that was a good flick."
