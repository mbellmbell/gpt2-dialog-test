"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the part when the ewoks were introduced in the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first time I watched it, I was a little freaked out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too!"
"__STAR_WARS__ The ewoks looks like teddy bears."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know! It's amazing that there were so many."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some of them were cute, but some of them scared me."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am glad that the ewoks were able to help Han Solo, Princess Leia and the others."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, without them, it would of been hard getting inside the base."
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite part was when the ewoks went into the big robots."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was so funny!"
