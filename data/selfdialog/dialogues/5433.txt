"__STAR_WARS__ I was always a Luke and Leia shipper."
"__STAR_WARS__ They're siblings. I don't think that would work out."
"__STAR_WARS__ They weren't originally siblings.  In the draft script of Empire Strikes Back, Luke had a completely different sister."
"__STAR_WARS__ It does come out of left field."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. The revelation makes little sense given what came before. It was just a neat way to end the love triangle."
"__STAR_WARS__ It wasn't really necessary, though.  I mean, plenty of love triangles end without such revelations."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Lucas just wanted Luke to have a sister. I suspect the idea was that she could become a Jedi and appear in sequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ If only he had done those sequels, instead of waiting so long."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think a Lucas helmed sequel trilogy in the 90s would have been great."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would have meant no prequels, though."
