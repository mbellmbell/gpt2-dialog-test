"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your opinion of the Washington Redskins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't have much of an opinion on them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about an opinion on Kirk Cousins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could have played better this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is never good to have less touchdowns and more interceptions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly I wonder if the Redskins will give him another chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should give him another season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I mean he did put up more then 20 touchdowns the past two years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even if he did that again while lowering his interceptions that would be great progress."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He must be wanting to do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he works really hard this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am sure he will put in a lot of effort this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he does especially if he gets traded to a team in need of a Quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah if the Redskins snub him he can get his revenge with a great season somewhere else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love to see that next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To be honest I will watch Redskins games when I can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here I usually try to watch as many games as I can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We are both big football fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well maybe the Redskins will win the Superbowl next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they do that will be great for the city of Washington!"
