"__LADY_GAGA__ So I was in my car driving last night and that Bad Romance song came on."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Okay.  What'd you think?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ That song is kind of trippy.  It's late at night, you're by yourself..."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Trippy?  It's not that creepy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ The way she sings it is kind of nuts."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Just because it sounds kind of electronic?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's just that they made her deep voice even deeper."
"__LADY_GAGA__ And that gives you the creeps?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm just saying, the chorus made me creeped out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You've got some serious issues, my man."
