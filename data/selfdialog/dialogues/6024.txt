"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the chances that were made to the Star Wars films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't mind them, but the original should be out there still."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, you cannot get a copy of it at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked the original because it looked more like a film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah and a lot of the characters were changed as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you like about the updates?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nothing really. I thought it made the film worse."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I agree. Luckily there was not much to change about episode 5."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that one is my favorite still."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Yoda makes that one amazing."
