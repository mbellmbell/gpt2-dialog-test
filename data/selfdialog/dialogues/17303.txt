"__MOVIES__ I watched Wayne's World for the first time in forever the other day!"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that in a while either. How does it hold up?"
"__MOVIES__ I still really enjoyed it. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are hilarious as Wayne and Garth."
"__MOVIES__ Rob Lowe plays the bad guy, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup. 'Benjamen'. All kind of people in the cast."
"__MOVIES__ I love the scene where they go see Alice Cooper in concert. The backstage part especially."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of the music, the bohemian rhapsody scene is classic."
"__MOVIES__ People still act out that scene out when the song plays."
"__MOVIES__ Chris Farley only has the small part as the security guard, but he shows up."
"__MOVIES__ He gives them all of the information about the record executive, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. So Cassandra can get signed to a major label or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ And then you have the multiple endings."
"__MOVIES__ The sad ending, the Scooby Doo ending, the mega happy ending."
"__MOVIES__ Who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ Penelope Spheeris. She did Black Sheep and a few other movies."
"__MOVIES__ She didn't have anything to do with Wayne's World 2 did she?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. I remember that's the one where they set up 'Waynestock', but that one I have yet to revisit."
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure Chris Farley is in that one more."
"__MOVIES__ Wayne's World one is the best thing Mike Myers has written for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Or that Dana Carvey has starred in."
