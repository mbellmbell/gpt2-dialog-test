"__HARRY_POTTER__ For the longest time, I had an aversion to the Harry Potter movies even though I had not seen one film."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You should watch the series.  They are very well done."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I actually finished up the series last night and I enjoyed it.  All the movies were well done."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which movie did you like the most?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Probably, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone.  I enjoyed the series when the characters were younger and more naive about the world."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I am different.  I liked when they were older and the movies were a bit more darker."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which movie was your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Probably Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.  The dementors were spooky."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The tone of that whole film was very dark to me.  Even the colors used in the film seem to be more muted."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think there is more at stake in the later films.  That is why I like them."
