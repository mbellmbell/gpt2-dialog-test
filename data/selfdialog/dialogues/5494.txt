"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Princess Leai will get a solo film?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like how they are making a Han Solo one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, do you think they will show her life before a New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope so, she was so brave in the films."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it would be sad since the actress that played her passed away."
"__STAR_WARS__ Carrie Fisher, that was sad."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish they would make some movie or at least show what she was doing between films."
"__STAR_WARS__ I always wondered why she ended up a princess."
"__STAR_WARS__ The movies do not give a real good back story as to how or why she ended up on Alderan."
"__STAR_WARS__ And they left Luke on the sand planet."
