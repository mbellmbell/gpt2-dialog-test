"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how do you think the Pats will be this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Outstanding.  Already were the best team in the NFL and just got better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are the gold standard in all of American Sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, year after year they just win and win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, Brady old as he is, still the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus don't forget Jimmy G is pretty lights out himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, watching him play last year was awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, it wasn't game managing either.  He made big time NFL throws."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also shredded some good defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, people overlook Miami is a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are.  Too bad he got hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if Brady still looks good Jimmy could have good trade value."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or as much as I hate to say it so does Brady.  Could be like a Montana to KC thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't know what San Fran got for that though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither do I.  But I do know Steve Young turned out pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure did.  One of the only lefties to be lights out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, most lefties struggle.  But if you can find a good one it poses problems for the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think the Pats will repeat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they certainly can.  It's just a matter of doing it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you're saying.  To many x-factors."
