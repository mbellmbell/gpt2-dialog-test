"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, I see the Chiefs are coming out to Foxborough for opening day. Catch a flight and come out out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I thought the Patriots would play the Falcon's opening day. That would be great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I've been out here for 3 years, XX moved us out for a new job and I love the town."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, I haven't talked to you in 5 years I didn't know. I'd love to come out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, 2 years ago with the Chiefs played the Patriots in the Playoffs, I had ticket but got sent to London the week of the game so my wife went with a friend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are the odds, that would suck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it did, oddly; it was a noon game so I was haunting the streets of Soho looking for a pub that was televising the game. Not what I envisioned with I bought the tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, you get to travel to England for work, amazing. So what weekend is that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're playin Thursday, September 7 at Gillette Stadium. Opening day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definetly, I'll look into airfarer. I hear it's a pretty good tailgate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't been to a game, but Stacey said she was the only Chiefs fan in the endzone sears I got surronded by a lot of blue, red and silver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much are the tickets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I'm sure I can get a pair on Stubhub for $300 or $400, it being there not the quality of tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are the Chiefs anygood this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don' t really know, they fired the GM, John Dorsey; relased their best receiver Jeremy Maclin so who knows."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I've never been to a Patriots game so I'll look into tickets tomorrow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great, let me know, I think you can get airfare from KC to Logan Airport for around $300 this far in advanced. Look into Providence, RI too because it cheaper, less crowded and closer to Foxborough and our house."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definetly,  I look them up tomorrow and get back to you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perfect, we haven't caught up in a long time and what a weekend to do it!"
