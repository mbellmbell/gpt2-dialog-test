"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, are you psyched about the football season coming up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, not soon enough!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think your team would do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think they'll do good. You know, the titan's still a young team and there are lots of talents..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the QB is good. What was his name?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marcus Mariota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah, didn't he get hurt?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, he broke his leg, but he should be good now. He's a young one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From Hawaii, right? Who'd have thought..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right? He is good though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Titans kind of surprised us all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there's a good chance for us this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope the same for mine...I don't know though. We will need some new players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was your team again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cardinals. Our main players are kind of getting old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, is Palmer still playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is. He's okay but he always chokes though..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha...at least he doesn't cry like some of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like Campbell..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding!!"
