"__MOVIES__ I just watched a interesting new Documentary."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, what's it called?"
"__MOVIES__ Room 237."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds familiar.."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's the room from The Shining."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! So what was it about then?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a lot of controversy around what the interpretation of the movie really is."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I didn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's some people that believe lots of crazy stuff about it."
"__MOVIES__ So did this documentary go in depth about that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it explained all of these theories with people who have been analyzing it for years."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of theories did people suggest?"
"__MOVIES__ One about how Stanley Kubrick faked the moon landing, and another was about unfair persecution of Indians."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that's pretty crazy. Do you believe any of them?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, I mean I figure they can't all be wrong."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I'll have to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ The Shining is one of my favorites, so I wanted to hear what people had to say."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's crazy, I really want to see it now."
"__MOVIES__ You should if you get the chance."
"__MOVIES__ Okay!"
