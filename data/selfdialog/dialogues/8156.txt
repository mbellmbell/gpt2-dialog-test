"__POP__ Ariana Grande resumed her tour after briefly suspending it following the Manchester attacks, but it had to be scary going to her first gig back."
"__POP__ I'm sure anyone would be nervous, but I think they picked her show because of opportunity, not because of her."
"__POP__ Her next show back though was Paris- and Paris has had a LOT of terrorism incidents, including a concert where a lot more people died than the Manchester concert."
"__POP__ Yeah, I'm not sure I'd want to be a pop singer on tour right now, there's been so many incidents."
"__POP__ The authorities all say don't let them take away your freedom, and continue your normal lives, but that's hard to do if you think you might be in danger."
"__POP__ Well, Ariana Grande did have the big Manchester benefit concert and security was tight, but everything went fine."
"__POP__ They said security would be heavy for the Paris show too of course, becuase of the potential for an incident."
"__POP__ The fans are really brave to keep going out to things instead of laying low at home."
"__POP__ I'm sure overseas fans feel like they don't know when they would get a chance to see her again, so that's why they risk it."
"__POP__ They must be really devoted Ariana Grande fans to take the risk though."
