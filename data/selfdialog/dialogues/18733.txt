"__MOVIES__ I'm going to binge watch some classic kung-fu flicks this weekend. Any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ You have to watch Enter The Dragon."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a big fan of that one."
"__MOVIES__ Not a big fan? Why not? Everyone loves that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I have seen it a few times, but I don't like how slow and boring it is."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard anyone describe Enter The Dragon as slow and boring before."
"__MOVIES__ What else do you suggest?"
"__MOVIES__ You're sticking with the 70s cinema?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course. Those are the best."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the one about the Flying Guillotine?"
"__MOVIES__ Master of the Flying Guillotine? I love that one."
"__MOVIES__ After seeing that movie when I was a kid, I attached my dad's cowboy hat to a yo-yo and started chasing my friends around as the guillotine guy."
"__MOVIES__ How inventive. The Five Deadly Venoms is a good one too."
"__MOVIES__ It is. It's one of the best. Which venom was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ The Scorpion because of his cool kicks. I like the lizard style too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that dude could run up walls like Spider-Man."
"__MOVIES__ The Toad was the weakest style, though. That's why he got killed off so soon in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That guy just didn't know how to handle himself. I mean, how can someone with invulnerability get beat?"
"__MOVIES__ He had a weak spot, so he wasn't all that invulnerable."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know. Bad writing."
