"__LADY_GAGA__ So how did you hear about Lady Gaga's most recent album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Can you jog my memory? What was the name?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Sure. It was called Joanne."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh now I remember it came out in 2016 I think I have only heard the two singles released from that album."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yes I loved those singles 'Perfect Illusion' and 'Million Reasons'"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I first heard 'Perfect Illusion' on this show she played a role in called American Horror Story. But never considered buying the full album."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I am familiar with that show. I actually purchased the single on Itunes prior to buying the album"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wow can you tell me what the album focuses on and the sound?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I definitely think it is a softer side to Lady Gaga that focuses more on family she dedicated it to her Aunt that had passed away."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wow that is a new turn for her music which is usually rather upbeat and focused on a pop sound."
