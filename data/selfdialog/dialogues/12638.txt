"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man every year when the Superbowl ends I get depressed, no NFL football for months"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I like MLB and NBA but I still spend most time reading about off season NFL Moves"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think did the best in the draft this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know I like Houston picking up DeSean Watson from Clemson and the Browns added a lot of depth too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You planning on going to any games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I have kids so NFL Sunday ticket at home for me.  Do you get it with your cable package?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I do, I have the NFL channel on all year, annoys the heck out of my wife, LOL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I watch quite a bit too.  Have you ever been to NFL hall of fame in Canton?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I havent but I'm dying to go one day.  Favorite team of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course the 85 Bears best defense and best coach of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Maybe maybe, but the Pats under Brady and Belichek are sure giving them a run for their money, maybe surpassed them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess thats true, I just remember watching that Bears team as a kid and it seemed like they could beat anybody"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think any team will pick up Kaepernick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not.  Sucks for him cause it seems like he still has some good talent but he sorta ruined it for himself with the protest thing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you play NFL Madden?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I used to quite a bit, but since I have kids now its a lot tougher but I miss it.  I grew up playing Tecmo Bowl for NES"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like the new NFL uniforms?  If you watch classic films they look so modern compared to those old bulky shirts they used to wear"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah everything seems so aerodynamic to maximize performance"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay last question, you go to a game with your buddies, whats the ultimate tailgate meal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm great question I'd say cold beer, and brats right off of the grill"
