"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, what dance would go best with this dance?"
"__MUSIC__ Not sure, I was thinking of using the samba, or the cha cha cha."
"__MUSIC__ Ummm, I think those are some bad dances."
"__MUSIC__ Why? Is the beat too slow for them?"
"__MUSIC__ One: Yes, and two, those require a more peppy-like, fast movement music."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, you're right, maybe I'll pick another genre instead."
"__MUSIC__ Like what? We were given this one for our assignment."
"__MUSIC__ And what, we can't change it up a bit?"
"__MUSIC__ NO, we were given this song title, so we gotta use this with what we have for our dance materials."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't I change this music up a notch, then?"
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm gonna use a synthesizer to change up the beat!"
"__MUSIC__ And what if our professor denies this?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, screw it."
"__MUSIC__ Ummm, no, I don't think this is a good idea."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Because it's difficult to change in the middle of our routine"
"__MUSIC__ .Well, what can we replace it with?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe with a little bit of style and flair! Not with our music, but our costumes! Say, instead of a long dress, why not a fur coat? Say, a huge black fox fur coat?"
"__MUSIC__ WOWIE, YOU WANNA WEAR A FOX FUR COAT? I'M DOWN TO DANCE WITH YOU, GIRL!"
