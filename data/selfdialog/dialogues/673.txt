"__MUSIC__ I'm deeply saddened by the passing of Chris Cornell."
"__MUSIC__ I still can't believe it. I grew up with Soundgarden as my favorite band."
"__MUSIC__ Soundgarden was kind of lost during that 90's grunge area. I think they fall right in line with Stone Temple Pilots and Alice in Chain."
"__MUSIC__ To me, they're even better than Pearl Jam and Nirvana, if I have to be honest with you."
"__MUSIC__ You have to admit it was basically Chris who made that band."
"__MUSIC__ Black Hole Sun is such a deep song."
"__MUSIC__ That's the favorite off the Superunknown album, but I think there's a couple other tracks that were better."
"__MUSIC__ Really? What were your favorite tracks off that album?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Black Hole Sun a lot but my favorite was Fell On Black Days. I think I related more to that song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I liked Fell On Black Days too."
"__MUSIC__ I actually was a bigger fan of Chris when he formed Audioslave."
"__MUSIC__ Audioslave is a band where, when someone mentions them I know they know their music."
"__MUSIC__ I know right? They had three fantastic albums. The self titled Audioslave album was my favorite of the three."
"__MUSIC__ That was my favorite too. Cochise, Like a Stone, and I Am the Highway are my favorites song by Chris of all time. Right up there with Black Hole Sun."
"__MUSIC__ I Am the Highway always makes me choke up because like Fell On Black Days, I could really relate to it."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know Chris planned a reunion with Audioslave before his unfortunate passing?"
"__MUSIC__ I did know that. I was so disappointed and saddened to hear that."
"__MUSIC__ You know though, his music lives on. Did you get his solo album?"
"__MUSIC__ I have that album, it's really good too. He opened up for Linkin Park during their Projekt Revolution tour. I caught a show, it was so good."
"__MUSIC__ You are lucky. I never got to see him live! I have to just live his wonderful music through the live concert DVD's."
