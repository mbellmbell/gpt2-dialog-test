"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think Kaepernick will find a team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. He's getting blackballed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. I mean look at all the other teams with bad quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure but some are rookies or have a lot of sunk cost."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think Kaep can be a backup?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's backup in New York?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uhh..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Geno Smith. Is Kaep better than Geno Smith?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say so, yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And he'd be a great backup to Wilson in Seattle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They signed McCown, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is terrible, and doesn't have the same game as Kaep."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is similar to Wilson's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. And Kaep's jersey sold like crazy last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I guess he wouldn't be a financial liability."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. People will buy his jersey no matter what."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like Tebow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kaep is waaaay better than Tebow."
