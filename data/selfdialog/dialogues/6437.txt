"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the Star Wars prequel trilogy? To me, it was disappointing"
"__STAR_WARS__ I had a similar first impression, but I've seen them a few times now, and I have to admit they're a lot of fun."
"__STAR_WARS__ But there are some glaring flaws. How about Jar Jar - isn't he annoying?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he is, but you have to look at the big picture. Lucas obviously included him for a bit of humor."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's the problem, though. He's not funny - he's just annoying."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar aside, some of the characters are very compelling. Qui Gone Jin, for example, played by Liam Neisen, is amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to agree with you there. He's a good example of a courageous, strong-willed Jedi. And Darth Maul is a terrific villian too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, how about the fight between the two Jedi and Darth maul with the double light saber? There's nothing like it."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. It ranks among the best ever Star Wars combat scenes. But Haydn Christianson was miscast as Anakin Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ There I agree with you. They could have chosen a better actor for that part."
