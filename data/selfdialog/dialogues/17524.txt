"__MOVIES__ What is the worst movie you've seen"
"__MOVIES__ For me, it would have to be How the Grinch Stole Christmas"
"__MOVIES__ The animated one?"
"__MOVIES__ No the one starring Jim Carrey"
"__MOVIES__ What? How can you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ It just ruined the whole franchise for me"
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ With the horrid adult jokes and twisting around the story to fit in some cheap references"
"__MOVIES__ Well at least the acting was good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Jim Carrey did fairly well, I'll give him that. But the script just wasn't good"
"__MOVIES__ And the makeup?"
"__MOVIES__ The Grinch's makeup was spectacular, but the makeup on the Whos was just...creepy"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess I can see your point there"
"__MOVIES__ But the worst part of the whole movie is just the cheap jokes"
"__MOVIES__ Oh you mean the slapstick?"
"__MOVIES__ No I just mean the added adult humor for the sake of the audience"
"__MOVIES__ What kind of adult jokes?"
"__MOVIES__ Well for starters, there's references to a lot of adult situations"
"__MOVIES__ I guess that is a tad inappropriate for a family movie"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it caused me to lose all respect for it to be honest"
