"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Pirates movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I would say the first one."
"__DISNEY__ That's too easy. Everybody says that."
"__DISNEY__ Because it's true."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but there's got to be another one that's better."
"__DISNEY__ Nope, the first is always the best.  It was more fun than the others."
"__DISNEY__ True.  Some of the plots got a bit silly."
"__DISNEY__ A bit silly?  You couldn't even follow them!"
"__DISNEY__ The last movie was a bit easier to understand than some other ones."
"__DISNEY__ By no means easy though!"
