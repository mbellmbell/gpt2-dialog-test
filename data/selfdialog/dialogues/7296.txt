"__LADY_GAGA__ Hey, do you know the singer Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Of course, you think I've been living under a rock?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Ha, no. I was just wondering what she's been up to lately."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I hear you. I haven't heard a new song in a while."
"__LADY_GAGA__ With the state of music today, I wonder if she would even put anything new out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Why do you say that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, every year seems to bring a new sound, and any artist that isn't new for that year sounds too old for the young kids to relate to."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It didn't used to be like that. I liked artists of any age group as long as they sounded good."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, that's too bad. It makes every artist sound the same, and then they disappear and new ones come. Every new artist is now a 'one-hit-wonder'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Believe it. See you around."
