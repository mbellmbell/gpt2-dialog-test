"__MOVIES__ I just saw the oddest Dracula movie ever."
"__MOVIES__ There are tons, which one?"
"__MOVIES__ Dracula Untold, it kinda puts you in mind of Van Helsing visually."
"__MOVIES__ I have seen Dracula Untold, I thought it was a rather unique twist."
"__MOVIES__ historically, Vlad was a hero to his people for fighting the turks. Seems like a natural vision for the Hollywood figure and historical one."
"__MOVIES__ I like how they kept it where he was seeking power to defend his people, but that  and the reffernce to the Dracula name  are probably the only historical facts."
"__MOVIES__ No, remember the scene where they showed briefly the people up on pikes impaled?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah , kinda. Why?"
"__MOVIES__ The actual Vlad the Impaler done that! He commanded a forest of 10,000 people be planted via impaling to greet the hoards."
"__MOVIES__ I did not know that1"
"__MOVIES__ Indeed, and in the uncut version, he is sitting on a throne like alter dipping his bread in the blood of his enemies like its gravy!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! That would be freaky to ride into and see."
"__MOVIES__ Psychological warfare is a part of warfare. I like how they made his wife actually stand by him, and not some whaf in a trance."
"__MOVIES__ I never understood why they would choose to go that route with his wife anyway."
"__MOVIES__ I figure it was, in older movies, a statement towards the male dominance of society."
"__MOVIES__ Well the original Nosferatu was ugly as sin, from the trailor, the guy that plays Dracula is very nice looking."
"__MOVIES__ They pay homage to Nosferatu, I believe that is who he visits in the cave when he seeks power."
"__MOVIES__ How did Nosferatu get in a cave?"
"__MOVIES__ They didn't say it was Nosferatu exactly. When Dracula sought power, he went to the cave to talk to the thing trapped there."
"__MOVIES__ oh, ok. That makes more sense."
