"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the Rocky Horror Picture Show?"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that a comedy musical or something like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it came out in 1975. Susan Sarandon and Brian Bostwick were 2 of the main characters."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that movie. Tim Curry stole the show! He was the 'sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania.'"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know Richard O'Brien was living as an unemployed actor in London during the early 1970s and wrote the movie just to stay busy?"
"__MOVIES__ No I didn't. Wasn't he the greasy haired butler in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the big lurchy guy. Creepy."
"__MOVIES__ It is a very weird story, but I think the weird part of it all is the audience interaction."
"__MOVIES__ I don't recall any of that. What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen it in theaters a few times and there were preparations that had to be made. We made a ton of toast. Yeah kind of wasteful!"
"__MOVIES__ Toast? What did you need that for?"
"__MOVIES__ In the beginning scenes as the movie unfolds, the crowd chants different different things. Like during the opening song people will chant 'Let there be lips.'"
"__MOVIES__ Really? What did you do with all your toast?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that you throw up in the air when the 'toast' happens in the movie. Or at least they did when I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ That would make a mess. Glad I didn't have to clean that up."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm sure the movie theater people hated that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there'a a good bit of profanity and lots of sexual innuendo but it's fun."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of sounds like it might be. Especially if you are in on all participation."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Especially since we would go to midnight show. Get out in the wee hours of the night and go hunt for a Waffle House."
"__MOVIES__ Now that part sounds good."
