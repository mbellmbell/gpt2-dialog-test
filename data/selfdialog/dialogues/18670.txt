"__MOVIES__ Oh I didn't know you worked in a video store! Did you like doing that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was fun getting to have regular customers and having great people to work with."
"__MOVIES__ That wasn't what I expected to hear. Did you get free rentals?"
"__MOVIES__ I certainly did and enjoyed it so much. One of my favorite movies that came out was 'Undercover Brother'"
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie! It cracked me up!"

"__MOVIES__ I like it when I find a movie that makes me feel like that."
"__MOVIES__ I would recommend this movie to everyone of my customers. I bought that movie which is something I rarely did."
