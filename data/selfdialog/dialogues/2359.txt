"__MUSIC__ Yngwie Malmsteen is so cool!"
"__MUSIC__ Who is that again?  It's the guitar player right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, the Swedish virtuoso who invented neoclassical-metal fusion."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, now I remember...One of my friends played two songs for me and it was really mind-blowing!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm really into his stuff.  Yesterday I was listening to a song called 'Amadeus Quattro Valvole'."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, what does that mean, it's in another language?"
"__MUSIC__ There are no lyrics in the song, it's an instrumental.  The name of the song is in Italian and it means 'Amadeus Four Valve'."
"__MUSIC__ That guy is something else.  I heard he's had a lot of singers in his band."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's true.  And most of them are amazing!  He has usually been able to get really great, talented singers."
"__MUSIC__ But the don't stay too long?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope.  Sadly they usually get in fights with him and he fires them."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's ridiculous!  I remember my friend said Mark Boals was his best singer."
"__MUSIC__ He was!  He joined the band after the second album was recorded because the first singer had already been fired."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's crazy!"
"__MUSIC__ Yep.  He starred in the music video for the single, but the audio featured the first singer!"
"__MUSIC__ That's something else.  How long did he last?"
"__MUSIC__ He lasted through the tour for the second album and the recording for the third album, then he was fired."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my Gosh!  How did that happen?"
"__MUSIC__ He said, 'The sad reason is I got in a fight with Yngwie and I was fired.'"
"__MUSIC__ Well, never a dull moment I guess!"
