"__BEATLES__ So, Sgt. Pepper is 50 years old."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I guess it is. They're releasing a new version of it now."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, really? Did they work Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane back into it somehow?"
"__BEATLES__ No, they didn't. That would have been the smart thing to do, right?"
"__BEATLES__ Guess I'll just stick with my own playlist, then! The album doesn't really work so well without them."
"__BEATLES__ I know what you mean. I mean, there are some neat experiments in there, but there's not much that really stands out until the end."
"__BEATLES__ A Day in the Life, you mean?"
"__BEATLES__ Right. But even that... honestly, the Paul segment could go. I don't know what else to do with it, but oy."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, there's that great climax of sound, and then... doopy doopy doo, I'm Paul McCartney; aren't I a fop!"
"__BEATLES__ I keep blending that transition in my mind with Bohemian Rhapsody. It's an improvement."
