"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, have seen Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I;'ve had a chance. Is it any good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's very good, it tells the story of how the Death Star Plans were captured."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, that's sound interesting. Any cameo's from the main trilogies or other works?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jimmy Smits plays Bail Organa, Artoo and C3PO have a quick cameo, and Grand Moff Tarkin plays a sizable role."
"__STAR_WARS__ Grand Moff Tarkin, how'd they do that."
"__STAR_WARS__ They used green screen and CGI techniques to superimpose Peter Cushings face onto another actor, and that actor sounded pretty close to Cushings voice as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Man, it amazing what they can do with CGI these days."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they even used the same technique to have Princess Leia have a quick cameo near the end of the film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whoa, now I definitely will make time to see Rogue One."
