"__ROCK__ Is there anyone cooler than Butch Walker?"
"__ROCK__ That's a random question but probably, yes."
"__ROCK__ No no, that was rhetorical you weren't supposed to answer."
"__ROCK__ Oh okay, then no yeah Butch Walker is the coolest."
"__ROCK__ His latest album Stay Gold has such a coolness factor to it."
"__ROCK__ You're going to have to explain what that means, man."
"__ROCK__ Each song drips with this East coast, New Jersey flavor and swagger."
"__ROCK__ I can see what you mean but plenty of artists do that."
"__ROCK__ Yeah but how many actually feel authentic?"
"__ROCK__ I guess not many, lots of people try and nail that sound and it comes off disingenuous."
