"__MOVIES__ It really is. Anthony Michael Hall was hilarious in that!"
"__MOVIES__ He really was. I like the two geeks with the dark hair."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they're funny. John Cusack played one of them."
"__MOVIES__ That's right! His sister Joan was in the movie, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she was the awkward girl with the neck brace."
"__MOVIES__ When she drinks from the fountain and wipes her mouth with her shirt! I couldn't stop laughing!"
"__MOVIES__ That part was funny. I love Long Duk Dong!!"

"__MOVIES__ He says, 'What's Happenin' Hot Stuff!' So, so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed Michael Schoeffling in that film, too. He made a great Jake."

"__MOVIES__ The people he had over totally trashed his house. It was destroyed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but that was more Caroline's fault for bringing everyone there. I couldn't stand her character!"
