"__MUSIC__ Who would you say is the best male vocalist today?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's easy. Nate Reuss."
"__MUSIC__ Nate Reuss? Interesting that he's the best when I've never heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ Very funny. Maybe you don't know his name, he's the lead singer from Fun.."
"__MUSIC__ Fun.? Remind me what they sing again?"
"__MUSIC__ Well their really popular album was in 2012, Some Nights. It had that song We Are Young featuring Janelle Monae."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! Tonight, we are young!"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, yes that one. And maybe you know the song he did with Pink, Just Give Me a Reason."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know that one too. Okay wow you are right his vocals were really amazing on that song."
"__MUSIC__ They truly were. And honestly I think he's an incredible lyricist as well."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I guess I never really listen very hard."
"__MUSIC__ You should. He talks about some pretty real subjects that when you hear 'em you're like -- dang."
"__MUSIC__ Alright I guess I'll go ahead and give him a listen. Any other recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ Well to be honest I'm pretty biased in favor of Fun.. A member of the group has his own band called Bleachers."
"__MUSIC__ So Fun. broke up?"
"__MUSIC__ No! And I'm hoping they never will break up, they just work on their own projects sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, it sounds like a break up to me dude. Would you say Beyonc√© 'just works on her own projects sometimes'?"
"__MUSIC__ Well Destiny's Child hasn't made music together since the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ Excuse me, I know you didn't ignore that banger Say Yes released in like, 2014."
"__MUSIC__ Haha that song about Jesus? Please that was hardly a comeback."
