"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I just watched the Fast and the Furious series for the first time."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What did you think of it. I love those movies."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I really liked them. There was one I wasn't thrilled about though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Which one was that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I wasn't a big fan of Tokyo Drift."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really?! That is one of my favorites."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know, I hear that from a lot of people. I just feel it is kind of thrown in and doesn't really go with the rest of the series."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Ya I guess I can see that. I really like the main character though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Ya he is ok. The best thing for me out of this movie was the introduction of Han."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh ya definitely. He is one of my favorites."
