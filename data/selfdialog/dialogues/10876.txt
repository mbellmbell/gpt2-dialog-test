"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the NFL's age limit for the draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remind me again what it is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The rule says they can't draft a player who isn't equivalent to a junior or senior in college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ooh, this rule. Controversial, I remember."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go ahead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should be able to draft anyone they want. If someone is 20 and able to transition easily, go for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about education?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They basically abandon their education."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what if they do? They'll make $10 million and then finish as they retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sets a bad example."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you're letting your kids use NFL players as role models, you're a bad parent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, that's actually mean but kind of true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of these kids need to get drafted sooner because their family is so impoverished."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if they get hurt?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they get hurt early and ruin their NFL careers, so be it. It's a sport, not a job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're harsh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm opportunist. A company should be able to hire whomever they think will do the best. So what if they're 19?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. Their bodies aren't ready for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only issue is they CAN'T return to college after declaring. I hate it."
