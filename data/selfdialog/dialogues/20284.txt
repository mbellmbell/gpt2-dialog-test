"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite genre of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ You know me, I like the classics."
"__MOVIES__ I should have known, right? So what's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I like Gone With the Wind."
"__MOVIES__ That is old!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, but it has such a feel for the Civil War period."
"__MOVIES__ I've never actually seen it, but I've seen clips from it a lot. It's in color, isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it has color even though it was a 1939 movie. The color really enhances the feel in the setting."
"__MOVIES__ Was that a Clark Gable movie?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in it, along with Vivian Leigh and some other notable names."
"__MOVIES__ I remember they had a really rich woman who always wanted to get her way and then the Civil War started, right?"
"__MOVIES__ She was a part of a big slave owning plantation in the South, and she was used to getting whatever she wanted and using men for her advantage."
"__MOVIES__ That would be where Clark Gable came in?"
"__MOVIES__ Clark Gable played a man whom she eventually could not have her way with. He represented a strong character who wouldn't put up with her ways in the end."
"__MOVIES__ That's where the famous quote comes in, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. Frankly, my dear...."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that one. It had to get past the censors of that time?"
"__MOVIES__ It got fined for it, I believe. It probably opened up the doors to using the word in subsequent movies, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, because now it's used all the time, and people don't really think anything of it, unless it's in a kids movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. That's true."
