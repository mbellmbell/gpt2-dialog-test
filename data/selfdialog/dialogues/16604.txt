"__MOVIES__ What is with all these remakes? Doesn't Hollywood have any original ideas anymore?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently not. Now what are they remaking?"
"__MOVIES__ Flatliners."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like that one from decades ago with Julia Roberts?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. I always thought it was pretty creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so who's in this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Ellen Page and some others I don't really know."
"__MOVIES__ Remember when they remade Point Break?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Why, why would you mess with perfection?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha! I'm not sure I'd call it perfection."
"__MOVIES__ Keanu Reeves was perfection in that movie and you can't convince me otherwise."
"__MOVIES__ I'm actually not going to argue with that."
"__MOVIES__ Because obviously you'd lose. Seriously though, they had to know they wouldn't be able to make the movie better."
"__MOVIES__ And if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Although I might rather have a remake than an awful sequel."
"__MOVIES__ It's like they don't know when to stop."
"__MOVIES__ I swear they're on like the 58th Fast and Furious right now."
"__MOVIES__ Well somebody must be watching them. They must be making money, right?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. I just don't get it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't think you've the audience they're going for."
