"__STAR_WARS__ Why is Boba Fett so popular?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I actually have no idea."
"__STAR_WARS__ He barely shows up in Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and when he does, he gets killed."
"__STAR_WARS__ And not heroically, he dies like a punk."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he gets bonked in the back of the head by accident like one of the three stooges and knocked into the Sarlacc pit."
"__STAR_WARS__ What the hell is the Sarlacc pit in the first place?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's like the vagina dentata of the desert."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, that makes Fett's death even sader. But people still love him."
"__STAR_WARS__ They also tried to hype him up with the prequels too, added a dad, made him Polynesian or something. It's just a mess, the whole backstory."
