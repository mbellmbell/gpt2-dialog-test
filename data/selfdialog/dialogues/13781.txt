"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been paying attention to the NBA finals this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but not constantly. I've mostly been watching on and off."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, me too. I don't really have a team in the playoffs, but it's still pretty entertaining and I pay attention sporadically."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, my team was in the playoffs, but they lost in the first round."
"__BASKETBALL__ It happens. It makes it hard to get interested when your team isn't all that great."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed. Which teams do you think will play in the championship series?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably Cleveland and Golden State, same as the past two years."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that's who I think will make it. Which team do you think will win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably the Golden State Warriors. The Cleveland Cavs are good too, but Golden State seems pretty unstoppable."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I think the Warriors will win as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ I kind of saw that coming, even before the season began."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah same, it's kind of unfortunate that the NBA seems to be a little too predictable."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, going into the season, there's only like 4-5 teams that even I have a chance to win it all."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I agree. There's 32 teams I think, but only a few have a legitimate chance to win it all."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and it's hard to get into NBA basketball if your team isn't one of those 4-5 teams that has a chance to win it all."
"__BASKETBALL__ My team had kind of a chance, but I figured they'd lose in the first round or two, so I wasn't super disappointed or surprised when they got bounced out in the first round."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, oh well, there's not much you can do. The Warriors are ridiculously good and the Cavs are good too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, plus the Cavs have an easier path to the finals since the eastern conference isn't as stacked/talented as the western conference."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Warriors will win, but I kinda want LeBron to get more rings."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know, I don't really care either way. I just want to see a good finals."
