"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I kind of like everything. Well, except heavy metal and most rap I guess."
"__MUSIC__ You even like country music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I love country. Although I prefer the traditional country music to today's pop country."
"__MUSIC__ So people like Patsy Cline and Waylon Jennings?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! As for newer artists, I just think Sam Hunt incorporating rap into country is awful."
"__MUSIC__ So you probably don't like Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood's new song then?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I don't mind the song on its face; however, in my opinion it is not country at all."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that. It has a lot of synthesized music."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It seems like it would work better in the pop genre."
"__MUSIC__ It reminds me more of something you'd here from Lady Gaga, not a country artist."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I'd go that far, but I see where you are coming from. I do like Lady Gaga though."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. She is such a great singer. Interesting though that you like old country and Lady Gaga."
"__MUSIC__ Well that doesn't even cover my favorite: Bruce Springsteen."
"__MUSIC__ You really do like a lot of genres don't you."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, for sure. Are you a Bruce fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Casually, but I wouldn't say a hard core fan."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not as crazy as some, but I've seen him seven times."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. You really do like him."
"__MUSIC__ I just can't get enough of his classic rock."
