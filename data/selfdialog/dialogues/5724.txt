"__STAR_WARS__ Was Rey living in Tatooine in the beginning part of Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, that was a different planet called Jakku"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh so another desert planet in the universe"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I guess there were a lot of them"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked how it had all the old star destroyers and other space junk on the planet"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I guess there was a big battle there back in the day"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that makes sense, there was more than just Endor"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the Empire was pretty big"
"__STAR_WARS__ We only got to see a portion of it"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but we saw the main parts."
