"__DISNEY__ I finally watched The Lion King with my kids."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that's a great movie to watch with kids. I loved the music."
"__DISNEY__ Ya they really liked I just can't wait to be kind. Isaac asked to hear it again after the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I still like Simba and Nala singing Can you Feel the love tonight."
"__DISNEY__ Ya, that's a part I liked more as i'm older but I don't think they liked it."
"__DISNEY__ They also thought Timon and Pumba were funny. Isaac laughed when they were first there scaring away the voltures."
"__DISNEY__ I remember as a kid really liked the part where Simba fights Scar."
"__DISNEY__ Oh ya that's good too. Isaac kept calling him Scarf. I thought that was funny."
"__DISNEY__ Cute! I actually have the CD would they want to borrow that?"
"__DISNEY__ I bet they would love to hear all the songs again."
