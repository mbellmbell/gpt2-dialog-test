"__MUSIC__ When were those released?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh gosh, it was her debut album.  It was in 1999 I think."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know she was also on the Mickey Mouse Club show, just like Britney Spears?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I had heard that.  They were contemporaries, weren't they?"

"__MUSIC__ How many albums did she end up releasing?"
"__MUSIC__ I have heard of seven.  Her last one was in 2012 so not too long ago."

"__MUSIC__ The Pop Star Princess, as they say."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I'd heard that too.  I think she's had some children now, hasn't she?"

"__MUSIC__ That's crazy!  I guess she was extremely popular."
"__MUSIC__ She still is.  She hasn't faded out of popularity yet."
"__MUSIC__ No, I guess she hasn't."
