"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the movie Wanted?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the movie with Morgan Freedman?"
"__MOVIES__ He's in there, yes, but there are plenty of other famous actors."
"__MOVIES__ Like who?"
"__MOVIES__ Angelina Jolie is in there as the romance interest."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's pretty cool. She's gorgeous."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's a looker definitely."
"__MOVIES__ Was the movie any good?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the idea was really good, but a good portion of the movie just felt so predictable and cliche."
"__MOVIES__ What's the idea about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of like The Matrix where a bunch of hyper-unrealistic shooting and fighting happen with an organization."
"__MOVIES__ What's unrealistic about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they shoot wings off of flies and get in cars while they're flipping over."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's pretty crazy."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds very cool, but is really kind of silly to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Does it have a good ending?"
"__MOVIES__ It does, on paper anyways."
"__MOVIES__ How's the ending go?"
"__MOVIES__ The organization turns out to be a fraud and corrupt, and the main people that are in it decide to destroy it."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, that's neat. I'll have to watch it sometime with you."
