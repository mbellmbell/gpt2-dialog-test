"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Michael Keaton role?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough call-- I love him in Batman, Beetlejuice, Birdman-- I'm super excited to see him in Spider-man: Homecoming."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that looks like it'll be really good-- it's cool to see him in another superhero movie."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know they were going to make a second Beetlejuice?"
"__MOVIES__ Really?!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the premise was the Deets family buys a hotel on a Hawaiian island, and Beetlejuice is supposed to scare them away."
"__MOVIES__ That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.  I'm glad they passed."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of movies that almost happened-- have you ever heard of a movie called Superman Lives?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they made a documentary about the movie falling through.  It's really interesting--  I would've seen it."
"__MOVIES__ They make the producer sound like a mad man-- making a lot of stupid suggestions."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like Superman had to fight a giant spider."
"__MOVIES__ And, how the giant spider made it into Wild Wild West, with Will Smith."
"__MOVIES__ I never saw that movie, fortunately."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  It's Will Smith's best role, if you exclude all his other roles."
"__MOVIES__ I liked him in Independence Day."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great movie-- too bad he wasn't back for the sequel."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that-- I thought they kinda said all they needed to with the first one."
"__MOVIES__ I'd watch it if it came on Netflix or something."
"__MOVIES__ There are too many good movies out there to waste your time."
"__MOVIES__ I like watching bad movies every now and then-- it makes me really appreciate the good ones."
