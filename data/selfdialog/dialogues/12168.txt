"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Dallas Cowboys can make it to the Superbowl this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have a very good chance if Dez Bryant can stay healthy along with Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's such a solid core they have right there. I was so impressed by both Ezekiel and Dak's rookie season showing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They both exceeded expectations that's why the Cowboys were so good last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know they were so mature for their age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At the start of last season I thought the Cowboys were done for after Tony Romo got hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It did look pretty bleak, but Dak came in and looked like a seasoned veteran!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their coach Jason Garrett did a fine job in easing him into the quarterback role."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They didn't put a lot of pressure on him so he had time to settle into the role, I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Having Ezekiel play so well helped out a lot! Don't forget that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sometimes I still wonder if Ezekiel is that good, or if the Dallas Cowboy's offensive line is just that dominating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's a combination of both."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true you can't be an effective running back with a poor offensive line but you also need a running back with good vision, speed, and strength to make your offensive line look good too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You also need a down field threat and a competent quarterback. Dallas had all those ingredients that's why their season last year was so successful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited to see them this year with that season of experience under their belts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we're going to see a resurrection soon of the great Jimmy Johnson Cowboys of the past in the form of the current team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that. Ezekiel would be Emmitt Smith reborn, Dez Bryant as Michael Irvin, Dak as the new Troy Aikman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's amazing is Jason Witten would still be Jason Witten!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not right. Jason Witten came into the league drafted by the Cowboys in 2003! That's after great Cowboys era!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, you're right I forgot about that. It just seems like Jason Witten has been around forever!"
