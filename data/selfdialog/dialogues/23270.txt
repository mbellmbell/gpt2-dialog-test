"__DISNEY__ Which did you think was better, Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that's a hard call. I liked them both."
"__DISNEY__ The Little Mermaid has those amazing underwater shots, and the music is terrific."
"__DISNEY__ That's true! But if we're talking animation, the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast is a classic."
"__DISNEY__ True enough. Ariel may be my favorite Disney princess, though."
"__DISNEY__ Why's that? I like Belle's love of reading, and her desire to help her father."
"__DISNEY__ I like Ariel's curiosity, and her willingness to sacrifice everything to see a new world."
"__DISNEY__ And to be with the man she loves - don't forget about that!"
"__DISNEY__ How could I? They're both great romances."
"__DISNEY__ They really revived the Disney movie genre."
