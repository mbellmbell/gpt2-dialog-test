"__MOVIES__ My husband and I watched 'Maleficent' last night."
"__MOVIES__ I have been wanting to see that movie, where did you go to see it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was on the television. My husband loves Angelina Jolie and all of her movies."
"__MOVIES__ Was it any good? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes it was so good. I don't know who did her make-up but it was great."
"__MOVIES__ In the previews for the movie she looked like she had the best cheek bones."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and she had these horns on her head and they looked so real."
"__MOVIES__ She is one woman that always looks so beautiful even with horns."
"__MOVIES__ She made you just fall in love with her character."
"__MOVIES__ Really, I thought she played some sort of evil witch."
"__MOVIES__ Well, as a young woman she had a pure heart, and when an invading army threatens her land she rises to protect it."
"__MOVIES__ Did she have wings in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ The king had cut off her wings and that is when her life took a turn for the worst."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the story was based off of Sleeping Beauty."
"__MOVIES__ Well it was, it just shows the story about Maleficent and how she feel in love with Princess Aurora."
"__MOVIES__ Who played Princess Aurora?"
"__MOVIES__ Elle Fanning played her but Angelina's daughter had a short role and played her as a little girl."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, how sweet. Does she look live Angelina?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think she looks more like Brad but she did a really good job."
"__MOVIES__ Well it sounds like you really liked the movie."
