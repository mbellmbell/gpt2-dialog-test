"__ROCK__ So, any bands you looking to see this Summer?"
"__ROCK__ I don't know man, but I'm really dying to see Metallica. I heard they're gonna be in concert in Orlando."
"__ROCK__ Really man? What date are they going to play?"
"__ROCK__ July 5th, I was thinking about ordering tickets on Stubhub."
"__ROCK__ Dude, I am so down to go, but I don't have money for a ticket."
"__ROCK__ That's alright man, I can buy you a ticket when I order mine, just pay me back when you get paid."
"__ROCK__ For real man? You're the best, this show is going to be awesome!"
"__ROCK__ Hell yeah man, I can't wait to see them perform Master of Puppets live."
"__ROCK__ Dude, I hope they play Ride the Lightning. That's my favorite song."
"__ROCK__ Another great song too man, I am so hyped for this!"
