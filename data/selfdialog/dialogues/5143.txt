"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hey what do you think about the Fast and the Furious movies? Do you like them?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes I do! I LOVE them!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you have any particular ones you love? And Why?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I love the Tokyo drift one! It actually has a different setting. I won't say exotic, but seeing them drifting and whatnot on Tokyo streets is very interesting."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I personally do not like it. The plot is kind of weak."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well okay, which one do you like the most then?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I love Furious 7! Paul Walker was partially still in it!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why do you like it better than the others?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Call me bias, I think it is because it is the last movie Paul Walker was in prior to his accident."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I understand. He was a good actor."
