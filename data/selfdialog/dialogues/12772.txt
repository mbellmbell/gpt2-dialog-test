"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's a classic Niners shirt!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure is. I'm a second generation fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got to see a few games in 95, nothing like it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you got to see Deion Sanders fly around the field?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was unbelievable! I bought a shirt there that said 'Deion does Dallas'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw those shirts. Our family has had season tickets forever. How about Jerry Rice?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I swear he was like an acrobat and ballet dancer on that field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was also an Olympic sprinter and World Series outfielder too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My friend's uncle went on a cruise and we got to use his season's tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it was the best show in town, with the best audience anywhere before they moved the stadium to yuppieville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, what a tragedy. Have you been to the new stadium?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I refuse to go. A friend of mine hosts a great tailgate party on a lake every Sunday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The home television situation has come a long way lately. Better screens and more access to games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I get the NFL package on direct TV, what about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same although I would like to see some healthy competion. I don't like them as a cable provider."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right? I would wager that more than half of their business is made up of football fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I assume you saw that game where Steve Young threw the ball and then caught it himself?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was sweet.  It's a shame that he played through so much injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The live game experience is just not what it used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will travel to see an out of town game now before a home game. The fans were betrayed here."
