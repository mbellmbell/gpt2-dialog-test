"__BASEBALL__ Yo you want to go see that Auburn Baseball game?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nah not really."
"__BASEBALL__ Why not?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't like baseball"
"__BASEBALL__ Dude, you obviously didn't see the last game."
"__BASEBALL__ What happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ Ok so the auburn pitcher, top of the 9th, had 2 outs, 2 strikes and 2 balls right"
"__BASEBALL__ Right."
"__BASEBALL__ And he decided to call a time out."
"__BASEBALL__ You can do that in baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Apparently."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok continue"
"__BASEBALL__ So he talked to the coach and decided to do something nuts"
"__BASEBALL__ What happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ He swapped with the catcher and he became the catcher."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok then what?"
"__BASEBALL__ The the catcher pitched it, and actually threw a strike and struck the dude out!"
"__BASEBALL__ No freakin way, how?"
"__BASEBALL__ The guy took off his mask and it was Tim Hudson!"
"__BASEBALL__ Bruh. No freakin way! Ok I gotta go see them play now."
