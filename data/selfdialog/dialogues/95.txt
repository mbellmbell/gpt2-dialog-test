"__MUSIC__ Hello.  How do you like the music of Justin Bieber?"

"__MUSIC__ I felt like he reallly didn't even deserve to be famous as he was only on Youtube."
"__MUSIC__ That's true.  Lots of people nowadays get famous that way."
"__MUSIC__ True.  But over the years, his music has gotten better."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  At first just my kids liked him."
"__MUSIC__ I can see why they would like him.  I think now he appeals to more adults."
"__MUSIC__ I really like him now.  I guess his voice has changed."
