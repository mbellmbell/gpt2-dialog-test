"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Know what I think is hilarious?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kids ruining dinners at fancy restaurants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides that. Think NFL and big money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I give up. This is going nowhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guaranteed contracts and signing bonuses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, let me be more specific: when a team gives a new player $50 million contract with a $10 million signing bonus, then to have them be a du."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ New players? Do you mean rookies or free agents."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rookies."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why are you rooting against them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not, really. I'm rooting against the system."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's absolutely ridiculous to give a player who's only succeeded against 18-22 year olds a massive contract to play against  seasoned veterans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, bigger and stronger, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More-so wiser than anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they've seen it all, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. So, the system needs to change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you're now rooting for the team to fail, which hurts the city it's in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but it's just sports. Cities get alone fine without them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably true. Hundreds of cities don't have sports and they're fine."
