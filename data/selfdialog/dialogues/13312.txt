"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hello, what's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Browns, how about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, I'm a Steelers fan! Do you think the Browns will be any better this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, I have a feeling Jabrill Peppers will be real good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Browns defense is looking better, how about the Steelers offense though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Leveon Bell is the best RB in the league, do you agree?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is between him and David Johnson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ David Johnson is definitely second best in my opinion. What about best WR?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say Julio Jones and then Antonio Brown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on man, AB is definitely #1!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As a Browns fan I can't admit that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha too much pride, huh? Who is going to the SB this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots and Seahawks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be an awesome rematch, I hate the patriots though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have to respect their skill, though. Super talented team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is very true, they always knock the Steelers out so I hate them!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha well I hate the Steelers so we can call it even!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe the Browns won't lose by 20 to the Steelers this year pal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very funny! This is the Browns year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see about that!"
