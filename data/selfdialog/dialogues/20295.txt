"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest transformers movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The last knight? no I haven't seen it."
"__MOVIES__ It was a really good movie I really enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Does it compare with the other transformers movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually thought it was better than the previous one. I only have one complaint."
"__MOVIES__ What's your complaint?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought that it was way too long. It lasted a solid three hours."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow that's a really long movie."
"__MOVIES__ Other than that, I thought the graphics were amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Did you watch it in 3D?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did! It was so much cooler but it gave me a bit of a headache."
"__MOVIES__ 3D movies always tend to do that to a person."
"__MOVIES__ It's the price you pay for an awesome movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think I might go and check out the movie this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ I think you totally should, all of the actors were great."
"__MOVIES__ I bet !"
"__MOVIES__ The cars become more detailed and more realistic each time."
"__MOVIES__ I'm always so jealous of the cars in the transformers movies."
"__MOVIES__ When I got out of the theater I thought all the cars were going to transform."
"__MOVIES__ I've felt that way before too."
