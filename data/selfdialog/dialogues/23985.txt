"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen Logan yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I have and I loved it. I loved seeing him with his daughter."
"__SUPERHERO__ I love any movie Hugh Jackman is in but Wolverine is by far my favorite character."
"__SUPERHERO__ The only thing that confuses me is I thought Professor X died in The Last Stand."
"__SUPERHERO__ He did, and that confused a lot of people. Their storylines confuse me."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I'm a big fan of the Marvel Universe and that confused even me."
"__SUPERHERO__ I wish more X-Men characters would have made an appearance in the movie though."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree but it probably would have taken Wolverine out of the spotlight."
"__SUPERHERO__ You might be right. I was sad when he died. Even though someone spoiled it for me before I even saw the movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's terrible, so it wasn't even a surprise for you. I can't stand spoilers."
