"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One major thing we have in common is our love for the NFL. Would you agree?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh absolutely. I love football in general, but of course the NFL is where it's at."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Refresh me, if you would. Who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am from Cleveland, so of course, I love my Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah, hey, I respect that. I am a Denver fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos are a great team. I am sure you were a very happy guy last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, absolutely. I was at the edge of my seat for that entire game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was just such a great way for Manning to go out, also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I thought. Do you think he would've gone another year if they hadn't won?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is quite possible. He was very determined to get that last ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also really respect that he retired quietly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was really respectable of him. Payton did not want to take anything away from the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure didn't. He is simply an pro."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he could go on to be a commentator?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't rule that out, no. I could see him perhaps on Sports Center."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he were to do it, I don't think it would be anytime soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No? Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because I think he would want to enjoy retirement for the time being."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good point. That being said, he was such an awesome quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. I think he will go down as one the greatest!"
