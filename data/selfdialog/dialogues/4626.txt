"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like many different genres, but hard rock is probably my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Who are some of your favorite bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of my all-time favorites are Queens of the Stone Age, Muse, and Nirvana."
"__MUSIC__ If you like them, I think you'd really like Royal Blood."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I haven't heard of them. What are they like?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a newer hard rock two-piece from the UK. They're very heavy, comparable to Queens of the Stone Age."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, I always love hearing new music. What should I start with from their discography?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they only have two albums out, but both are really good. I'd start with the first and then listen the new album."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, when did the new album come out?"
"__MUSIC__ Royal Blood's new album just came out this month, on June 16th. It's called 'How Did We Get So Dark?'"
"__MUSIC__ Great, I look forward to hearing it. Have you heard of Death From Above 1979?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I love that band."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right? Another great, heavy two-piece."
"__MUSIC__ I heard they're changing their name back to just Death From Above."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they're dropping the '1979' part of the name?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are. They changed it originally due a legal dispute with Death From Above Records, but it's water under the bridge now."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, cool. Death From Above definitely rolls off the tongue easier, more memorable too."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I'm so glad they're back together again."
"__MUSIC__ I know, me too! I definitely plan to see them the next time they come through town."
