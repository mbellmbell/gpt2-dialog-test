"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so ready for football to start.  Let's pretend we are doing a mock fantasy football draft.   You go first, we'll predict how the first round plays out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ David Johnson - 2,000 total yards, 25 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nice Pick - Nest would be Laveon Bell - He gets tons of yardage and will have 12 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After that, I would pick Ezekiel Elliott.  He's running behind one of the best lines in the league.  He will do even better than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would pick Antonio Brown. He's a lock for 100+ catches, 1,300 yards, and 10 touchdowns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to go with Odell Beckham Jr. next, he's finished in the top 5 in wide receiver scoring every year he's been in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Julio is a safe next pick.  Guaranteed yards and catches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After Jones, I would pick Melvin Gordon.  He's improved and is the workhorse back in San Diego."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Next, would be Lasean McCoy.  He's getting older, but I think he should get 1,500 yards and 12 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mike Evans - young star who keeps improving.  This year he tops 100 catches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ AJ Green - Very underappreciated.  If healthy, he'll be in the top 5 scoring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nice Pick.  I would take Jordy Nelson next.  He has one of the best QB's throwing to him.  He's a lock for 12 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of underrated, next would be TY Hilton.  He's been in the top 24 scoring for wide receivers every year he's been in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like it.  I'm going to take Aaron Rodgers next.  Might be early for a quarterback, but he is great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though he gets hurt a lot, It's time Rob Gronkowski goes off the board.  He gives you production like a wide receiver does.  besides, it's fun to say Gronk!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Jordan Howard next. He's the only weapon that Chicago has.  He's a lock to get 25+ touches a week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like Leaonard Fournette for Jacksonville, tons of touches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about Devonta Freeman for Atlanta.  I think he gets at least 12 touchdowns and 1300 yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nice, who else could go next?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady, Jay Ajayi, Michael Thomas, Dez Bryant, Drew Brees.  There's so many great players, it's hard to decide."
