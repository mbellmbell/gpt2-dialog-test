"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, can we talk about how bad the Burrow burning scene was in Half-Blood Prince?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I mean, I get what they were going for, they wanted to add something darker to offset all the wacky forced high school romance, right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly, I think they could've done that better if they, you know, actually did stuff from the books. Just take Hannah out of class one day because her mother died, that actress had done a couple of Harry Potter movies, that would've been fine!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it's a part of movie-language's whole 'Show, don't tell' thing."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But then why have Bellatrix and Fenrir, a known murderer and a known cannibal, show up if they weren't going to murder and/or eat anyone?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's a good point, they only sent out Stunning Charms, didn't they?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe, I couldn't tell. All spells look the same in the movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And when they burned down the Burrow, it was back and fine again in the next movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Because they established earlier that there's a spell that can fix things earlier in Half-Blood Prince, so there was no reason to worry in the first place."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wow, you're right, that actually accomplished nothing."
