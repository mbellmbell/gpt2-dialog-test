"__MOVIES__ When you've just started dating someone, picking a movie is easy."
"__MOVIES__ Right, you both want a romantic comedy, a rom-com. One that's not too gross or explicit."
"__MOVIES__ You've probably both checked out the selection, and might even have settled on the same one."
"__MOVIES__ You both want one that sounds truly funny, in case the date itself is a dud."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. And it's a good sign if you laugh at the same things."
"__MOVIES__ And it's a bad sign if he insists on a dreary war movie, or something pornographic, or a kid's movie."
"__MOVIES__ Or if she does."
"__MOVIES__ True. It's also bad if you're sharing snacks and one of you takes most of it."
"__MOVIES__ I never do that. Hardly ever."
"__MOVIES__ But if the relationship seems to be progressing, choosing movies gets harder."
"__MOVIES__ Right. What if only one of you likes art?"
"__MOVIES__ Or the two of you have radically different ideas of what art is. Bad."
"__MOVIES__ Right--I hate all those made from comic book movies. Zak loves them."
"__MOVIES__ Let him go without you, that's all. I hate anything with Tom Cruise--it's a prejudice, I know."
"__MOVIES__ It is. I think he's adorable."
"__MOVIES__ And Ron likes his movies too. How perfect for you."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he talks all through them. People turn around and shush him!"
"__MOVIES__ How awful. And how distracting!"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. If he'd only done it on our first date. But I'm hooked on him now."
"__MOVIES__ Well, shush him yourself, silly girl."
