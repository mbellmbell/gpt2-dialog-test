"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hi! Are you an NFL fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan. What team do you support?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always liked the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is a better quarterback, Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd have to say Rodgers. If you look at his stats, he blows Brady out of the water."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As a Pats fan, I'd have to disagree and say Brady. Stats aren't everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If stats aren't important, why do you think Brady is better then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has had more success as a quarterback, and obviously has the leadership skills to lead a team to the super bowl multiple times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, football is a team sport. The Packers have struggled because of their lack of a good defence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady also has more experience, and has a clutch factor that is rarely seen elsewhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd have to argue that Rodgers has the same, if not better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, I did see some of the miracle games last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That said, I would still favor your team over mine for this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well until Brady retires, he has a better overall team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably true, considering what you said about your defence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he'll age out soon though, he's getting really old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as he doesn't retire before we see a Packers and Patriots super bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, that would be one to go down for the ages."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And it would be a perfect ending to Brady's career."
