"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think Rap and Hip-Hop today is the same as it used to be?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No way.  Gone are the days of EPMD.  Nas is still out there, not making music so much but still on point."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know.  I loved EPMD.  Strictly Business and You Gots to Chill were my joints!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but what about Public Enemy?  Remember the LP Fear of A Black Planet?  Now that was dope!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yeah, they were on point too."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you remember the song, Fight The Power?  And what about Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Fight The Power was a national anthem.  KRS-one is trying to educate now.  Too bad rappers today are still in the dark, sheep as it were."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, they mostly rap about nonsense.  Money, drugs, and degrading women.  There are a few decent ones though..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think we'll ever get back to conscious rap and real hip-hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I doubt it.  It's a whole new ballgame now.  It's all about the money."
