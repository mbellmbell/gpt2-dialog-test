"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your favorite football team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite team is the browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would you like the browns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was born and raised a browns fan. I am a loyal, die hard fan. I am not a front runner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good fan to be. Many fans only root for a team because they are good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. I for sure am not one of those fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the browns will finally improve this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do like their coach and I think they should stick with him. I also think they did well in the draft but I think it will take a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of people think the owner doesn't know what he is doing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm one of them. He has already failed once by having to start over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he can still build a winner?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure. He talks the talk but I'm not so sure he knows what he is doing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's his biggest flaw?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's too involved. He needs to leave things up to the pros and stay out of the details."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he is better than Randy Lerner?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not really sure. Randy lerner at least did everything he could to get the right people involved."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why didn't he succeed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. Sometimes I think this team is cursed. I thought for sure they had something going when they got Holmgren as a GM."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody will ever dispute how difilcult it is to be a browns fan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is for sure."
