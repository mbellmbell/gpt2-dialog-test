"__MOVIES__ Do you Like Judd Apatow movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! I love Knocked Up. One of the best comedies ever."
"__MOVIES__ I agree! Did you see This Is 40?"
"__MOVIES__ No, is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you should see it. It's totally on point if you have kids."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Trainwreck -- wasn't that one of his too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was good! Amy Schumer was great in it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know Judd Apatow was a writer for old Jim Carrey movies, like The Cable Guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I assumed The 40-Year-Old Virgin was his first movie."
"__MOVIES__ Nope, but that movie is also one of my favorites!"
"__MOVIES__ Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan have a really good bromance going in it, just like Knocked Up."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Steve Carrell is so good. Did you see him in Little Miss Sunshine?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what was that about?"
"__MOVIES__ He's like a suicidal uncle who goes on this journey for his niece's beauty pageant. It's pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds kind of crazy!"
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty good, but not as good as Judd's movies though. Did you like Pineapple Express?"
"__MOVIES__ No, actually. I thought it was kind of terrible, and I felt bad for Rosie Perez."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Because, she was so good in Fearless and White Men Can't Jump. She was terrible in Pineapple Express."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but she wasn't the main character. James Franco was funny in it!"
