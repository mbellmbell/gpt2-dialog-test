"__MUSIC__ I think Tupac is the best rapper of all time."

"__MUSIC__ Great to find someone who agrees!"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think someone can successfully argue with that fact."
"__MUSIC__ People try. Someone said Future is better than Tupac."
"__MUSIC__ What? in what sense?"
"__MUSIC__ That Future has better lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ That could be true if the listener is an eighteen year old."
"__MUSIC__ Tupac's lyrics are obviously superior to most rapper's, but it will take a discerning listener."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. His words in Changes are deep."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder how much more he'd have done had he been alive today."
"__MUSIC__ The hip hop scene has changed a lot. Do you think he'd still be relevant?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Look at Snoop Dog and Nas."
"__MUSIC__ And Eminem- Who was  mentored somewhat by him."
"__MUSIC__ Eminen! I think he sits on the throne in Tupac's absence."
"__MUSIC__ Certainly. Can't think of a more fitting title that rap god"
