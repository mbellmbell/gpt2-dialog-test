"__MOVIES__ Have you been to the movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Not for a few months. It is getting so expensive to watch in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ I know! I'd rather just wait until I can get them on Netflix or on demand for a few dollars."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. My last one was La La Land, but it was $5 movie night."
"__MOVIES__ How was that? It really cleaned up at the Oscars."
"__MOVIES__ It was great. It kind of started out a little corny, but once it went on I really liked it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is interesting that they are bringing back more traditional musicals."
"__MOVIES__ It seems to be working."
"__MOVIES__ Althought Ryan Gossling and Emma Stone are no Fred and Ginger."
"__MOVIES__ No, definitely not. But they were pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I just can't see them in that type of musical role."
"__MOVIES__ I liked them fine, but I probably wouldn't have minded someone else."
"__MOVIES__ Could they actually sing?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure it was highly autotuned for the movie, but they were okay."
"__MOVIES__ They need someone like Mandy Moore! She has such a great voice and was amazing in A Walk to Remember."
"__MOVIES__ I lover her too, but I'm not sure if she would have been right for the La La Land part."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ She's a little too serious and conventional. The role seemed to need something more quirky."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. I guess it was probably fun to bring Ryan and Emma back togther for another movie."
"__MOVIES__ They definitely have an undeniable chemistry."
