"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi.  It's been a while."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yea, what have you been up to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not too much.  I just watched 'Star Trek' for the first time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Which 'Star Trek' movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I watched the one by J.J. Abrams."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The reboot?  I really liked that one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You're a huge Star Trek fan right?  You've seen all the other movies and shows?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I've seen them all.  The first rebooted one was my favorite."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I enjoyed it.  Chris Pine is a fantastic Captain Kirk."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I agree.  He played off of Zachary Quinto's Spock, very well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They are great together.  The rest of the cast was perfect for their roles too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ John Cho as Sulu is my favorite.  Can't believe he's the same actor from the 'Harold and Kumar' movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you think I'd enjoy the other two?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think so.  'Star Trek Into The Darkness' had Benedict Cumberbatch play the villain."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He's one of my favorite actors, so I'm pretty excited now.  How about 'Beyond?'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ 'Beyond' wasn't as well-balanced as the second one.  But this time, the villain is Idris Elba's character."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He's another actor I really like!  They're doing a great job with casting."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think the Star Trek universe has so many fans that every element has to be thought out carefully."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Want to watch the other two with me?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes I would.  I never get tired of those movies!"
