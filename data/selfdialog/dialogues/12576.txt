"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How exciting will the Panthers be this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It depends. How good is DA?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ DA? Who is DA?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does he matter?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does he matter? He's Cam's backup, his support system. Without him the whole thing goes down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does he really matter that much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He threw that interception against the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I remember that now. That game wasn't close though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was like 44 to 8, yes, though that was the first play of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How is Tolbert doing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's doing well. It's nice to see him playing again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is kind of large, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that's accurate. He weighs 243 pounds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if that's large. Cam Newton weighs 245."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're that close? I wouldn't have guessed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. He just is taller."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I would say so. He's faster too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be an interesting race."
