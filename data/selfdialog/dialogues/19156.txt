"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite director of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to go with David Fincher."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Over Scorcese, or Spielberg, or anyone on that level?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Fincher to me has turned out consistently outstanding work that pushes the envelope in a way that Spielberg doesn't really do."
"__MOVIES__ I like a lot of his movies, but I don't think there's a movie on the level of Taxi Driver, or Goodfellas."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe not Taxi Driver - I agree that it's one of the greatest movies ever. But Fincher has made some gems."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Fight Club, Zodiac, Seven, the Social Network. The list goes on."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Seven was kind of cheesey and exploitive at times."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see it when it first came out, or only years afterward?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably years afterward. I was kind of young when it first came out."
"__MOVIES__ Then what I'd say is that you probably don't realize that Seven seems cheesey and cliched because for years afterward, there were like 3 movies a year made who were ripping off Seven."
"__MOVIES__ What does that matter?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, when you've seen the same plot and themes over and over, they start to seem cliched. But Seven was the original."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you mean. And Fight Club WAS a great movie. I never got into Zodiac?"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I think it's Fincher's best movie."
"__MOVIES__ It just seemed kind of slow paced, and in the end there wasn't really a resolution."
"__MOVIES__ It was telling a story that doesn't have a resolution, though!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll maybe give it another shot. But I'm going with Martin Scorcese for best director of all time!"
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough. He's top 3 for me, no question."
