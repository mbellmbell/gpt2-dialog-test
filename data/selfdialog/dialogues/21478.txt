"__DISNEY__ Wasn't there going to be a Lion King sequel?"
"__DISNEY__ There were some sequels."
"__DISNEY__ That's funny, I never saw them in the theater."
"__DISNEY__ They were released straight to DVD."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I see.  Are they worth watching?"
"__DISNEY__ Not really.  They are just kind of standalone movies."
"__DISNEY__ Is Scar in them?"
"__DISNEY__ No, he died in the original.  Remember, the hyenas did him in?"
"__DISNEY__ I do now.  Sad, really, he was a great villain."
"__DISNEY__ He was a murderer.  He deserved what he got."
