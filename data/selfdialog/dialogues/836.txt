"__MUSIC__ I've been trying to track down older Beatles albums. Which ones would you recommend me tracking down first?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorites been Abbey Road but Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is awesome too."
"__MUSIC__ I did grab Abbey Road already. I look for the other."
"__MUSIC__ Actually if you're getting into the Beatles now, you might as well get the discography sets. They have most of the top albums."
"__MUSIC__ I actually want the full separate albums because I enjoy the band's artwork for the covers and booklets."
"__MUSIC__ I see, if you're trying to be have a comprehensive set that is definitely a must."
"__MUSIC__ I started going back and collecting true classics recently. I recently finished my Pink Floyd collection."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's great! I didn't know you were a Floyd fan. What's your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ Comfortably Numb! It's so mesmerizing and relaxing but yet speaks a lot to you."
"__MUSIC__ That's a great song. The Dark Side of The Moon Album is probably their best, at least my personal favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I loved that one and the Wall a lot. It gets so much play from me."
"__MUSIC__ What other bands have you started collecting?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm also in the process of collecting the Led Zeppelin albums!"
"__MUSIC__ How far have you gotten along with the collection of Led Zeppelin albums?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm making good progress, but I can't find Presence!"
"__MUSIC__ I think I have that album lying around the house somewhere. I know back in the days I had doubles of all their albums. If I find it I can give it to you."
"__MUSIC__ That would be great! Thanks a lot."
"__MUSIC__ No worries at all. I appreciate sharing good music with someone who appreciates it!"
"__MUSIC__ It's been a fun adventure collecting these albums. I'm going to move into the 80's next!"
"__MUSIC__ That'll be fun, not as iconic as the 70's, I would go back to the 60's but the 80's have a lot of one hit wonders!"
