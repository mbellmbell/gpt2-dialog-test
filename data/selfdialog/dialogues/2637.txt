"__MUSIC__ Wanna play a game?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, sure. What?"
"__MUSIC__ You know that thing that's going around Facebook: I'll tell 10 concerts I've been to, and you pick the fake!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, sounds fun!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I've seen live Backstreet Boys, Sisqo, Hanson, Nsync, Miley Cyrus, LFO, Ariana Grande, Justin Beiber, Pink, Katy Perry."
"__MUSIC__ Um, that's tough- they're all pop!"
"__MUSIC__ I know. I have very particular music taste I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I'm gonna guess Backstreet Boys."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you guess that?"
"__MUSIC__ Just because most people weren't fans of them AND Nsync back in the day, so I figured it had to be one of them."
"__MUSIC__ Close, but wrong!"
"__MUSIC__ Really, who was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Nsync! I love Backstreet Boys but hated them!"
"__MUSIC__ Ugh, I really almost hit the nail on the head."
"__MUSIC__ No your turn!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok I've seen Nicki Minaj, Miley Cyrus, No Doubt, Alycia Keys, Maroon 5, Nickelback, Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Hudson and... Elvis."
"__MUSIC__ Haha! I think that one's kind of obvious!"
"__MUSIC__ No! What do you mean!?!?"
"__MUSIC__ Elvis died before we were born."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, my bad... I couldn't think of another musician!"
