"__MUSIC__ So, we've got most of the details settled, but what kind of music should our new burger shop play?"
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music makes customers want to eat more?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm less worried about that and more about making customers relaxed."
"__MUSIC__ So you want something downtempo then?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. Or at least that isn't intrusive."
"__MUSIC__ I'm worried we'll end up with, like, muzak covers of Beatles songs then."
"__MUSIC__ Well what would you suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking something people can really get into. Like Madonna or Nirvana."
"__MUSIC__ Nirvana? In a burger shop?"
"__MUSIC__ What's wrong with that?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like it'll be too intense. It might be distracting."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have any other ideas then?"
"__MUSIC__ What about jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ That could work. But I feel like our decor isn't classy enough for jazz to be a safe choice."
"__MUSIC__ I guess classical is out too then."
"__MUSIC__ It's gotta be."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the only suggestion I have left is that we could find a good radio station."
"__MUSIC__ I bet we could find something fitting. Maybe something contemporary?"
"__MUSIC__ So not NPR?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not."
