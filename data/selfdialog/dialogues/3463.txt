"__MUSIC__ What do you prefer, opera music or symphony music?"
"__MUSIC__ Ah, that's hard.  They overlap a lot.  But I think I prefer arias to symphonies."
"__MUSIC__ I prefer arias to symphonies as well but I do like concertos."
"__MUSIC__ I like arias because they are shorter."
"__MUSIC__ I like the vocals.  I like concertos when I am trying to read or study."
"__MUSIC__ But, it depends on the aria.  I don't like modern opera."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I recently saw Nixon in China.  I thought it was brillant."
"__MUSIC__ I have seen it too and I hated it!  I thought the music didn't have any style."
"__MUSIC__ I don't agree at all. I love modern opera, especially in English."
"__MUSIC__ Nope.  I don't want anything written after 1920 and nothing in Engish."
"__MUSIC__ What about modern classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of it is all right, like Aaron Copeland, but not too modern."
"__MUSIC__ I like the Grand Canyon Suite and the Syncopated clock."
"__MUSIC__ I like those too.  I think they are very approachable."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Porgy and Bess?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Porgy and Bess, but I have a hard time seeing it as an opera."
"__MUSIC__ I think there is a fine line between opera and musical theater."
"__MUSIC__ I would agree with that, especially when I think about Andrew Lloyd Weber."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like Le Mis and Phantom of the Opera."
"__MUSIC__ I agree."
