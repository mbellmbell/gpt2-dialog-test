"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite scene out of any Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It would have to be the fight between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker at the end of Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Mine I would have to say is where Luke Skywalker finds out Darth Vader is his father."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's classic. The shock everyone must have felt who watched it when it first came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah that's one of the best twists in history."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. It was pretty awkward that Luke and Princess Leia kissed before they found out they were brother and sister."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that was a pretty rough pill for them to swallow I would imagine."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han Solo is my favorite character. He cracks me up."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I love Harrison Ford in everything he does, but that's my favorite role of his."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also Chewy is so lovable, and I love how close his and Han Solo's relationship is."
