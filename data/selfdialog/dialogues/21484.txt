"__DISNEY__ So what was the original one with Maleficent?"
"__DISNEY__ She was the big baddie in Sleeping Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ Right. How did that one go?"
"__DISNEY__ It was sort of similar to Snow White."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, how so?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, Princess Aurora, that was her name, was cured to die but instead fell into a long sleep because of guardian angels."
"__DISNEY__ Then what happens?"
"__DISNEY__ Exactly what you think. She has to be awoken by a kiss. Prince Phillip was the prince."
"__DISNEY__ And everyone lives happily ever after?"
"__DISNEY__ Don't they always?"
