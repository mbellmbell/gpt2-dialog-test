"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, what's up?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not much, how's it going with you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Pretty much same thing, different day, working to make ends meet. I'm also trying to put up enough money to go to California this summer."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Awesome! What's in California?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, besides the obvious, the Moody Blues are touring out there this summer."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The Moody Blues? I haven't listened to their music in a while."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yep, they're still going strong. In fact, the lead singer, Justin Hayward, and the bass player, John Lodge, each did solo shows earlier this year and I got to see them both!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow, that's great! How were the shows?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well Justin's was acoustic and pretty laid back, but it was good. John's was more electric and energetic. I loved both shows, but my husband enjoyed John's the best."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ And now the Moody Blues will be touring this summer?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, mostly the West Coast. It's the 50th anniversary of their first album, Days of Future Passed. They'll be performing every track from that album, and even playing with a symphony orchestra in some cities."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow, that sounds amazing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm sure it will be. I've talked to my husband about trying to get out to see them in California or maybe Nevada, but he's saying we can't afford it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's too bad. How much are tickets?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They're not cheap, I think they start at around a hundred dollars. And that's just a part of it. We'd probably want to fly, so there's the air fare, and then of course a hotel room for a couple of days, and meals."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. Do you think you can come up with the money somehow?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm wishful thinking. But realistically I don't see how we can pull this off, even if went alone."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Why would you want to go alone?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, my husband isn't as into the Moody Blues as I am, so he wouldn't really care if he didn't go. And I know other fans on the West Coast that I would be able to hang out, so I wouldn't really be by myself."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Gee, I hope you can figure out a way to get there! Hey, I need to run, but let's hang out soon, okay! Call me!"
