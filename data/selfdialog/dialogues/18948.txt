"__MOVIES__ Jackson is hilarious in this movie- I know he is not comedy relief, but at times it feels like it, because so much of the rest of the movie is tense."
"__MOVIES__ Jackson as comedy relief? I can't really see that. Was he just funny the way he was funny in Pulp Fiction?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I think that better describes how he was funny. There were just  more moments in this movie than in Pulp Fiction in which you just wanted to laugh- you know how Jackson loves to monologue in Tarantino films."
"__MOVIES__ So he talks a lot in this movie- that sounds kind of boring."
"__MOVIES__ A lot of Tarantino films are a bunch of talking interspersed with blood. Anyway, there is this one particular scene in which he confronts this high ranking southerner."
"__MOVIES__ Oh lord, this is going to be good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so Jackson's character is a little dubious, and he tells a tall tale or two. He slowly worms his way into a conversation with this man who plainly hated him, and at first it just looks like he is trying to find mutual ground with him."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess, the old man has a bounty on his head?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it turns out that the old man who was questing to a town not far from there was intending to see his son's grave."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god, did Jackson kill his son? Was his son a bandit or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and no, according to Jackson, the man's son was hunting black people and ran into him, so Jackson turned the tables and hunted him."
"__MOVIES__ And then a fight breaks out between him and the old man."
"__MOVIES__ No, and stop interrupting if you want to hear the story."
"__MOVIES__ Geeze, sorry. Go on."
"__MOVIES__ So Jackson marches this guy through the snow, naked and he focused on describing how brutally cold the weather is and how it's making the man's son desperate."
"__MOVIES__ Man, Jackson's character's always seem to be devoid of sympathy."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right? So he makes him march naked for two hours, and eventually the son just breaks down, gives up on living and most anything else, but he does ask for one thing."
"__MOVIES__ What did he ask for?"
"__MOVIES__ The son asked Jackson for a blanket, just a blanket because it was so cold. Jackson made him trade his dignity to get one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god, what do you mean by that? Now we definitely have to see the movie."
