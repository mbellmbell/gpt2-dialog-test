"__DISNEY__ No it's not. It was one of my favorite Disney movie. My brother saw it a million times. He wanted to be Mr. Incredible"
"__DISNEY__ I did too! It was a cool family with superpowers.  I was Elastigirl. When is it coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ It's coming out June of 2018. And it will be in 3D"
"__DISNEY__ Oh Gosh, I hope I'n not the only adult without kids watching at the theater. Because I will not miss it."
"__DISNEY__ We should make it a friends night out. I have to see it!"
"__DISNEY__ Lets do that! it will be less awkward for the other people there."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder what it will be about. I just hope they can bring the same voice cast from the original movie."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. It has to be better than the original, and knowing Disney movies, it will be."
