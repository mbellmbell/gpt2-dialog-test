"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ EJ just got picked by the Bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard they grabbed him in the first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't imagine. He probably thought he'd get at least as much as EJ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, even Brees didn't get that short of a stick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did Flacco the same way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he starts enough games, he can be top tier after this contract."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's young enough to bounce back on another team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Geno may get less now, but he's on a better team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Five years from now, Geno could easily get double what EJ makes five years from now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a shame too. EJ's talent is wasted on the Bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bills wer better off spreading that money around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think 2 seasons left for Flacco."
