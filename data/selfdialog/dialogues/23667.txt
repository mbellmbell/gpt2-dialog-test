"__DISNEY__ Do you realize that there is almost never a mother in Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean, there is a mom and dad in Inside Out?"
"__DISNEY__ True, but what in Finding Nemo, the mom dies in that movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Ok, that true and there is no mom in The Little Mermaid either."
"__DISNEY__ Yep, and in Beauty and the Beast we never see Belle's mom at all."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I don't even know if she is supposed to be dead or what."
"__DISNEY__ I think so. And there's the classics of course.  Cinderella doesn't have a mom."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah and neither does Snow White."
"__DISNEY__ And we can't forget the biggest one - Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ Well, technically Bambi had a mom for a little while during the movie."
