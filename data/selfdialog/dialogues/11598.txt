"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the first head coach to go this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean is it always Marvin Lewis?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean but I think he has the best job security"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should have been fired years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah besides him though who do you think gets fired first?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its a tough one because I think the league is trending on patience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pederson in Philly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely give him the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When do you think they would fire him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Midseason next year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats a rough time to fire a coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but they need to see what he does when Wentz has weapons"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well what happens if he does well but the defense still plays poorly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then the defensive coordinator gets fired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Pederson is off the hook?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Until they miss the playoffs, yeah"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats an easy out I believe"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really you want to stick with a head coach and franchise quarterback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess I never think they are patient enough in the NFL"
