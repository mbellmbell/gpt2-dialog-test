"__BASEBALL__ Who will win these series' over the weekend (FRI-SUN) HOU/NYY, BOS/TB, TOR/SEA ?"
"__BASEBALL__ Just the games this weekend? Houston just beat the Yankees so..."
"__BASEBALL__ Just Fri-SUN. I have a friendly wager with my brother, just wanted to see what people think."
"__BASEBALL__ Short series is really a crapshoot. Let me look at the probables at least."
"__BASEBALL__ Just your best guesses works. Don't need to go sabermetric on it lol."
"__BASEBALL__ Well I'll go with the Yankees because they play well at home at least."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and no Keuchel for Hou."
"__BASEBALL__ Boston seems easy, they're just better and also at home."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm detecting a theme here lol."
"__BASEBALL__ Well like i said, short series you scrape whatever advantage for a guess and they fit the bill."
"__BASEBALL__ Right, that's pretty much my thinking."
"__BASEBALL__ So you took NYY and Boston...I'll go with the Mariners for the other one."
"__BASEBALL__ I went with Toronto."
"__BASEBALL__ That one could probably go either way, home field aside."
"__BASEBALL__ Stroman on the hill Saturday and the homefield, I figure that's at least a chance."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't get a read on either of those teams so I'd just flip a coin lol."
"__BASEBALL__ Pretty much. I'll stick with the home theme too."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you not pick the Orioles series? You did all the other AL East teams."
"__BASEBALL__ Nah, we're both Orioles fans, of course we think we're gonna win."
"__BASEBALL__ Haha. You can hope. Bundy's throwing, so that's good."
