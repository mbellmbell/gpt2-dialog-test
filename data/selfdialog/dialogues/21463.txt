"__DISNEY__ That was from  Pochahontas,right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think that was it.  The one with the Indian and the Pilgrim"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that was like, the mid 90's"
"__DISNEY__ Who sang that song anyway?  It wasn't the movie version that made the charts, was it?"
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't it Vanessa Williams?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but those movies have had some great songs.  Like Let it Go from Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ Or most of the songs from The Little Mermaid"
