"__STAR_WARS__ Are you excited for the new Han Solo Movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's not for a while though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I just want to see him get the Falcon."
"__STAR_WARS__ And how he meets Chewy.  Best team in movie history."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, they had been together forever."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd like to see him and young Lando too.  I hope they do stuff together."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, looks like they were close at one point."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what tore them apart?  The Falcon maybe."
"__STAR_WARS__ That seems more like friendly smuggler business."
"__STAR_WARS__ We'll find out though."
