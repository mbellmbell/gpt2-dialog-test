"__STAR_WARS__ So, you remember the climax of Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Where Vader picks up the Emperor and throws him down that shaft?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  Here's something I find weird... I've heard different explanations for that big explosion of blue energy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, some of the books say it happened because the Emperor was full of Dark Side energy and all, so that when someone like that dies the energy explodes outward."
"__STAR_WARS__ Weird, don't remember that happening when Darth Maul was killed.  Or Count Dooku for that matter..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, true, that's one confusing aspect.  But you know what i always thought?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I figured the explosion because his body hit some kind of  energy reactor.   After all, the explosion is the same blue color as reactor thing down at the very bottom of the shaft."
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh, that theory makes me sense to me than the whole Dark Side thing. But, then again, the color is also the same as the Force Lightning the Emperor was torturing Luke with.."
