"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Kendrick Lamar Is probably one of the best new artists that i can respect and actually call him a rapper."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What about Drake"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Drake is not a rapper in my eyes. From what i hear he dont even write his own stuff."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So it matters to you if a rapper writes his own lyrics. People that sing dont be writing the songs but they are still cinsiderd a singer"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True but rap is diffrent your telling about your life your struggles and that dont match up if someone else is writing it"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess What about future"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ All that man talks about is getting high I like rappers that take your on a journey with there words that fool act taking nobody nowhere"
