"__MOVIES__ You like Hitchcock?"
"__MOVIES__ That PSYCHO? He's for THE BIRDS -- snooping around, peering into a neighbor''s REAR WINDOW."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, don't get in a FRENZY."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, you've got THE WRONG MAN! I'm not agitated -- it's just that his movies give me VERTIGO"
"__MOVIES__ I guess one could say he is NOTORIOUS."
"__MOVIES__ What's that old saying, give a man enough ROPE..."
"__MOVIES__ Ah yes -- ROPE -- the master's most underrated movie."
"__MOVIES__ It WAS a little weird, those two guys hiding the murdered corpse at a family dinner party."
"__MOVIES__ The lead, John Dall, was scary good -- maybe TOO good, because his career never took off, and not for lack of talent."
"__MOVIES__ And Jimmy Stewart playing an existential philosophy professor with a Nietzschean fixation."
"__MOVIES__ It was a murder mystery where the murder took place at in the first few minutes of the film."
"__MOVIES__ Right, very unconventional, especially in context of its 1948 release."
"__MOVIES__ There was no question the weapon, who did it, or where the body was."
"__MOVIES__ I must say, I enjoyed how Hitchcock would ratchet up the suspense."
"__MOVIES__ The philosophy angle might have been a little weak"
"__MOVIES__ I never bought Stewart's 180 degree come-to-Jesus moment in the end."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, way too tidy, but the Hays Code intervened."
"__MOVIES__ That's what it felt like."
"__MOVIES__ Which is why I love the pre-code era from 1930 to 1934."
"__MOVIES__ Some real gems -- but some pretty gratuitously tawdry junk, too."
