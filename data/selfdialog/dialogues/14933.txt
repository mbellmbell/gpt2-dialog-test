"__ACTION__ Were you a big fan of The Matrix"
"__ACTION__ I liked the first one, but the other ones were pretty bad"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, the first one was really new and fresh"
"__ACTION__ Had a lot of cool special effects"
"__ACTION__ Not sure if I ever followed the actual story line"
"__ACTION__ Right, when you strip out all the action and effects, the story line is pretty lame"
"__ACTION__ Something about red and blue pills"
"__ACTION__ Well there's that and how the world isn't what it seems"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, pretty weird"
"__ACTION__ Too sci fi for my taste"
