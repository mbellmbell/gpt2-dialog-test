"__BASEBALL__ Did you hear about the baseball umpire getting cheered in Philadelphia?"
"__BASEBALL__ What? Baseball umpires never get cheered. No matter what they do, they always make somebody mad!"
"__BASEBALL__ Not this time! He became the hero of the game!"
"__BASEBALL__ What happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ This fan was yelling rude remarks at the Giants. I mean, really rude remarks, obscene remarks."
"__BASEBALL__ I hate it what some jerk makes you embarrassed that you brought your kid to the game!"
"__BASEBALL__ Apparently this umpire hates it too."
"__BASEBALL__ What did he do?"
"__BASEBALL__ He had the fan ejected from the game!"
"__BASEBALL__ Wait, he had a fan ejected? I didn't even know they could do that!"
"__BASEBALL__ Well he did. Security escorted the loud-mouthed jerk out."
"__BASEBALL__ That's awesome."
"__BASEBALL__ The whole crowd loved it. Everybody cheered on the umpire!"
"__BASEBALL__ That has got to be a first in baseball!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know, usually umpires are pretty much despised."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope he gets admitted to the umpire hall of fame."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm pretty sure there isn't an umpire hall of fame."
"__BASEBALL__ Well there should be one, just dedicated to this one guy."
"__BASEBALL__ What if it started a trend of people actually appreciating umpires and cheering them on for good call?"
"__BASEBALL__ That would be just crazy."
