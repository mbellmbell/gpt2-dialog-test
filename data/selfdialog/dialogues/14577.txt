"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, what's up?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey buddy!  How have you been?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Pretty good.  I just got out of work."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Same.  It's been a long week."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Tell me about it.  Have any plans?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not really.  I was going to wind down with a movie and a few beers."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I was going to do the same."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You should swing by."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Any movie suggestions?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I was thinking of rewatching the 'Lord of the Rings' movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That sounds great.  It's one of my favorite movie trilogies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was so far ahead of its time.  What was your favorite?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I loved the first one since it introduced us to the world of Middle-Earth.  It also had the best balance of all the elements; adventure, action, drama."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I really liked the first one; especially the Cave troll scene.  That said, I am a big fan of the action of 'Two Towers.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Helm's Deep was such a great scene.  Theoden's speech was an instant classic."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It gives me chills every time.  'Lord of the Rings' is also one of the few movie franchises that stay true to the original source material."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yea, they did justice to Tolkien's works."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ True masterpieces."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, we should start soon if we want to get all the way through to 'Return of the King.'  Especially considering how long the last one is."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sounds good.  See you soon."
