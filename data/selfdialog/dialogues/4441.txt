"__MUSIC__ I really like meta-songs."
"__MUSIC__ Meta songs? You mean songs about songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Something like that. Or songs about being a recording artist or whatever."
"__MUSIC__ Like Nickelback's 'Rockstar'?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess, maybe. Though, that's more a song about people aspiring to be a rock star than what it is to live that life."
"__MUSIC__ Are there really a lot of examples of what you're talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, for example, let's take Reel Big Fish. You're gonna get some back story here."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I'm listening."
"__MUSIC__ They road in on that late '90s ska wave, and had a big hit with 'Sell Out', which itself was a meta-song about, of course, selling out."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, okay, so what next?"
"__MUSIC__ That was it. After that one hit, then never hit it big again, and have had middling success ever since."
"__MUSIC__ That seems to happen to a lot of bands.Like with Chumbawamba and their song 'Tubthumping' which happened around the same time."
"__MUSIC__ Right, the story isn't over. See, years later they released another song called 'One Hit Wonderful'."
"__MUSIC__ Oh boy, I see where this is going."
"__MUSIC__ Naturally, the song is about being a one hit wonder, and the audiences no longer caring about you when the limelight ends."
"__MUSIC__ I can see how that would be a bit meta. Probably very true to life for a lot of people in the industry."
"__MUSIC__ The song even uses a sample of 'Sell Out' in it, at the beginning and end as someone is flipping through radio stations."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind funny, like a bookend type thing. Like, they sold out, and then after everyone forgot, it was all for nothing."
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't for nothing, they've released a lot of songs since then. Though, if they made a song like that again it would be ironic since besides lead singer Aaron Barrett none of the original band members remain."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right, as long as there are people enjoying their music it wasn't for nothing. I hope they feel that way."
