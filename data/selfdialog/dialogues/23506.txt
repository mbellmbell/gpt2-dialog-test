"__DISNEY__ What are your favorite Disney characters?"
"__DISNEY__ Any parameters, or can I choose any at all?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm... How about favorite from the movies in the last 10 years."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, how many can I choose?"
"__DISNEY__ Five"
"__DISNEY__ That's it?? That's so hard!!"
"__DISNEY__ I know, that's what makes it fun!"
"__DISNEY__ Ok, so I'll go with... Baymax, Moana, Thor, Captain America and Anna from Frozen"
"__DISNEY__ Thor and Captain America are Marvel, not Disney!"
"__DISNEY__ Marvel is owned by Disney so they count!!"
