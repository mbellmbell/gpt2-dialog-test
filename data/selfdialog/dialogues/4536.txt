"__MUSIC__ Do you like any of this down-south rap music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I like east-coast rappers."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Future?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of his songs are okay. I like old school rap, like Nas and Jay z."
"__MUSIC__ You like Ether? When Nas dissed Jay?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. Jay had no choice but to join forces with Nas after that one."
"__MUSIC__ But Jay got way more music than Nas. I like that whole Reasonable Doubt album."
"__MUSIC__ I like the album with Can't Knock The Hustle on it."
"__MUSIC__ I forgot which album that was."
"__MUSIC__ Me too."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like west coast? Do you like Too Short?"
"__MUSIC__ The only Too Short I like is Pimps and Hoes, the song he did with Biggie and Jay Z."
"__MUSIC__ That was from Life After Death. Those whole two cd's were bumpin'."
"__MUSIC__ I like Nasty and Story to Tell. Biggie was absolutely a story teller."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he was nice with his. I like his first cd though."
"__MUSIC__ The one with Warning on there?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I like Warning, Respect, and I like Gimme The Loot."
"__MUSIC__ Gimme The Loot was off the chain. He had dudes going out doing stickups behind that song."
"__MUSIC__ Fool you crazy. Ain't no music have nobody out doing stickups."
"__MUSIC__ You're crazy. Remember Onyx with Throw Your Gunz? Plenty of young bulls would listen to that before they went out on route."
