"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new Disney movie 'Moana'?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I loved it, what did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ It was good. I liked the tropical setting and thought the characters were pretty interesting."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, me too. I really liked those little coconut guys, what were they called again?"
"__DISNEY__ Kakamoras!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that's it. They were too cute, and I loved that song they sang."
"__DISNEY__ The movie was full of great songs. Disney movies usually are though."
"__DISNEY__ Ain't that the truth. Every time I go and see a new Disney movie, I end up humming the songs for days!"
"__DISNEY__ I hope they make a sequel to 'Moana,' I thought there was more story to tell."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that would be great!"
