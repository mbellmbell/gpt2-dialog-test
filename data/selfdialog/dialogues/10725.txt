"__FASHION__ Lauren Conrad just released a new line of clothes."
"__FASHION__ Saw that, I wonder if she will dip her toes into maternity clothes now that she is pregnant?"
"__FASHION__ I bet she will. She seems really down to earth and her designs reflect that."
"__FASHION__ What's the name of her line again?"
"__FASHION__ I think it's just LC Lauren Conrad"
"__FASHION__ I just love the soft, flowing dresses she has out. I saw one at Kohls."
"__FASHION__ Me too! Did you happen to see how much it was?"
"__FASHION__ It was more than $100 unfortunately."
"__FASHION__ Really? Most of her designs are pretty reasonable from what I've seen."
"__FASHION__ I think her fashion sense is no chic and beautiful"
"__FASHION__ I agree! And very feminine."
"__FASHION__ Her jewelry is also really attractive. Very simple and elegant."
"__FASHION__ Have you seen some of her rings? They are to die for!"
"__FASHION__ They are gorgeous but of course beyond my budget!"
"__FASHION__ I did see a few tree-themed necklaces that were reasonable."
"__FASHION__ Oh? That sounds beautiful! Her bracelets are great, too."
"__FASHION__ Did you ever watch Lauren on 'The Hills?'"
"__FASHION__ All the time. Her fashion sense has evolved since then. But she has always been so chic."
"__FASHION__ I agree. I love how her line is designed for a simple girl."
"__FASHION__ Even though she has money! Love it!"
