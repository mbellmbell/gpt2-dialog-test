"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new John Wick?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the Chapter 2 sequel?? I have!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that's it! What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty great.  It definitely had more suspense than the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought they both had pretty equal amount of action."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree! The second one is much better, with more thrilling adventures."
"__MOVIES__ Ok we can agree to disagree then."
"__MOVIES__ All right I guess you're right!"
"__MOVIES__ It comes out today on Blue-Ray!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! I already pre-ordered it!"
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, did you see Kong: Skull Island?"
"__MOVIES__ I did! It was definitely a great rendition of the old one."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed that the time setting was in the 1970s."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, it was during the anti-Vietnam era so there were some references of that in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ The Blue-Ray is going to be available tomorrow!"
"__MOVIES__ Are you going to pick one up??"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely, King Kong is my hero."
"__MOVIES__ Haha I wouldn't say he's mine but he's pretty great."
"__MOVIES__ You can borrow the movie if you'd like."
"__MOVIES__ Sweet! Thanks friend."
