"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you heard Kendrick Lamar's new album?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's crazy good, Kendrick always delivers!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, it's a little bit behind his last album overall for me, but it's still better than 99% of everything else out there."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ 'DNA' is such a jam, and I like the video too."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Don Cheadle is in the video, right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So is Schoolboy Q."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'll go with 'Humble' as my favorite song on the new record."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ My favorite part is the chorus, it sounds like he's saying 'Biyombo' instead of 'Be humble'!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It would be an even more amazing track if it was actually about Bismack Biyombo."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He should do that for the next album."
