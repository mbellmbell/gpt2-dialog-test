"__MUSIC__ hi jarry,whats good?"
"__MUSIC__ not bad man, how's it going at your end?"
"__MUSIC__ am doing great as well mate"
"__MUSIC__ alright cool"
"__MUSIC__ please i and francis is having a bit of an argument here so wanted to ask your opinion,got some time?"
"__MUSIC__ sure, what's it?"
"__MUSIC__ so can you classify rnb music as soul music?"
"__MUSIC__ well in my opinion i would say no, those two are two different genre of music."
"__MUSIC__ great,so i thought but francis thinks otherwise"
"__MUSIC__ that they are same ?"
"__MUSIC__ yes"
"__MUSIC__ nah, because that's like saying beyonce does soul music and sade adun does rnb"
"__MUSIC__ exactly my point because rnd has some pop element infuse in it but soul music is pure soul music"
"__MUSIC__ same way i see although this topic can be tricky."
"__MUSIC__ i don't think say its so straight forward,i had seen sade adun on interviews say she is a soul singer and had also seen mariah carey say she does rnb music, which shows they bot different."
"__MUSIC__ hahaha you should be telling that to francis."
"__MUSIC__ i'm but he's just not buying it."
"__MUSIC__ then you have to leave him to his opinion."
"__MUSIC__ true talk,would chat you up later."
"__MUSIC__ alright mate."
