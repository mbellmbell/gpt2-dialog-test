"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have a favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. I don't watch much football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair. I tend to root for the patriots but that's because I'm from Boston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My dad's from Boston too. He roots for the giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's so wierd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. he was super happy during their superbowl faceoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can imagine! Nothing says defeat like an 18-0 season ending in a superbowl loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. although I guess the patriots got their redemption this past year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was amazing. I definitely thought it was over in the third quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually was more impressed with the game a few years back against the seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah -- the one with that weird play at the end that won it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I forget what it was exactly, but it was just such a fortuitous mistake on the seahawks part."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It definitely was an odd decision."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you looking forward to anything specific this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. I really just use games as a chance to hang out with friends on sundays over food and drink."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hah, yeah. It's definitely part of the culture."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you want to watch a game with me sometime?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great!"
