"__MOVIES__ Did you see Captain America?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was my favorite MCU movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good.  Tommy Lee Jones was pretty good in that."
"__MOVIES__ So was Chris Evans.  He's great as Cap."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  Did you know in the beginning that was him playing that part?"
"__MOVIES__ No way?!  That is amazing.  I thought it was a different actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah a lot of people did.  But they just altered his image."
"__MOVIES__ That's amazing."
"__MOVIES__ It was.  And the plot was one of the better ones too."
"__MOVIES__ The World War 2 era fighting was cool."
"__MOVIES__ That's what Cap was made for."
"__MOVIES__ And lets not forget the Red Skull."
"__MOVIES__ Hugo Weaving was awesome as the Red Skull."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they bring him back somehow in a future movie."
"__MOVIES__ I mean why not?  Cap survived."
"__MOVIES__ And the Red Skull is just like him only evil."
"__MOVIES__ And ugly."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, very ugly."
"__MOVIES__ Still, that movie was just solid all around."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, MCU is doing it right."
