"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey Bo, did you by chance record that football game from a few days ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, was it the Saints game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was indeed, them vs. the Colts I believe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got it, I am actually glad you asked me to record it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that bro?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was an excellent game, the Saints have a great squad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh definitely, I root for them every time out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is that young running back's name who is an absolute play maker?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a few, but maybe Hightower?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah Hightower is incredible!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely goes on runs when he wants to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Him and the quarterback seem to have good synergy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't disagree, you definitely did enjoy the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did, and can you remind me of the quarterback's name."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Brees, he will go down as an all time great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh surely, I remember when the Saints weren't that great but that has all changed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are definitely a formidable squad now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We see eye to eye, come through and we can watch the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You wouldn't mind watching it again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all, I'm a Saints fan now!"
