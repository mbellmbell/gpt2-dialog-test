"__MOVIES__ So, you know, it might sound crazy but I really enjoyed Batman v Superman."
"__MOVIES__ That's okay, you can like it, but a lot of people didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, critics hated it. They really went to town on it."
"__MOVIES__ I remember the freaking out people did online about it."
"__MOVIES__ They were either really happy it was badly reviewed, or really angry."
"__MOVIES__ Fan wars are the worst. Good or bad, the film was bound to upset some people."
"__MOVIES__ And that's even if it wasn't such a dark, deconstruction of superheroes."
"__MOVIES__ It really does feel like a Watchmen sequel in some ways because of that."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose it's not a surprise then that Zack Snyder directed both films."
"__MOVIES__ It shows. If nothing else, the man has a visual flair that's unique to him."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that 300 sequel they made, and he didn't direct it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah? Who did?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I don't remember, but whoever directed it tried to mimic his style, and they came close, but they didn't quite pull it off."
"__MOVIES__ That's not surprising. He makes it look easy, but making every frame look like a shot out of a comic can't be."
"__MOVIES__ Right, the way certain scenes are composited and stuff, looks straight out of a graphic novel."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I suppose if nothing else Batman v Superman might win the award for prettiest comic book movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is pretty, it really is, but it's good in other ways too."
"__MOVIES__ Most people would disagree, though, I'm indifferent to it."
"__MOVIES__ At least we can both agree that we hope Justice League turns out good, right?"
"__MOVIES__ I have low expectations, but high hopes. Fingers crossed."
