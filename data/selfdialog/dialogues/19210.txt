"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Some Like it Hot?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't.  Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It is awesome.  A classic comedy, no doubt."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ There are several stars you may know: Marilyn Monroe. Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis ring a bell?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that's a lot of star quality there."
"__MOVIES__ And the chemistry between them all is awesome."
"__MOVIES__ So, which one of the men plays Monroe's love interest?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's kind of tricky.  You see, the men are dressed as women for most of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What?  Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ They witness a murder in Chicago, so they dress as female musicians to try and escape fro the mob."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like it has the potential to go wrong in several ways, in a funny way, of course."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed it does.  Curtis's character falls for Monroe, while Lemmon's character is busy fighting off the advances of a rich womanizer."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man; isn't it an older movie? It sounds a little scandalous."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's older, but it's very modern."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like something I'd be interested in watching."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me, you won't be disappointed if you do."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure I won't; I love old movies like that.  They're relatively clean, but they are still clean and entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ After you watch it, let me know.  I want to hear what you think."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good.  I'll check if Netflix has it later."
