"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What was that movie about that cellist genius?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Um. That's so descriptive. Was it a documentary? About Yoyo Ma?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No it was, um.. about this black guy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's not exactly the usual racial profile of a cellist"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That sounds racist, but whatever. Anyway this dude was like a genius or something."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think I know. But I'll let you remember if you can. Can you, you know, remember things?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ of course I can. it's right at the tip of my tongue..."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The... cellists... play... what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What? Cello... No, that's not what I mean."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No I mean, the cellist play solo music?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes of course."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So... it stands to say that a cellist can be a what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Doh!. The Soloist! That's the movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ding Ding Ding. Yes. With Jamie Fox as Nathaniel Ayers"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's the genius dude! Ayers. Apparently he goes crazy while in music school or something."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, he was attending Julliard as a double bassist And then he had to be institutionalized. treated with electroconovulsive therapy etc."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Those will mess you up more than help you."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So he wasn't really a genius, talented yes, but a genius? Hardly."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But anyway the movie was pretty good."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ i thought it was ok. Not that great. but the problem of gifted people with mental illnesses is quite interesting. Like, are they more prone to mental illnesses? Why do artists commit suicides at so much higher rate than the general public? It's interesting to say the least."
