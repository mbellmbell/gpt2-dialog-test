"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am so upset with the transgressions of last years Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are still thinking about that B?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's been eating me up for months, it was just so unreal that the Falcons lost on such a big lead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On the bright side the Falcons are the younger squad with a legacy to protect, they will be back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you, Devonta Freeeman is still my favorite player right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was incredible for my fantasy league all year too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really covered good yards and made solid catches throughout the year for Atlanta."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Falcons have always had a great run squad, and always a great quarterback the land those kill shots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Someone told me that Matt Ryan just might be the greatest of all time!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is absolute tomfoolery man, how can he be the best when he gave up a lead like that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He gave up a lead to a better team, but against Brady his stats and skills match up well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If we are talking stats we can go far back, my dad still thinks Joe Montana is the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the game has evolved, and arms nowadays are incomparable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I completely agree, and Matt Ryan is no chump my man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was one of the most entertaining quarterbacks of last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He can get those completions, but I was really a Cowboys fan last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Dak Prescott things were looking incredible early in the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he was a bit young and took on too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe it was all thrown at him a bit early but he will surely come back better!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree bro, we gotta catch a Cowboy's game some time!"
