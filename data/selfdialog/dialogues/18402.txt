"__MOVIES__ Hey, so what movies are you going to see this summer?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know...maybe I'll watch Spiderman."
"__MOVIES__ Spiderman has been re-booted three times now, right?  In such a short time span..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but this time it looks good.  Ironman is going to be in it, so he's finally part of the Marvel Comics world."
"__MOVIES__ I think there are too many action hero movies these days. Did you see the trailer for Black Panther?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that looks like it is solely targeting the African American audience. It looks tribal...I probably won't watch it."
"__MOVIES__ It looks like a lot of eye candy, but I don't think I will watch it either."
"__MOVIES__ What movies have you seen so far this summer..."
"__MOVIES__ I just saw Cars3 this past weekend..."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?  I didn't know the series was already at 3 movies now..."
"__MOVIES__ Meh, I'm not into car racing, but I do like Pixar movies. I thought this was for the kids, with not much of a story."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the Mummy with Tom Cruise a few weeks ago."
"__MOVIES__ It got really bad reviews and didn't do well...what did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ Lots of CG and lots of action...it was a typical Tom Cruise movie, but that's about it.  It didn't have to be 'The Mummy'.  I could have been a Mission Impossible movie with Egyptian god themes tied to it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, maybe I will watch it when it comes out on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was surprisingly good. After the horrendous Batman vs. Superman I had low expectations for it."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely.  The story reminded me of the first Capitan America movie. But I had a good time watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know Gal Gadot was only paid $300,000 for her role?"
"__MOVIES__ Really?!  She was seriously underpaid for that!  I guess the studio is going to make a ton of money at her expense!"
