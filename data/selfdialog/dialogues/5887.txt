"__STAR_WARS__ I remember the first time I saw Star Wars. It blew my mind!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me, too. I thought the light saber fight was great."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think my favorite in the franchise is the Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, that is good, but I liked Return of the Jedi best."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is not all great, though. Remember Jar Jar Binks?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, what a terrible character! What were they thinking?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite character is Han Solo. Ford did a great job."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I liked Han, but I really liked Yoda. That little guy could be tough."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was amazing what they could do with puppets!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Even when the puppets were goofy looking aliens, they still were entertaining."
