"__BASEBALL__ Have you heard about the Knuckleballer who is the 1st woman in West Coast League?"
"__BASEBALL__ 'Now would it be sexist if we slap her butt after a good outing, Dee?'"
"__BASEBALL__ Come on man. I'm serious."
"__BASEBALL__ Really/ I thought you were joking."
"__BASEBALL__ No, I am dead serious."
"__BASEBALL__ Awesome! If a woman ever makes it to MLB, this is how it'll happen."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope to see it someday."
"__BASEBALL__ And I hope she succeeds unless she plays for the Cardinals, in which case I hope she's awful."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm sorry, did you just imply that a pitcher that came up with the Cardinals that should otherwise have only an outside chance at being on an MLB roster would be unaffected by our devil magic?"
"__BASEBALL__ You know Jackie Mitchell was the first female player to play professional baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. Legend has it that she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in the same inning."
"__BASEBALL__ And the next day the commissioner voided her contract and declared that women were not fit to play baseball because it would take too much of a toll on their bodies or something like that."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. They banned us women from the MLB until the '90s."
"__BASEBALL__ You know what he was probably thinking at the time."
"__BASEBALL__ 'Women need to say in the kitchen where they belong'"
"__BASEBALL__ Not to be sexist or anything but I don't see why women would want to play professional baseball. All of that pitching isn't good for men."
"__BASEBALL__ So you think Babe Ruth was right?"
"__BASEBALL__ What did he say?"
"__BASEBALL__ Babe Ruth said something to the effect that women were too delicate and liable to get hurt if they played baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ I think baseball is hard on anybody's body. Man or woman."
