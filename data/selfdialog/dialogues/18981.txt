"__MOVIES__ Have you ever noticed that newly released movies often copy each other?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I'm following you."
"__MOVIES__ Like when a bunch of apocalypse movies came out at once. 2012 came out around the same time as The Road."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, ok. I see what you're getting at."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't San Andreas out around then, too?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that was definitely more recent. But I think that Ice Age movie was around 2009."
"__MOVIES__ Ice Age: The Meltdown?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that's the one I'm thinking of. I think they've done like three or four Ice Age movies by now."
"__MOVIES__ Can you really consider Ice Age movies to be apocalyptical though? I mean, they're animated..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but they're still about major world changes."
"__MOVIES__ But they're not about the end of the world and that's what true apocalypse movies are supposed to be about."
"__MOVIES__ But to the animals living during that time, it sure seemed like the end of the world."
"__MOVIES__ But they aren't people!!"
"__MOVIES__ Does it matter? Apocalypses are apocalypses, no matter which life forms are around to witness them."
"__MOVIES__ So you think that if bacteria witnessed a cataclysmic event, assuming there were no humans around to see it, it would still qualify as an apocalypse movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you honestly think that Hollywood would make a movie about a bacterium's End of Days?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, it might be better than some of the drek they're putting out these days. I might not mind a movie about a bacterium."
"__MOVIES__ At least it would raise viewers' IQ slightly. People would then know the difference between bacteria and a bacterium."
"__MOVIES__ Please. No grammar police today. It's my day off. But yeah, I'd love to see a blockbuster about microorganisms."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they could get John Cusack to play a cute smallpox virus or something."
