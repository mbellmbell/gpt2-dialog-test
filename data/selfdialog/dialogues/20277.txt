"__MOVIES__ So we were talking about John Cusack movies earlier."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, i am a major John Cusack fan."
"__MOVIES__ What was the first movie you saw him in?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, my first JC movie was Better off Dead."
"__MOVIES__ Right on, i remember that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Stand By me was next and then he did a movie called Hot Persuit. The girl that was his girlfriend i had a crush on."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool. I think i remember that movie. Wasnt it where they were going on vacation in the carribean and crazyness ensues?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It wasnt the usual 'Brat Pack' movie he was doing. Although, Ben Stiller was in it as the bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ I remember he did a slew of movies in the 90's."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, him and Tim Robbins did Tapeheads and that was a different character then what he usually played."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he was a sleazy video maker."

"__MOVIES__ HA, that's crazy. But after One Crazy Summer, he started doin more Adult Roles like in Eight Men Out and such."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but that started to fizzle his image. It wasnt until Grosse Point Blank and Con Air did he jump back on the map."
"__MOVIES__ True. When did High Fidelity come into play?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right after Pushing Tin and that crazy movie, Being John Malkovich."
"__MOVIES__ OMG, that was the CRAZIEST movie i had ever seen in those days."
