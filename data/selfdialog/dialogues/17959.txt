"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that Nicole Kidman movie that takes place in France?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Moulin Rouge? Yes, and it seriously made me cry at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it is nice once in a while to see sad endings. It lets you remember that not everything in life is happy."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I for one like to have a good ending to my movies. Moulin Rouge was awesome except for its literally killer ending"
"__MOVIES__ Well, how did you enjoy that other movie you went to see at the theater this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Finding Dory right? Ehh it was ok but nothing like the original am I right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, remakes of originals seldom are as good. You just put so much standard on the original that the sequal isn't as good."
"__MOVIES__ True, like Pirates of the Carribbean. The original was great but they tried to outdo it in the sequels but it just wasn't the same"
"__MOVIES__ You know what I can't stand sometimes that Hollywood does, speaking of remakes?"
"__MOVIES__ I know what you're going to say already. When they take an old classic from long ago and 'retool' it for a newer audience."
"__MOVIES__ There is one thing I can't stand about movie remakes. They always think that you have to put more violence and foul language into them."
"__MOVIES__ I know, its like they don't believe a movie can be clean and funny anymore to be good. They ooze drama with everything they put out no"
"__MOVIES__ So which movie that is already out that you haven't seen yet would you like to see?"
"__MOVIES__ You're going to think I am way behind the times, but I just saw on Netflix that they put Happy Feet on there so thats next on my list."
"__MOVIES__ Happy Feet? That movie came out 11 years ago. Why haven't you watched it yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, I also have a busy social life too. I can't just watch every movie that comes out."
"__MOVIES__ I know which movie my kids used to play that drove me up the wall and I bet your kids did it too."
"__MOVIES__ It was Frozen wasn't it? I tell you after hearing the song Let It Go in the movie and on the radio so much, I seriously wanted to scream."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, sometimes some of the best catchy songs come from movies. Remember I See The Light from Tangled?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't mean to say all songs from movies are like that. I mean just the ones they overplay on the radio and on TV."
