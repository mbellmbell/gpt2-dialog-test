"__MUSIC__ Do you have any bands or albums or songs that changed your life?"
"__MUSIC__ I bet I have quite a few. First one that comes to mind is My Aim is True."
"__MUSIC__ Elvis Costello, right? I'm sort of surprised."
"__MUSIC__ I still remember the first time I heard it. I had a restaurant job the summer between high school and college. I wasn't happy with it. Just dragged myself there every night."
"__MUSIC__ So, go on."
"__MUSIC__ One night I stopped by Marilyn's house before work because she had a new album she wanted me to hear, and it was My Aim is True."
"__MUSIC__ When did that come out? Like '77, '78?"
"__MUSIC__ It was '77, at least in the States. Summer of '77."
"__MUSIC__ So what was it about the album?"
"__MUSIC__ He had so much anger. Some of it was on the surface, like I'm not Angry and Blame it on Cain, some of it was just this enormous mass of seething anger under the surface, like Watching the Detectives and I'm Not Angry."
"__MUSIC__ So anger changed your life?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, in a way it did. It gave me focus for my dissatisfaction, and pulled me out of my general malaise."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I guess I can see that, for you. You still have that anger, as well as a continual rebalancing of anger and malaise.What's your favorite song from the album."
"__MUSIC__ That's hard. I love so many of them. I think it would be easier to name the ones I am a little bit less than crazy about."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, what are they?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like No Dancing and Mystery Dance just fall a little bit below the level of the rest of the album. But that's okay. No one can hit a homerun every time they are up."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't ask, but my favorite on the album is Alison. I could listen to it ten times in a row."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song, too.His sadness and regret are palpable. And his feeling of having been cheated to the utmost."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I feel like it is almost a match for Good Year for the Roses."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, good point. I love that song, too."
