"__BASEBALL__ I heard baseball is trying to speed up their games."
"__BASEBALL__ I heard that, too. It is about time they did something."
"__BASEBALL__ They made several changes recently that have helped. Like automatically throwing out pitches that hit the dirt."
"__BASEBALL__ That helped. And I also like that a pitcher can now go to their mouths without stepping off the mound."
"__BASEBALL__ The next proposal is to allow an intentional walk without having to throw 4 pitches. I wish they would do that."
"__BASEBALL__ No way! They should have to throw the pitches. What if one is a wild pitch?"
"__BASEBALL__ Wild pitch? That never happens. It would help speed up the game. They should do it."
"__BASEBALL__ I still disagree. What baseball should do is prevent batters from getting out of the batter's box between pitches."
"__BASEBALL__ I can go along with that. It is just a waste of time and does not help the batter."
"__BASEBALL__ I bet that would shave about 20 minutes off each game."
"__BASEBALL__ Right. So far, the changes have not amount to a lot of time saving."
"__BASEBALL__ Here is another time saver. The catcher can only talk to the pitcher once an inning."
"__BASEBALL__ Again, I must agree. Most times the catcher goes out is to confer about the signs, which they should have already gotten straight."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, professional baseball players should have learned to get their signals straight without having to visit the mound."
"__BASEBALL__ Great we have sped the game up! I really hope they continue limiting reviews, or we will end up with 5 hour games!"
"__BASEBALL__ Right, like in football games where it seems like every play has be reviewed."
"__BASEBALL__ I hate that. It really makes watching football painful."
"__BASEBALL__ Overall, I give baseball a better grade than the other sports on review."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. Basketball is getting as bad as football."
"__BASEBALL__ Baseball is still the best professional sport."
