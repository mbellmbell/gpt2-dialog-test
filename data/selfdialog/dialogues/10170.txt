"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are you a fan of Drake?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think he releases some decent stuff every now and then, but I wouldn't say I like him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Any particular reason why you don't?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Honestly, I just feel that the majority of his music is a little too emotional."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What specific examples do you have to support that idea?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, for instance, 'Take Care' was a great album but all his songs are too focused on how the women of his life shaped him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Isn't that what a lot of music is about?  Also, is there a different standard for male hip-hop artists to not be as emotional?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well I would rather listen to how other events shaped him as well, rather than just the women."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I personally believe that vulnerability is a fresh angle to hip-hop and rap, since it is so rare."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I will concede that to you.  Drake does stand out from the crowd in that genre."
