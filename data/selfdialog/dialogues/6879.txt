"__STAR_WARS__ Which battle do you think is best in all the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is a toss up between Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back and the second Death Star attack in Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, snow speeders in Empire were pretty cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the AT-AT walkers - the stop motion effects were awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that the Imperial officers reactions to Vader made him seem that much more evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also, the mystery surrounding the Emperor and his holograph appearance."
"__STAR_WARS__ The line, 'I am your father...' has to be the greatest Star Wars line ever."
"__STAR_WARS__ In addition to 'I love you...I know' - Empire has the best lines."
"__STAR_WARS__ Very true - and they leave us in suspense as to what will happen next after Luke is rescued."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, at that point we didn't know what would happen to Han Solo."
