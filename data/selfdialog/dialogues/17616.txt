"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the newest Pirates of the Caribbean Movie yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not yet. Have You?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I did and I was a little disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ Why? Was it the acting?"
"__MOVIES__ No the acting was fine.  Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were great, as usual."
"__MOVIES__ Why didn't you like it then?"
"__MOVIES__ I just thought the story line was a little dry. Maybe there are just too many Pirates of the Caribbean movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can understand that. I read a review that said it was a waste of time and money."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't go that far, but it is definitely not as good as the previous movies in the series."
"__MOVIES__ How is the cinematography?"
"__MOVIES__ The scenes are a little dark, but it is not bad."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's good then. What is the story line for this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's really similar to the first one.  A young couple is looking for a valuable object, Capt. Jack helps, and they encounter enemies, like the British Navy and Barbossa."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that sounds really similar to the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and there's a secret ending after the credits, so there is probably going to be another one."
"__MOVIES__ What is the secret ending?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a couple lying on sheets."
"__MOVIES__ Who is the couple?"
"__MOVIES__ I won't tell you so I don't spoil it, but you can go see for yourself."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I might do that."
