"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Modest Mouse is going to be playing here next month?"
"__MUSIC__ Do I know them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I used to listen to them all of the time- you probably know some of their songs from me."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ You probably know 'Float On'.  It was really popular when it came out and it's been used in a lot of TV commercials."
"__MUSIC__ Where are they playing at?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they're going to be someplace downtown."
"__MUSIC__ Downtown?  Like in one of the bars or smaller clubs down there?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'd really like to go see them at a small place."
"__MUSIC__ Why, don't they play in small spaces?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they used to, but then they got really big for a while and were actually playing arenas."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, really?  How do I not recognize them then?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, they're kind of an indie band, originally."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'll think about going to see them with you."
"__MUSIC__ That would be awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ When is it again?"
"__MUSIC__ Some time next month - I'll look it up and let you know exactly when it is so you can plan.  I'm excited!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll wanna brush up on them first.  What albums would you recommend I download?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say 'The Lonesome Crowded West' and 'Good News for People Who Love Bad News'.  Both of those will be more recognizable to you."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll check them both out.  Text me and let me know when the show is."
