"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is hosting the Super Bowl this coming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are actually having it in Minnesota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Minnesota? Are you kidding me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they have a new dome!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? When was that built?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it was just built for the Vikings this past year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's great, but I really love an outdoor NFL game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, especially in the snow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think those are the best football games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think any games should be played in a dome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not even when it's 20 below zero?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not even then!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football is such a brutal sport, they should be able to withstand the weather."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think the players can, it's just the fans can't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True fans will withstand the weather."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there is some good to come from having a dome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, probably good if you want to take kids to the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, my kids love the games but it can get so bitterly cold that we have to leave."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, probably eventually all NFL teams will play in a dome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like that is the trend."
