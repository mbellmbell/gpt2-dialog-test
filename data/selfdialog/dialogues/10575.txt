"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What ever happened to that rapper C-murder?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's serving life in prison without the possibility of the parole at the Angola State Prison in Louisiana."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Jesus christ. What happened? This is the first time I'm hearing anything about this."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The entire sequence of events is pretty crazy but long story short he was convicted of killing some 16 year old kid outside of a Louisiana nightclub in 2003."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ 2003? I know for sure he released an album in like 2008 or 2009."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's why I said crazy sequence of events. He had like 3 different trials for the murder, but Louisiana has some messed jury laws and he was eventually convicted and setenced in 2009."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I always loved his music. That's really sad to hear. Life in prison with no parole is no joke."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I agree. You know his brother his Master-P right? I think C-murder is trying to get his case heard by U.S. Supreme Court."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know his brother is Master-P. Oh wow, the Supreme Court? That'd be insane if he eventually got out of prison."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I really hope he does, I don't think he's guilty but instead staying to true to his roots. I've heard some people in New Orleans say that Souja Slim actually killed the 16 year old kid but C-Murder is so real that he wasn't going to rat out his now deceased friend for committing the murder."
