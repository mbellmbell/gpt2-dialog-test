"__MOVIES__ Why do you watch so many old movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Define old."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, all this black-and-white stuff. It's so... stagey, and slow."
"__MOVIES__ Some of it, yeah. But, you know, half the film ever made is in black-and-white."
"__MOVIES__ I... guess? Where's the cutoff on this?"
"__MOVIES__ Depends. On a mass scale, let's say the 1950s -- but there was color film way back in the silent era."
"__MOVIES__ So why did it take so long to catch on?"
"__MOVIES__ A bunch of reasons. The early technology was unstable and hard to use; for a long time it was way more expensive; and it was seen as a gimmick more than a strict improvement."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously? How could people treat it like a gimmick?"
"__MOVIES__ Partly because it was new and used in a gimmicky way at first. Partly, it's just not fundamental to the medium."
"__MOVIES__ How is it not fundamental? It's completing the picture."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what picture? You're bringing in that notion from the outside."
"__MOVIES__ The outside of what?"
"__MOVIES__ At its core, film is just about the juxtaposition of imagery over time. Color adds another visual dimension that can distract from the composition and values created from strict light and shadow."
"__MOVIES__ But it's all two-dimensional. It's just a more accurate picture."
"__MOVIES__ Accurate according to whom? The world of a film is a created world, that operates according to its own rules -- not necessarily the rules that you know."
"__MOVIES__ But, I mean. It's photographed from real life, so."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the imagery is captured from whatever makes the best picture -- but think of how much of that is false. You make sets, you cast the people who look best to act out lives they never lived."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, because it's a story."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. It's a created universe, so why insist that it operate like the real world?"
