"__STAR_WARS__ If you could learn more about any side character in Star Wars who would it be?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Boba Fett for sure.  He was competent enough to fight Jedi and have Han on the run."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and that alone is worthy of a story.  He has never had enough screen time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus I heard he escaped from that monster on Tatooine."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I heard that too, it would be exciting to see how he has done what he's done and what goes on after Tatooine."
"__STAR_WARS__ We saw him as a kid, I would like to see how he trained and became such a great character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've always wondered that too, who trained him?  Is he force sensitive and doesn't know it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have a feeling that while not all the characters have force powers as strong as a Jedi, they are force adjacent you could say."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, Obi-Wan says there is no such thing as luck, and these guys are way too skilled to not be using some type of force powers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, maybe not force sensitive like a Jedi or Sith, but they get a little nudge from it."
