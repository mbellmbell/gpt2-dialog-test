"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL season is getting really close!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can not wait to go watch the Indianapolis Colts play!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you plan on going to a lot of their games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, my wife and I usually go to three or four home games each year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have not been back ever since they cut ties with Peyton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hated their decision to do that. I wish that management would have handled that situation differently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they just did it to get Andrew Luck in the draft that year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are probably right about that actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still can not find it in my heart to forgive the franchise for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, you are not a Colts fan anymore?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope! I quit watching them all together after they did that to Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I do not think I could ever do that for any reason!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Manning done so much for this franchise, I could not believe they would just let him go the way they did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean, I loved Peyton myself and did not feel he was done right by the organization."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What made me really mad was the fact that he still had a few really good years left in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that he should have been able to retire as a Colt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ While he was winning a Superbowl with Denver, the Colts did not even make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea it has pretty much been a struggle for us ever since he left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe one day I can find it in my heart to forgive and forget, but not yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so, I know how much you love the Colts deep down."
