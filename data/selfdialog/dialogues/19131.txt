"__MOVIES__ What did you think about Mississippi Grind?"
"__MOVIES__ It was much better than I had expected. I'm surprised at how little recognition it got."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think it was really underrated by audiences."
"__MOVIES__ I think Mendelsohn's character is one of the realest I've seen onscreen so far."
"__MOVIES__ Watching him with Ryan Reynolds was mesmerizing at times."
"__MOVIES__ I know, a lot of people really only look at Ryan as some goofball, but he's a good all around actor."
"__MOVIES__ I think so."
"__MOVIES__ I think what did it in for mass audiences is that it is a little slow. Most people don't have the patience for that."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. It more of a character study than a fast paced what's gonna happen next type of movie."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that Jake Gyllenhaal was originally cast as Curtis?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't. What happened with that?"
"__MOVIES__ He had a scheduling conflict, so he had to drop it."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing against him, but I'm glad it was Ryan Renyolds and not Jake Gyllenhaal."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I don't if  Jake Gyllenhaal could have pulled it off."
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think he could."
"__MOVIES__ Has  Ben Mendelsohn  been in a lot of movies? I'm interested to see more of his work."
"__MOVIES__ He's actually been in a lot of things, he usually plays a villain or some sort of bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ What might I know him from?"
"__MOVIES__ Well he played 'Pope' in Animal Kingdom."
