"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, I used to sometimes, but mostly for the commercials and halftime show."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're not a huge fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But this year, I watched it for the game with a friend who is really into football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think of the game this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, it was amazing right? Did you watch it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I started to, but as the Patriots came back during crazy play after crazy play, I had to turn it off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah, so you were a Falcons fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been a Falcon's fan all my life, yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you must've wanted to shoot yourself in the face during the second half of that NFL game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could say that. It was a disaster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They say that Tom Brady has a reverse curse on him, and he'll keep winning until the apocalypse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right now I just want a lowly team like the Cleveland Browns to come in and beat them next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be an amazing game to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots would finally pay for all the good karma they've been getting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think the Falcons made a lot of mistakes that Super Bowl? I think they deserved to lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My Falcons never deserve to lose. Matt Ryan is a god and deserves the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have a little Matt Ryan action figure somewhere in your house that you kiss before you go to bed every night."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because I have a Tom Brady one."
