"__MUSIC__ Do you have any music or songs you like that tell a story?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know what you mean, exactly. Like, history?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. Sure."
"__MUSIC__ There's lots of folk songs out there. They're pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Got a favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Um... how about the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald by Gordon Lightfoot. That one always gives me chills."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting! I've heard of Gordon Lightfoot but I don't know that song, I don't think."
"__MUSIC__ It's incredible. It's about the crew of this ship in Lake Superior that died after a terrible storm."
"__MUSIC__ That's intense. That kind of... well, it's about something totally different and probably more tragic..."
"__MUSIC__ What is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Cherokee Nation by Paul Revere and the Raiders."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man. Is it about what I think it's about?"
"__MUSIC__ Native American rights and all the historical injustices that have been done to them."
"__MUSIC__ I gotta listen to that."
"__MUSIC__ It's a really haunting rock song... which is not a description I usually use for rock songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but no I get you. Was that band-?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think the lead singer was part Cherokee."
"__MUSIC__ Phew man, that's intense."
"__MUSIC__ You could probably do a book report on every lyric of it."
"__MUSIC__ I bet."
