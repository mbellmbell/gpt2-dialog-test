"__MUSIC__ What would you say is the best album released this year?"
"__MUSIC__ That's hard to say. So much good music has been released."
"__MUSIC__ If you had to pick a #1?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Kendrick Lamar's album."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was pretty amazing. I'm not always huge on Hip Hop, but that album was great."
"__MUSIC__ He's got incredible lyrical talent, and his songs are very interesting musically as well."
"__MUSIC__ No argument. But it wasn't my favorite album."
"__MUSIC__ What was yours?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say probably the new Lorde album."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I'd never really gotten into Lorde."
"__MUSIC__ You should give her a try. She's really talented."
"__MUSIC__ Something about her just kind of makes me bored, but I can't really explain why."
"__MUSIC__ That's weird, because I don't think of her or her music as boring."
"__MUSIC__ Not her music. What little of it I've heard, it's OK."
"__MUSIC__ So it's her personally?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess. In any case, Kendrick's album was much better."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, did you even listen to Lorde's album."
"__MUSIC__ Not really, but I still think I'm right!"
"__MUSIC__ Can't really argue with that. Music is tough to agree upon."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, and that's part of what makes it great."
