"__MUSIC__ Wow, I'm going through a such music dry spell. Haven't liked any of the new stuff I've listened to."
"__MUSIC__ That happens to me sometimes, I feel that. Sometimes even my favorite old music I can't listen to occasionally."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's like I'm either bored of everything I used to listen to and underwhelmed by all the new stuff that's coming out."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like it's just this time of year. There are going to be a bunch of releases in the next couple months that I'm excited for, but it's pretty slow right now."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm so excited for the new Fleet Foxes record, and the new Arcade Fire. Plus, Vince Staples is coming out with something. Gonna be a great year."
"__MUSIC__ I don't listen to much of that kind of stuff, but maybe I'll give it a shot."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite genre right now?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd been listening to a lot of electronic stuff, but I think I really tired myself out."
"__MUSIC__ You just need to change genres completely for awhile. I can give you some great folk-y recommendations."
"__MUSIC__ Nah, thanks, but I'm not a huge folk fan. If anything I want to get into more hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to Kendrick's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, actually. I was meaning to, but I heard people were underwhelmed by it."
"__MUSIC__ What? No, it was incredible. You should definitely give it a try."
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe... I don't know."
"__MUSIC__ Literally no other rapper right now is putting out music of this caliber. I swear."
"__MUSIC__ All right, all right. I'll listen."
"__MUSIC__ When it dropped I didn't listen to anything else for five days."
"__MUSIC__ I hope that happens for me. I really need that right now."
"__MUSIC__ Let me know how it goes!"
