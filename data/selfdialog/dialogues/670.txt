"__MUSIC__ What is the last concert you went to see?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw Kelly Clarkson with my 8-year old son.  He loved it."
"__MUSIC__ He loved Kelly Clarkson?  Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he really enjoyed Pentatonix more than Kelly.  They were the opening act."
"__MUSIC__ Who is Pentatonix?"
"__MUSIC__ You've never heard of them?  They do acapella music.  They make the drum effects and other sounds with their mouths?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah.  I think I've seen them before.  Somebody shared them on Facebook. I thought they were only Christmas music."
"__MUSIC__ No, you should look them up again.  They used to do mostly covers, but they do have original hits now."
"__MUSIC__ I never heard of their original music before."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite is 'Can't Sleep Love'."
"__MUSIC__ I'll look that up sometime.  Okay, what was your first ever concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, wow.  You are going back in time.  When I was a kid, my parents took me to see John Denver."
"__MUSIC__ The guy who did 'Rocky Mountain High?'"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, among other songs!  My Dad loved him and listened to him all the time.  I love him, too."
"__MUSIC__ What ever happened to him?"
"__MUSIC__ He died years ago in a plane accident."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?  I don't remember hearing about that."
"__MUSIC__ It was 20 years ago.  He died in 1997."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, well, I was a child in 1997.  But, I have heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ He was great in concert.  I can still remember it even though it was long ago."
