"__DISNEY__ Am I right in thinking that Mulan is the only Disney movie set in East Asia?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so. Why?"
"__DISNEY__ It just seems like a missed opportunity. They've gone to the Europe well a lot, but almost never to other parts of the world."
"__DISNEY__ The Lion King and Tarzan took place in Africa?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and the Jungle Book was in India."
"__DISNEY__ And The Emperor's New Clothes was Peru."
"__DISNEY__ So I guess they do go to other countries sometimes."
"__DISNEY__ They do."
"__DISNEY__ I'd still like to see more new settings though! I think it could be exciting."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't mind it at all."
