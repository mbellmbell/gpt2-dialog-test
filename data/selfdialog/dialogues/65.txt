"__MUSIC__ How do you feel about the current state of rap music?"
"__MUSIC__ In all honesty most of it is crap. Some of it is catchy but it's still pretty bad."
"__MUSIC__ Oh? What song do you find catchy but is still bad?"
"__MUSIC__ Theres a ton of em, but one that really stands out to me right now is Panda by Desiigner."
"__MUSIC__ I like the song, it's prety good I think."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Can you tell what he was saying or did you need to look up the lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ I had to research it."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly thats what I hate. Most songs now have artist's mumbling about nothing. There is no substance anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Theres a few songs out there with some good substance."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Name three."
"__MUSIC__ I honestly can't right now."
"__MUSIC__ Can you name one at least?"
"__MUSIC__ That's current? No."
"__MUSIC__ See? This is what I'm talking about. Rap in my opinion has gone down hill."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I can agree to a certain extent."
"__MUSIC__ I miss really good songs that had an actual message. Now you have nothing but songs about money women and getting high."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I'd say the majority of it is just generic."
"__MUSIC__ What I really don't like is the songs that do have great messages and such don't get to see the light of day."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Most listeners don't like positive toned music. It's like they don't want to be bothered with a message and just want a nice beat."
