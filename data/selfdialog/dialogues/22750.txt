"__DISNEY__ I love Disney movies!  Have you ever seen Snow White?"
"__DISNEY__ I sure have, it's and oldie but a goodie for sure, I think it came out in the 30's."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it did, 1937 to be exact."
"__DISNEY__ The mirror and the Evil Queen scared the heck out of me when I was little."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, me too, the voice of the Queen is so creepy and when she turns into the old hag, it's even creepier."
"__DISNEY__ I kept yelling 'don't eat the poison apple Snow White'!"
"__DISNEY__ The home of the seven dwarfs is so cute, tucked away in the woods."
"__DISNEY__ Speaking of woods, wasn't that part scary when she was lost in the woods and the trees were like monsters?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, the movie has some really scary stuff in it!"
"__DISNEY__ It's a great movie that will withstand the test of time for sure!"
