"__MOVIES__ Which do you like better: Star Wars or Star Trek?"
"__MOVIES__ Star Wars, hands down. It is so much better than Star Trek."
"__MOVIES__ How is Star Wars better than Star Trek?"
"__MOVIES__ Star Wars has a much more entertaining story. Star Trek is just for nerds."
"__MOVIES__ But Star Wars isn't even science fiction, it is a space opera."
"__MOVIES__ ...and Star Trek is just for nerds who like green aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Star Trek is so much more than physics. It's true science fiction in that it reflects on modern society through a future lense."
"__MOVIES__ George Lucas was a visionary."
"__MOVIES__ George Lucas was a terrible writer. He basically turned the Wagner epic Ring Cycle into a space movie."
"__MOVIES__ OK, I grant that Lucas is not THAT good of a writer, but you have to give him some credit."
"__MOVIES__ I do give him credit. He managed to make a space opera movie."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you not think Lucas is that good of a writer?"
"__MOVIES__ Aside from Episodes one two and three, I don't think he had his vision for episodes five and six until after episode 4 was such a hit."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, he wrote himself into a corner where there was a love triangle between a brother, sister and smuggler."
"__MOVIES__ Well that is just because they didn't know they were brother and sister at the time Leia kissed Luke."
"__MOVIES__ Let's also talk about sexism and racism. There are literally only three women characters in the entire original trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ No way. There is Aunt Beru, Mon Mothma.....and Leia...What the heck?"
"__MOVIES__ There is also a female rebel officer who says the wholey insignificant line of 'Stand by, Ion Controlâ€¦ Fire.'"
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of which, why don't they just use Ion Cannons to destroy all star destroyers?"
