"__MOVIES__ I just wasted over an hour of my life."
"__MOVIES__ What are you talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ Clown Town."
"__MOVIES__ I'm almost afraid to ask but what is Clown Town?"
"__MOVIES__ A crappy movie I just rented and will be returning immediately."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of that movie."
"__MOVIES__ There is good reason why you haven't."
"__MOVIES__ What was the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ A group of friends get stranded in a seemingly deserted small town and find themselves stalked by a violent gang of psychopaths dressed as clowns."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't even sound interesting to me."
"__MOVIES__ If you are  in need of a homicidal clown extravaganza this spooky season, then check out Clown Town."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds generic and boring."
"__MOVIES__ It is very boring."
"__MOVIES__ Are these teenagers or twenty somethings?"
"__MOVIES__ Twenty somethings. They driving through Ohio on their way to a concert when one of them leaves her cellphone at a roadside diner."
"__MOVIES__ What do they do? Did they turn around and go after the cellphone?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope.  They call the phone, and the person who answers instructs them to head to Clinton, a nearby small town where he'll meet them."
"__MOVIES__ That's their first mistake."
"__MOVIES__ They head to the town, which has apparently been deserted since a catastrophic train accident years earlier. Deserted, that is, except for a bunch of homicidal maniacs wearing differently styled clown costumes and makeup"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I want to know anymore about this movie."
