"__DISNEY__ How long has it been since you're seen the movie Aladdin?"
"__DISNEY__ Much too long."
"__DISNEY__ I watched it again recently in remembrance of Robin Williams."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, he played Genie didn't he?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep, one of my favorite characters."
"__DISNEY__ I think my favorite character had to be Jafar."
"__DISNEY__ Why Jafar? He's a bit of a creep."
"__DISNEY__ Imagine having that amount of magic! Obviously I'd use it for good and not to get young princesses to marry me."
"__DISNEY__ You better not!"
"__DISNEY__ Cross my heart."
