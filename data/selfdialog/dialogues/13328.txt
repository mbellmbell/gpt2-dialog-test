"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the Chicago Bears' chances this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ESPN predicted that they would go 6-10, but I think that is too optimistic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that they will win less than 6 games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My number one concern is at quarterback. I think that the Bears overpaid for Mike Glennon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're right. And then after they spend all that money on Glennon, the Bears turn around and draft a quarterback in the first round!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ God, what a terrible decision that was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if Trubisky turns out to be a franchise quarterback, then the trade will look great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's an awfully big 'if'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think that you're giving the Bears enough credit after this last draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they did not get a good draft grade on any website that I saw."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And don't forget about all the injuries that the Bears had on defense last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. That defense was decimated by injuries all year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that Vic Fangio is one of the best defensive coordinators in the NFL, and that the defense will be great once it's healthy again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So then you're putting all of your faith in the Bears' Defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And I'm not disagreeing with you that the Bears have a QB problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really hope you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. It really ruins my Sundays when tbe Bears are terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. I'm just getting my sons to watch football with me, and they'll lose interest if tbe Bears are awful this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They won't be great, but I also don't think that they'll be as awful as you fear."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love your optimism!"
