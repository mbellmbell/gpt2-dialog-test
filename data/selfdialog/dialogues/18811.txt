"__MOVIES__ Didn't You finally watch Rocky 4 recently?"
"__MOVIES__ I did indeed!"
"__MOVIES__ It's about time, wasn't Drago the perfect bad guy?"
"__MOVIES__ He was, I've even heard people joke about that film singlehandedly ending the cold war."
"__MOVIES__ Ha I've been one known to make those jokes, his lines were so quotable as well."
"__MOVIES__ 'If he dies he dies'"
"__MOVIES__ That's one of the best ones, I admit to crying the first time when Creed dies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that scene was a bit rough, right up there with Mickey's death."
"__MOVIES__ I would rare Mickey's just slightly higher, I was a mess man."
"__MOVIES__ I can picture you in a corner a blubbering mess."
"__MOVIES__ Not too far off, not ashamed to admit it."
"__MOVIES__ Adrian's was the worst."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I agree even though you didn't see it happen, my jaw dropped during the cemetery scene in Rocky Balboa."
"__MOVIES__ I had read minor spoilers, bad habit and knew it was coming, but still hit hard."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't expecting it, may have made it worse."
"__MOVIES__ Where would ypu rank Rocky 4? Curious now that I've seen it."
"__MOVIES__ Among Rocky movies? Below the first two and just barely below Rocky Balboa, much higher than the other sequels though."
"__MOVIES__ Similar to mine, but would flip Balboa and part 4."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway need to go, but nice talking to you."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you too take care."
