"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait until the NFL comes back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It should be a great year with teams having so much talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think the Redskins can take it this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it because they need a better defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and a long term quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They haven't signed a contract with Cousins yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. He's going to play under the franchise tag if they don't come up with an agreement by July 17th."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't understand why they don't just give him a long term contract already."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're looking to trade him for someone else and don't want to get strapped with him long term."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also wants a lot more money than they want to pay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot more than he should get considering he has never gotten them very far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they will end up paying him more if they keep the franchise tag option every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. This year he will get 23.9 million for the franchise tag and if they did it again next year it would be 34 million."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely could have offered him at least a 3 year contract for that much money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't make a quarterback really want to play hard if they think the team isn't fully behind them either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they don't want to give him a good contract they should at least let him have the opportunity to play for another team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has improved, but I don't think he is championship material yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is their back up quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Colt McCoy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right. Well he's pretty good as an option if the deal falls through with Cousins."
