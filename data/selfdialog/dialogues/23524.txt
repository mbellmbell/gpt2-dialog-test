"__DISNEY__ Have you taken your kids to see the new Cars 3 movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No not yet! Have you taken your kids?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! It was such a good movie! All the original characters are back. McQueen, Mater, Sally, Luigi, Guido, Mack, Red."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that is awesome! The second Cars just wasn't that great and all the original characters weren't in it."
"__DISNEY__ I know! I had reall high hopes for the Cars 3 and it didn't disappoint! I'm thinking of taking my kids a second time. In this one, McQueen is the old racer who is having trouble keeping up with the new, faster race cars."
"__DISNEY__ Oh it was that good huh? Well looks like I need to get my kids to the theater soon! That sounds like a good story line!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes maybe we can take our kids together! When are you free?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh my kids would love that! Let me look at my calendar and get back to you."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds great! Looking forward to it!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm preparing myself for all the Cars 3 items my kids will want me to buy after the movie, haha!"
