"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, did you hear any more about Mariota?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, his injury. He broke his leg or something, remember?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah, I'm sure he'll be good by the season start though. He's young and all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, not like Brady or something. he's getting old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of getting old, you think Palmer is gonna play another season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As far as I know...and Fitz too."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean Arizona?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, I think the Cardinals deserve a big win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I kind of like them, too. Tired of seeing the same teams over and over..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you! No more Patriots or Steelers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh, can't stand either one of them!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also kind of want to see the Vikings win..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! I'm a bit of a cheesehead so I can't root for the Vikings!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, no! No cheesehead!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What you don't like Arron Roger's and his hail mary's?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he is impressive at that for sure. But no, I don't care for the packers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, then just settle for no Patriots and Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good...and Go Cards!!"
