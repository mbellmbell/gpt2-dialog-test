"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You better believe it!  Who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ America's team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahaha. You can't mean the Dallas Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the Dallas Cowboys!  They have won 5 Superbowls!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not in this century!  My team is the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots?  They are nothing without Tom Brady!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Patriots have Garoppolo as a backup!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Garoppolo is garbage!  If he becomes starting quarterback the Patriots win no more Superbowls.  I doubt they even go 8-8 with Garoppolo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Garoppolo will proof you wrong.He has a QB rating of 113.3."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now if you want to talk about a run for the Superbowl lets talk the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys?  Are they bringing back Aikman or Staubach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny!  But we did get 5 Superbowl wins with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but that was back in the VCR era."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Cowboys are a true team and not a one hit wonder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady has 5 Superbowl wins.  That is hardy a one hit wonder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever!  The Cowboys will prove they are America's team with Dak Prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Prescott is a kid that has not done anything yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Cowboys went 13-3 last year under his leadership."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And lost to the Packers!  Prescott still has to prove himself."
