"__MUSIC__ Do you like movie music?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the music you hear while you're watching the movie? Sure."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I mean listening to like soundtrack albums and stuff."
"__MUSIC__ For certain movies, yes. Like I like when a movie has a bunch of cool songs in it. I'll buy those albums occasionally."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too, sometimes. But I really like the orchestral music. You know, like the love theme or the chase theme or the hero's music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. I guess so. I mean, I've never bought one of those albums."
"__MUSIC__ I have a bunch of them. People think it's weird sometimes but I just listen to them whenever. If I'm studying or cleaning the house or just doing anything."
"__MUSIC__ Why do people think it's weird?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Sometimes they think it's strange to be listening to suspenseful music, for instance, without anything suspenseful going on."
"__MUSIC__ It's just music. How is it different than listening to classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ I know. Exactly. But some people think it's odd if you're not listening to songs all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Well, those people are boring."
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha. That's what I think. But yeah, I love stuff like John Williams music or James Horner or older stuff like Henry Mancini or Lalo Shifrin."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I would listen to them. I've just never really thought about it."
"__MUSIC__ The way I look at it is, if you like music, why wouldn't you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Some people have weird standards. By the way, I take it back: I did buy a soundtrack once."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you did?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, long time ago. I bought the Star Wars album."
"__MUSIC__ Right, right. That's a good one. A lot of people bought that one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that Darth Vader march is one of my favorites."
