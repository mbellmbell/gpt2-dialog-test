"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite superhero movie."
"__MOVIES__ The Dark Knight."
"__MOVIES__ That movie is so good that it's hard to even put that in the same tier as the more traditional superhero movies, such as Spiderman or Ironman."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. Everything about that movie from Christopher Nolan's direction to Heath Ledger's Joker is outstanding."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Heath Ledger definitely deserved the Oscar for his performance, especially considering he was robbed for Brokeback Mountain."
"__MOVIES__ You don't think that Phillip Seymour Hoffman deserved it that year for Capote?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that he was good, but Ledger was better. However, now that your remind me that Phillip Seymour Hoffman won that year, I am not as mad."
"__MOVIES__ Phillip Seymour Hoffman was such a versatile actor. I'd say my favorite of his movies were Magnolia and Almost Famous."
"__MOVIES__ Not Doubt?"
"__MOVIES__ He gave an amazing performance in Doubt, although the film's subject matter made me very uncomfortable."
"__MOVIES__ Very understandable. I just think that between him, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis, that is one of the best ensemble casts that we've ever seen in a film."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought of it that way. However, I do think Meryl Streep is kind of overrated."
"__MOVIES__ Really? She is one of the most versatile film actresses ever in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I think that she might be reasonably considered the greatest film actress of all time. My problem is that this reputation allows her to receive Oscar nominations for films that don't warrant them, such as Florence Foster Jenkins."
"__MOVIES__ That was a great comedic performance. I also liked her chemistry with Hugh Grant in that film."
"__MOVIES__ She was good, although I think that I liked her more in The Devil Wears Prada."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's one of the all time villains in film history."
"__MOVIES__ That's a bit of an exaggeration. Kathy Bates in Misery was much better of a villain."
"__MOVIES__ Forgot about her. I try not to watch films based on Stephen King stories."
"__MOVIES__ You're missing some amazing films then like Carrie and The Shinning then."
