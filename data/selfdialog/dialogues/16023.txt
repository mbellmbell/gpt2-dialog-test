"__ROCK__ I miss the rock bands of the 90s."
"__ROCK__ Me too. Which one was your favorite?"
"__ROCK__ I didn't have one particular favorite. They were all so good, you know?"
"__ROCK__ Oh, I know. I especially liked the grunge era."
"__ROCK__ Same here! I couldn't get enough of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains."
"__ROCK__ Speaking of Soundgarden, did you hear that Chris Cornell passed away?"
"__ROCK__ Yes, and I'm so sad about it. He was far too young."
"__ROCK__ Not as young as Kurt Cobain or Layne Staley when they died."
"__ROCK__ That's true. I guess the bright side is that their music will live on forever."
"__ROCK__ That's a good way of looking at it."
