"__DISNEY__ Up was such a great movie."
"__DISNEY__ A lot of people liked that movie. It draws you in so quickly, too."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. It was actualy kind of emotional watching that first bit where they run through the man's entire life, and losing his wife."
"__DISNEY__ That was a well-done clever bit to develop the plot really quickly."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah. I remember that was how we learned about why he decided to go on his trip."
"__DISNEY__ Then that little kid showed up unexpectedly on the porch."
"__DISNEY__ That was so funny! I remember he knocks on the front door when the house is in mid-air."
"__DISNEY__ It was an endearing movie. I guess I just felt a little confused towards the end."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it just kind of seemed like the talking-dog invention and some other stuff came a bit out of nowhere at the end of the movie."
