"__BEATLES__ What do you think of the White Album?"
"__BEATLES__ It's perfect."
"__BEATLES__ Really? I don't like it."
"__BEATLES__ Are you nuts?"
"__BEATLES__ It has too many songs."
"__BEATLES__ But they're all good."
"__BEATLES__ No they aren't. They could've left off a few."
"__BEATLES__ But then it wouldn't be the White Album."
"__BEATLES__ I just find myself skipping a lot of songs."
"__BEATLES__ I love them all and so do most people."
