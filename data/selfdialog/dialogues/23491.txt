"__DISNEY__ What do you think of the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, is that the live action remake?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the one that stars Emma Watson."
"__DISNEY__ I haven't had time to go see it yet. Was it any good?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I really liked it a lot.  It changed a few things from the original."
"__DISNEY__ Was it weird to see it in live action?"
"__DISNEY__ No, it didn't take away at all. They can do such good things with CGI these days."
"__DISNEY__ That's true, so the Chip and Mrs. Potts were still in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah all of the animated furniture was still there, and still really funny."
"__DISNEY__ Well, maybe I'll have to see it.  I think maybe it's already out on DVD now."
