"__BEATLES__ Do you know when the Beatles will be making a comeback?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know man. They are old and lazy now. I they all retired."
"__BEATLES__ They retired? I didn't know that. I thought they still go on tour."
"__BEATLES__ Paul McCartney still does concerts, but he does them as a solo act.  Yes, they broke up years ago and retired the band."
"__BEATLES__ Why'd they do that?"
"__BEATLES__ Its a complicated story. One of the main Beatles wanted to go solo, and that caused the dissolution of the band."
"__BEATLES__ Why did he want to go solo?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know. But most of the time when a group member wants to go solo, it means that he or she leaves because of money reasons."
"__BEATLES__ Money reasons? What do you mean by that?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, he probably thought he could make more money if he went solo. I think it was John Lennon, who left the group first."
