"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Office Christmas Party?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure - I saw so many Christmas movies this year. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Jennifer Aniston, T.J. Miller, and that guy - I can't remember his name - the guy from Arrested Development?"
"__MOVIES__ Jason Bateman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's him!"
"__MOVIES__ I love Jason Bateman! I didn't know he was in a movie with Aniston and Miller!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I just rented Office Christmas Party and I was blown away by the cast. so if you haven't seen it I definitely recommend it."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'd remember if I saw a movie with Aniston, Bateman and Miller. When did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ At the end of 2016. It's really, really funny."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good, maybe I should check it out."
"__MOVIES__ I'd say so. I'm not usually into Christmas movies - usually I find them too cheesy, but Office Christmas Party breaks the mould."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? It's not all about some big-eyed kid learning the true meaning of giving?"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, no, definitely not. Actually, it's really not a kids' movie - it's rated R, so I would definitely not watch it around any children."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, good to know! So it's pretty crude?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I wouldn't say it's gratuitously crude but, yes - it's pretty typical of the comedy you can expect from a guy like T.J. Miller."
"__MOVIES__ Got it - so I should be prepared for lots of swearing and off-color humor."
"__MOVIES__ Correct. And, you know, that T.J. Miller crudeness is balanced out by Jason Bateman's sweetness."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, awesome. To be honest, I'm willing to try anything that features Jennifer Aniston."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, she is underrated and awesome. So, yes, if you're in the mood for a slightly raunchy laugh, check out Office Christmas Party. I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Good to know, thanks so much for the recommendation!"
