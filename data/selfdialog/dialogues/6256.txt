"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of the new Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked The Force Awakens for the most part."
"__STAR_WARS__ Were you surprised when Han Solo died?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was. I couldn't believe he would die like that of all people. I feel like Princess Lea should of been the one to die."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which character was your favorite? I really like Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rey is cool but so is the Storm Trooper guy named Finn."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Rey is Luke Skywalker's daughter or Han Solo's?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's so hard to tell. On one hand I really feel like Luke was but there was that one line that implied Han could of been her dad."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have one feeling that she is Kylo Ren's twin since in the book series Han Solo and Lea had twins."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be really freaky if she was Kylo Ren's long lost twin."
