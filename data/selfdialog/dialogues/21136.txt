"__THRILLER__ As a fan of thriller, did you like the Child's Play franchise growing up?"
"__THRILLER__ Somewhat, yes. I used to really get a kick out of Chucky."
"__THRILLER__ Do you think the direction they went was the right one? With the films becoming more dark comedies?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes and no. As time went on, I don’t think seeing a killer doll was all that scary to the masses anymore."
"__THRILLER__ I understand your point. However, I think it still could have worked if they tried. It almost felt like after the third film, it literally became a comedy."
"__THRILLER__ I do not disagree. I think they just felt it would’ve made the movies more amusing."
"__THRILLER__ I can see your point. That being said, the most recent movie was a bit more on the serious side."
"__THRILLER__ I noticed that while I was watching. I think they should go for a good blend of the thriller with some comedy."
"__THRILLER__ There is a new Child’s Play sequel coming out this year, also."
"__THRILLER__ Really? I did not know that!"
