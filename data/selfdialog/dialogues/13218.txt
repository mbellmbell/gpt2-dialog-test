"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your predictions for the Steelers in this year's NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have a pretty good chance this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The injury situation seems to have cleared up and we don't have major players with suspensions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was that an issue last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Not having LeVeon Bell for the first four games probably made a difference down the stretch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well had we won more of the first four games we would not have been in the Wild Card and would have more time to rest in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ DO you sense the mood of the team is better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do especially for Antonio Brown now that they gave him a generous contract."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the rule changes with the goal posts?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is really going to make the game interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With a goal post not so wide, I guess windy day kicking could make or break a game more often"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that rule will stay?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It depends on the relative skill of the kickers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think of the comments that kickers are not really a part of the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I found the comments totally ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay....who are you predicting to meet in the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers. It will be epic!"
