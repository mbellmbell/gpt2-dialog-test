"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see The Fox and the Hound?"
"__DISNEY__ No, when?"
"__DISNEY__ It's old, from when we were kids."
"__DISNEY__ What was it about again?"
"__DISNEY__ The lady found the baby fox, and he became best friends with the hunting dog!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah! Wasn't that a sad movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, when she had to release the fox into the wild it got sad."
"__DISNEY__ I feel like like I cried a little bit haha!"
"__DISNEY__ I definitely cried. But it was one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ I can understand why."
