"__MOVIES__ What's one of the weirdest movies you've ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah!  That's definitely a strange movie."
"__MOVIES__ The one based off the Hunter S. Thompson book."
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah, that's the only one I believe.  When did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's been a long time!  I think it was in 1998 when it came out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it in the theatre too.  What a bizarre film."
"__MOVIES__ It was a pretty accurate depiction of the book though, which was also completely bizarre."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it definitely was.  Who was in it, I've forgotten?"
"__MOVIES__ It was Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah!  Johnny Depp was perfect in that role."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he plays quirky characters really well.  I think it's one of his best for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, no doubt.  Did you ever figure out the plot of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The plot's a little hard to follow, but in general it's about a journalist and his lawyer who take a trip to Las Vegas."
"__MOVIES__ I thought there was more to it than that."
"__MOVIES__ No, that's pretty much it.  They have a bunch of bizarre escapades while they're there."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, some scenes stand out in my mind for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, mine too.  Have you read the book?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I never did.  Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say it's better than the movie for sure."
