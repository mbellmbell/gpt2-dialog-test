"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Bruce Springsteen actually wrote a song for the first Harry Potter movie? It wasn't used though."
"__MUSIC__ He did? Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It was leaked on the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book."
"__MUSIC__ Is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ It's okay. It doesn't sound like a classic Springsteen song though."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I know what a classic Springsteen song would sound like anymore anyway."
"__MUSIC__ It was just a lot lighter. It was a weird thing for him to do."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it's a good thing they didn't use it then?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Songs need to make sense for the movies that they're in."
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to put a good movie soundtrack together."
"__MUSIC__ I like when they use a lot of classical. Like in Jiro Dreams of Sushi."
"__MUSIC__ I like that too. I also like when an actor in the movie sings a song."
"__MUSIC__ Does that ever happen?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Haven't you seen Wild Wild West?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't."
"__MUSIC__ The theme song is sung by Will Smith."
"__MUSIC__ Will Smith had a musical career?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! and he's actually pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ I need to investigate this."
"__MUSIC__ You're going to have a great time."
