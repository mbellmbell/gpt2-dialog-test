"__DISNEY__ You're stranded on a desert island and can only have one Disney movie to watch forever. What is it?"
"__DISNEY__ The Incredibles."
"__DISNEY__ Why The Incredibles? What about the others?"
"__DISNEY__ I like the classics too, but The Incredibles are my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ What makes The Incredibles worthy of being the only Disney movie you'll ever watch again?"
"__DISNEY__ Like I said I like the other movies too, but I like the story of The Incredibles the best."
"__DISNEY__ I'll be honest, I don't remember much about that movie."
"__DISNEY__ It's the movie about the family with superpowers."
"__DISNEY__ Oh right. That's the movie about the retired heroes that take down the giant robot."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's the one. It has more action than the others so that's why I like it the most."
