"__THRILLER__ What's the best thriller movie you've seen in the past few years?"
"__THRILLER__ Probably Gone Girl."
"__THRILLER__ Ah! That's a good one."
"__THRILLER__ Yea like everything about that movie was so unexpected."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, like when they did the second half of the movie from the wife's point of view."
"__THRILLER__ I know right?! Like they set up it so that you're convinced that the husband had something to do with the wife's disappearance, like you're so sure of it."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, then they show just how psycho the wife was and how she set the whole thing up."
"__THRILLER__ Such a good twist."
"__THRILLER__ I totally did not see that coming at all."
"__THRILLER__ And the ending was crazy. I feel so bad for the husband."
