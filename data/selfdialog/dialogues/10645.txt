"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Of course random opinion is not relevant, rather as spoken from the mouths of the architects, 'rap is business music & Hip-Hop is cultural music' ."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, damn well perhaps i like both."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Word, in the end the labels of Hip-Hop, Asian, skinny, hetero/homo, independent, or conservative are completely irrelevant and clearly harmful."
