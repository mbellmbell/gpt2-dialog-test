"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite non-Jedi or Sith character in all the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting, why do you favor him more than others?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, hes one of the most witty guys in the series, and he is loyal to his friends."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree about that, he always helped his friends out."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say if not for him, my favorite non-Jedi or Sith character would be Jango Fett."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he is awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ He really is ruthless the way he will kill anyone."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sometimes that's what it takes to get ahead, especially when you have no Jedi powers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I guess that makes sense."
