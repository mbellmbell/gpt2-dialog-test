"__MUSIC__ Stop press! What's that honking sound?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's called a crumhorn. Haven't you heard it before?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. I love progressive rock but don't remember any sound like that."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe it's because it comes from the Middle Ages."
"__MUSIC__ So, are there any of those preserved from that time?"
"__MUSIC__ Not sure; it seems, though there's a lot of books describing them."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check one book out and build one for my own. Love that sound!"
"__MUSIC__ And I think it brings included some music sheet to try it out"
"__MUSIC__ Wonder if anyone bothers to play that now."
"__MUSIC__ Well, look at the media player credits. Do you see something in there?"
"__MUSIC__ It says 'Artist: Musica Reservata - John Beckett'"
"__MUSIC__ 'Musica Reservata', might they be from Italy?"
"__MUSIC__ Looking at the web it says they were from London."
"__MUSIC__ That John Beckett, isn't he related with Samuel, you know, the writer?"
"__MUSIC__ I found out in Wikipedia they were cousins. Art was running in the family!"
"__MUSIC__ The crumhorn in that track was played by David Munrow"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean the one from the Early Music Consort of London?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure it is. Anyway, I love better the sound of the recorder."
"__MUSIC__ It reminds me of my childhood. What is your favorite recorder part?"
"__MUSIC__ The one by Florian Schneider, with Kraftwerk, in 'Morgenspaziergang'"
