"__DISNEY__ Did you get a chance to watch the live actions Beauty and the Beast remake?"
"__DISNEY__ Yah I watched it. I didn;t really care for it unlike everyone else in the world."
"__DISNEY__ What!? It was exactly like the original. What was wrong about it!"
"__DISNEY__ The songs just felt so artificial and there were too many of them!"
"__DISNEY__ Yah they did add some unnecessary song in there. I walked out on the Beast's song to use the bathroom."
"__DISNEY__ And the moving objects looked creepy especially the wardrobe with its dead eyes."
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't the dress scene amazing though! Emma Watson looks gorgeous in that iconic gown."
"__DISNEY__ She did I'll admit, and that scene was done well. But everything in that movie I liked better in the animated version."
"__DISNEY__ What about the Gaston song? They added more to it compared to the original."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know! I guess I just was not feeling the whole movie. It could just be me."
