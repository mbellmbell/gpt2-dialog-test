"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I really liked Aladdin. Robin Williams as the Genie was the best character ever."
"__DISNEY__ I like Aladdin too. Didn't they make a second one?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so, but it had a different person as the Genie and it wasn't as good."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe they'll do a live version of Aladdin like they did with Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I would be interested in that, but it could still be hard to cast for the Genie."
"__DISNEY__ Some characters just can't be replaced."
"__DISNEY__ What do you think about Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Great movie! It made me cry."
"__DISNEY__ I think all Disney movies made me cry at some point."
