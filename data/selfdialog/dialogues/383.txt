"__MUSIC__ I don't understand why Norah Jones has the last name of 'Jones'."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, her father was Ravi Shankar, the great Sitar player."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right, he taught George Harrison how to play."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you can hear George playing the Sitar on 'Norwegian Wood'."
"__MUSIC__ I think the Sitar uses an entirely different way of using notes, not like Western music."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of like Arabic music, some kind of half-notes or something."
"__MUSIC__ You'd think Lennon's son, and Ringo's and Paul's would get together and make a New Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Lennon's son, Julian, did some songs I remember, and he sounded just like his father."
"__MUSIC__ That's right. And I think Ringo has a son, Zak or something, who's into music."
"__MUSIC__ And Bob Dylan's got a son who's successful, but I don't know his stuff at all."
"__MUSIC__ I remember George Harrison played on Julian's 1991 album, 'Help Yourself' but didn't get any credit on the album jacket."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and I think Julian always said he had a better relationship with Paul McCartney than with his own father."
"__MUSIC__ That's sad. Right. Didn't Julian inspire a couple of Beatles songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Strangely, 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds', from a drawing he did of the moon and stars and the sun."
"__MUSIC__ No, I think it was a drawing of a girl. Oh, and 'Hey Jude' of course."
"__MUSIC__ And that weird 'Good Night' song at the end of the White Album, that sounds like Dean Martin or something."
"__MUSIC__ I think Ringo is singing it. He's the only Beatle on it."
"__MUSIC__ They've got that 50th anniversary 'Sgt. Pepper' boxed set out now. Amazing. Fifty years?"
"__MUSIC__ If you've got the money to buy it."
