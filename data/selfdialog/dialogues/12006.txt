"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football? Training camp is only a month or so away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, I'm still in baseball mode, but now that you mention it..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Next season should be pretty interesting. I still can't believe the Patriots managed to come back in the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, as a Patriots hater I was shocked. There are so many things that had to happen for New England to come back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's their magic though, everything broke right at the end and they took advantage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else do you think will be a contender this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want to say the Cowboys because they caught fire last year. You never know though with young QBs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Prescott could take another step forward, or sometimes those guys have sophomore slumps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can tell you who won't be contending this year: the 49ers. I've grown up with 49ers fans, so it's kind of funny with the team being so bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 49ers fans I know are pretty resigned to another bad season. How about those Raiders though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they were good for the first time in 15 years. Assuming Derek Carr is healthy this year, they should improve. Khalil Mack is a monster on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping they can do something memorable before moving to Las Vegas. The Oakland fans deserve it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chiefs should be good again too. They're just so balanced between offense and defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a division I'm excited to watch next year. Any players you're looking out for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides the usuals, I think Leonard Fournette could be a great rookie. He's on the Jaguars, so might not get blocking though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He seems built to be a stud in the NFL. How about Christian McCaffrey?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's weird, you don't see 2 running backs drafted so high very often. I think McCaffrey is maybe too slight to be an every down back, but the Panthers should be able to get him the ball where he needs it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's so fast. Just get him the ball in the flat and let him work his magic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On the lighter side, the Cowboys drafted a guy named Taco."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should be a fan favorite, I already want that jersey."
