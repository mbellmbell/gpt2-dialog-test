"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite nightmare on elm street sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say Dream Warriors, actually like it nearly as much as the first one."
"__MOVIES__ That would also be mine actually, felt it had the best plot."
"__MOVIES__ Oh absolutely, also some of the best kills in the entire series."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed it also gets points for bringing Nancy back."
"__MOVIES__ Sure does, though the end when her father turns into Freddy was bittersweet."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah didn't See that coming the first viewing, though should've."
"__MOVIES__ I mostly did, still was painful to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Would would you rank Heather Langenkamp among screen queens?"
"__MOVIES__ Certainly up there, probably the best of the modern ones."
"__MOVIES__ One of the few comparisons I would make might be Neve Campbell."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't all that into Scream, so don't rate her as highly as some. Neither can tough Jamie Lee Curtis or Karen Black."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that goes without saying, they don't make them like they used to."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed the classics are deemed classics for a reason."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely and then when filmmakers try to replicate it, they tend to fail. See nightmare elm street reboot for an example."
"__MOVIES__ Or Rob Zombie's Halloween 1 and especially 2 what a travesty that was."
"__MOVIES__ Not sure what he was thinking Devils Rejects showed he could direct a gem."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately looks like it was a flash in the pan."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah sadly so, anyway have to go."
"__MOVIES__ Talk to you again soon."
