"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite unknown Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ Unknown huh? I guess I can't go with Hey Jude?"
"__BEATLES__ Unfortunately not!"
"__BEATLES__ Okay - I really like 'Polythene Pam' then"
"__BEATLES__ I've never heard of it - what can you tell me?"
"__BEATLES__ It's on their Abbey Road album"
"__BEATLES__ Great album, why do you like it so much?"
"__BEATLES__ It's full of cultural references to Liverpool. To me it shows that even at their peak they still stayed true to their roots"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's pretty funny"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah - at the end John Lennon even fakes a Liverpool accent"
