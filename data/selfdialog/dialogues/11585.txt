"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might head out to see how the newer players we got perform. I'm really excited about Brandin Cooks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yea, me too. That dude looks super fast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping it'll be like the Brady to Moss from 2007."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, there's just too many. You left out James White!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Our offense is going to be really fun to watch. Do you still have season tickets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea. Let me know which games you want to go to and I'll hook you up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious? I'd love to go to the home opener to watch them raise the banner"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Consider it done!"
