"__MOVIES__ Would you like to come over this weekend? I'm having an 80s movie marathon."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like fun! What will we be watching?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought we'd start with Labyrinth."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that the one with David Bowie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite from the 80s was The Goonies."
"__MOVIES__ We'll be watching that, too."
"__MOVIES__ Neat! I also liked The Dark Crystal."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I forgot about that one! I'll add it to the list."
"__MOVIES__ You should add some John Hughes movies, too."
"__MOVIES__ Like The Breakfast Club?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! Also Pretty in Pink and Sixteen Candles."
"__MOVIES__ Molly Ringwald starred in one of those, didn't she?"
"__MOVIES__ She was in both, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's right! She did a lot of movies back then."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, though The Breakfast Club will always be my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ There were so many great movies that came out in the 80s. I wish we had time to watch them all."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we should make '80s movie marathon' a weekly thing?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a great idea!"
"__MOVIES__ Fantastic! I'll bring the popcorn!"
