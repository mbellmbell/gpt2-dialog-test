"__FASHION__ Have you heard about the  sexy take on athletic/leisure clothing?"
"__FASHION__ That's news to me. What is it?"
"__FASHION__ It's called The New Athleisure."
"__FASHION__ The New Athleisure? What is it skin tight leggings with a top attached to it?"
"__FASHION__ Something like that but not quite."
"__FASHION__ Well. Then what is it?"
"__FASHION__ They say it is  a sexy take on  athleisure, with skin-skimming knits that outline every curve."
"__FASHION__ Sounds interesting. Do they come in an assortment of colors?"
"__FASHION__ I saw some that were color-block bodysuits."
"__FASHION__ Do you remember what color it was? I like body suits."
"__FASHION__ I think one was like purple, black and blue."
"__FASHION__ Purple, black and blue? That does not sound like it will look good on me."
"__FASHION__ They had some cute sporty separates."
"__FASHION__ Sounds interesting."
"__FASHION__ I remember one being a pink top and pink bottom."
"__FASHION__ I like pink. I have a pair of pink heels I just love to wear."
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure if the bottoms were shorts or a skirt."
"__FASHION__ Well, either or is fine with me."
"__FASHION__ I don't think I like this new take on athleisure. I don't think my frame could pull them off wearing them."
"__FASHION__ Don't sell yourself short. You can make a potato sack look good."
