"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, how is it going?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty good. You catch that panthers game last night?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it was great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam is really coming into his own in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's had a few good seasons to be sure. Can't forget that super bowl performance though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that was nerves more than anything else; he looked jittery."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but that's part of being a quarterback. He didn't look jittery last night."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess the pressure isn't as bad during regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think they will go all the way this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't know, but they looked pretty solid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. Still looks like some problems on the offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You talking about the right tackle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea ha ha, he didn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of the line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he is a rookie. Can't expect him to just pick up and run with it until he has some time to practice with the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, sure. I'm pulling for the Saints this year anyways."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Saints? Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea. Really liked what they did last year, and they picked up some good players in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well we better get back to work, talk to you later."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, see you around."
