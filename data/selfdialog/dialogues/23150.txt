"__DISNEY__ I think Cars 3 is coming out this weekend or next."
"__DISNEY__ Are you going to see it? Cars is my least favorite Pixar movie ever."
"__DISNEY__ I'd say Cars 2 is worse than Cars, but yeah, it's definitely on their low end of the quality scale."
"__DISNEY__ This one seems to be getting better reviews, though."
"__DISNEY__ True, but with how good Toy Story 2 and 3 were, you'd think they would be better at sequels."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed. Monsters University wasn't the best film either."
"__DISNEY__ I have strong faith in The Incredibles 2, though -- there's no way they can mess that up."
"__DISNEY__ Especially with the current trend of superhero films."
"__DISNEY__ So, we're skipping Cars 3 and waiting for the next Pixar movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Sounds good to me."
