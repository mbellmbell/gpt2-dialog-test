"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you take if you could decide again: Rivers, Eli or Big Ben."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Rivers. But it's close between him and Eli."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No love for Ben?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's great but gets hurt too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Injury prone, yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not prone just a factor of his play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli hasn't missed a start though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And has two rings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also true, but I think Rivers is just the best of the three."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Shame he doesn't have a ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess he just hasn't had the team around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, he had LT and Gates for years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And he's had pretty good defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a favorable division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but you know who screwed it all up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Norv Turner."
