"__BASEBALL__ Let's talk about our fantasy baseball teams.  I have 3 teams and only one of them is doing well.  I'm getting frustrated."
"__BASEBALL__ Tell me about it; i have 2 teams and neither is doing well."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't believe the number of injuries this year!  I can hardly keep up with them!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know; did you hear that Familia has a blood clot in his arm and may miss the rest of the season?"
"__BASEBALL__ I did hear that.  I'm sorry for him; but i'm also sorry for me.  He's my bullpen ace in one of my leagues."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm sorry for him too, but i'm glad i didn't draft him.  I'm okay with my relief pitchers; my main problem is hitting.  Most of my guys, like Bradley, are off to lousy starts."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm in the opposite situation than you.  I have enough bats, but my pitchers seem to either be having bad years, or are getting hurt."
"__BASEBALL__ So what's your strategy? do you look to trade underachievers, or do you like to hold onto them?"
"__BASEBALL__ That's one of the things that makes fantasy baseball so frustrating.  I'm afraid if i dump some of these guys, they'll turn their seasons around as soon as another fantasy team picks him up."
"__BASEBALL__ LOL; yes, i have the same fear.  Did you hear that Bourn went on the disabled list?"
"__BASEBALL__ WHAT? no i didn't hear that.  that's too bad, he's on one of my teams."
"__BASEBALL__ me too.  he's been hurt most of the year and i drafted him real early; i need his production."
"__BASEBALL__ What's the matter with him this time?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not sure; it's either his knees or his calves.  He's on the 10-day disabled list."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, i guess it could have been worse.  Hey what do you think about this Bellinger; he's going crazy with the bat for the Dodgers."
"__BASEBALL__ Isn't he amazing? You know i had the chance to pick him up on waivers and i passed on him and now it's too late.  someone else picked him up."
"__BASEBALL__ by the time he made a believer out of me, it was too late for me too.  do you think he can keep up this production?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, he can't go on like this; i mean he has, i think, six homers and about 15 RBI in about 15 games.  no one can keep up that pace."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right; at some point the pitchers will pick up on his weaknesses.  he's due to go into a slump."
"__BASEBALL__ but even if he does, he has shown the Dodgers were correct in bringing him up from the minors.  Enjoy the games tonight!"
