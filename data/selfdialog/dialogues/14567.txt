"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey how's it going? How was your weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was amazing I went and saw the new Alien movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have been wanting to see Alien Covenant! How was it?!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The movie was absolutely great. I don't want to give anything away but Ridley Scott did not let us down with this movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I am totally going to go see it today after work then. I have to go see it in theaters to get the best effect."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That is a great idea. Did you know that James Franco is it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What, no way. Does he have a good part."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well actually, since it doesn't give anything important away, he dies in the first 5 minutes."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What!? No!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know. But it is okay. He pops back up for a second and the movie is great with or without him."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well do they answer all of the questions every Alien fan has had?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes! They finally answer everything but I will say, if you haven't seen Prometheus in a long time, you may want a refresher."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well lucky for me I watched it last week because I was so excited about Covenant coming out."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Awesome well if you are really going to the movies tonight I'll go with you. I'd love to watch it again."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sounds great! Looks like there is a show at seven thirty tonight at the iMax theather."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Great. Hope you are ready to watch some scary aliens trying to take over."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have been waiting for a new Alien movie to come out for too long. I am ready. Plus I love Danny McBride."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well you are in for a real treat because he did such a good job. I hope the cast him in more serious rolls."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes you are making me so much excited about this movie!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ See you tonight at 7! Ill save us some good seats and get snacks. I am not getting up for anything. Don't want to miss out."
