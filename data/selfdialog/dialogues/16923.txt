"__MOVIES__ Seen anything interesting in the theaters lately?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I want to see the new Wonder Woman, but I'm not sure the kids are ready for movies like that yet."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, my younger one wouldn't be, and our boys are close to the same age."
"__MOVIES__ We were thinking maybe Cars 3, but I don't know if Pixar/Disney have another good Cars story in them."
"__MOVIES__ I read that there's a female technician as a main character in this one. That's a good message."
"__MOVIES__ It is. I like that."
"__MOVIES__ The older boys might like A Wimp Will Rise, it's based on those Diary of a Wimpy Kid books."
"__MOVIES__ My boys love those books."
"__MOVIES__ So did mine, though they didn't like the first movie quite as much."
"__MOVIES__ Mine either."
"__MOVIES__ Despicable Me 3 is coming out, but we haven't seen any of those."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you should go. My boys love Despicable Me."
"__MOVIES__ I see the Minions everywhere, and people seem to really like them, but I don't get it."
"__MOVIES__ They're just funny. And cute."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think of Captain Underpants?"
"__MOVIES__ My kids enjoy the books, but I'm not fan."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it seems a little... lowbrow."
"__MOVIES__ It is, which is what they like about it."
"__MOVIES__ Bathroom humor is always a big hit with boys, I think, but I don't really want to encourage it."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right?"
