"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies for the kids lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I just saw Cars 3 the other day. Have you seen the other Cars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I have seen the first one about 1000 times, but I haven't seen the second one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you should, it is very good!"
"__MOVIES__ I think my son would like to go see the third one. Is it imperitive that we've seen the second one to see the third?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not really. It can stand by itself."
"__MOVIES__ What is the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Lightning McQueen is getting older and there are a lot of yournger and cooler cars."
"__MOVIES__ This sound like a story I have heard a lot-just with people instead of cars."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is a familiar story, but it is very good."
"__MOVIES__ How does it end up?"
"__MOVIES__ Well everyone wants him to retire, but he decides to give it one last go. The deal is he has to win his first race of the season or retire."
"__MOVIES__ Well, does he?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not going to tell you that. Go watch the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh fine. Who is your favorite Cars character?"
"__MOVIES__ I have always liked Tow Mater. He's a funny guy!"
"__MOVIES__ I like him too. My son is obsessed with Lightning McQueen though."
"__MOVIES__ I like him as well. He is such a flashy and arrogant car at the beginning of the first movie, but I like how he changes."
"__MOVIES__ Life lessons learned through Pixar films, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ I think there are definite lessons for our kids to learn."
