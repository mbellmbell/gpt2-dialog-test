"__STAR_WARS__ A lot of people disliked the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Was there anything about them that you did like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, at the end of the day it's still Star Wars so I'm willing to forgive an awful lot. For example I thought Ewan McGregor did a great job playing Obi Wan Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Jar Jar Binks? He seems to be the most hated Star Wars character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Personally, I didn't dislike him as much as everyone else did. That doesn't mean I liked him but I don't really see what all the anger is about."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's some other stuff you liked about the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The pod race scene in Phantom Menace was fun. Maybe it went on a little too long but it was exciting."
"__STAR_WARS__ The lightsaber action i the prequels was pretty intense. There was much more of it than in the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true but it loses a lot of its mystique when people break out their lightsabers at the drop of a hat. I kind of preferred them to be used sparingly."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was cool seeing Anakin become Darth Vader throughout the three movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah the scenes near the very end of Revenge of the Sith where they show him actually putting the mask on were something Star Wars fans had been wanting to see for years!"
