"__MOVIES__ Know what movie I used to like but is now awful and distasteful?"
"__MOVIES__ As I cannot read minds, I do not. But go ahead."
"__MOVIES__ The American Pie series."
"__MOVIES__ I sort of agree. Go ahead and rant."
"__MOVIES__ So, the original had the webcam against her knowledge, including some nude scenes."
"__MOVIES__ True, that's a crime these days and should have been then, too. Anything wrong with Pie 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm not done with 1 yet. The whole plot about losing your virginity is awful."
"__MOVIES__ Why? It's a real thing guys talk about and have goals for. Girls too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but they end up treating women terribly."
"__MOVIES__ True. So, Pie 2?"
"__MOVIES__ The lesbian scene alone is awful."
"__MOVIES__ I sort of disagree for awful reasons, but why did you not like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's completely ridiculous and none of that would happen."
"__MOVIES__ So, I like American Pie 3 and Reunion."
"__MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Despite now frowning on I-II, these are good for older people who grew up with them."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Growing up and getting married, and coming back for your reunion: it's great to see how people have changed."
"__MOVIES__ How did they change?"
"__MOVIES__ Despite being immature still, especially Stifler, they've matured and taken some responsibility for once."
