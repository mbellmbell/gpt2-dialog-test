"__BASKETBALL__ Do you like Lebron James?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, but I haven't always liked him."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you mean by that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well when he first came into the league, I thought he was a showboat."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can see your point of view there."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he just seemed to have everything given to him."
"__BASKETBALL__ But he is so skilled, and people love to watch that."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree with you there, but I value humbleness, and I think he used to lack that."
"__BASKETBALL__ So were you a fan when he left Cleveland to go to Miami?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I actually thought that was pretty funny, and I laughed at the people of Cleveland."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow, that's pretty mean-spirited."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well I just thought it was pathetic for people to care that much about a basketball player."
"__BASKETBALL__ I get it. It seems like some people took it too personally."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, and it was great when he went down to Miami and won a championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ But then he came back to Cleveland and won one for them as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, but it took awhile. I'm sure a lot of people thought that it never would happen."
"__BASKETBALL__ So what do you think of their team this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well the Cavs always have a chance with Lebron there, so they might get it done again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Personally, I like their chances too. They have a good all-around team to support him."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Western Conference looks exciting this year too, so the Finals should be entertaining to watch."
