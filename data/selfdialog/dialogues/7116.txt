"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the 2017 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes I did! It was hosted in Germany and France."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What about the game between France and Canada?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That game was awesome! The French took a 2-1 lead early in the second and managed to keep the Canadians at bay until the last minute of the period."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It was so good!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How about the match between Germany and Slovakia?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That was pretty exciting! I can't believe Germany won."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It was pretty close, within less than 30 seconds, Yasin Ehliz beat the Slovakian goalie through the five hole to tie it for Germany, who went on to win it in a shootout."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What about Cristobal Huet? It's unbelievable how he's still playing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know! How old is he?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He's 41 I believe!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Age is just a number, he made a save on Switzerland's Vincent Praplan in the penalty shootout that decided their Group B match."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What about that save by Florian Hardy??"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Let's talk about him!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ When I saw how he reached out with the paddle of his stick, I was amazed that he got just enough of the puck to prevent a goal on the rebound."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You should've seen Finnish forward Oskar Osala, who had taken the shot on an (almost) open net!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I definitely did, he could only stare in disbelief."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It was such a shock, I still can't get it off my head."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That game in Cologne though, France made a big upset on Finland!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know, they beat them and they were last year's finalists with a score of 5-1. Great game!"
