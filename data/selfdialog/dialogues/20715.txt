"__THRILLER__ Me either. It was an awesome surprise. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."
"__THRILLER__ I thought the way the plot unfolded was brilliant. The perspective was creative."
"__THRILLER__ I know. I couldn't get over how good it was. I like movies that are not so obvious and make you think."
