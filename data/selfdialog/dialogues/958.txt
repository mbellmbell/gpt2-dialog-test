"__MUSIC__ Hey. Are you play to vocal practice?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I can find an open practice room."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean, it can be difficult to find one in the afternoon."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I know but I must practice. What music are you on your way to practice?"
"__MUSIC__ My instructor has me working on old show tunes. Right now, I am on my way to practice my piece from 'The King and I.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that sounds neat. What is your favorite song so far from the musical?"
"__MUSIC__ There are several. It is a classic. So far, play like Anna's song 'I Whistle a Happy Tune.'"
"__MUSIC__ That is a good one."
"__MUSIC__ I think it works very nicely for my vocal range."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that. Did you know that musical was based on a book?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. The book itself was based on a real person."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Anna Leonowens. She has quite an interesting and storied history."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it works nicely as a musical."
"__MUSIC__ Oh definitely. Once Rodgers and Hammerstein got a hold of it."
"__MUSIC__ You know the touring company is currently in Chicago."
"__MUSIC__ We should get tickets to go see it. That would be a treat."
"__MUSIC__ I will check into the ticket cost and get back with you."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you. I really look forward to it."
