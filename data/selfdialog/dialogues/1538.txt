"__MUSIC__ What's the best band you've ever seen live?"
"__MUSIC__ You know, I've seen a bunch of bands, but CKY is up there for me. I don't think they're even around anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really? I wouldn't have expected that."
"__MUSIC__ Me, either. I only know a few of their songs going in but had to buy a bunch of their albums afterwards."
"__MUSIC__ Was it intense? Were there moshpits?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. The main thing was that their guitar tone sounded so incredible in person."
"__MUSIC__ What was it like?"
"__MUSIC__ It was almost metallic. I'm not sure how to describe it other than gritty and dynamic but in control."
"__MUSIC__ Not too many bands have mastered their own sound. I mean, Chevelle could be one, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Not too many bands sound like Motorhead."
"__MUSIC__ That's for sure. That's a difference from a lot of the pop punk stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it seems like a lot of those bands have been forgotten."
"__MUSIC__ Some of the big bands are so recognizable from that era, like Blink182 and Simple Plan, but not too many stood out."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of those musicians went on to do other stuff. It didn't seem to last."
"__MUSIC__ So out of the CKY albums, which is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I just prefer the early stuff. It was unrefined."
"__MUSIC__ It feels like a lot of artists nail an album out of the gate like they've been waiting their entire lives to get the chance to record it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it's that way for a lot of things. You've been waiting your whole life to throw down that first idea that's hung around your head."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know why CKY broke up?"
"__MUSIC__ There were disagreements. I think the frontman left because he didn't like the culture of the group."
