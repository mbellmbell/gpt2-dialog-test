"__BASKETBALL__ Are you going to watch the Cavs game tonight?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course I am! You?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I can't stand to watch LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, his complete and utter dominance of his opponents must be intimidating to watch for a Warriors fan like yourself."
"__BASKETBALL__ Something like that...you know the Warriors will crush the Cavs in the playoffs!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Just like they did last year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Ok, but the Warriors have Durant now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and the Warriors only picked him up to get him out of their way...."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not going to argue with you there."
"__BASKETBALL__ It'll be a good match, unlike the Eastern finals right now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the Celtics are getting embarrassed."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm glad. I've hated the Celtics ever since Olynyk ripped Love's arm out of his shoulder in 2015."
"__BASKETBALL__ You know he didn't do that on purpose!"
"__BASKETBALL__ You would say that...you probably defend Draymond Green kicking all these guys, too. I'm sure that's always an 'accident.'"
"__BASKETBALL__ Hey, if Green were on your team, you'd like him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not true. His body fat percentage is way too high for an NBA player, and he just plays dirty. I don't appreciate his style of play in the slightest."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, in any case, I'm looking forward to watching another Cavs/Warriors finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ I am too. Hopefully the Cavs don't have to come from behind like last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hopefully you don't get a chance to, because the Warriors will sweep the Cavs!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, yeah...go Cavs!"
