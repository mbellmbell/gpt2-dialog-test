"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a lot of bands that I love but I'd probably say The Pixies as my absolute favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I like them too. Steve Albini is one of my favorite producers and he made Surfer Rosa with The Pixes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that album definitely has a different sound than the rest of their albums. It's more raw and emotional."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. That album sounds like they are right there in the room together playing, rather than being slickly produced."
"__MUSIC__ Their other albums are great too but none of them really capture that sound. I especially love David Lovering's drumming on that album."
"__MUSIC__ How would you describe The Pixies sound to someone who had never heard of them before?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say it's simultaneously playful and angry with extremely catchy music. A big element of their music is the Frank Black's screaming style and Kim Deal's soft background vocals and full bass sound."
"__MUSIC__ Some people say that the entire concept of a quiet verse and loud chorus was invented by The Pixes."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if that's true but that's their signature sound for sure. They were doing that before the style became popular in the 90's."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like the album Bossanova?"
"__MUSIC__ Very much. I know that at the time it came out, Pixies fans were a little disappointed but over time it's become more recognized as a fantastic album."
"__MUSIC__ Some of their best songs are on Bossanova. Dig For Fire, Veloria, The Happening. Just amazing stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I think at the time people were a little put off by it because it was more slickly produced and didn't sound as raw and intense as Surfer Rosa and Doolittle."
"__MUSIC__ There was also much less backing vocals by Kim Deal on that album which was a staple of Pixies music."
"__MUSIC__ There's some of that but yeah, she sing much less on that album. Her bass parts are still prominent and wonderful though."
"__MUSIC__ It's really too bad that Kim Deal left the band a few years ago. It almost doesn't feel like The Pixies without her."
"__MUSIC__ It is too bad but I think that Paz Lenchantin was a great choice as her replacement. She brings a lot of the same attitude to the band."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like The Pixies newer music?"
"__MUSIC__ It's definitely not as good as their music from their heyday but it's pretty good. Not amazing though."
