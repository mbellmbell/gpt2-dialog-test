"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is going on with the Steelers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Big news is Martavis Bryant looks to have turned himself around and will be able to compete this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is big news.  He could really open things up for Ben and the rest of the offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, with AB, Leveon and Martavis the offense is primed to perform."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like we've been saying that for a while now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  The problem is they haven't all been healthy and ready to play at the same time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Staying healthy is easily the most important aspect of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think teams will work the players less during training camp so as to preserve their bodies?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, it is a very fine line. If you don't prepare you can easily get manhandled during the season.  Over prepare, and you risk wearing down your body."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the league needs to be harsher with guys that are obviously trying to hurt other players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean guys like Vontaze Burfict?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I mean I understand it's football, and things happen, but when you witness it over and over and don't address it in the proper way?  I think it is bad for the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially when players get suspended for a year for smoking marijuana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really does not seem to make sense. You treat the guy who could benefit from coddling harshly and then the guy that is flagrantly trying to take out superstars, you coddle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems weird that their HR is so outdated and behind the times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You would think they would be super progressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If not progressive, a little more concerned about the welfare of their superstars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sometimes I think they forget the value that these guys bring to the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is for sure. Who would go see the Patriots without Tom Brady, and look how the league treated him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to get their Human Resources act together."
