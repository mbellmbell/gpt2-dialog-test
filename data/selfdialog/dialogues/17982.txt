"__MOVIES__ Okay, I've seen It's a Wonderful Life. What are some other good Christmas movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Bell, Book, and Candle is a cute and funny Christmas rom-com from the 1950s, with witches, warlocks, and, worst of all, beatniks."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it, though?"
"__MOVIES__ James Stewart, Kim Novak, Ernie Kovacs, Jack Lemmon and the perfectly named Hermione Gingold."
"__MOVIES__ And where does Christmas come in?"
"__MOVIES__ Beautifully, at the end, when Gillian the witch changes her evil ways."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good. What else have you got?"
"__MOVIES__ If you crave a white Chistmas, there's Smilla's Sense of Snow."
"__MOVIES__ What's that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a mystery set in Copenhagen and Greenland. It's filled with a high moral purpose and clever detective work."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ You get to watch Julia Ormond, Gabriel Byrne, Richard Harris, and Vanessa Redgrave at work."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me more."
"__MOVIES__ If you haven't seen it, you might like my favorite Bogart comedy, We're No Angels."
"__MOVIES__ So it's got Bogart. Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Just Peter Ustinov, Aldo Rey, Joan Bennet, Basil Rathbone and Leo G. Carroll. Fabulous actors."
"__MOVIES__ But what's the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ At Christmas, three criminals and their deadly snake escape prison on Devil's Island. That complicates the lives of Bogart and his kin."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't there a remake of that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Don't bother with it. Watch White Christmas instead, or Home Alone, A Christmas Carol, or Edward Scissorhands."
