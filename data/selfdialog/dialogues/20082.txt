"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new train spotting film?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Train Spotting?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's it, the one with Ewan Mccgregor in it."
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't seen it yet, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ No but I was thinking about going to see it this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Good idea, maaybe I could come with you?"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great, I really loved the original train spotting movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a real classic movie, I've watched it so many times."
"__MOVIES__ I hope this one is as good as the last one."
"__MOVIES__ Is Danny Boyle directing it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, his films are normally quite good so I have high expectations."
"__MOVIES__ Danny Boyle is good, did you watch Slumdog Millionaire?"
"__MOVIES__ I did see that but I didn't think it was as good as some of his other movies."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that?"
"__MOVIES__ It just seemed too commercial and pandering to simple interests."
"__MOVIES__ You mean making a movie for the money rather than the art?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, I like it when directors follow their conviction and have a true creative idea."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean, movies can be diluted sometimes in the interest of profits."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, I will meet you at the cinema on Saturday at twelve ok?"
"__MOVIES__ Great, see you then!"
