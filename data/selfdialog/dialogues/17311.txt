"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the movie Snatch?"
"__MOVIES__ Dude, that's one of my all time favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the characters are awesome. Turkish and Brick Top and whatnot."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite was Bullet Tooth Tony."
"__MOVIES__ Heck yes, my favorite scene is when he's driving the car with the dude hanging out the window."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that. The Madonna song that was playing when he got shot up starts playing on the radio."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's funny, he looks at Avi and his face lights up. 'I love this track.'"
"__MOVIES__ Lennie James from the Walking Dead plays Sol in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Man, that guy doesn't age does he?"
"__MOVIES__ You're right. He looks the same today as he did back in 2000."
"__MOVIES__ Could you understand anything that Brad Pitt or the other gypsies were saying?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at first, but I've seen that film a bunch of times and now I understand every word."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool."
"__MOVIES__ They are speaking English, it's just the inflection in their speech that makes it so hard to understand."
"__MOVIES__ That movie really got Jason Statham's career going."
"__MOVIES__ It certainly did, and Brad Pitt's character is by far my favorite of the roles he's played."
"__MOVIES__ I just realized that Madonna and Guy Ritchie used to be married. No wonder they used that Madonna song."
"__MOVIES__ Which song was it? I forget."
"__MOVIES__ It was Lucky Star wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ That's right. Man I love that movie."
