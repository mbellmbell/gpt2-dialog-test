"__MUSIC__ Hey, did you hear about Dexter Holland?"
"__MUSIC__ The singer from The Offspring?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, that's the one."
"__MUSIC__ No, what happened?"
"__MUSIC__ He finally got his Pd.D!"
"__MUSIC__ His what?!"
"__MUSIC__ PdD."
"__MUSIC__ You're joking!"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, he earned his Ph.D in molecular biology, last week."
"__MUSIC__ That's amazing! I had no idea."
"__MUSIC__ It took him ages to earn, because he would take breaks to tour with The Offspring."
"__MUSIC__ So being the lead singer/song writer for an internationally known, amazing, long running, punk band is just his hobby?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much. His passion, even before music, is science."
"__MUSIC__ Wow."
"__MUSIC__ That's why there'd be long breaks between albums, he was going to school and working on his education."
"__MUSIC__ I guess he's a regular Jack of all trades."
"__MUSIC__ He's also a licensed Airline Transport Pilot and a Certified Flight Instructor."
"__MUSIC__ Now I know you're pulling my leg."
"__MUSIC__ No, its totally true!"
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe how accomplished he is. That really is amazing."
