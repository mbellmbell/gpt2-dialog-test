"__COMEDY__ Okay, what movie do you put in when you're in a bad mood and need a laugh?"
"__COMEDY__ I think I've seen Caddyshack about 100 times."
"__COMEDY__ So good! Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield are amazing in that movie."
"__COMEDY__ Haha, both of them were improvising a lot of their lines. That's a great formula for comedy gold, get funny people and let them do their thing."
"__COMEDY__ It's like coaching a super talented basketball team, give them a little structure and get out of the way."
"__COMEDY__ Another one from that era that I love is Airplane."
"__COMEDY__ Another classic. I think Airplane might have better jokes, but the characters are better in Caddyshack."
"__COMEDY__ I think that's a fair way to describe it. Although Kareem playing the pilot was pretty memorable and hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ And Leslie Nielsen is going to make me laugh, no matter what movie it is."
"__COMEDY__ Can't disagree with you there. Throw in the Naked Gun movies as other all time classics."
