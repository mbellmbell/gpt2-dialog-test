"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Star Wars was ahead of it's time for having such a strong Female protagonist?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Leia was strong and independent at first, but they kind of ruined it by having her fall in love."
"__STAR_WARS__ But that makes it stronger. She is a strong woman, but still a woman with a heart and emotions."
"__STAR_WARS__ She kissed her brother."
"__STAR_WARS__ She didn't know he was her brother and she only did it to make Han jealous."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's gotta be awkward though, every fight has to end with 'at least I didn't kiss my brother'."
"__STAR_WARS__ It does beg the question of why they split up."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's obviously still feelings there."
"__STAR_WARS__ She was royalty and he was a criminal, it was never going to work."
"__STAR_WARS__ Can you still be royalty if you got your own planet blown up?"
