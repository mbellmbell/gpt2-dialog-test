"__MOVIES__ Are you a Hitchcock fan by any chance?"
"__MOVIES__ Alfred Hitchcock? Yeah I love his movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yay, me too. I've been hoping for someone to watch his movies with."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favourite?"
"__MOVIES__ I gotta say the Birds."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, a classic, good choice."
"__MOVIES__ You know it was filmed in Bodega Bay. I've been there!"
"__MOVIES__ No, that's cool."
"__MOVIES__ I also really like Rope."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not familiar with that one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well Jimmy Stewart is in it, it's a really good one. It also has some really long takes, some of the scenes are like 10 minutes long."
"__MOVIES__ That's amazing."
"__MOVIES__ It really is. That's half the reason I like it right there."
"__MOVIES__ Jimmy Stewart was in more than one HItchcock film as I recall."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like Rear Window."
"__MOVIES__ That's one of my favourites."
"__MOVIES__ It's probably the most famous, too."
"__MOVIES__ It was so entertaining considering it took place in such a confined space."
"__MOVIES__ That seems to be a theme in a lot of Hitchcock films."
"__MOVIES__ I hadn't noticed that."
