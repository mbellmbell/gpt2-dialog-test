"__MOVIES__ You nkow what's really stupid?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. i know many things that are stupid. Including you."
"__MOVIES__ Shut up. You know what I mean."
"__MOVIES__ No I don't. what do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean look at it, it's a subway train, why is it blowing up in flames like that? They're all electric."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but,. but. if we don;t have the flames, the rnold fighting the Satan is much less dramatic. It IS about the End of Days after all."
"__MOVIES__ ys, but they have to make it believable. Now it's just stupid and funny"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know flames and burning seems pretty entertaining. It's all in good whole some family fun,."
"__MOVIES__ you know what else is stupid?"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, here we go again."
"__MOVIES__ The Hollywood portrayal of Satan."
"__MOVIES__ And what's wrong with it? I might regret asking this..."
"__MOVIES__ I'll tell you exactly what;'s wrong with it. hollywood portray Satan as this winged creature with horns, right?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the idea yes."
"__MOVIES__ There is no religious text in Christendom, that supports that image. None. There are pagan supports for that, but not legit religion"
"__MOVIES__ And unless it's from a legit religion, the portrayal is... wrong?"
"__MOVIES__ Not wrong, but annoying. Look. Satan was supposed to be the most beautiful creature among God's creation. Light bearer. That's what Lucifer means."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. But..."
"__MOVIES__ But Hollywood portrayal of Satan or the adversary has been corrupted by pagan sources. Much of what we perceive as the characteristics of Satan was developed during the middle ages and evolved to include these traits that are not supported by religion"
"__MOVIES__ Like,horn, red skin, wings, bad teeth, etc?"
