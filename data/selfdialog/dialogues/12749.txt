"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are your favorite NFL announcers of all time? They don't necessarily need to be current."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I have a special place in my heart of John Madden. He sort of opened up color commentary to a whole new level of fun and insight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was a total natural. He combined great insight and humor, like you were alluding to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say that currently I do like Al Michaels and Chris Collinsworth. I think they are the best tandem and I will tune into games they play just to hear them call the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's a first. I don't know if I've ever heard of anyone tune into an NFL game just to hear the commentators."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah, it's hard to explain why they are so good. I think they have a chemistry that few can match."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are other teams that are just as smart or provide good analysis, but I agree, they just have a certain synergy together that is unparalleled."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I completely agree. If we are talking all-time greats, you can't forget Howard Cosell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Naturally and no doubt. Such a wordsmith -- and that voice and New York accent. Pure genius!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and he called perhaps the saddest game of all-time, a Monday night game when John Lennon passed away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yes, I remember that, he was very classy about how he handled that situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not to switch gears too much but what ever happened to Brent Musburger? He was so good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't know myself. He brought a certain sort of calm, analytical professionalism to the games he called."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and for awhile there in the 80's, he was THE announcer when CBS ruled sports broadcasting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not exactly sure what happened to him, perhaps he was phased out due to old age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In terms of some of the newer announcers, I sort of like Jon Gruden. He was this macho swagger that I sort of like."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's kinda like a military drill sargent calling a game. I think he's an acquired taste, but I think for most football fans, he's a good fit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know this is a 'hot take' -- sort of -- but I like Joe Buck. I know I'm probably in the minority here, but I think he's professional and calls a good game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think you lost me with that one. I'm waiting for him to retire. I think he said he's going to move on at a point in the not so distant future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overall, I think the sport has a number of good announcers and good announcing teams. It's a good time to be a fan!"
