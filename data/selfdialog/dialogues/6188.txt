"__STAR_WARS__ So, which Star Wars movie is the best, in your humble opinion?"
"__STAR_WARS__ For me, it'd have to be The Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, for me, that's the most emotionally resonant of the movies..."
"__STAR_WARS__ And also the darkest, with such a brutal, sad ending and cliffhanger."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I can't imagine having to wait three years after Empire Strikes Back to find out what happened."
"__STAR_WARS__ It had to feel like a bit of a letdown, Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ You see such great characters we know very little about in Empire Strikes Back, like Boba Fett."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's just so mysterious and cool, and it's definitely sad how he dies early on in Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some people say that it was Lawrence Kasdan who really made Empire Strikes Back a great film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I wonder if he is a better director than Lucas, or maybe better at executing Lucas' ideas and concepts?"
