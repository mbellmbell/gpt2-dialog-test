"__STAR_WARS__ Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really, I quit watching after the Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean you haven't seen the new one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope."
"__STAR_WARS__ You have to see it man! It was so much better than the Phantom Menace!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe I'll check it out. What was it called again?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, I'll have to check it out."
"__STAR_WARS__ You should, there is another one coming out in December, I can't wait."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well if I like the Force Awakens, I'll go see it with you."
