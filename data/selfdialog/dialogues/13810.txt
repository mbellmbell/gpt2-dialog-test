"__BASKETBALL__ Are you going to watch the Spurs game on Monday?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes I am, I want to see if GS will rest some players."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think the Spurs are looking at the long term picture rather than the now?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, if not they would be playing Leonard now."
"__BASKETBALL__ If you had to pick one to start a team around, right now....Lebron or Curry."
"__BASKETBALL__ This is a hard one but Lebron, he is still the best and most dominate."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you ever think the draft is rigged?"
"__BASKETBALL__ All the time how else do you explain how some teams end up with the top 3 pick when it just seems to 'fit'."
"__BASKETBALL__ I understand it but I can't believe they took  Kanters passport away and detained him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Crazy right, I don't think a terrorist would be 7 feet tall."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did Lebron get snubbed?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but I think he's at the point that he cares much more about the NBA Championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ Should the 76ers trade down?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, they are rebuilding and can get a lot more with say 2-3 major picks than just 1."
"__BASKETBALL__ Out of d James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Kawhi Leonard  who do you think will win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Russell - its a numbers game and they seem to want to spread the MVP around now."
"__BASKETBALL__ LeBron is a lot like Shaq; you can give him the award every year if you wanted to."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but I feel like you should still give it to the most deserving even if its the same person over and over."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's going to be a man on a mission now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah, Lebron is definitely going to be playing to prove something."
