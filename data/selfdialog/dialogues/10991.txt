"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the NFL season should be longer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean with more games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I think the NFL season is too short."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's just about right. I don't think they can really play too many games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football is really taxing on the body. That's why most games have a week between them for recovery."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that since football players are getting paid so much money, they should play more games in a season. Plus it's more money for the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think that there would be more injuries if footall players had to play more than 16 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. I mean, do you see players who go deep into the playoffs getting injured more than those who get eliminated in the regular season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really know. But imagine players who go into the playoffs having to play extra games during the regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that it wouldn't matter. I think they could do something where they have more rest time between a few games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that could work. But I personally see it being a problem with the players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course it would be a problem with them. They want to make as much money without working more for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you blame them? Would you want to make the same amount of money for more work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I was making millions of dollars, I woudn't mind. Wouldn't you like to see the season start earlier since there isn't really much sports.Y"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't mind. But I also wouldn't want players getting injured because they are playing too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just want to see more football. I think it would also give some teams more chances to get over injuries early in the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there's some pros and cons to having a longer season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely think the NFL should consider it since it means more revenue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would definitely watch all the games though if they did add more games."
