"__MOVIES__ I saw the best documentary on Netflix called Betting on Zero."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that about the company Herbalife?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It was fascinating."
"__MOVIES__ I've never understood why these multi-level marketing companies are allowed to stay in business when they're scams."
"__MOVIES__ The movie talks about that. The FCC and other agencies investigated them, and practically called them a pyramid scheme but didn't directly."
"__MOVIES__ Well why not?"
"__MOVIES__ They talk about how the FCC is reluctant to label anyone as a pyramid scheme, even though they describe them with the literal definition they use for pyramid schemes."
"__MOVIES__ Why not just shut them down?"
"__MOVIES__ The documentary talks about how insanely profitable the company was for a select few, and they used that money to buy endorsements from incredibly respected people to speak out for them."
"__MOVIES__ And I'm sure they could afford the best lawyers, too."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Since very rich people are making lots more money, they won't shut them down."
"__MOVIES__ Did they have any consequences from the FCC investigation?"
"__MOVIES__ They were fined and got their hand slapped, and had to settle with millions of people who they ripped off over the years."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's good!"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, the settlement amount was so low that people were lucky if they got back 10 bucks."
"__MOVIES__ That's awful."
"__MOVIES__ And they really targeted Mexican-Americans to rip off, betting they didn't understand enough to figure out it was a scam, with the language barrier and such."
"__MOVIES__ That's just despicable to target immigrants to rip off."
"__MOVIES__ I know! The movie interviewed some of the people who got scammed, and they lost thousands."
"__MOVIES__ What a terrible thing when they're just trying to chase the American Dream."
