"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch that ESPN: 30 for 30 on the 1985 Chicago Bears?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I caught the tail end of it the other night but didn't get to watch the entire thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You need to watch it as soon as possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Was that good? I'm a sucker for anything football and love the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! It was very good. It had a lot of great Walter Payton footage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Walter Payton is one of my all time favorite NFL players. Rest in piece sweetness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine too, I get pretty emotional even thinking about him and everything he went through."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What kind of cancer did he have again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a rare liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Damn what a horrible way to go. Do you know when Emmitt Smith broke his rushing record?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Emmitt Smith broke the record in 2002, I think he had like 17,162 career rushing yards when he broke it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's amazing. I miss old football like that now running backs are becoming pretty obselte."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same but you have to understand that game is steadily changing and has been for years now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that has to do with the different rules that have been applied to the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No not really. I would say it has to do more with the players. Players are getting bigger and stronger. Also just the way teams are running their offenses now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Makes a lot of sense now that I'm really thinking about it. What modern player would you compare Walter Payton to?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is going to be tough but I think I'm going to have to go with maybe Marshawn Lynch or Darren Sproles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mashawn Lynch is a complete monster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well his nickname is 'Beast Mode'. I'm exicited that he came out of retirement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same but I think everybody knew he wasnt serious about retiring to begin with."
