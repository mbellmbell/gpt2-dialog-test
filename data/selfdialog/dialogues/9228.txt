"__BASEBALL__ Are we at a point where steroids may have been better for the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ No way how can you say that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Scoring was better back then"
"__BASEBALL__ And the pitching was terrible."
"__BASEBALL__ There were great pitchers still available."
"__BASEBALL__ But people want to see scoring."
"__BASEBALL__ They do but they can solve that."
"__BASEBALL__ How?"
"__BASEBALL__ Analytics is turning lineups into hit machines"
"__BASEBALL__ I dont see it happening yet"
"__BASEBALL__ It will turn eventually"
"__BASEBALL__ I cant see that ever happening."
"__BASEBALL__ They will get better and learn to adjust"
"__BASEBALL__ So you think this is just temporary?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, a sub 3 ERA will not be the norm."
"__BASEBALL__ I just think when people hit homers more fans come out"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but what were they worth knowing everyone was juicing?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think people can forget about that."
