"__BASKETBALL__ are u excited for the cleveland game tonight?"
"__BASKETBALL__ ehh, yes and no"
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron seems to be unstoppable though right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ well, that's just it, is he really unstoppable athletically or just a cash cow?"
"__BASKETBALL__ does it matter if you watch the whole series anyway?"
"__BASKETBALL__ i suppose for some, though i do not, nor do i know of anyone watching every game of the series"
"__BASKETBALL__ how much fun would it be to not have all the hype and irrelevant branding and money references though?"
"__BASKETBALL__ actually, all sports not just basketball suffer from having no focus on actual sport and competition"
"__BASKETBALL__ exactly, which is why it's cool to tune in and what & who is cool in the nba whilst keeping up with playoffs as well; right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ how much have you made for being a loyal cleveland playoff 'theoretical' supporter?"
"__BASKETBALL__ huh, what do you mean how much have i made, like personally?"
"__BASKETBALL__ yes, your actual personal monetary benefit from so called 'support' of the cavaliers?"
"__BASKETBALL__ i don't understand what you mean, how do i make money watching someone else do something?"
"__BASKETBALL__ exactly, go and do for yourself;  even if that means going to play basketball yourself to at least reap the physical benefits"
"__BASKETBALL__ but then what kind of cleveland fan am i, and how would i know of Lebron's highlights?"
"__BASKETBALL__ case and point ignorant one, professional teams do not exist without your wasted money and time on them;  yet sports are still always here for us to enjoy and actually benefit from"
"__BASKETBALL__ so i don't get it, why is there even an nba.    .or any other league for that matter?"
"__BASKETBALL__ exactly, and furthermore why would you use time you could be experiencing a sport and begin fit, on watching anyone else?"
"__BASKETBALL__ well then what is there to talk about if not all the playoffs going on?"
"__BASKETBALL__ perhaps EVERYTHiNG else in the world that has relevance, not a price"
