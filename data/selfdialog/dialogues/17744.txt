"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie How to Be a Latin Lover?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't even heard of it. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a guy that gets dumped by his wealthy elderly wife and becomes a giggolo."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my, that sounds entertaining what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I read reviews before I went and they weren't that great, but I actually liked it."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It stars Salma Hayek and Eugenio Derbez."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of Eugenio Derbez, but I really like Salma Hayek."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she's great, especially in her movies from the 90s."
"__MOVIES__ I guess this is the most recent movie she's been in.  Was it funny?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was a really good satire. It was nice to just watch a movie mindlessly."
"__MOVIES__ That does sound nice. How was Derbez as an actor?"
"__MOVIES__ He was great.  He and Salma have wonderful chemistry, so it was nice to watch how natural they were on screen together."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that does sound nice."
"__MOVIES__ It did have a lot of cliches, which I am usually sick of, but I liked them this time."
"__MOVIES__ The whole title itself is a cliche, so I can understand that."
"__MOVIES__ I highly recommend it though.  It would be great to see with your girlfriend."
"__MOVIES__ I'll talk to her about it tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me if you see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I will."
