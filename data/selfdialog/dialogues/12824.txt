"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought they were done in the first quarter"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was pulling my hair out, I was throwing things at the tv"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I know. I was losing my mind too, But then they just turned it around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like two different teams, Like they learned how to play after the half"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know what they gave them in the locker room, but it worked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, just as long as they don't get caught, I don't care what they give them if it makes them play like that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that was one of the best touchdowns I have ever seen"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, the guy rand the entire field, dodging guys left and right"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every time you thought he was ganna get tacked, he shook them off"
