"__DISNEY__ I can't tell you how many times I've seen 101 Dalmations."
"__DISNEY__ Oh my gosh, Cruella de Vil was so scary to me! Especially in that scene where she's driving her car like a madwoman and her eyes get all wild and red."
"__DISNEY__ I can see how that would have been scary for you, but all the puppies were so cute!"
"__DISNEY__ Okay I'll grant you that, the puppies were adorable."
"__DISNEY__ One of my favorite scenes is when Perdy goes into labor and Pongo and Roger are out waiting and he just keeps getting more and more excited as more puppies are born."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he was a pretty proud puppy Dad."
"__DISNEY__ I mean, if you had 101 kids wouldn't you be pretty proud?"
"__DISNEY__ I think I'd be more worried in how I was going to feed all those kids actually."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good point. Can you imagine how much Roger and Anita must have spent in dog food?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd think they'd have to get second jobs just for that purpose!"
