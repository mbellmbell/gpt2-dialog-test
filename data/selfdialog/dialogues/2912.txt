"__MUSIC__ Guess what album I just received as a gift!"
"__MUSIC__ An album?  As in a cd?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I still love to collect cd's so I can hear the music that isn't being played on the radio or online."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's true.  So who is it?"
"__MUSIC__ The latest Bruno Mars release.  24k Magic."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! I like him.  He has a great voice."
"__MUSIC__ Yes he does.  He is so talented.  This album has a very 'retro' feel to it."
"__MUSIC__ Retro? Like disco?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope.  Like funk, r&b, 90's hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That sounds like fun."
"__MUSIC__ It is.  There are a couple of tracks that made me laugh the first time I heard them."
"__MUSIC__ But the music is good?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, it has that first release '24k magic', and now that other song is out 'That's What I like.'"
"__MUSIC__ Are those your favorite on the album?"
"__MUSIC__ No. Not even close.  There is a track called 'Chunky.'  I love it."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds funny.  I may have to borrow it from you."
"__MUSIC__ Fat chance, maybe I'll go oldschool and burn you a copy."
"__MUSIC__ That would be great.  Are there any ballads that show off his pipes?"
"__MUSIC__ You know there is.  He's really talented.  I hope he has a nice long career."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  All he has to do is stay healthy!"
