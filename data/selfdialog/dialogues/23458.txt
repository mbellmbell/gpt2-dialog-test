"__DISNEY__ Did you know that Sleeping Beauty was the last animated Disney fairy tale until The Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ That can't be true."
"__DISNEY__ I read it on Disney's website. There was a 30 year gap between those two."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, I can't believe that. Why?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess it was because Sleeping Beauty didn't do too well in theaters."
"__DISNEY__ That's a long time between movies though."
"__DISNEY__ It definitely is. Especially for a classic fairy tale like Sleeping Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ You said The Little Mermaid was the one they did right after Sleeping Beauty?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes."
"__DISNEY__ That's crazy. 30 years is a long time."
