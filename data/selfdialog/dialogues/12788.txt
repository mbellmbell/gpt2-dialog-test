"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team do you think will have the best defense in the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's tough, but I think the Seattle Seahawks will be the best defense this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Legion of Boom is usually a pretty safe bet, but they were not all that good last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's true that they were not as good as in years previous, but Earl Thomas was injured and should be back stronger than ever this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will also benefit from Richard Sherman not being traded in the long run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Sherman helps all of the guys around him be better, even when his off the field comments are a little much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I watched the draft, I noticed Seattle went very defense heavy. Do you think they are preparing for a run?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there was so much value at many defensive positions, Seattle wanted to make sure to get their piece."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle drafted a great player in Malik McDowell and I'm excited to see how he plays with the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he is joining a team that tied for third in sacks last year, so it's a pretty good squad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's crazy to think how so many of those sacks came after Earl Thomas was injured and Seattle had to modify its game plan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The injury definitely hurt Seattle's plan, but they still managed to finish top five in points and yards allowed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sounds like Seattle is only getting better, but I'm looking forward to seeing what Wade Phillips can do with the Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Rams have some very talented players, but they are way under-utilized."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wade is one of the greatest defensive minds of all time, so I think he will be able to draft a plan that works for the players they already have in the building."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Donald has now had a couple of years, so he will be a good player to lead the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The problem is consistency for that team, they had an awful time keeping people from scoring in the redzone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm worried that might happen again this year since Phillips is switching to 3-4."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully in a 3-4, the defense will be a bit more stout, even if there are growing pains."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There isn't much to lose with the Rams defense, as they can only improve upon last year."
