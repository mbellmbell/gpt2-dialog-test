"__MUSIC__ Who do you think is the best band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ That's easy, The Rolling Stones."
"__MUSIC__ Really? You think they're better than the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ I know some people would think it's a horrible thing to say, but I think the Stones were better."
"__MUSIC__ But you're not denying that the Beatles were great?"
"__MUSIC__ No, of course not. But I'd list the Who right up there with them."
"__MUSIC__ You know who else I would put right up there with them?"
"__MUSIC__ That was a bad pun. Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Van Halen, that's who."
"__MUSIC__ With Sammy Hagar?"
"__MUSIC__ No, of course not. With David Lee Roth."
"__MUSIC__ Well if you include Van Halen, you have to include KISS."
"__MUSIC__ No argument there. And I'd include Metallica."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with Metallica. And AC/DC."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they deserve to be included. Pink Floyd should be on the list."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure about that one."
"__MUSIC__ Pink Floyd changed music forever."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'll agree with Pink Floyd. But if you include them, it seems like Nirvana should be on the list."
"__MUSIC__ Nirvana wasn't around long enough to make the list of best bands of all time."
"__MUSIC__ They changed music forever."
