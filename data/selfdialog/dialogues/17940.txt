"__MOVIES__ I just saw the new Jennifer Aniston rom-com. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it, but I heard it wasn't that great."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I really enjoyed it! I thought it was so funny and relatable!"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm maybe I'll give it a try. Who else was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ That one guy from How I Met Your Mother. What's his name?"
"__MOVIES__ Jason Segel?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, him! He's the funniest."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh I don't really think he's that funny."
"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding? You have to see him in this movie!"
"__MOVIES__ What is the movie about again?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a typical rom-com but a lot funnier and raunchier. I think you'll like it."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, fine. What theatres are showing it?"
"__MOVIES__ The theatre on Route 1 and the one downtown. I went to the one downtown."
"__MOVIES__ Okay cool. How much are tickets?"
"__MOVIES__ Matinee is $5 and regular tickets are $8 I think."
"__MOVIES__ That's not too bad. Maybe I'll take my boyfriend tomorrow night."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great idea! I bet you'll both enjoy it. Especially because Russell Brand is in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I do like Russell Brand!"
"__MOVIES__ See! You're going to love it."
"__MOVIES__ We'll see..."
