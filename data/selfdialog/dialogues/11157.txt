"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Worst team in the NFL this year. What are your thoughts?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How could I not say the Cleveland Browns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How could you not. I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They went one and fifteen last year and were lucky to win that one game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did they beat last year. I can't remember."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chargers. I believe it was the last game of the season as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was it. Crazy they won the last game of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're on a winning streak. Watch out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha. Yeah, they are bound to reel off seventeen in a row now and go 16 and 0 this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After all of the crazy things that have happened in 2016 and 2017, that would be the biggest shock of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. What other teams do you see as being horribly atrocious?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The teams that come to mind are the Jets, Chargers, and the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bears might be a little bit better. Didn't they just get a new quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not particularly any good ones. Glennon, I believe. They lost Cutler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh year, Cutler is gone. That's an upgrade just there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha. Pick six Cutler. He retired, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The bears did draft that Trubisky guy from North Carolina."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That guy is either the next Ben Roethlisberger or the next bust."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a bear. So, I'm going with a bust."
