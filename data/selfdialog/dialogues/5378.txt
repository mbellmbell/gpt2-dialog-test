"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Vader would have stayed good, had he not died in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not know, I think for a time."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was so powerful, so much force was in him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and it went dark, but Luke was powerful too."
"__STAR_WARS__ There was a scene, when he confronts Jabba, where he is wearing black clothes and looking murderous, do you think that showed he will turn bad?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it shows he has the capacity. It is a tight balance, good and evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish he would, maybe start a new line of siths."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Maul, maybe he could be the new him. Luke Maul."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am serious, then he could be in control of the balance."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not think one man having that much power is any control of the force."
