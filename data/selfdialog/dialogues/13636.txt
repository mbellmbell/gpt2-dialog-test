"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which NFL player really defied expectations last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think anyone expected Dak Prescott to do as well as he did"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And to lead the Cowboys into the playoffs with a legitimate chance at the Superbowl, too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think he had a lot of help from his teammates, but it's still impressive"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And if he hadn't done as well as he did, Tony Romo may not have retired"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel bad that Tony Romo never got the recognition that he deserved"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But then again, maybe it's the other players on the team that make both Prescott and Romo look good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it's hard not to do well when you have Jason Witten and Dez Bryant on your team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes sense when the team does noticably better when Dez is healthy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But either way, Prescott was set up to be a backup to Tony Romo, not take over the team as a rookie"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but they didn't have much of a choice when it was between him and Mark Sanchez"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was that who it was? It's so hard to keep track of where Sanchez is these days"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wasn't that bad of a player, but I don't think he'll ever live down the butt fumble"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I were him, I would laugh along with it until it wasn't a joke anymore"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And there hasn't really been anything since then to distract from it, despite some bad plays over the years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember seeing Desean Jackson try to reverse field and run back a kick or a punt, only to lose a ton of yards"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you blame someone for trying something that worked so well for him in the past?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not, but as a player you still have to know when to take chances like that or just cut your losses"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's easier for players to take the 25 yards for a touchback when most don't return it that far"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that may be but I still don't like that rule change, 20 yards was plenty before"
