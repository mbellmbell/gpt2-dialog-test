"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite movie them of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh that is difficult. I cannot think of one that I prefer the most."

"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, I can see that. It is classic and definitely catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it has spanned almost a century time."
"__MUSIC__ Almost. Not quite there yet though."
"__MUSIC__ Ok so can you think of one."
"__MUSIC__ Probably Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ Oh sure. Absolutely agree on that. The trumpets!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that music is so distinct and you can feel it in your soul."
"__MUSIC__ And you thought you didn't have a favorite movie tune."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I did. I really love the Star Wars theme."
"__MUSIC__ Who wrote it? I can't remember."
"__MUSIC__ John Williams. He wrote many movie themes."
"__MUSIC__ That's right. Talented man."
"__MUSIC__ Sure from the main theme to Darth Vadar's music he captured all the emotions of the film."
"__MUSIC__ The music for Darth Vadar always scared me a little bit."
"__MUSIC__ Yes that music is a bit foreboding."
"__MUSIC__ You know something bad is going to happen when it starts up."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you are right. It depicts his personality perfectly."
