"__BEATLES__ If you had to have a Beatles song played at your funeral what would it be?"
"__BEATLES__ My first, non-reflective answer is to say 'In My Life.' It's a retrospective of an entire life."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it's really a great song of love and memory. So poignant for a pop song."
"__BEATLES__ Mmm-hmm, it also has the right tempo and mood for a service like that. What would you go with?"
"__BEATLES__ 'You Won't See Me.' Ha! Ha! Ha!"
"__BEATLES__ You're kidding, right?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, of course. That'd be a little cruel."
"__BEATLES__ Okay, so what's your actual choice?"
"__BEATLES__ I think Let It Be would be my pick. It's also a really good retrospective and the lyrics are about dealing with pain and loss and depression."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that's a really good one. 'Have a number of great songs ready to play at your funeral' isn't a standard form of praise for a band, but it's so true in the case of The Beatles!"
