"__BASKETBALL__ What have you thought of the NBA playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They've been great - the best teams are coming out, obviously."
"__BASKETBALL__ Definitely, the Warriors and Cavs are really showing off what they have. No surprise, I suppose."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah - I think it's going to be a rematch of the last two years."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's hard to believe that those teams can remain on top for so long"
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron really is showing off how good he is. He's only 32 and has three championships and been in four other finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Something like that. It's crazy. I thought Steph Curry would be the next one, but he's only three years younger than Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ So do you think Lebron is the next Jordan?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, that's impossible, but he could have even more of a legacy due to social media and stuff now."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's shocking to see what younger kids are into and how influenced they are by social media."
"__BASKETBALL__ So what team are you rooting for?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'd like to see Lebron win again - but I don't really care about the team. What about you?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't care about the tournament as much, but it is interesting to see him win and win again."
"__BASKETBALL__ The outspokenness of many of the league stars is shocking to me."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it really comes out during the playoffs"
"__BASKETBALL__ Everyone seems to have their opinions and they are often out there."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's a lot different than the NHL playoffs, which are going on at the same time, where the players specifically talk about the game to the media."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's almost like the NBA players have a pre-made speech during their press conferences and only say what they want to, not answering questions."
"__BASKETBALL__ I saw that Durant said to not watch the playoffs if people thought they were boring."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah - that's shocking. I can't imagine one of your top players ever encouraging fans not to watch the playoffs."
