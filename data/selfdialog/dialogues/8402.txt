"__BEATLES__ Of the Beatles, do you consider yourself more of a John or a Paul fan?"
"__BEATLES__ I always loved John, the way he'd push the creative envelope. You just never knew what he'd do next."
"__BEATLES__ Now that you mention it, I could have seen that from the style of eyeglasses that you're wearing."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I love the look, but more the songs, like I Am the Walrus."
"__BEATLES__ How about his lesser known ones? Any I should know?"
"__BEATLES__ I always had a soft spot for Julia, from the White Album. It's so wistful."
"__BEATLES__ Good to know. I've always been more of a Paul person myself--just an incomparable body of work."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I can't deny he seemed to be a more disciplined writer with quite an ear for melody."
"__BEATLES__ And I think his solo work stands up better. Band on the Run is one of my favorite records of all time."
"__BEATLES__ Touche. But I'd gladly trade all of 1980s Paul for Imagine!"
