"__STAR_WARS__ So, something has been bothering me about Rey in the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like that one, I like where they're going with the new franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like it, too, but I'm still bothered by the fact that a girl who spends her time scavenging for parts in wrecked Emperial ships conveniently know how to operate and repair the Millennium Falcon."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, she spent her whole life in starships, so she would have learned firsthand."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but that doesn't make her a top notch pilot that can keep up with the likes of Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ She must have learned from Unkar Plutt, the guy who stole the Millennium Falcon."
"__STAR_WARS__ It just seems weird, the same guy who was willing to let her starve and who turned her over to the First Order also took the time to teach her how to pilot a plane?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She worked for him, it showed that her family left her with him in that flashback."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then why was he willing to let her go hungry if she didn't give him enough parts?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Just because she was left with him doesn't mean that he's kind, but she knew that he had added a compressor so obviously he had been teaching her about the workings of a starship."
