"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ I surely have. Classic movie."
"__DISNEY__ Indeed it was. Do you know if it was hand-drawn? I don't think it was computer animated."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, but I'd say hand draw. Gorgeous illustration though."
"__DISNEY__ Terrific music too. Who was your favourite character?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, definitely Gaston. He reminds me of myself."
"__DISNEY__ Ha! Hyper macho and manly?"
"__DISNEY__ You forgot 'devastatingly handsome.' I was rooting for him to win."
"__DISNEY__ That's ridiculous. The Beast is so charming... personality issues aside."
"__DISNEY__ I suppose. But Belle never did much for me either way."
