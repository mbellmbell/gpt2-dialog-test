"__MUSIC__ You ever hear of Devin Townsend?"
"__MUSIC__ nah, what band is he in?"
"__MUSIC__ He used to be in Strapping Young Lad - really popular industrial metal band from the early 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ Oh word, that sounds familiar. Didn't they break up?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he wanted some creative distance from such an angry outlet so he started a solo career."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of stuff does he make now then?"
"__MUSIC__ He dabbles in alot of genres - alot of melancholic rock in his early career but now he does ambient stuff, a country album, prog rock..."
"__MUSIC__ oh wow, reminds me of Ween a bit then. Alot of genre-hopping..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's accurate. He has some consistency between projects though so they blend together really well."
"__MUSIC__ So should I start at the beginning with him then?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Start with Ocean Machine - it's really heavy and sludgy and the best entry point."
"__MUSIC__ Word. And I should just go chronologically from there?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, his career has a specific trajectory that comes to light if you follow it from the beginning. If you dive in at the end it'll seem really strange."
"__MUSIC__ Strange how? Because of the cross-genre approach?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yes, but right now for instance he just finished a space opera starring puppets, and is going from that to a symphony."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, so it's a little tricky to figure out what the heck is going on unless I follow his work from the beginning?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah exactly - he has alot of recurring themes and in-jokes in his work that make his chaotic later output make way more sense."
"__MUSIC__ Gotcha, so listen to his stuff chronologically and pay attention to how things progress. What's the reward in all of it?"
"__MUSIC__ You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll scream - it's some of the craziest, most passionate, and inspirational music out there today."
"__MUSIC__ Haha well alright then, I'll get started now."
