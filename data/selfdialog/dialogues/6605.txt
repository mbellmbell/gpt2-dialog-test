"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think is prettier, Padme or Leia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say Padme was prettier, but Leia had a better personality."
"__STAR_WARS__ Leia definitely had some energy to her. She was the coolest."
"__STAR_WARS__ It kind of weirds me out when I think about her kiss with Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was no big deal. She was just trying to get Han's attention."
"__STAR_WARS__ He definitely got jealous."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and Luke just gloated. That was funny."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm glad that Han and Leia got together."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, but Ben didn't turn out too cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ He must have had a dark side nanny or babysitter when he was a kid, or maybe just too much of his grandfather in him."
