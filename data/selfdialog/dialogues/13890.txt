"__BASKETBALL__ What do you see the Raptors doing next year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know. I feel this organization is at a crossroads"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they have to figure out if the Lowry Demarr Derozan tandem is going to work going forward"
"__BASKETBALL__ I just feel like they can't get any further with this tandem"
"__BASKETBALL__ It may be time to move on from it"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but I think the organization is going to try and build from this"
"__BASKETBALL__ They picked up Serge Ibaka at the trading deadline and he played pretty well for them"
"__BASKETBALL__ That he did but he isn't enough to get over the hump in the East"
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly. This team needs 3 point shooting badly"
"__BASKETBALL__ They definitely do. They also seemed to be weak mentally"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah Lowry seems to fall apart in the big moments. I don't trust this team"
"__BASKETBALL__ Neither do I. They just seem to shrink against the big teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ Especially Cleveland. They always wet the bed against them."
"__BASKETBALL__ The pacers gave the Cavs more of a challenge then the Raptors did."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know that is embarrassing. That's why I would seriously consider changing the course of this team."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, but I do't think the organization has the stones to do it."
"__BASKETBALL__ They will just keep treading water. Happy with a 2nd round exit."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's why some organizations never really prosper"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they like to play it safe and that is not going to get it done"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep they will stay in the middle of the pack"
