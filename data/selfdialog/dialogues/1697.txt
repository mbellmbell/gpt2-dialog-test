"__MUSIC__ Heard any good songs lately? Seems like everything is so lame.."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmmm. not anything I loved. I saw a facebook video about Florence and The Machine and I liked her sound."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Is that the one that sings 'dog days'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I love the sound of her voice."
"__MUSIC__ I think I saw that video too. Is it the one where she is singing to the sick girl."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, that's it. Heartbreaking."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she's good, folksy, reminds me of Jewel or Sarah Mclaughlin."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. I've been listening to Bethel Music too. Rebecca Krause."
"__MUSIC__ Is that Christian music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, gives me goosebumps. I love 'It is Well'"
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check it out. Doesn't Bethel do 'Oceans'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's another one that gives me goosebumps."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of goosebumps.  I was listening to an oldie the other day. P-diddy and Faith Evans..'Missin you'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, I used to love that one, I forgot all about it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, seems like Faith Evans didn't do a lot but she has a pretty voice."
"__MUSIC__ She does, makes no sense who makes it and who doesn't."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Like Miley Cyrus, I mean her voice is ok. But doesnt blow me away."
"__MUSIC__ And Sia..what is that all about?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw her on James Cardon. She has a good voice. The whole not showing her face is like a publicity thing."
"__MUSIC__ It's still weird."
