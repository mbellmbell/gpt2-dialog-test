"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many superbowls have there been?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hm, well the NFL has been around for almost 100 years, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I don't think superbowls started when the NFL started."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's weird, I wonder why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess they didn't come up with the superbowl yet until later."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definetely, I think the first one was in 1967."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Darn, that's 40 something years after the NFL formed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think only a handful of teams have ever won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definetely, it's unlikely all 32 have won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, just from a probability standpoint."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Packers have won the most."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, Patriots in a close second, probably."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots? I would say the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, they're good but they aren't THAT good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know 27 superbowls have been in only 3 cities?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Miami."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's interesting, places that are already extremely populated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the superbowl stats are so interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, they are."
