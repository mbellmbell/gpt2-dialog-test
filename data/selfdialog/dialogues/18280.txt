"__MOVIES__ What's the best Quentin Tarrantino movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm, tough call-- he's got a lot of good stuff.  I'm going to say Jackie Brown."
"__MOVIES__ You don't hear that choice very often.  I'll say Pulp Fiction for mine."
"__MOVIES__ Excellent movie, and yeah, Jackie Brown is overlooked a lot, but I think it's excellent-- the plot, the pacing, the acting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was my first exposure to Pam Grier, and she killed it."
"__MOVIES__ I like his portion in 4 Rooms, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'd go so far to say as the other three segments kinda sucked."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I could do without them, despite really liking Tim Roth."
"__MOVIES__ That's the problem with a concept like that-- Roth is the only recurring character in each segment, but his personality is radically different from segment to segment."
"__MOVIES__ That's the risk you run with a concept like that, with 4 different directors that have different styles and stories."
"__MOVIES__ You know what movie of Tarantino's I didn't really care for?  Kill Bill."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, both of those are ok, but give me Pulp Fiction, give me Reservoir Dogs-- Kill Bill isn't even close."
"__MOVIES__ True Romance is an underrated gem too."
"__MOVIES__ I recently read the comic that Clarence is reading to Alabama on their date."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, you've seen that movie a lot of times if you can recall that bit of detail."
"__MOVIES__ Is 900 times a lot?"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, at least it's not Crossroads, with Britney Spears."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I've seen that 1000 times."
"__MOVIES__ So, you really like Britney Spears?"
"__MOVIES__ Eh, not that much, but I do like Taryn Manning.  She's pretty great in Hustle and Flow."
