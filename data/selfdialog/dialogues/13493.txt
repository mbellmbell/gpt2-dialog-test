"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been to an NFL game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No but I really want to go. It is just so expensive!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year Jets and Dolphins tickets were going for $10."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, let me rephrase. It is expensive to see a team I care about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aren't you a Pats fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Very much so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I guess you will never be finding cheap tickets then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No and that's the problem. But it's okay. I watch on TV as much as I can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't imagine you see a lot of games in your area."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is hit or miss. I got a lot last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least you have post season every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not a given, but yes it's been pretty good lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lately? When is the last time the Pats haven't the your division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it was in 2008."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is crazy! And wasn't that the year Brady was hurt?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and they still had a great record, but they lost the tiebreaker I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Since Brady started, haven't the Pats almost won all the division titles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every year except for 2002 and the year he was hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As much as I hate to admit it, that is really impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. It makes being a fan kind of easy."
