"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, what's going on?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not a whole lot. I'm looking forward to the weekend, though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you have any big plans?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. I'm going to Wrigley Field on Saturday."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Aren't the Cubs out of town?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, but there's a big concert at Wrigley this weekend."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh nice! Who's playing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Pearl Jam is headlining the Saturday night show."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow, Pearl Jam! I remeber when I got their first CD, Ten, at the record store at Harlem and Irving Plaza."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh right. I remember that record store."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was called Rolling Stone, and they went out of business many years ago."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh that's too bad. I really loved taking the bus to Harlem and Irving and visiting that store."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too. We didn't have the internet back then and had to discover new music the hard way."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Haha yes! I remember 'discovering' Nirvana before they got famous."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Those were the good old days."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes they were. I need to dig up my old Sony disc player and pop in an old CD."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Where did the time go? Pearl Jam is 25 years old already!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It seems like only yesterday that the grunge music movement took over."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Right. I bet everyone at the concert will be in their forty's."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No doubt! Well, I hope you have a great time at the concert!"
