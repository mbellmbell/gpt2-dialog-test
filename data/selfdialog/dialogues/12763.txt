"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What teams do you think could compete for an NFL title this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but the AFC looks stronger to me, overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As strong as the Cowboys were last year, that seems harsh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's fair. And I can't rule out the Packers or Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you still prefer the AFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you start with the Patriots, then have perennially competitive teams like Baltimore and Pittsburgh, and add in Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really think Baltimore has a shot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, Flacco is still decent, and I never underestimate Ozzie Newsome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Flacco needs weapons, and those wide receivers are pretty thin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right now, yeah, but a lot rests on how Breshad Perriman develops."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is he even starting this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's penciled into an outside spot, with Maclin in the slot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do they make up for losing Dennis Pitta, though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, a lot of that will have to come from Maclin and Perriman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't even know who their tight end is, now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a few B-listers, Ben Watson and Maxx Williams, for example."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not a very inspiring list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping they'll take a look at Gary Barnidge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why didn't the Browns bring him back, anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I assume they just want a roster full of young guys for the rebuild."
