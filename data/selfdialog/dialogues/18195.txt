"__MOVIES__ I just watched all The Hobbit movies. I can't believe the same people were responsible for The Lord of the Rings!"
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of understandable, the movies did have a troubled production."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't make them more fun to watch!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not saying it does, just that Peter Jackson sort of got a raw deal on them."
"__MOVIES__ What're you talking about? If he didn't want to do the movies, he shouldn't have."
"__MOVIES__ Originally Guillermo del Toro was supposed to direct, but it didn't work out so Warner Bros. called in Jackson."
"__MOVIES__ He should've turned them down then."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe so, but would you in his situation? Everyone was ready to go; there were jobs on the line."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose it's nice that he took up the cause then, but the movies didn't turn out well anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Still, that's more Warner Bros. fault again. Originally it was only supposed to be two movies, if you can believe that."
"__MOVIES__ Two seems like a lot to begin with. Why did they split it into three?"
"__MOVIES__ Simple, really. The head honchos wanted more money."
"__MOVIES__ You can kind of tell. For all the buildup Smaug gets, he only briefly appears in the second film, and is killed off like 20 minutes into the last one."
"__MOVIES__ The movies are kind of weirdly paced. I think it's because they had to pull a lot of other material from The Silmarillion to pad it out."
"__MOVIES__ And you don't think Jackson deserves some of the blame for that?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. If you watch The Making Of features, you can tell he was a guy who was laying down the tracks as the train right behind."
"__MOVIES__ You're saying the production was so troubled he was mapping everything out only days or weeks ahead of filming?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe not exactly like that, but something along those lines. It's really amazing the films came out as good as they did, honestly."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I was a little too hard on him, but still, some of the CGI in that looks really bad."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like I said, the production was very troubled. Almost all of your complaints can be explained by that."
