"__DISNEY__ Did you buy Beauty and the Beast yet?"
"__DISNEY__ Not yet.  I'm trying to not let my daughter know it came out yet."
"__DISNEY__ Why's that?"
"__DISNEY__ I would rather wait for the Blu-Ray to get a bit cheaper."
"__DISNEY__ How much is it at Target?"
"__DISNEY__ $25 I think.  Seems expensive."
"__DISNEY__ If you want, you can borrow my copy."
"__DISNEY__ It's okay, I'm sure we'll get around to it."
"__DISNEY__ Alright.  Besides, you know she's going to watch it about a billion times once you get it."
"__DISNEY__ No joke, don't remind me!"
