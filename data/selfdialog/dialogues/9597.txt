"__COMEDY__ Hey, do you like funny movies?"
"__COMEDY__ Oh yea, my favorite is Bridesmaids with Melissa McCarthy. She is hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ I know, she cracks me up. My favorite part of that movie was where Lillian crapped in the street."
"__COMEDY__ HAHA, yes! Maya Rudolph nailed it. Did you know that was her husband in real life who plays the air marshall."
"__COMEDY__ Wow that is awesome. I couldnt work with my husband."
"__COMEDY__ Oh girl me either, but if he were funny like the air marshall, or if Wilson Phillips were part of it I probably could."
"__COMEDY__ Right? The end there was great too, where they all did the dance."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yes, and the take one with the sandwich and video camera. I really could watch this movie over and over."
"__COMEDY__ Me too. And if i could go by the cops and not get pulled over, while 'look no one is driving' or littering, wouldnt it be great?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes it would, unfortunatley we arent rich and famous!!"
