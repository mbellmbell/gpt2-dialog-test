"__COMEDY__ So what are we gonna watch tonight?"
"__COMEDY__ How about a comedy movie? I've got Ghostbusters, Space Jam, The Great Muppet Caper..."
"__COMEDY__ Which Ghostbusters? I heard there's a new one."
"__COMEDY__ The original."
"__COMEDY__ And Space Jam...that's the one with Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, right?"
"__COMEDY__ That's right."
"__COMEDY__ Hmmm...I'm not sure whether I wanna see Space Jam or The Great Muppet Caper."
"__COMEDY__ I've got a few others, if you wanna see."
"__COMEDY__ Nah. I guess I'm in a Muppet mood."
"__COMEDY__ Alright. The Great Muppet Caper it is, then."
