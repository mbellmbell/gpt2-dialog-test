"__MUSIC__ Are you doing anything Friday and Saturday?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking about going to a free music festival on either Friday or Saturday, and wanted to know if you wanted to come."
"__MUSIC__ FREE? Oh, I like free things! Yes, either day is fine. What kind of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It says both local and national bands. Some of them are Urban Tropic, Trevor Hall, Jack McIntosh and Company."
"__MUSIC__ Where's it at?"
"__MUSIC__ Cincinnati, Ohio. It's at a top outdoor venue called Sawyer Point, and the festival is called Paradise on the Point."
"__MUSIC__ And it's free? No admission charge?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, it's free. Well, except of course for food and drinks at the vender stands, and beer."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, count me in. I love free festivals because they attract a lot of people."
"__MUSIC__ This one is being billed as all ages and a family festival where kids are welcome."
"__MUSIC__ All ages, but they are selling beer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it didn't say anything about having a sectioned area to drink, just that you had to be 21 to drink and there would be lots of craft beers."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds really nice."
"__MUSIC__ It looks gorgeous in the pictures. The stage is a half shell, and it's by a lake, with a grassy area."
"__MUSIC__ There is nothing better than being outside in the summer time next to a lake."
"__MUSIC__ There's what looks like a huge bridge nearby, and the picture was so pretty I could just imagine how nice it would be!"
"__MUSIC__ I like outdoor concerts because you can enjoy the sunshine and fresh air and scenery while you listen to the music."
"__MUSIC__ It looks like a wide variety of performers, I was really interested in one called The Infamous Stringdusters."
"__MUSIC__ We definitely have to check this out."
