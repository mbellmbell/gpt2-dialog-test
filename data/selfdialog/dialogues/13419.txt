"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Dolphins stand a chance this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ honestly, I do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why, did they even make the playoffs last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure did, they played in the first round against the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yea, they lost that game. So what makes you think anything will be different next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well look at how they did it last year. They had a rookie head coach in Adam Gase."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but that doesn't mean anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember how they started out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Terribly if I recall correctly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You do, they started out with a 1-4 record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yea, then won a bunch right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True story, they won 9 of their next ten games and made the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is fairly impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, and they secured most of their core players from last season for this upcoming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they get any big names."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not this year, but I think that's a huge difference, they don't need playmakers, they need team players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't they have Suh on the D-line?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure do, he's a monster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea he is, nobody is running him over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, he does the running over."
