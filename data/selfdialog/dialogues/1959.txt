"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Slowdive's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I thought they stopped making music after the '90s."
"__MUSIC__ Yup! It's their first album since Pygmalion, which was in 1995."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I loved that album, although my favorite is Souvlaki. What's the new one called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's self-titled."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Surprisingly, yeah. I'm usually skeptical when a band comes together after a long break like that."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think of My Bloody Valentine's 2013 album?"
"__MUSIC__ I hated it."
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was okay. It's self-titled too, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it's called MBV."
"__MUSIC__ Loveless will always be the best shoegaze album to exist."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I personally like Isn't Anything a lot better."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't Anything is good, but Loveless means a lot to me."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song on the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely 'I Only Said'."
"__MUSIC__ Nice, I really like that song too. Aren't they from the UK?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think they're Irish."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I thought all shoegaze from back then was British."
"__MUSIC__ I thought so too for a while! Even Slowdive is English."
