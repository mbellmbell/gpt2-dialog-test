"__DISNEY__ My kids watched Mary Poppins for the first time yesterday, while they were sick."
"__DISNEY__ That is a great movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. It really stands the test of time."
"__DISNEY__ I think it was Dick Van Dyke's greatest performance."
"__DISNEY__ Julie Andrews is amazing too."
"__DISNEY__ I always thought Mary Poppins and Bert were boyfriend and girlfriend, but I heard a theory that she was actually Bert's governess."
"__DISNEY__ I've heard that theory too, but it doesn't feel right to me, you know?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it doesn't feel like that kind of relationship to me either."
"__DISNEY__ Anyway, now my kids are begging me to add sugar to their children's Tylenol."
"__DISNEY__ As kids, I'm pretty sure we begged for that that too."
