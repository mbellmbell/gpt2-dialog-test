"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the latest star wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one? Force awakens?"
"__MOVIES__ No, rogue one."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good, I really liked the scene where darth vader went all crazy."
"__MOVIES__ At the end? Yeah he took it to the rebels."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty dark though."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I liked it about, like how Empire was dark."
"__MOVIES__ True, I just wish there were more lightsaber fights."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the ending made up for it though."
"__MOVIES__ And especially when vader looks out at the leaving ship very pissed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! I wonder if they are going to do more one-off movies like this in star wars universe."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, probably now that Disney owns it they'll be doing something with it."
"__MOVIES__ Lucas really did start to mess up all his great movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, have you seen the ET edit where the cops are chasing the kids with walky talkies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's hilarious! Or the worst in the pub with Han."
"__MOVIES__ Han shot first!"
"__MOVIES__ I hope Disney does something with the game side things."
"__MOVIES__ The movies at least are great."
"__MOVIES__ Force awakens was kind of just a remake of the first one."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean?"
