"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the movie 'Cloud Atlas'?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I read the book."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't even know it was a book."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, it was a big bestseller. That's why they made the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I see. How did you like the book."
"__MOVIES__ It was actually pretty awesome! I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. The movie was only OK, I thought."
"__MOVIES__ Then they must not have adapted it well, because the book was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ The movie wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. Just not amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Did the story kind of follow different characters throughout time?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that's how it went."
"__MOVIES__ Who were the stars of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Tom Hanks was probably the biggest name."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, you're saying it was a Tom Hanks movie and an adaptation of Cloud Atlas, and you didn't like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that's what I'm saying."
"__MOVIES__ That surprises me. That sounds like a recipe for success."
"__MOVIES__ Not according to me! You might think differently."
"__MOVIES__ I would be interested in seeing it, yeah."
"__MOVIES__ If you like it, then maybe you just think the concept is cooler than I do."
"__MOVIES__ That's possible."
