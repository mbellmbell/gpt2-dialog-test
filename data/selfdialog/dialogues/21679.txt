"__DISNEY__ Did you see the live version of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I did."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think of it?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was really well done."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, I was afraid they would mess it up."
"__DISNEY__ I was too, but they kept it really similar to the cartoon version."
"__DISNEY__ I thought the casting was excellent!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, so did I.  Emma Watson was great as Belle."
