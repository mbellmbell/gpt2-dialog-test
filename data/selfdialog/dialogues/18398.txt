"__MOVIES__ Did you watch Boyhood?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes, I loved it! I can't believe it didnt win the Academy Award for Best Picture."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! It was way better than Birdman!"
"__MOVIES__ That was really awesome that they filmed it over 12-13 years."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really identified with it a lot I think because you kind of process what it is like watching the same characters age in real time."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was better than Before Midnight."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I thought Before Midnight wasn't that great. But I really Like Before Sunrise and Before Sunset."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, those are two of my favorite movies. I got excited when I saw Ethan Hawke in Boyhood."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, did you think he was playing Jesse?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! At first I thought this was the family he left behind for Celine. But there was a daughter, which wasn't the case for Jesse."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the same too. I wouldnt have been surprised if Richard Linklater had made that the case."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I guess he wanted Boyhood to be its own, special thing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Patricia Arquette was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I haven't seen her in anything for years. I didnt know she was still acting."
"__MOVIES__ What other movies is she in?"
"__MOVIES__ True Romance, Lost Highway, and probably more I can't think of."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I havent seen those movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They are both good. Not as good as Boyhood, but entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Lost Highway a David Lynch film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It is really trippy, as you would expect!"
