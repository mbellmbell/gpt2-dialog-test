"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the new Ghostbusters movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I really don't like all those remakes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well it wasn't really a remake."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, it's not like it used the same characters."
"__MOVIES__ No, but it followed the same story line."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was a totally different idea."
"__MOVIES__ How do you figure?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the ghostbusters were girls."
"__MOVIES__ It's still pretty much a remake."
"__MOVIES__ Well, why did you like the original so much."
"__MOVIES__ Because it was original."
"__MOVIES__ Every idea borrows from something else."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ There's really no original idea with movies."
"__MOVIES__ Ghostbusters was original!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think that was the first movie with people trying to catch ghosts?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the first I had heard of."
