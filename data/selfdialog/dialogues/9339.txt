"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Cardinals game on Wednesday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that was a tough loss."
"__BASEBALL__ I know!  They have been doing so well lately.  It kind of derailed them."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they will bounce back tonight against the Giants though"
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. They started off very rocky, but they are turning things around."
"__BASEBALL__ That they are.  Aren't they leading the Central right now"
"__BASEBALL__ I believe so.  But I would have to check."
"__BASEBALL__ I honestly don't care who is leading the Central as long as it isn't the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ I know right?  They win 1 World Series in over 100 years and suddenly they have millions of fans!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, bandwagon fans at best."
"__BASEBALL__ Right?  Did you see the Reds troll them?"
"__BASEBALL__ I saw that video, that was great.  I haven't laughed that hard in a while."
"__BASEBALL__ Me either!"
"__BASEBALL__ Who do you have going for it all this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Well in the AL the Yankees are very dominate, as much as I hate to say it.  NL is a complete toss up, but it is still early."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I don't think the Yankees will stay this strong."
"__BASEBALL__ Me either, but who knows, it is very early in the season.  Ask me again after the All-Star Break."
"__BASEBALL__ I can do that.  You going to any games this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I have tickets to a few this year, what about you?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nah, unless you have an extra ticket!"
