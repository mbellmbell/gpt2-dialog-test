"__MOVIES__ Did you hear they're making another Jurassic Park movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  Are they really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, It's going to be called Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe they're still making these movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know!  I really liked Jurassic World."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I think anything with Chris Pratt is great."
"__MOVIES__ I like him too, but I still think the original Jurassic Park is the best."
"__MOVIES__ You always say stuff like that, always nostalgic for old stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was my favorite movie growing up, what do you want from me?"
"__MOVIES__ Jurassic World was way better, and you know that."
"__MOVIES__ It goes Jurassic Park, The lost world, Jurassic World, then Jurassic Park 3."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree.  I think it's Jurassic World, the lost world, Jurassic Park, and then Jurassic Park 3."
"__MOVIES__ Agree to disagree. I'm excited for the new one though, I think it'll be good."
"__MOVIES__ I know nothing about it, but just looked it up, and they already have a 6th movie planned."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  That just got me super excited."
"__MOVIES__ Right?  Regardless of the order we put them in, at least we can agree that we're happy they're still making it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, can't argue that."
"__MOVIES__ Did you want to go see the new one together when it comes out?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, when does it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ It's scheduled for June 2018, so we'll see."
