"__HARRY_POTTER__ So why did Harry break the Elder Wand?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't think he wanted the responsibility of it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I took it as he didn't want anyone to have responsibility for it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ By tossing it off the bridge, he thought he could the trouble."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess it did work out, right?  I mean he did have a family"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You mean the scene at the end at the train station?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, seems like his son was scared to go off alone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm sure it was scary.  I really liked what Harry said to him though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Makes you wonder if they'll make a movie about him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would pay to see it!"
