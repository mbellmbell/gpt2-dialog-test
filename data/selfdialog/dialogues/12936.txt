"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's only a couple more months and then the wait is finally over!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You must be talking about football season, I can't wait to see how my team does this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your team? I'm a big Jets fan...sadly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sorry to hear that!  I'm a Giants fan, but I do pull for the Jets as long as their not playing eachother."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel the same way.  Growing up my father was a Giants fan and my Grandfather was a Jets fan, so I always pull for both."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember the one year when they thought there would be a 'subway series' between the 2 teams!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that was back in 2008, that would of been amazing if it happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least the Giant's have won a few superbowls and who could forget the most recent in 2012."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yes, I did love that the Giants beat the patriots that year; I can't stand the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either, they are cheaters and I hope they do horrible this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do too, however unfortunately it seems like they'll never have a loosing season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like Tom Brady, he's so cocky and then there's the whole 'deflate gate'!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is such a loser and I hate that people from Boston will defend him till the day they die."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Once a cheater always a cheater; thats why they call the coach BeliCHEAT!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like that guy either, remember the scandal where he got caught filming the Jets during practice??"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How could I forget it! That just shows they need to cheat in order to succeed, I just hope the Jets beat them at least once this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure they will, they usually win one and loose the other against the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be in the Superbowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough to say before the season starts, but I'd love to see Jets vs. Giants in my lifetime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HA! Me too, but then we can't be friends anymore lol."
