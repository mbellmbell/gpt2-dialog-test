"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the original Star Wars trilogy best or the newer films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they're all good in their own right, but I tend to prefer the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ But the new movies don't have the same great writing or inventiveness and the acting is miserable by comparison!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wouldn't say that Mark Hamil was particularly talented, would you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really, no.  But Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford gave classic performances!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true but part of that could just be nostalgia for a film series that was so innovative and new compared to other sci-fi movies from earlier eras."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true.  And the new movies do have excellent production quality and provide interesting background and cool story arc advancement."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree.  I like that the origins of Darth Vader were made clear along with the fall of the Jedi.  I also like seeing the resurgence of the Rebels."
"__STAR_WARS__ But don't you think there were some things that just didn't fit in with the Anakin Skywalker storyline?  Like the Gungans, for example?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do agree that it seems like George Lucas just wanted another Ewok-like culture to drive sales, as the Gungans really were not essential to the story.  But they provided an impetus for Amadala's actions in Episode 1, even if it was a weak one."
