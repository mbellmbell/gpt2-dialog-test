"__MOVIES__ Do you like the Paranomormal Activity movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I did at first."
"__MOVIES__ What happened?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just really like Found Footage movies."
"__MOVIES__ What's a found footage movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, it's a movie that is supposed to look like it's real, like you literally found the footage of some regular person and watched it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right. Ok that makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, so I've been a fan of found footage since The Blair Witch Project, it lets me get into the movie a lot easier."
"__MOVIES__ Yea same here."
"__MOVIES__ But yea, the first paranormal activity had me on the edge of my seat the entire time because I was waiting for something crazy to happen."
"__MOVIES__ Only the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, because after that first one, I could of understood nothing big was going to happen."
"__MOVIES__ Yea the movie is really more about anticipation."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but anticipation only works if you don't know what's coming next."
"__MOVIES__ True, but you don't know whats coming next in the other ones."
"__MOVIES__ Not necessarily, but I had low expectations, and they ended up being right."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I guess you're right, they are all pretty much the same."
"__MOVIES__ Yea they really are."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm sure they are going to make another, maybe it will be better."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't hold my breath."
