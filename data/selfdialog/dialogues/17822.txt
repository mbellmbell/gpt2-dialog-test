"__MOVIES__ So, you told me Mama Mia is you favorite movie musical--any others?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, yes, they are ones that most everybody probably likes."
"__MOVIES__ Such as?"
"__MOVIES__ Phantom of the Opera--my wife and I saw it together and sat in the theater not knowing if the other enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ And?"
"__MOVIES__ We both loved it."
"__MOVIES__ And what did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ What's not to like--the music, the plot, the costumes, the grandeur..."
"__MOVIES__ And Emmy Rossum."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, my goodness, she is so beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ But she didn't do the singing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but she's such an angel."
"__MOVIES__ And now she's in Shameless."
"__MOVIES__ Not quite an angel, but still beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Back to Phantom--have you seen it on stage."
"__MOVIES__ No, but hope to someday;  I've seen a televised production."
"__MOVIES__ Not quite the same."
"__MOVIES__ No; we did see Mama Mia on stage--not as good as the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what other movie musicals do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ We'll have to save that for another day."
