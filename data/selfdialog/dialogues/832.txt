"__MUSIC__ Do you like Bruno Mars?"
"__MUSIC__ I love Bruno Mars, actually."
"__MUSIC__ He has so much style. His new songs are great."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I do enjoy his music. Every new thing he puts out is awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I've liked him since the biginning. My wife actually made me buy her his first CD."
"__MUSIC__ I would have guessed that if you'd buy the CD it had been because of your daughter."
"__MUSIC__ I know. But my wife fell in love with the song 'Just The Way You Are'."
"__MUSIC__ And how was the rest of the CD?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I must say that I had it in the car for a while and I heard it all the time. Every song had something interesting."
"__MUSIC__ So you listened to it more that your wife did at the end?"
"__MUSIC__ You could say that. But I am not ashamed."
"__MUSIC__ No body is saying that you should feel ashamed. It's just interesting to know that you are a devoted Bruno Mars fan."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the guy has talent, and I am open to hear all the music that sound enjoyable to me."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, ok... no need to get touchy."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! all of this is just funny. Any way, you know that he is coming to town for a show soon."
"__MUSIC__ Is he? You wouldn't miss it for the world I would assume."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't. But talking to my wife yesterday we were thinking that you and Mary should come with us."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a fun plan."
"__MUSIC__ So we can count you in? It is next weekend."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. See you soon."
