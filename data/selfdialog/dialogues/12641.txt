"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bro, if you had to take one quarterback this year, who would it be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man that's a tough question, it's gotta be either Rodgers or Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You gotta pick one to take you to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll go with Brady, he's probably the best quarterback to ever play the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would argue that he isn't, I think he just got with a great coach at a perfect time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy has won 5 super bowls and owns so many records. You're crazy if you don't think he's the best"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the best way to look at it is when he was hurt that one season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When he tore his ACL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he gets hurt, and Matt Cassel comes in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the Cassel that was terrible in Kansas City?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes indeed. The same Matt Cassel that has now played terribly on 5 more NFL teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what's your point?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Cassel came in and led the Patriots to an 11-5 record.  And put up some great stats doing it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I remember that, I think they franshise tagged him after that year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, he was awesome for the Patriots, got a big contract playing somewhere else, then was terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what does that have to do with Brady not being the best ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's pretty clear that Belichek is the great one here, and can win with anyone under center."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's done it for so long though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All I'm saying is, there's better quarterbacks out there, like Rodgers, who havent had the advantage of having the best coach of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agree to disagree."
