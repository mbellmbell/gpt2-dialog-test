"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey bud, who you got this year, Pats or Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seahawks, what are you smoking, they wont even make it past the wild card game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, ok so who do you think is going to make the superbowl then"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its going to be atlanta again.  Matt ryan has a chip on his shoulder after last years game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You may be right.  If they do make i back i at least hope that they get a rematch with the patriots so they can avenge that horrible loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't care so much about that, id rather not take the chance of the pats getting another ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you hate the Pats that much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really hate them i guess, but i like it better when there aren't dynasties in sports.  Spread the wins around a bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That can be boring though, i like when you have a team that you know is just dominant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as it isnt the Pats im good.  I dont mind when a team from a certain division wins the division several years in a row."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah like the packers, ill always root for them since im not a bears or lions fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the vikings?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do like the vikings, and their stadium is AWESOME, have you seen pictures of it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah its almost a rival of jerry world.  Just incredible how opulent they are making them now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything to get the people to come watch the games i guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that fans arent supporting the NFL for some reason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not necessariliy, i just know that it costs a TON to go to the stadium to watch a game, so you have to do something to make it worth the amount you have to pay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true, i guess its not really something that the average family could afford.  Easier to just watch it on TV too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are making a lot of money on TV deals since so many people are choosing to watch that way now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its crazy the revenue that is generated."
