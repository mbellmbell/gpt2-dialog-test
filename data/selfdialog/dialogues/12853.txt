"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you like more? The beginning of the NFL season, or the end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the beginning of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? The end of the season is just one big party."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the beginning of the season holds so much possibility."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibility for what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibility for everything and everyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going to need some examples."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the beginning of the season, you don't know if there is going to be a Cnderella team who is just magically good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you have a point.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You also don't know which rookies are going to have amazing seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess the speculation around that is pretty fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the beginning of the season you get to have a NFL fantasy draft too, and that comes with it's own possibilities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really like fantasy football, I just like watching the football games on tv,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, regardless, for other people that's still one of the things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, yeah I guess. But the end of the season is so fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not for everyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not fun if your team doesn't make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't think about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it's okay to like either."
