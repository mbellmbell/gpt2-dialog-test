"__MOVIES__ Did you watch anything good lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I introduced my boyfriend to Star Wars over the weekend. He had never seen them before!"
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy! What did he think?"
"__MOVIES__ Well we just watched the first one, but he enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ By the first one do you mean A New Hope?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, we're watching the original three movies before we start on the prequels."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably for the best."
"__MOVIES__ How are you going to watch Rogue One and The Force Awakens with the others?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess we'll just watch those last and keep seeing them in the order they came out."
"__MOVIES__ So in the version that you saw, who shot first in the cantina scene."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember which edition we watched but Han reacted."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, that's not right!"
"__MOVIES__ I had to explain my frustration about it."
"__MOVIES__ Are you going to watch the Holiday Special?"
"__MOVIES__ I had not considered that!"
"__MOVIES__ You should, to really get the full experience."
"__MOVIES__ It's so bad though."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's charming in a way."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it does have that Boba Fett cartoon."
"__MOVIES__ And it has that great cooking show."
