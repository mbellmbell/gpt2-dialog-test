"__MOVIES__ So have you felt super hero fatigue with all of the Marvel movies yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, I expected to, but not really."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow that is not the answer I was expecting."
"__MOVIES__ It's mostly because Marvel has done a great job of making me care."
"__MOVIES__ Explain what you mean please."
"__MOVIES__ Well with the connected universe, it feels like one giant big budget television show."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah I guess I never saw it that way."
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely, knowing that after I finish a movie, I'll get to see those characters progress into another movie, years ahead is great."
"__MOVIES__ I never really looked at it as a TV show, just kind of bombarding us with the same movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's what is so exciting, knowing that Guardians of the Galaxy is happening in the same universe as Spiderman and we will get to see them cross."
"__MOVIES__ That is definitely really cool now that I think about it."
"__MOVIES__ And it's been really neat to see less popular heroes get center stage, like Dr. Strange."
"__MOVIES__ And to see lesser ones like Guardians become mega hits, definitely agree."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, Guardians of the Galaxy was a super niche super hero group until now."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah now we can't escape Groot, he's like the Minions."
"__MOVIES__ Hey you take that back, baby Groot is precious."
"__MOVIES__ Oh he totally is, it's just crazy how good Marvel is at marketing their product."
"__MOVIES__ They're the best in the business, and it's crazy to watch DC struggle to try and catch up."
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely is, it's almost sad."
"__MOVIES__ Though they got their hit with Wonder Woman, so that's exciting."
