"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, ultimately I really don't think the prequels were necessary."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they're all premised around Anakin turning into Darth Vader, which really isn't much of a story.  At least, not one that needed THREE movies to tell."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but he's a pivot character in the story arc."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ahh.. I don't really buy that.  Yeah, in Empire and Jedi he's big, but in the first film he's pretty much just a lapdog of a Grand Moff Tarkin.  He even orders Vader around like a minion in a few scenes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm.. not sure.. been awhile since I've seen the first film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, there's a scene where Vader's choking a guy out for insulting the force and the Admiral is like, 'That's enough.' And Vader STOPS what he's doing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Doesn't happen in the second film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the Admiral guy, in fact everyone on board the Death Star died, so yeah."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the story of Anakin's fall could have been good, they just should have handled it differently."
