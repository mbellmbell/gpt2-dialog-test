"__MOVIES__ What is your guilty pleasure movie"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, for sure it's the Wizard of Oz"
"__MOVIES__ Wow that is really a classic, but why guilty pleasure?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess a lot of people consider it to be an old film, seeing as it's from the 30's"
"__MOVIES__ I can see how that can be a turn off. How did you first start watching this movie"
"__MOVIES__ I used to watch it with a family member of mine"
"__MOVIES__ who?"
"__MOVIES__ My Grandma, she actually used to know Judy Garland way back in the day. Right after she starred in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's amazing. Whats your favorite part of the film then?"
"__MOVIES__ It would have to be when dorothy first lands in munchkin land"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's still a breath taking scene. Those colors!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, especially for the time it was release, the colors were amazing"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the scene with the tin man"
"__MOVIES__ oh you mean the song and dance number"
"__MOVIES__ yes that one!"
"__MOVIES__ it's such a classic! If I only had a heart is my favorite song from the movie"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I prefer the Cowardly Lions song"
"__MOVIES__ Is there a reason for that?"
"__MOVIES__ The lyrics are so much more hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ Well i can't argue with you there."
