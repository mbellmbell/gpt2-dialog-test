"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did Titans pick up any WRs? They sorely needed some"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mariota is useless withotu anyone to throw the ball to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously Titans have the worst receiving crew if you ask me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. They're pretty bad. They picked up that WR from WMU, what's his name?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, Corey Davis!, he was a beast at WMU."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NCAA FBA Division I Career receiving leader. 5278 yards"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of ALL time, going back to whenever they started tracking it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude was a beast at WMU, but he was realy the only WR they had so they had to use him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they had other options, but none were as good as Davis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i wonder how well he will do with Mariota"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least he will be able to catch his ball unliek Titan's current WRs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard Davis scored 31 on Wonderlic test."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, That's pretty high for a WR. They usually range 17 or so"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, usually QBs have high Wonderlic scores."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The lowest score ever in the NFL was Morris Claireborne who got a 4."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Janitors score 14..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. We're talking borderline retarded. 10 is the cut off for being literate, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, good thing he's good at football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably won't be able to do much else."
