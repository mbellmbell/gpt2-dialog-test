"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the new Star Wars Movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue One? Yes I have."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't you just love it?!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do! I have to admit I cried a couple of times."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me to. I cried when I thought Cassian had died."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one is Cassian again?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The actor was Diego Luna."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! I remember."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also cried when Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen, died as well."
