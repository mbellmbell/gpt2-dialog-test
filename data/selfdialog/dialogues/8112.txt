"__POP__ I've been listening to Taylor Swift lately and I actually like it."
"__POP__ I like some of hers but my favorite right now is Arianna Grande."
"__POP__ Yeah, after the bombing she got a lot of attention.  I hadn't really heard of her music until then."
"__POP__ So what did you think of it?"
"__POP__ I liked it.  It's just not as intense as I prefer."
"__POP__ I guess it is more for a younger crowd.  Do you like Justin Timberlake?"
"__POP__ oh yes!  I forgot about him!"
"__POP__ He is really good!  What about that song Can't Stop the Feeling?"
"__POP__ I love that!  I like to play it in the mornings when I need to get going but am feeling really down and sluggish."
"__POP__ It's the perfect song to get you up and feeling good for the day!"
