"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL season begins on September 07, 2017 this year, and I can't wait."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really? Do you know which teams will be playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I know who is playing. It's my favorite team that won the Superbowl last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you talking about the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absoultely!! They will be playing against the Chiefs. I will be watching front center row."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the Chiefs are a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the Patriots are number one in my book, they have been my favorite team since the beginning. Who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a fan of the Greenbay Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Greenbay? They haven't won a superbowl since 2011 when they played against the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is true but the Packer played a good season that year and last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm. What was the score when the Packers played against the Steelers in 2011."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was pretty close. The score was 31-25"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess Green Bay is alright but they are no match to the Patriots."
