"__MOVIES__ Those are so cute plus I heard they are coming out with a third one to add to the series."
"__MOVIES__ I will definitely be going to see that movie then."
"__MOVIES__ That movie Pixels he did was awesome. Have you ever seen that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one where he has to fight off the aliens who come to earth as classic arcade games?"
