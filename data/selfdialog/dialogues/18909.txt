"__MOVIES__ Did you see the Star Wars Rogue One film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I caught it on the big screen in 3D."
"__MOVIES__ So how was that? I didn't see the 3D version."
"__MOVIES__ It was awesome visually."
"__MOVIES__ I'll bet. For me there were issues with the story."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I agree."
"__MOVIES__ It was hard to feel sympathy for the female lead."
"__MOVIES__ She wasn't that likable."
"__MOVIES__ But I liked the two Force-sensitive characters, like the blind man, they were good."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like any one else really except Leia at the end."
"__MOVIES__ It was weird how they digitized her."
"__MOVIES__ Darth Vader really kicked people's behinds too."
"__MOVIES__ He was awesome, in a bad way."
"__MOVIES__ Scary right?"
"__MOVIES__ Mmm Hmm.  They digitized one more character, I couldn't tell at first."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I saw that."
"__MOVIES__ Guess that's the future of movies."
"__MOVIES__ Seems like it."
"__MOVIES__ I think Star Wars will go more and more that way."
"__MOVIES__ Star Trek too."
