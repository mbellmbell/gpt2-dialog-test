"__MOVIES__ Well, another lunch and talking about movies.  I rented the movie you recommended last time."
"__MOVIES__ Brooklyn?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes."
"__MOVIES__ Well--"
"__MOVIES__ It was wonderful and the lovely lead actress is Saoirse Una Ronan who was born in The Bronx."
"__MOVIES__ You can put your notecard away now."
"__MOVIES__ I was so impressed that I had to look her up."
"__MOVIES__ Has she been in anything else?"
"__MOVIES__ She's had a career for at least ten years, but I didn't recognize any of the parts."
"__MOVIES__ It's always interesting how so many of the so-called overnight stars have been working for years."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, although I don't think she has become a star."
"__MOVIES__ No, probably not; it was a great role but not that many people see simple stories."
"__MOVIES__ Although it did have a box office of around 60 million while costing 11 million or so."
"__MOVIES__ Back to the notecard again, huh. Well, if she were a star, she would cost 11 million herself."
"__MOVIES__ You know the movie reminded me of the movie, Marty--which won an academy award for best picture and for Ernest Borgnine."
"__MOVIES__ Geez, how old are you? I can't even remember Ernest Borgnine from McHale's Navy"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't say I saw its first run--I watch TCM sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen it, too.  I can't say that I thought it was that great."
"__MOVIES__ No, but a simple heartwarming story, like Brooklyn."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think a movie like Brooklyn could ever win the academy award these days, but who knows."
