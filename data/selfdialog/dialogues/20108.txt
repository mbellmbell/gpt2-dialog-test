"__MOVIES__ Did you see that they are coming out with another Cars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, isn't it the third one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't know how I feel about it."
"__MOVIES__ Me either.  Do you know what the story line is?"
"__MOVIES__ I think Lightning McQueen has to prove that he isn't too old to race."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that doesn't sound bad. I hope this is the last one they make, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too.  I don't like when franchises make too many movies."
"__MOVIES__ Is it supposed to be a good movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it actually is. I heard the animation for it is beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I'm sure it is. Pixar always does a wonderful job."
"__MOVIES__ I'm trying to remember who does the voices for the main characters."
"__MOVIES__ Owen Wilson voices Lightning McQueen and Larry the Cable Guy voices Mater."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah that's right. Those two are always funny together."
"__MOVIES__ Yes they are. I love Mater as a character, he's so cute."
"__MOVIES__ He is very sweet."
"__MOVIES__ It's not a good time for the movie to come out though.  There are so many other great movies out right now."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah like Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ I want to see that so badly!"
"__MOVIES__ You need to it's amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I might go this weekend."
