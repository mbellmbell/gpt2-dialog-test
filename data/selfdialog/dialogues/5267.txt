"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see the latest Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I thought it wasnt that great."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the acting was lacking."
"__STAR_WARS__ You might be the only one to say that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but its the truth."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you want more of the original cast?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No I think they all showed up right."
"__STAR_WARS__ How about James Earl Jones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Now that would have been comedy."
