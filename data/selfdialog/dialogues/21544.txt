"__DISNEY__ Best evil name ever!"
"__DISNEY__ Right? And she was totally evil."
"__DISNEY__ Obviously - who could make a coat out of puppies?"
"__DISNEY__ Someone VERY concerned with fashion."
"__DISNEY__ Heh, and the Dalmatians were just collateral damage?"

"__DISNEY__ Maybe I have a career in super villainy."
"__DISNEY__ Well, you just need to find some puppies to make your costume!"
"__DISNEY__ And maybe get a few henchmen too."
