"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, what NFL team do you think will win it all this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going to go with the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks?!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, this team has made it to the superbowl back to back. Loss one and won one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what, so has the Cowboys. Matter fact the Cowboys made it to the Superbowl more than the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are the Cowboys your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I follow the Buccaneers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now that is a struggling team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every team has a weak spot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and one of yours seems to be the kicker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who, Robert Aguayo?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I hear his preseason practice isn't going so well. He is showing some lack in fundamentals and consistency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well as they say, 'practice makes perfect.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that. I think there is talk about bringing in another kicker and just keeping Aguayo on the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That maybe a choice they make; they can't get rid of him though, because his contract is good for another year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you will just have to wait and see what the Bucs want to do with Aguayo for the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No matter the outcome, the Bucs are still my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wasn't trying to change that. I know how it is to be a loyal fan to a team that let's you down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Got to keep your hopes up and root for the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your right. After all, it's just fun and games."
