"__DISNEY__ Disney recently acquired Star Wars. Do you think Star Wars movies are now Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ It's hard to say. I would have to say yes."
"__DISNEY__ I disagree. I think Disney has its own thing and adding Star Wars just doesn't make sense."
"__DISNEY__ I can see where you are coming from. But Disney has really made these movies into their own."
"__DISNEY__ I'll be honest, I haven't actually seen any of the Disney made Star Wars films."
"__DISNEY__ Are you serious? You have to see them - they are so rich in storyline."
"__DISNEY__ Do they feel like the old Star Wars movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, in many ways they do. With a Disney touch."
"__DISNEY__ I feel like it cheapens both franchises."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, you have convinced me!"
