"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Tom Hiddleston movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called Kong: Skull Island."
"__MOVIES__ Is it another King Kong movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it takes place on the island, instead of in New York."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm that's interesting. What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was good! Even though it's starring Tom Hiddleston, I really liked John C. Reilly's character."
"__MOVIES__ Who does he play?"
"__MOVIES__ He plays a pilot named Hank Marlow that was strapped on Skull Island in WWII."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that sounds like a plot twist."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the movie is secretly about his character."
"__MOVIES__ That's really cool! How were the special effects?"
"__MOVIES__ They were great! Definitely first-rate."
"__MOVIES__ Is it overly filled with CGI?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a lot of CGI, which can be disappointing to some people, but I did not mind it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I usually don't like a lot of CGI, so I would have to see."
"__MOVIES__ I highly recommend it!"
"__MOVIES__ I might give it a try for something to do this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Let me know if you do!"
"__MOVIES__ I will."
