"__MUSIC__ What do you think about the music they're pumping out these days?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the talent-less hack auto tune garbage on the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess so."
"__MUSIC__ It's total garbage. What do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't know what happened or when it changed."
"__MUSIC__ 90's, 80's then even worse hitting 2000, Napster, The Pirate Bay and on and on.."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, nothing like the late 60's. Wow, what happened to all of that?"
"__MUSIC__ Gutarists can't solo anymore. The guitar used to be a 'voice' now anybody can be a singer with a computer fixing their voices key."
"__MUSIC__ Sad, and when do you think was the greatest time of music?"
"__MUSIC__ If it wasn't the 60's then we have to go back to the 20's. We've got to get back to Jazz."
"__MUSIC__ Jazz? Are you kidding me?"
"__MUSIC__ No! Let's go back to Ragtime, Big Band and New Orleans. This is the birthplace."
"__MUSIC__ The birthplace of what?"
"__MUSIC__ Improvisation which is the foundation for anything new."
"__MUSIC__ Uh huh, like how rock came from Jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ Jazz and Blues, Yes! And this is what has happened to music in the last 30 years."
"__MUSIC__ We've lost that ability.."
"__MUSIC__ Correct and you know what the really sad thing is?"
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ We'll never see it again."
