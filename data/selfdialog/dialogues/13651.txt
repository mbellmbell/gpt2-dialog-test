"__BASKETBALL__ Hey have you caught any good basketball games lately?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I just watched the Duke versus KU game last night. Did you watch?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I didn't get to. What happened?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well it was a great game! Duke ended up winning in double overtime."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh man, I wish I would have seen that! They have a stellar recruiting class this year, so I bet they will be great again next year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course, they always do. But KU's recruits are not to shabby either."
"__BASKETBALL__ They need some good new post players."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they recruited two or three big men that really have some good post moves."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who does Duke play next?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they have a home matchup with North Carolina."
"__BASKETBALL__ That ought to be a good one. I love rivalry games."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think KU is playing Kansas State which is their rival next."
"__BASKETBALL__ That should be an easy win for KU."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe, sometimes K-State's team can really show up and be good."
"__BASKETBALL__ True. Who do you think will win between Duke and UNC?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That is anyone's guess. I will be pulling for my Blue Devils."
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course you will, though I would really love to see a little bit of an upset with UNC winning."
"__BASKETBALL__ We shall see. The game is at 8 o'clock Thursday."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ought to be a good game"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, I love a good ball game."
