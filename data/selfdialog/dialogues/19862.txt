"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite series of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I'd have to say Star Wars. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ For me, I'm going to go with Lord Of The Rings. Talk about an amazing adaptation."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool! Who are your favorite characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Personally my favorite characters are Aragorn and Gandalf. Do you have any favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ Well if I had to pick, I thin I'd probably go with Pippin just because I think his personality is like mine."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah remember when he goes and visits the Ents? I thought that was pretty awesome."
"__MOVIES__ And the CG on Gollum was awesome! They really did a good job."
"__MOVIES__ It was super lifelike. I saw those movies like 3 or 4 times a piece in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see The Hobbit movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, but they weren't nearly as good. I kind of got bored."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's what you get when you try to stretch a tiny book into three full length movies I guess."
"__MOVIES__ I'm still a very big Peter Jackson fan though. I liked his King Kong movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too but it was a weirdly casted movie I thought. Jack black and Adrian Brody?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you've got a good point. I mean it wasn't the best, but I've always liked King Kong."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't they just make a new one of those?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe they did but I haven't seen it. Do you have a favorite monster movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well that's a broad topic. I guess I'd probably pick Godzilla, I can't think of a lot of other recent monster movies."
"__MOVIES__ I guess most of the movies in that topic are old, unless you count Pacific Rim or something."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but those were robots not monsters. Oh well, I still really liked that movie."
