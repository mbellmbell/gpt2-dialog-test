"__ROCK__ Hey whats you opinion on Journey?"
"__ROCK__ The rock band?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah."
"__ROCK__ I think they are awesome and I respect their early work. However I am not  a current fan."
"__ROCK__ Why not?"
"__ROCK__ I honestly feel the band just wasn't the same without their lead singer Stephen Perry."
"__ROCK__ What makes you say something like that?"
"__ROCK__ Dude, He has an iconic voice and he was the face of the band when he was lead singer."
"__ROCK__ I mean I agree somewhat but I think they are still good without him."
"__ROCK__ I can't agree with you there. I think the band lost an icon in Perry."
