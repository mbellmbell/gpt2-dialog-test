"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hey, you gonna see the new Fast and Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What number is this again? Seveteen? Fifty-six?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Seven, I think."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Ha! You're a fan and you don't even know."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't care what number it is. They're good movies. Except for maybe Tokyo Drift."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm surprised you even wanna see this new movie. That Paul guy isn't in it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hey! It's getting really good reviews. I'll give it a chance. So you wanna go with me?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ uh.. I'll think about it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I have this feeling that if you see this one, you'll become a fan. Have you seen any of them?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I saw the first one. It was okay."
