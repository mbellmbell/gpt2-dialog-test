"__BASEBALL__ So I've read about the Atlanta Braves, and they were actually good fairly recently."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, and they have had several men become elected into the hall of fame recently."
"__BASEBALL__ That's incredible, considering the hall of fame is pretty exclusive."
"__BASEBALL__ I bet Braves fans miss those days when they all played."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm sure they do, but they certainly can rebound to that point."
"__BASEBALL__ I read about a guy named Chipper Jones, and he was really good, but why isn't he in the hall of fame?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, he isn't eligible yet, but next year he will be."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he will get elected to the hall of fame?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm sure he will because he played great defense at third base and hit very well."
"__BASEBALL__ Something interesting about him was that he could bat right- or left-handed."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, and not many players can do that, much less as well as him."
"__BASEBALL__ I'll say. I think Mickey Mantle was the only other switch hitter as good as him."
"__BASEBALL__ Who were the other Braves players that you read about that were recently elected to the hall of fame?"
"__BASEBALL__ They were John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux."
"__BASEBALL__ Didn't they all pitch for the Braves at the same time?"
"__BASEBALL__ They sure did, and they even won a World Series championship."
"__BASEBALL__ Did Chipper play with them?"
"__BASEBALL__ He did, and his rookie season, 1995, was the year they won the World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ Who was their manager that year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Bobby Cox, who, by the way, is also in the hall of fame."
