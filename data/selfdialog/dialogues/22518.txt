"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Tangled?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I have, it is one of my favorite recent Disney movies!"
"__DISNEY__ I think it is as good as Frozen, really."
"__DISNEY__ Frozen has a few more good songs than Tangled, but I like the story and characters better in Tangled."
"__DISNEY__ I agree with that. 'I See the Light' is a really good song, though."
"__DISNEY__ I love the way it looks when they are under all of the lanterns on the water!"
"__DISNEY__ I also like how the girls in the village braid Rapunzel's hair shortly before that."
"__DISNEY__ That is a cute scene, with Flynn and Rapunzel dancing with the villagers."
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad Rapunzel ended up getting away from Mother Gothel."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it's a good thing she left her tower!"
