"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So are you still a big football fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! I am counting down the days until the NFL returns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am actually looking forward to it myself this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did not think you cared for the NFL that much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I used to not care for it at all, until I moved to Nashville. Now I actually look forward to going to watch the Titans play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool, now we can talk a lot more during the season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We sure can! I am really excited about Marcus Mariota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do not blame you, he is a really good young player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you could start a franchise with any player in the league right now, who would it be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To be honest, it might be Dak prescott if I had to pick one guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? You would take him over guys like Arron Rodgers,Andrew Luck, or even a great receiver like Antonio Brown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would for a couple of reasons actually. The first being his uncanny composure when he is on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can just tell he never panics. I will give you that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The other reason is because he can control the game with both his arms and his legs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does have great mobility. However so does Luck and Rodgers as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but he is so much younger than them; so that is why I would pick him if I were starting a new franchise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You actually make some pretty good points about Prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have always enjoyed watching him, even when he was at Mississippi State."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do not think anybody thought he could come in and steal Tony Romo's job though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate that Romo lost his job, but I am really happy for Prescott."
