"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ever heard of Nick Hakim?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, man. Who is that?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's a hiphop artist. I think he's kind of new."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I've never heard of him. What's his music like?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, it's hiphop, like I said. But he's also got this really funky 70's vibe going on."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Like a psychedelic thing?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, exactly. You should check out the song Roller Skates. You'll never get it out of your head."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Now you've got me curious. Does he have any videos?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yep. In fact, Roller Skates has a really trippy video. You should look it up."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I will, man. Thanks for the recommendation."
