"__BASKETBALL__ I just refuse to get on the Seth Curry bandwagon."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why is that?  He's putting up numbers like crazy since he's been with the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ He just isn't a good all around baskeball player."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He doesn't actually play defense, he just stands there, waiting for one of his teammates to pass him the ball, so he can shoot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, what's wrong with being able to shoot?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Nothing is wrong with it, and it's a great part of the basketball game, but there are so many other parts he doesn't even try to play!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I can see that.  He is an amazing shooter though.  He's one of the best."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hardly, I mean you're forgetting about the greats, man."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who are the greats then?  Who is better?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, let's see, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Larry Bird, to name a few, and that's shooters who also played defense."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you mean, he isn't even the best in his own field of 3's?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, he's mediocre, at best compared to the greats.  Sure he can hit a 3 from half court, but so could many many many others, who also found the time and energy to play defense."
"__BASKETBALL__ I see what you're saying, he just isn't as good in his own environment?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly, I mean he isn't even the best shooter of all time, let alone the best basketball player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, did you see that ESPN interview where they were comparing him to a young Kobe or even the great Michael Jordan?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that's what sent me on this rant.  It's like, you people are supposed to be professionals and to actually know your basketball history."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, come on, you know they just get ex players to talk about those games, and those players are so biased it's unreal."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly, it's just like they are all over his jock because he's relevant and popular now, not even considering the history of basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ I get what you're saying, he really is overrated."
