"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the Godfather movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I only saw the first one and the third one, but never the second one."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's the best one of the trilogy!"
"__MOVIES__ Am I missing anything vital to the storyline?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if you saw the first one, you saw the rise of power for Michael Corleone."
"__MOVIES__ Right, and he was trying to retire by the third one."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the second movie shows how his empire crumbles, and how he loses the things he loves most."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's right, he was divorced in the last movie, wasn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ Right, and the movie also focuses on how much of a cold hearted man he has become."
"__MOVIES__ Did he do something really heinous?"
"__MOVIES__ When his older brother tried to set him up, Michael had him killed!"
"__MOVIES__ My goodness, how could he have changed so much from the honest family man from the first and third movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Half of the movie also focuses on the rise of power of Michael's father, this time played by Robert DeNiro in flashbacks."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like an incredible performance!"
"__MOVIES__ It's my favorite part of the whole movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't it bother you knowing that everything is going to turn out okay for the character in the end?"
"__MOVIES__ No, because the journey is so incredible, and to see him overcome such odds is amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ So is the second Godfather movie something that stands the test of time?"
"__MOVIES__ It absolutely does, because the movie is so timeless!"
"__MOVIES__ I think I'll do a Godfather marathon this weekend based on your recommendation!"
