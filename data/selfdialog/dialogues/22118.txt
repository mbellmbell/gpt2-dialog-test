"__DISNEY__ She was definitely one of the more memorable ones."
"__DISNEY__ She was big but still beautiful and had that sinister smile."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I wonder if we'll ever get to see her in a live action remake."
"__DISNEY__ I can't believe they haven't done that already."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder who they would cast as Ariel."
