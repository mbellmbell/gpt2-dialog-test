"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Moana yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  I have not."
"__MOVIES__ Neither have I but I really want to because my little niece and nephew watch it all the time."
"__MOVIES__ I have heard it is really really good."
"__MOVIES__ I am serious girl.  They watch it at least twice a day, every single day."
"__MOVIES__ Oh!  Now I understand what all those internet memes are about."
"__MOVIES__ When I saw the preview though, it made me so nostalgic for Hawaii."
"__MOVIES__ It does look like the animation and design are very well done."
"__MOVIES__ And come on, it has The Rock in it."
"__MOVIES__ Right?  Who doesn't love The Rock."
"__MOVIES__ He even sings in the movie.  I really want to hear it."
"__MOVIES__ He is the last person that I would picture singing."
"__MOVIES__ I do think though that it is based on true Hawaiian myths and legends."
"__MOVIES__ I just love that whole culture.  Is the movie out on DVD yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  I need to just borrow it from my sister in law and watch it."
"__MOVIES__ And you haven't yet!"
"__MOVIES__ Hah, No, just too busy lately."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we should watch it together sometime."
"__MOVIES__ Ooh yes!  That sounds like a great idea.  Let's plan a girl's day watching Moana."
"__MOVIES__ I'll bring the popcorn."
