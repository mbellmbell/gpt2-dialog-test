"__MUSIC__ Oh my goodness, I just got tickets to the Eagles concert."
"__MUSIC__ The Eagles? Who are they? I haven't heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious? The Eagles are a classic American rock band. They've been around since the 1970s."
"__MUSIC__ Really? What songs do they sing?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, my favorites are Wasted Time and Take It To The Limit."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, now I know who you are talking about. Didn't they recently lose a band member?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Glenn Frey died at age 67. He was a major part of the band. He wrote most of the music and also played guitar."
"__MUSIC__ So how are they going to have a concert without him?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I am not sure. I assume they are just going to try to go on without him."
"__MUSIC__ Who are the other band members?"
"__MUSIC__ Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner are the other members."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of Don Henley. Didn't he have a successful solo career after The Eagles broke up?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he sang that one song from the movie Real Genius...All She Wants to Do Is Dance."
"__MUSIC__ That was a great song. Didn't he also sing The End of Innocence?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. See, I knew you have heard of this band before! They had 6 number one albums and a bunch of number one singles, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, now that I think about it, I did like that song Heartache Tonight. That was their song, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that single was hot in 1979. It sold about a million copies!"
"__MUSIC__ OK, now I remember The Eagles. They do have some good songs."
"__MUSIC__ Rolling Stones ranked their album Hotel California as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time. I think it was even at number 37!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow! I hope you have fun at your concert. Have an extra ticket?"
