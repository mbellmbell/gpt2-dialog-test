"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that the Seattle Seahawks could make another Super Bowl appearance this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That team is past its prime and will likely relinquish their grip on the NFC West within the next three years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle has a great quarterback and dominant defense. What more could you want?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Russell Wilson is an undersized game manager."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's unfair! He's probably one of the most accurate and mature quarterbacks in the NFL right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From everything I hear, he's a great guy. However, if you put him on a bad team, he probably couldn't make them win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now we're getting into hypothetical territory. You still haven't addressed their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks defense was all-time great two or three years ago. Now they're just old and overpaid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Harsh! You don't think that the Legion of Boom is still one of the top defensive secondaries in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're way too injury prone. Last season, Earl Thomas broke his tibia before the playoffs and they apparently didn't even report Richard Sherman's sprained MCL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football players are always playing through injury. I'm sure that there are a lot of banged up players that we don't know about in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you couple the injuries with their increasing ages and their large contracts, I don't see how Seattle can continue to compete moving forward."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle still has one of the best front offices with John Schneider as GM. This is the guy who picked Russell Wilson, Richard Sherman, and Kam Chancellor in the later rounds of the draft after all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but I haven't seen any great late round draft picks from Seattle in the last two seasons. Moreover, I keep reading reports of tensions between the players in the Seattle locker room."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you referring to the alleged Richard Sherman-Russell Wilson feud?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more so referring to how Pete Carroll takes such a hands off attitude in controlling players that it ultimately manifests in a lack of discipline. Richard Sherman should not have been able to yell at a coach last season regarding an offensive play call."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that Pete Carroll's light touch approach allows the players to relax and play better. Also, Richard Sherman was right about that offensive call."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whether he was right or wrong is an entirely different subject. My argument is that you can't run a team where everyone is trying to lead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Until that light touch approach begins to manifest itself on the football field, I won't criticize Pete Carroll for it. I saw an interview with Michael Bennett the other week and he said that Carroll's light touch approach was useful in attracting free agents to the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe that's true, but I would say that Seattle's recent success coupled with Washington's lack of an income tax play bigger factors in attracting free agents."
