"__POP__ I've noticed a dramatic change in pop music."
"__POP__ What's that?"
"__POP__ It's a lot more diverse."
"__POP__ I know why. It's because the world is getting smaller."
"__POP__ Yes, we all have access to the music that's popular around the world."
"__POP__ Exactly! I suspect that if a song is popular in one country, it will be popular in another."
"__POP__ Why is that?"
"__POP__ I think it's because the human brain likes certain patterns."
"__POP__ And, those patterns are present in pop music?"
"__POP__ Yes, most pop songs have a similar structure. It's a structure which is soothing and pleasing."
