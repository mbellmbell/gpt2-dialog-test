"__THRILLER__ Hey! Do you know if there's any good thrillers playing at the cinema right now?"
"__THRILLER__ I think The Mummy's still playing, if you haven't seen that yet."
"__THRILLER__ I haven't! That's the new Tom Cruise movie, right?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes. It's also got Russell Crowe playing a character called Dr. Henry Jekyll, and Annabelle Wallis playing a monster-hunting archaeologist called Jennifer Halsey."
"__THRILLER__ Sounds good! But do you think I'll be able to follow the plot even if I haven't seen the previous Mummy movies?"
"__THRILLER__ Definitely, it's standard. Tom Cruise plays a soldier of fortune called Nick Morton, who goes around the Middle East looting ancient treasures. He digs up the wrong tomb, and thrilling adventures ensue."
"__THRILLER__ Haha, got it. Well, it sounds good! I love anything that involves ancient mythology and some daring escapism."
"__THRILLER__ Me too. Plus, Russell Crowe is one of my favorites. I love anything he does."
"__THRILLER__ Agreed, me too. I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan, but I'll see anything with Russell Crowe."
"__THRILLER__ Great! Let's find a time to go this week! If we go to an afternoon showing, it probably won't give us nightmares."
