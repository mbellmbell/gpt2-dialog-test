"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you ever listened to any electro-pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, I'm not sure what exactly it is, though. What exactly does that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just pop or even rock music with an electronic influence."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I'm sure I have then. I'm actually looking for something new to listen to anyway, what do you suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ Well recently I've been listening to this group called The 1975, you should give them a try."
"__MUSIC__ The 1975? Are they electro-pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I'd definitely say so. I know one of their songs got really popular, it's called 'The Sound'."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds really familiar, but I'm not sure if I recall it. Are there any certain songs or albums you suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ They only have two albums, but I really like the song 'Change of Heart.'"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'll have to check it out. If I end up liking them it's a shame there's only two albums."
"__MUSIC__ They are really good so I hope you like them. There is good news, though!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, what is the good news?"
"__MUSIC__ Well supposedly there is a new album in the works that is supposed to come out next year."
"__MUSIC__ No kidding? Well I guess it's a good time to get into their music if they have more coming out soon."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. If you don't like them I can suggest loads more music."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you! What else do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm really into alternative music. I love Panic! at the Disco."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah they are so great! They are getting really popular now, but I've always liked them."
"__MUSIC__ I know! It sounds like we have similar tastes, so I hope you enjoy the new band."
"__MUSIC__ Great! I look forward to it!"
