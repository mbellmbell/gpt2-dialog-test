"__MUSIC__ Is Madonna still creating new music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure.  If she is, she has to hold some record for her longevity in the business."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I can remember when she hit the airwaves in the early 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Me, too.  What was the Madonna song you remember hearing?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was Border Line, but I'm not 100% sure."
"__MUSIC__ For me, it was 'Holiday'.  And, now, anytime I hear the song, I think of how it got butchered by Adam Sandler in 'The Wedding Singer',"
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't there a song about an island?"
"__MUSIC__ La Isla Bonita?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah!  My little sister ran around singing that for most of a summer."
"__MUSIC__ Madonna was actually one of the examples my university used in a marketing class."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, when she did a Pepsi commercial while singing 'Like a Prayer', it actually had a backlash.  Religious groups were really angry because they thought the song was sacreiligious."
"__MUSIC__ I vaguely remember that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  It created quite the scandal and ultimately, the company lost a lot of money.  But, the commercial is actually pretty well shot."
"__MUSIC__ I could see that. Madonna has always put out great videos!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  What was your favorite video of hers?"
"__MUSIC__ Vogue!  I don't think I knew anyone who hadn't memorized the hand gestures from the chorus."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite video was 'MUSIC'.  It was so lively and relevant."
"__MUSIC__ Well, no one could say that she hasn't left her mark on the music world."
"__MUSIC__ Very, very true!"
