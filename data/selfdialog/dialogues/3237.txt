"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm supposed to start a conversation with you about music, so what type of music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm kind of odd about music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, how so?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Christian music, but not a lot of the current stuff."
"__MUSIC__ So you like hymns?"
"__MUSIC__ No, actually."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, hymns remind me too much of lulabies."
"__MUSIC__ Is that so?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really wonder about churches that play only hymns, because it seems like they want their congregation to sleep through the sermon."
"__MUSIC__ Well anyway, back to music, so what artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Steven Curtis Chapman, Andrew Peterson, Twila Paris, Sarah Groves... the guy who does the 'Broken but Beautiful' song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I heard that one years ago."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked it, but the stations don't play it anymore."
"__MUSIC__ So who's your favorite artist of the bunch."
"__MUSIC__ Andrew Peterson."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that.?"
"__MUSIC__ He's songs seem more realistic than most Christian music, but it still has the instrumental sound that I like."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check some of his stuff out."
"__MUSIC__ I recommend 'Silence of God.'"
