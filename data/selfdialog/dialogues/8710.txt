"__BEATLES__ So, you're not a Sgt Pepper guy. What album do you go for, then?"
"__BEATLES__ I dunno. It's a toss-up, depending on what the weather's like -- but the safe answer may be Revolver."
"__BEATLES__ Revolver. Didn't that come right before Sgt Pepper?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it did. You can kind of think of it as a precursor or rough draft for the ideas that would end up going overboard and result in Pepper."
"__BEATLES__ What, like the concept album thing?"
"__BEATLES__ No, I mean the way the songs are written and recorded. This and Rubber Soul kind of make up a pair, but whereas Rubber Soul was more like a refined and well-developed extension of the music they'd been doing, Revolver takes that another step toward the idea of the studio as an instrument."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, yeah. They quit touring around this time, right?"
"__BEATLES__ Exactly, yeah. Rubber Soul was, I think, the first thing they did once they locked themselves away in the studio and had some time to think about what they were doing. Revolver's the more developed second effort, where they really go to town with exploring the benefits of sitting around all this equipment rather than bopping around the globe."
"__BEATLES__ So there's sort of a logical progression? There's the simple music they wrote while they were, uh, bopping around -- then they sat still and took the time to be deliberate, then they figured out what made studio recording unique, then they went ridiculous with it."
"__BEATLES__ Right; it's all the same creative flow. That's one of the things I find so interesting about the Beatles -- how transparently you can trace their creative development."
