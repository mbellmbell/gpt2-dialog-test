"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the G.O.A.T. (Greatest of all-time)?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, now the buzz is that Brady is. But I think there is some debate about this."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would make your short list"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely Brady, Montana, Jim Brown. Interestingly, It seemed like Jerry Rice was on that short list but his stock seemed to have gone down a bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I remember when a lot of people thought Jerry Rice was the GOAT. Why do you think he has gone down a bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My theory is that with so many historically good QB's in the league right now, it's elevated the QB position even more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And by that logic positions like RB and Wide Receiver have just gone down in importance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you can even see that in the NFL draft a bit. But getting back to the debate, it's really hard to be objective about Brady lately"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the most recent Superbowl is in everyone's mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was such a remarkable comeback that for most people they think 'there he is, the greatest of all-time'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and I have a difficult time arguing with that assessment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I think the dust needs to settle a bit before anyone makes that proclamation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, here's what I think would push him over the top: Super Bowl rings and the fact that he wasn't always surrounded by top-notch talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it is impressive that his wide receiver core does change a lot and he is able to keep on winning. That is definitely in his favor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the argument against?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Montana is in the discussion because his record in Super Bowls is perfect. Also, I know a lot of old-timers say Jim Brown was the most impressive player they'd every saw."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think the Jim Brown argument -- if you are going to go that route -- would not have to be based on stats but based on observing him play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and I think the number of people who first-hand witnessed him are obviously dwindling. Although his stats were very impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't have an amazing yards per carry average?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without looking, I think so. Anyway, to me, saying that Brady is the GOAT is something you can't say without some objectivity that is granted by hindsight."
