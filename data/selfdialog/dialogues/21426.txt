"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but I want to! Is it good?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, it's just great. I loved it."
"__DISNEY__ Does it follow the animated one's storyline?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, pretty close."
"__DISNEY__ I think I'd be upset if they changed it too much."
"__DISNEY__ No, they didn't mess with the story. Some things were added, but they fit in very well."
"__DISNEY__ Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, we get to learn what happened to Bell's mother, for example. How she died."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds intriguing. I can't wait to see it!"
