"__HORROR__ What's your favorite horror movie? Like, absolute favorite."
"__HORROR__ Absolute favorite? John Carpenter's The Thing."
"__HORROR__ I love The Thing! I'm a big Exorcist fan myself."
"__HORROR__ Ooh, that one's good too. I like how a lot of the real tension in the story is about the human characters."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, the same is true in the The Thing, really."
"__HORROR__ And they both have amazing practical effects! Though I think The Thing wins there, for obvious reasons."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, even the part where Regan comes doesn the stairs with her body all messed up does not compare to even the scene with the dog from The Thing."
"__HORROR__ Oof, that scene with Regan gives me the creeps. I couldn't walk down the stairs at night after seeing that."
"__HORROR__ For me, it's when her head turns around. The sound effect they used for that scares me so much."
"__HORROR__ That sound effect is actually made by them folding a leather wallet with stuff inside, I looked it up! Isn't that cool?"
