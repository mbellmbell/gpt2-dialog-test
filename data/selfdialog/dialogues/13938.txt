"__BASKETBALL__ Did you get home from work in time to catch the Golden State Warriors at the San Antonio Spurs game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Almost, I missed the first quarter but I was able to catch the rest. What a game!"
"__BASKETBALL__ It sure was! It was pretty close the whole time."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the Spurs struggled a little bit in the 2nd and 3rd quarters it looked like. Cost them the game in the long run."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know. I was kind of rooting for them to pull through."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too! I'm usually a Dallas Mavericks fan, but I'll root for the Spurs, too."
"__BASKETBALL__ They're playing again tomorrow night, do you think the Spurs can pull it off?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know man, I sure hope so!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too, I think it will be tough though. Predictions are favoring the Warriors to win the series in 5 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're right, it's gonna be a tough one. Even if they win, it will be pretty hard to come back and win 4 in a row."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the Warriors are up 3-0 in the series, aren't they?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They are. They're a tough team to beat!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Durant and Curry are pretty unstoppable!"
"__BASKETBALL__ You got that right!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I just don't think the Spurs are going to pull it off, I hate to say."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, sadly I've got to agree with you. I think the Warriors are going to sweep it Monday night."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too. At least the Spurs still have home court advantage tomorrow."
"__BASKETBALL__ True. Didn't help them last night though!"
"__BASKETBALL__ You're right, I guess we'll see! Want to come watch it my place?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure, sounds great! I'll see you there. Go Spurs!"
