"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you know who the Devils are playing tonight?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am not sure, why?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Tonight is one of the playoffs for the Stanley Cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Good Old Lord Stanley's Cup, eh? That's going on now?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, playoff season usually start around the start of May."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ When does the season start then?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Some time in October I think."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Wow that certainly is a long season!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It kind of is. The whole thing could be wrapped up in 6 months if they tried."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Six months still feels a little long for a sports season. It should be around four."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hockey is a different sport though. The players need more spaced out games."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Football players can do it, why can't hockey players?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ There's more players in football and hockey players take harder collisions."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I guess I never thought of it that way."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It really is a sport that has to be played to be respected."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I suppose that is true in some way."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe you should play a hockey game with my rec league some time?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well I never really skated but I'd love to give it a try."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe by next playoff season you'll be skating like a pro."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well I certainly have all the time in the world then. Haha!"
