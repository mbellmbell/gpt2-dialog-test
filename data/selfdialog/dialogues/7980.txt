"__POP__ What would you say is the best pop song of 2017?"
"__POP__ That's a tough question.  Especially because there have been so many memorable and catchy ones thus far."
"__POP__ If you had to pick just one though?"
"__POP__ I think the title has to go to 'Shape of You' by Ed Sheeran.  Right from when it came out in January, it's been dominating the charts."
"__POP__ What do you like about it the most?"
"__POP__ I love the dancehall element of it, and the fact that despite his ability to reach high notes, Sheeran keeps his voice lower for it."
"__POP__ That did definitely add to the impact of his song and lyrics."
"__POP__ Also, the song didn't just do well here.  It hit number one on the charts of 30 other countries."
"__POP__ That's impressive.  I feel like I still hear that song all the time."
"__POP__ That makes sense, since it's the second most streamed song on Spotify still."
