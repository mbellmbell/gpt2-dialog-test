"__MUSIC__ Hey, what do you think about Katy Perry's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Witness? I love most of it."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I especially love Witness and Chained to the Rhythm."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but my favorite is 'Miss You More'."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that one a lot too."
"__MUSIC__ It's such a good ballad."
"__MUSIC__ It reminds me of songs from the 90's when we had a lot of really good ballads."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it feels like something we could get from Celine Dion."
"__MUSIC__ It really does. I could see her singing it in her Vegas show too."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. Katy should be really proud to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ She should."
"__MUSIC__ I really hope she makes it a single off the album."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she's only had upbeat ones so far. It would be nice to mix it up a little."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, especially with the fall coming up. I like slower songs in fall."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I like upbeat in summer and to slow down for the later half of the year."
"__MUSIC__ It would be perfect for radio too."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't mind driving home from work and hearing it."
"__MUSIC__ I would be turning that radio all the way up if I did."
"__MUSIC__ You and me both."
"__MUSIC__ Our love for Katy Perry is just unmatched."
