"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see that the Rangers choked again this year in the playoffs?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I saw and I loved it, Go Penguins!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who is the coach of Pittsburgh anyway?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Mike Sullivan but in hockey, the coach tends to make no difference."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ When a team is eliminated a coach tends to get fired though."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I actually don't think that players respect the coaches of hockey enough."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That is not something most NHL fans care about.  We care about tough hits, fights, and team spirit."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Fights in hockey are dangerous.  I hope the commissioner bans them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You seem to like nothing in hockey, do you like anything?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I like to cheer for the goalie since their job is the only job that truly counts."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What happened to the Rangers goalie, henrikk lunguest"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well you can only stop so many pucks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If the goalie cannot block all pucks, what is the point?   Add another offensive player.  In doing this, we are allowing a goalie to stink but still get the trophy"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sydney Crosby is my favorite hockey player."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Crosby is the player that I love to hate.  He has been given a golden skate by the officials and gets away with everthing.   He never sits in the penalty box."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ At least the Flyers did not make the playoffs this season.  That team has one good player Claude Giroux but the rest of them like to whine and they pick on Pittsburgh."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Pittsburgh is only hated in Philadelphia because they are good and they win, not choke."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That being said, Philly has fans who are die hard and I have to respect that.  In Tampa, the fans are not loyal an they tend to not know what hockey even is."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hockey is not a sport for the south anyway.   Canada and Russia are models for hockey and its future."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, maybe our teams can make the finals and we can go to Game 7 of the stanley cup finals."
