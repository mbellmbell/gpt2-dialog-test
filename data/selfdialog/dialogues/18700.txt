"__MOVIES__ What do you think of the new Spider-Man trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ For Homecoming? I think it looks great. Are you planning to watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, absolutely! With the trailer and with his appearance in Civil War, I feel like they finally nailed the Spider-Man character perfectly, and I'm so excited for him to get his own movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Not to say that any of the past ones were bad, though."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all. Tobey Maguire's Spidey is still one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ He really knocked it out of the park in Spider-Man 2. His whole storyline with Dr. Octopus was so good."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. I don't think he ever had a bad moment throughout his 3 movies."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, Spider-Man 3 wasn't the best."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to be completely honest here, but I really liked Spider-Man 3."
"__MOVIES__ What? That's a first!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't care. I liked seeing Venom and Sandman, and I thought it was nice to round off the storyline with Harry."
"__MOVIES__ Harry's death scene was pretty sad."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was. The only one I could think of that might be sadder is when Gwen died in one of the newer ones."
"__MOVIES__ The Amazing Spider-Man 2. That scene was heartbreaking."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the imagery in it with the web that he shot to try and catch her, with it looking like a hand and all. I thought that added a lot to the scene."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. Also, I know there wasn't any blood or anything, but I thought the way she died was pretty brutal."
"__MOVIES__ Understandable. My stomach dropped when I heard her hit the ground."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was pretty bad. Now that we're talking about it, The Amazing Spider-Man movies weren't that bad."
"__MOVIES__ They weren't. I thought Andrew Garfield was a solid Spidey. Not enough to hold up to Tobey, though."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we'll see if Tom Holland can outshine both of them."
