"__MOVIES__ Which is your favorite Harry Potter movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, out of 7, that's a tough choice."
"__MOVIES__ It's out of eight; seven got split into two. Don't be silly."
"__MOVIES__ Best overall experience or how it was adapted from the book?"
"__MOVIES__ Experience, of course. Books adapted into movies should run smoothly."
"__MOVIES__ I like Harry Potter."
"__MOVIES__ ...and..?"
"__MOVIES__ ...The one about Dumbledore's Army."
"__MOVIES__ You really don't know the title? It's The Order of the Phoenix."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. That one."
"__MOVIES__ So, why do you like it the most?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the first with a real dark turn to it. The Goblet of Fire killed the vampire guy but still felt a bit silly."
"__MOVIES__ If by the Vampire guy you mean Cedric Diggory, then I got you, but it's a different movie. What was your favorite part of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I love the fight scene at the end. The music sounded a lot like Shostakovich's fugato from his 11th Symphony."
"__MOVIES__ That's super specific, but cool. Yeah I liked it too but there was something wrong about it."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Harry was fighting without saying his spells out loud."
"__MOVIES__ Why does that matter?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, at Hogwarts, they don't learn how to do that until the following year."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe someone taught him, MuggleBreath. Ever think of that?"
