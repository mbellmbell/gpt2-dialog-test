"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it looks like the Texans are getting a new Quarterback coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Do you know who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Sean Ryan is his name."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right on. Is he any good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. He was the recievers coach but thet bumped him up for 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very cool. I hope he works out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, i'd really like to see the Texans go to the palyofs this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would as well. I'm thinking the Cowboys wont."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Tom Savage says he's looking forward to the new coarh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he will help Savage get that ball downfield."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Osweiler was pretty useless last season as a coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I think he did nothing for Savage last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, when a coach gets a 40 million dollar contract, he better help the QB get the ball to the end zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ FORTY million?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he was getting paid more than top players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a feeling this season will be much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping it does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we'll know in less than 90 days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, i cant wait!"
