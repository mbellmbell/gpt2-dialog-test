"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you remember when Wayne Gretzky used to play?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes! He was and is a legend!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you watch the Canucks game last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I missed it - did they win or lose?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ My favorite player is Kirk McLean. Who is your's?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I love Pavel Bure. No one is better than the Russian Rocket!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see that goal that Linden scored last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, it was a classic move going around that goal post."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That save Brodeur made in tonight's game really saved the game for the Devils."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know, I couldn't believe he was able to stop that puck."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think that hockey these days isn't quite as exciting as it used to be. There's too much fighting and not enough focus on the game itself."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Really? The only reason I watch hockey is for the fights!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The referees are ruining tonight's game between the Kings and the Oilers. Way to many penalties."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know, what is going on with the penalties tonight? The refs should just let the players play."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I was listening to tonight's game on the radio and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I was in the bleachers and nearly bit my nails off. It was a nailbiter but we pulled off the win in overtime."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Man, I wish those Canucks could win that Stanley Cup one day, but they always seem to choke in the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, I was a huge fan back in the day but their lack of execution when it really counts is a real disappointment. The riots don't help either."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I used to play hockey as a kid but it's so hard on your body. It really is a game for young folks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hear you. It's just amazing that a legend like Gordie Howe was able to play into his 50s."
