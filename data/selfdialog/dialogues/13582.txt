"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think about the Cleveland Browns this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will be improved this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too! I think their defense will be much improved."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yah, especially since they did so well drafting some good defensive players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thin they will be improved offensively as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that can't be much worse than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, you got that right. Maybe they will even finish with more than 4 wins this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see. Who else do you think will be improved this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I would have to say the Cowboys will be even better again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought for sure they would be in the Superbowl last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps this will be the year for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially since those good rookies from last year have a year under their belt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it may help them to get a better coach soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, their coach is decent, but man he never wins in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any idea who you think will win the Superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just like every year I would have to go with the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Until they lose Tom Brady you almost have to favor them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure! He is probably the best quarterback ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My guess is Patriots over the Cowboys this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a pretty good guess in my opinion."
