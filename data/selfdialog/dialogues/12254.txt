"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite professional sport?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd have to say basketball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, of course, you're a Bay Area guy and the Warriors are doing so great.  What about the 49ers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah I've followed them for years and I do like the NFL.  What about you--what's your favorite?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football definitely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You and a lot of people, but what makes it so popular?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tailgating, ha, ha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know you're just kidding, but, even so, most fans don't attend the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they're probably tailgating at home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 49ers are driving me to drink, but really, what makes the game so popular?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know--I suppose the physicality has something to do with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Physicality? Are you trying to get around saying 'violence'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K. you got me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, I'm not that crazy about the violence and I enjoy the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think it's partly the suspense and the excitement that any moment there can be a spectacular play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get that--a 50 yard run by a running back breaking multiple tackles, probably outdoes a driving layup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the 40 yard bomb and diving catch is more exciting than a three point shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And there is a lot of pageantry and tradition in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we've made a couple points, but I'm not sure we've explained the popularity.  Maybe we need to be psychologists."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, we need to be psychologists to explain the popularity of soccer."
