"__ROCK__ Do you like older rock music?"
"__ROCK__ It depends on what you mean by older. The 80's or 90's?"
"__ROCK__ I guess the 80's. Do you like Guns and roses?"
"__ROCK__ Sure some of their songs are great. I like Metallica though."
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah! That one song about the sandman was amazing."
"__ROCK__ Oh, you mean Enter Sandman. I think that was the name."
"__ROCK__ Yeah that's probably it. What about the 90's bands?"
"__ROCK__ Sure some of it. I like Pearl Jam."
"__ROCK__ I think Pearl Jam is still around."
"__ROCK__ Really, I wonder how bands stay together so long."
