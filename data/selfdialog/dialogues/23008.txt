"__DISNEY__ Okay, what was you're favorite Disney movie growing up?"
"__DISNEY__ Alright slow down, are we talking Disney Channel Original Movies or you know, the classics like Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ Ha, well let's say any Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Wow this is a lot. For some reason 101 Dalmations is really standing out the me."
"__DISNEY__ Oh for sure, that's a classic! But I'll admit I preferred the live action one to the animated flick."
"__DISNEY__ That's how it seems to go these days. Well what was your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ That's easy -- A Goofy Movie."
"__DISNEY__ I completely forgot about A Goofy Movie! Remember when that guy had this break with reality or something."
"__DISNEY__ Yes I remember it well! 'Why are we always wearing these gloves all the time?'"
"__DISNEY__ Haha that shattered my world watching that as a little kid. I was like, why DO they where gloves all the time?"
