"__POP__ Can you believe Adele's success at the Grammys this year?"
"__POP__ Even though it was not brand new, that album she won for, 25 is pretty amazing."
"__POP__ I really like her voice on the song Hello."
"__POP__ Yes, that song showcases her talent very well.    What were the other singles?"
"__POP__ I know Water Under the Bridge is the most recent release."
"__POP__ Definitely!    Love the lyrics of that song."
"__POP__ You don't think it is just another relationship tune?"
"__POP__ Maybe, but I don't get people calling it cheesy."
"__POP__ For sure.    This is her third album, and the style is set.    Know anything about the next one?"
"__POP__ Haven't heard anything.     Hope it isn't nearly five years like between 21 and 25."
