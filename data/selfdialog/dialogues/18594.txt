"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite nostalgic movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely The Princess Bride."
"__MOVIES__ Why? You love Star Wars more than living."
"__MOVIES__ Because it's just a ton of ridiculous fun, and Robin Wright is phenomenal."
"__MOVIES__ You had a thing for her."
"__MOVIES__ Of course. And this was one of Carey Elwes' first roles before he got big."
"__MOVIES__ So, it's half hipster reasons, half attraction?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay let me try again."
"__MOVIES__ Go ahead."
"__MOVIES__ It's crazy campy and low-budget, but it's so well-made."
"__MOVIES__ How can it be campy and well-made?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, take the fight scenes. Indigo vs Westley, for instance."
"__MOVIES__ What was campy about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the dialogue was ridiculous, and you can see the mats when they land their big jumps."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so what's so good about it?"
"__MOVIES__ The actual choreography is outstanding, with a long fight scene."
"__MOVIES__ For me, the music is super campy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it sounds like it was all 1980s MIDI, like they couldn't afford an orchestral recording."
"__MOVIES__ That and the ROUSs, who are insanely stupid and impractical."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're there for looks. There's no way they'd survive and sustain their height and weight."
