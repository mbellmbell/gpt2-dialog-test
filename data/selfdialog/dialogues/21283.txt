"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see the Stephen King movie Misery?"
"__THRILLER__ Only about a million times. I love Kathy Bates in everything she does."
"__THRILLER__ She played an insane woman really well in that movie."
"__THRILLER__ That's right. It wasn't overdone or ridiculous, but very believable."
"__THRILLER__ That's right. Did you see her in Dolores Claiborne?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes that one was just as good in my opinion. She's such a good actress."
"__THRILLER__ I think I might have done the same thing she did in that situation."
"__THRILLER__ You mean her character in Misery?"
"__THRILLER__ No of course not! I mean Dolores Claiborne, for what her husband did to their daughter."
"__THRILLER__ Oh of course. I'm sure a lot of mothers sympathized with her when that came out."
