"__MUSIC__ Even though it's been over a year I'm still listening to Beyoncé's Lemonade like it was the first time."
"__MUSIC__ I believe it. That, and the visual album was one of the best things I've ever seen."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song off the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Woah, that's a tough one. You know what, strictly because I can dance to it, Hold Up."
"__MUSIC__ Hold up, they don't love you like I love you. Classic lyrics and I really good beat."
"__MUSIC__ You know the story behind that song?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I assume it has something to do with Jay-Z."
"__MUSIC__ Haha I don't know about that. But do you know that song Maps by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah how does it go ..... 'wait, they don't love you like I love you.' Wow did she steal the lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all. I think in around 2011, that kid from Vampire Weekend, Ezra Koenig tweeted something like, 'hold up, they don't love you like I love you.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so instead of wait, hold up. That's funny."
"__MUSIC__ And yeah apparently he was working on a song and everything but it never really came through."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so he sold it to Beyoncé?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, and I think she put her own spin on it and changed the lyrics a bit. And credited the Yeah Yeah Yeahs of course."
"__MUSIC__ That's so amazing the way things come full circle like that."
"__MUSIC__ It really is. Anyway what's your favorite song off of the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Hold Up is one of them, but also Sorry."
"__MUSIC__ Oh Sorry for sure! It's such a breakup bop."
"__MUSIC__ Truly, and you know what else makes me tear up just a little bit, Sandcastles."
"__MUSIC__ Don't even get me started! Sandcastles and All Night will have me crying .... all night!"
