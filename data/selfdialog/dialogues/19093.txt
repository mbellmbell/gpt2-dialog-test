"__MOVIES__ What movie do you want to see right now?"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder woman, definitely Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Why would you pick that?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen my desk at work?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what does that have to do with Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ That is how I have it decorated, in Wonder Woman. I am a huge fan of comic books."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, So who is in Wonder Woman again?"
"__MOVIES__ Gal Gadot plays the lead."
"__MOVIES__ Never heard of her."
"__MOVIES__ She has been in some of the Fast and Furious franchise movies."
"__MOVIES__ I am not a huge fan of movies that don't have mega named leads."
"__MOVIES__ The biggest Batman flop in history had a huge name as a lead."
"__MOVIES__ Who was that?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh, George Clooney, A.K.A. Bat-nipples."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I try to block that movie from my brain."
"__MOVIES__ So does Clooney."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder why they thought that was a good idea."
"__MOVIES__ Hollywood will forever wonder."
"__MOVIES__ So do you think you will see it in theater's?"
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully, but if not, I will get it when it comes out on blu ray."
