"__DISNEY__ So did you see the new Beauty and the Best movie with Emma Watson?"
"__DISNEY__ Not yet, but I loved the old animated on."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah me too."
"__DISNEY__ I'm a little bit unsure if I want to see the new one."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah so am I. But I hear the acting and CG is wonderful."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that as well. But live action remake seems a bit iffy to me."
"__DISNEY__ True, but you never know you just might like it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, maybe I can give it a chance."
"__DISNEY__ Let's go see it together."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds good to me."
