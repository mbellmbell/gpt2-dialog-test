"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you know if Rick Ross is working on a new album?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I imagine so he doesn't really seem like the type to just stop all of the sudden."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah he seems driven to be successful."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's exactly right."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Any clue when a new album of his might come out then?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hard to say really maybe another year?  He seems to work hard on them for awhile."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's sad but at the same time it's worth the wait."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah it is."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wonder if he'll work with any other rappers on this album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Maybe, hope it's eminem."
