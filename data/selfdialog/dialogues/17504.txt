"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Deadpool?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have, that movie is so funny and awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I think Ryan Reynolds was the best fit for Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ He is such a funny actor, I did not think the movie was going to be a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Me either, when the credits started in the beginning, did you notice the funny names?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I was laughing from the beginning, I knew right there it was going to be funny."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know they are making a Deadpool 2?"
"__MOVIES__ What! No way! When does that come out?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure, but I do know they are making a second one."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what it will be about."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully Ryan is in it again."
"__MOVIES__ He would have to be, nobody else could play that part as well as him."
"__MOVIES__ I liked his little jokes to the camera, like he was interacting with the audience."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that too, not very many movies do that at all."
"__MOVIES__ His jokes were so hilarious, and I am not a fan of comic movies."
"__MOVIES__ Neither am I, but it makes me want to watch more if they are like Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ I do not think many comic movies are quite that funny."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any other comic movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I have only seen a couple, and they were nowhere near like Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen any, but am going to check some out."
