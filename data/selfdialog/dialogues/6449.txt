"__STAR_WARS__ How do you think it felt being Han Solo frozen in carbonite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh man, I don't even like to think about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ What if he was awake the whole time, but just couldn't move or open his eyes?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a creepy thing to even think about."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, but he was in there for a long time."
"__STAR_WARS__ How did they keep him alive without being able to eat?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's a drama in space and you're worried about how someone stuck in a rock ate?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, it's a valid question."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose you're right."
"__STAR_WARS__ What if they just fed him a really big meal to tide him over until he got out?"
