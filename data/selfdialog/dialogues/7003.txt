"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are you a Columbus Blue Jackets fan?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes I am a huge fan!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They have made so much progress since their inaugural season."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You are right! This year was a fantastic season for them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Why do you say that? They are not even in the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well they had the longest active win streak out of any other team this season."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ohh that is true! I heard they were only 1 win short of tying the Blackhawks all-time consecutive win streak."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah what a bummer. Guess we will always be second to the penguins and blackhawks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You mean the Washington Capitals? That is who broke our streak."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Really? Was it in Columbus or DC?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ DC, thank goodness! That would have been devastating to snap the win streak in Columbus."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh well, maybe next season we will do better."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ True, but for now we will have to watch the penguins win another stanley cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah I guess. It seems like they go far in the playoffs every year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They really do have a great team. I mean look at Sydney Crocby."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That is true. As much as I do not care for their team, they are very skilled."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are there any other teams you like to watch?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well the Predators have been fun to watch recently because historically they have not been a high achieving team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's true. I bet Nashville is buzzing with excitement."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You can say that again! I would love to see them as the underdog win a stanley cup."
