"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen any of the 'new' Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have, but I don't think that they are half as good as the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, I can see where you are coming from, but I think they are pretty good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar-Jar Binks is the most annoying character there has ever been."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, true. I really like Darth Maul as a villian though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh definitely, I just wish they had done more with his storyline. It was so short."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I know. I think the last two movies that have been put out have been better than there first attempts at reviving it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I will say that they have improved. I like how Luke Skywalker is back into the plotline here recently."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that it helps bring the movies together more. I really liked Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon being back."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Millenium Falcon is still the coolest ship in the Star Wars Universe, in my opinion."
