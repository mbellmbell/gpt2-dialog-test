"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever seen the Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Many times. It is defintely one of my all time favorite movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Can you help explain to me why the Emperor dies when Darth Vader throws him down the shaft on the Death Star?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I've wondered that myself. It seems that the Jedi and Sith could survive almost everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was thinking that exactly the same. In the Attack of the Clones, Annakin jumps out of a vehicle and falls thousands of feet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes that's a great point. My only thought is that Palpatine must have ignited an explosion."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh right, because there is that huge blue fireball that comes back up the shaft."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, so that is my thought: that he must have hit some fuel cell with his force lightning which ignited a huge explosion."
"__STAR_WARS__ Great thanks! I was wondering why he couldn't survive a 'little' fall like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ No worries. That seems to be the best explanation that I can think of."
