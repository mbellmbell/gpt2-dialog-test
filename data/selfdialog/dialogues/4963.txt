"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I just don't know what to think about the Fast and The Furious films now?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think I know what you mean, but you need to elaborate some more."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, look at the first film.  It was a decent action film revolving around racing and fast cars."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It also revolved around 'family' as 'Dom' always likes to say."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Right.  The stunts were great, but for the most part everything was believable."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Which is the complete opposite of what they are doing now."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Exactly!  In the Fast Five film, there was a scene where they were using their cars to drag a sealed bank vault down a busy street!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ In the Fate of The Furious, the Rock's character manhandled a torpedo.  I love it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Maybe it is because I am getting old, but I like my action scenes to be more realistic."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I want to see how much farther the movies will push the envelope.  Will space be the final frontier for the movies?"
