"__HORROR__ The Shining was on last night.  Man, that movie is scary."
"__HORROR__ I know.  All work and no play makes Johnny a frightening character."
"__HORROR__ Every time it comes on, I have to watch, yet I always regret it.  I have trouble sleeping after I do."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I know what you mean.  It really messes with your mind."
"__HORROR__ It's cool, though, how it's become part of popular culture now.  You see references to it in a lot of other shows."
"__HORROR__ Really, like what?"
"__HORROR__ Well, there's one South Park that totally parallels it.  One of the character buys a Blockbuster, so that's kind of like the hotel."
"__HORROR__ Oh yeah, I remember that one.  You're right; it is connected."
"__HORROR__ And, I think The Simpsons did a parody actually called The Shining for one of their Halloween specials."
"__HORROR__ Cool!  I'll have to check that one out!"
