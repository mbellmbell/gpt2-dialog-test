"__MOVIES__ I love the movie Sucker Punch."
"__MOVIES__ You're talking about the one with Emily Browning and Oscar Isaac, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ I never got around to seeing it. What's so good about it?"
"__MOVIES__ First of all, the cinematography is amazing. Zack Snyder was the director."
"__MOVIES__ He sounds familiar. Didn't he just direct Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice?"
"__MOVIES__ That's right. So many critics don't like his movies, but I think he puts so much work into making them look great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but good cinematography can only take you so far."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you're saying, but in the case of Sucker Punch I thought everything about the movie was great."
"__MOVIES__ I thought I heard somewhere the acting was subpar."
"__MOVIES__ No way. Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Oscar Isaac, and Carla Gugino were amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I do enjoy Oscar Isaac. He's in The Promise alongside Christian Bale."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I haven't seen anything with Christian Bale in it for a long time."
"__MOVIES__ He was in Out of the Furnace not too long ago."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I wanted to see that one but never got around to it."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really good, although I don't really enjoy Casey Affleck as an actor."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny. I don't mind Casey, but I don't really care for his brother Ben."
"__MOVIES__ Are you serious? I loved Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting."
"__MOVIES__ I only ever liked him in He's Just Not That Into You."
"__MOVIES__ He was pretty lovable in that movie"
