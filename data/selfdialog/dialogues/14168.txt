"__HORROR__ Did you watch The Ring 2?"
"__HORROR__ Yea, unfortunately. It was very bad."
"__HORROR__ Oh, why do you say that?"
"__HORROR__ Because, it was basically the same movie as the first one, except now, we already know what happens."
"__HORROR__ Oh yea, I see your point."
"__HORROR__ Yea, the only twist they put on it, was now it deals with college kids."
"__HORROR__ I liked how the threat became global."
"__HORROR__ Yea I guess that was pretty interesting. But what does that even mean really?"
"__HORROR__ I don't know, I guess we'll find out in the ring 3!"
"__HORROR__ Haha, no thanks, I'll skip the next one"
