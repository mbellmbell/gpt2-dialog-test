"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the movie Wall-E?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I love that movie. Why do you ask?"
"__DISNEY__ Because I think I'm getting a bit too large just like the people in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ Haha. No you're not."
"__DISNEY__ You don't think so?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I don't think anybody could be as lazy as those people in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ Well I do like to sit in my chair a lot and watch Disney movies! Haha."
"__DISNEY__ But that's okay because Disney movies are great."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I guess, and Wall-E is one of them."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe you can do some jumping jacks the next time you watch it or something."
