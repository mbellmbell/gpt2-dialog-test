"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, it is just about a month until the preseason starts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Do you like the preseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, I like that there is football on television again, but it is pretty different than the regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel the same way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am excited for it though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When does the actual season start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it kicks off on September 7th."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who plays in that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is the Chiefs versus the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will you be going for in that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will for sure be pulling for the Chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, they are not even 'my team'. I just really do not like the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are kind of cocky. I have nothing personal against them really, they just win too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that. I want to see some diversity in who goes to the big game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love to see some very unlikely teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't it be great if it were someone like the Browns versus the Titans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be something!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or even better, the Browns versus the Bengals. It's an Ohio showdown!"
