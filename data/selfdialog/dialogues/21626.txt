"__DISNEY__ Did you just love The Lone Ranger?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah absolutely. Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, totally awesome together."
"__DISNEY__ No kidding."
"__DISNEY__ The only thing was it was such a long movie."
"__DISNEY__ Some of Depp's antics fell flat too."
"__DISNEY__ I think he was miscast."
"__DISNEY__ I think he said something publicly to this effect."
"__DISNEY__ But I think Armie was spot on in his role."
"__DISNEY__ The final train scene went on way too long for my taste."
"__DISNEY__ They must have been trying to top all previous western train scenes!"
