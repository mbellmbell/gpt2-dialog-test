"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see Death Proof?"
"__THRILLER__ What is that?"
"__THRILLER__ It's a Tarentino film.  A guy is using a car to kill people."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, he's chasing them down in that black car, right?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah!  That's the one."
"__THRILLER__ Sure, I've seen it, but it's been a while."
"__THRILLER__ What's your favorite part?"
"__THRILLER__ I like the whole second half.  You know when the girls are chasing the guy down."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah I was freaking out when that girl was on the hood!"
"__THRILLER__ Did you know she is a stunt woman in real life?"
