"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What did you make of Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's Control?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Man, that was the best thing to happen in rap in 2013."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ One of my favorite moments for sure too."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It was a call out to all rappers to start making real music, real hip hop, to get back to the roots. And he basically crowned himself the King of Rap in that song."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I think it was a call to artistic arms that has since elevated the game."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, he calls out Tyler the Creator, Drake, Mac Miller, A$AP Rocky, and others and says he isn't rapping to be good. He's rapping to be the best."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you heard what Big Sean said about it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What'd he say? That he didn't hear Kendrick's verse before recording his?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, he has said that in the past, but he somewhat recently said he thought he had the best verse on 'Control.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh come on! No one thinks that."
