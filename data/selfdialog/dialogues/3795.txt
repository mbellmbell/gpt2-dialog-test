"__MUSIC__ I need ideas on new music to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I know, my music selection is getting pretty stale."
"__MUSIC__ What have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, in terms of new stuff I like a few newer pop songs."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like Selena Gomez, It Ain't Me and Something Just Like This by the Chainsmokers and Coldplay."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked Something Just Like This when it first came out but then it was played every ten seconds on every station and got old fast."
"__MUSIC__ True, I definitely don't love it now as much as I did at first before I heard it a million times. I think that's pretty typical."
"__MUSIC__ I do like Coldplay though. I used to listen to a lot of their stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I do too but I have to be in the right mood for it because sometimes their music is so slow and sad it can be tough to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. I feel that way about their song Yellow."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the newer Imagine Dragons song, Thunder?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. I probably have."
"__MUSIC__ It's great. I love Imagine Dragons."
"__MUSIC__ I couldn't get enough of their first album, Night Visions."
"__MUSIC__ Same here, I love their song Radioactive from that album."
"__MUSIC__ The band is going on tour and stopping in the Northeast this Fall."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like so much fun. I've heard they're amazing in concert."
"__MUSIC__ I want to hear them sing Bleeding Out live."
"__MUSIC__ Let me know if you get tickets!"
