"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is it just me or is it really hard to understand rap lyrics unless you have them written down right in front of you?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well all these modern artists mumble."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No I mean even classic ones."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I haven't really noticed."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think it's just there's a lot going on at one time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, like for me I mainly listen to Irish artists so there's a whole range of accents there plus they have entirely different slang. Those are the things that get me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I gotcha. I just feel like I can deal with a lot of clever word play or really fast speed of delivery but it's hard to keep up with both."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That makes sense."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So I usually will read all the lyrics before listening to an album for the first time and then read them again while I'm listening."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I do too except there are some songs I just can't find the lyrics for anywhere. So I end up understanding about one more line each time I listen to a song."
