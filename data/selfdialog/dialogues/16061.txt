"__ROCK__ Who are some of your favorite underrated bands?"
"__ROCK__ Oh man, King's X without a doubt. They are criminally underrated."
"__ROCK__ King's X? What do they sound like?"
"__ROCK__ Their sound varies. Their early stuff from the '80s is melodic but influenced by heavy metal and blues. My favorite song from this era is 'Over My Head.' Such a great song."
"__ROCK__ Hmm, not really into that sound."
"__ROCK__ Well, throughout the '90s, they were heavily influenced by grunge. Pearl Jam were a big fan of them during this era. But they still kept their flair for melody, harmony, and groove, which can be heard throughout all of their albums."
"__ROCK__ Melody and harmony?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, all of the members of the band sing, and they create complex vocal harmonies. They were very influenced by the Beatles in this regard."
"__ROCK__ Whoa, now that sounds intriguing. I'll have to look into them."
"__ROCK__ Their most recent stuff has become very progressive and heavier. I like each era, but they've never quite achieved mainstream success, but they have a very loyal fanbase."
