"__MOVIES__ Have you watched the movie Miss Sloane?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't, what's it about and who stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the movie stars Jessica Chastain and there's a host of other actors you might recognize. It's a very good movie."
"__MOVIES__ I love Jessica Chastain! Zero Dark Thirty was such a good movie, how would you compare it to Miss Sloane?"
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed Miss Sloane, I think I prefer and liked it better than Zero Dark Thirty."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting! Jessica was nominated for an Oscar for Zero Dark Thirty so that's saying some high praise!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know, and I thought her performance in that was great, but I thought her performance in Miss Sloane was on another level!"
"__MOVIES__ Alright, you've sold me on it, tell me a little more about what Miss Sloane, but no spoilers!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, in Miss Sloane, Jessica plays a high profile political lobbyist, she's just left her firm and joined a new one to take on a new campaign."
"__MOVIES__ I love political thrillers, you've got my attention!"
"__MOVIES__ The challenges she faces going from this big firm to a smaller one is evident, but her character is so bold, confident, and cold that she revels in these challenges."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I think my attention is definitely rising!"
"__MOVIES__ Alright, so the conflict she starts encountering becomes quite personal as her opposition is basically the pro-gun lobbyist, so you can imagine how heated things will be getting."
"__MOVIES__ Oh this is definitely sounding like it's right up my alley."
"__MOVIES__ Right, and so, when they start trying to dig and attack her character, it becomes a big chess match, and let me tell you this movie is not lacking any substance in tension or punch!"
"__MOVIES__ This sounds really good! I'm going to give it a shot, you sold me on it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad! Tell me what you think once you've caught it, oh and another recent movie I watched that was amazing, was John Wick Chapter 2!"
"__MOVIES__ I saw that last week! John Wick 2 was really good. The action and fight sequences were so top notch."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it! Hollywood needs to get back to good choreographed fight scenes like this, and quit the quick choppy edit ones."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed! Nobody wants to suffer a headache from those bad fight sequences. Thanks for the recommendation. I'm going to check out Miss Sloane!"
