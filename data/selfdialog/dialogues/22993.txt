"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ That's a tough one. I love them all!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but if you HAD to pick just ONE Disney movie that is your absolute favorite, what would it be?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm....... I guess I would have to say Alice in Wonderland."
"__DISNEY__ That's such a great movie! What do you like about it specifically?"
"__DISNEY__ I just like the whole story line. It's so interesting and most of it makes no sense and that's what I love about it!"
"__DISNEY__ Any favorite characters?"
"__DISNEY__ I love The Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. What's your favorite Disney movie if YOU had to pick?"
"__DISNEY__ Don't make me choose. I love them all too! I guess I would have to say The Sword in the Stone."
"__DISNEY__ That's another one of my favorites too! Great choice."
