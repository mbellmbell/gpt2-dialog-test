"__BASEBALL__ Will we ever see a hitter hit 400 in a season?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think the time to do it was the late 90s and it did not happen"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I tend to agree with you because the pitching is so much better"
"__BASEBALL__ But to counter my own argument, players are hitting alot better than they were."
"__BASEBALL__ I just think that its too hard to maintain it all year."
"__BASEBALL__ Hard to believe its that big of a deal to hit less than half the time."
"__BASEBALL__ Well its a tough game"
"__BASEBALL__ You would have to go 2 for 3 almost every day because if you go 1 for 3 its still good but not near the 400 level you are aiming for."
"__BASEBALL__ I think its harder to hit for the triple crown"
"__BASEBALL__ Its fun to watch guys get close."
"__BASEBALL__ Is there a stat youd like to see eliminated?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think RBI."
"__BASEBALL__ What? Thats how baseball exists!"
"__BASEBALL__ I just dont see how thats a stat though, you cant control guys getting on ahead of you."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but you can control whether they cross the dish"
"__BASEBALL__ Thats true but still doesnt change the fact that you did nothing to get them on."
"__BASEBALL__ Sometimes thats not true"
"__BASEBALL__ How?"
"__BASEBALL__ Guy could be a terrilbe hitter so they walk players to get to him and then he hits a grand slam"
"__BASEBALL__ That almost never happens"
