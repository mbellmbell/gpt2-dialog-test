"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey bud! What have you been up to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh nothing much, just slaving away at work."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I hear you there. Do you have any plans for the weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not really. I guess I'll just stay at home and watch movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, that's one of my favorite ways to unwind too. What are you going to watch?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have no clue. I'm hoping to find a series to binge on."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you have Hulu or Netflix?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have both."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have been watching a really good series on Hulu if you're interested."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Heck yes!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's called the Handmaid's Tale."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think I have heard of that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's a book too. There is an old movie based on the book as well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's about a world where fertile women are gathered up and used to reproduce, regardless of their wants and needs."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sounds creepy!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It really is disturbing! What do you say we get together and watch the movie Sunday? I haven't seen it yet."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sounds like a plan!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Cool. Why don't you come over to my house around 2 pm?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Great! I'll bring the popcorn!"
