"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the campus radio station?"
"__MUSIC__ They're okay, but some of the music they play is pretty weird."
"__MUSIC__ Weird how?"
"__MUSIC__ Like, it's so indie and obscure I've never heard of it. Or else it's really folk-pop."
"__MUSIC__ Folk-pop? Give me an example."
"__MUSIC__ You know what I mean. Like, Mumford and Sons."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of like them."
"__MUSIC__ They aren't bad, it's just a strange choice for the radio station."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you were the DJ here, what would you play."
"__MUSIC__ Lots of classic rock! Led Zeppelin, that sort of thing."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like people might also think that was a weird choice."
"__MUSIC__ Why would they?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, this is a college radio station. I think they expect it to be a little fresh."
"__MUSIC__ Fresh as in indie?"
"__MUSIC__ Fresh as in contemporary. You might be better off throwing in some pop."
"__MUSIC__ Then I'm not sure that this is a job I want."
"__MUSIC__ Luckily it's not one you have to do!"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I could be more flexible."
"__MUSIC__ Let them play whatever they want, so long as people are enjoying it."
"__MUSIC__ That seems like a nice philosophy."
