"__STAR_WARS__ Would you change any cast member if you could?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the original actors were really perfect in the roles and brought it to what it is now."
"__STAR_WARS__ It makes you wonder if kurt russell had been Han Solo would it have been as good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Was he in the running for the part?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep he was considered."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think harrison is so good as Han hard to imagine anyone doing it better!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently harrison was brought in at  first just to feed lines to the auditioning actors."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never heard that before."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya, George ended up loving his delivery to the actors and cast him in the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow! I am so glad he did."
