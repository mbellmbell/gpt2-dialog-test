"__MUSIC__ I used to think I'd always be aware of the most recent music, but I'm not. I still like older songs."
"__MUSIC__ You know, while there are some great older songs, there are still some pretty cool new songs."
"__MUSIC__ I realize I should try harder maybe, I still find  myself listening to The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, and The Rolling Stones."
"__MUSIC__ Those are great groups. Which group is your favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I usually say the Rolling Stones, but I also like Bob Seger and songs from the 1960s."
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to the music every day."
"__MUSIC__ I don't, but I still find myself listening to music every week. I always listen to the older songs when in the car."
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I live in a rural area and have trouble picking up a station I like. I have quite a few songs on the computer. So I've put music on CDs."
"__MUSIC__ Do you find yourself listening to the same bands before changing the CD?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I try to put a mix of different artists on each CD to make it more like I'm listening to the radio. I would get bored, I think, listening to just one artist."
"__MUSIC__ What types of songs do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of the CDs are country music. Some are oldies, rock or pop. Usually, I don't mix the different types of songs on the same CD."
"__MUSIC__ How do you choose which CD you want to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I usually just randomly pick a CD. If I'm not in the mood to listen to that CD, I may switch to another one."
"__MUSIC__ How many songs do you get on a CD?"
"__MUSIC__ There's usually around 20 songs per CD, and I have maybe 20 CDs in the car."
"__MUSIC__ That's quite a few songs you have."
"__MUSIC__ I think so. I don't drive all that much since I'm retired, but it's plenty to keep me entertained. I do like my music."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds great. I wish I took the time to make my own CDs."
