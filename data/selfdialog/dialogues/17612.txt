"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't, why?"
"__MOVIES__ I wanted to go to the theater and just find something to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Hah, you could do that on television for free!"
"__MOVIES__ You know what I mean; is there anything good out?"
"__MOVIES__ I think A Cure for Wellness might be out but I'm not sure."
"__MOVIES__ What's that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's like this horror or something like that."
"__MOVIES__ Horror?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it hosts a rehabilitation center where everything is just kinda weird."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have the trailer on your phone?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, let me bring it up for you."
"__MOVIES__ That was a little weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is weird."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I'd like that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I want to see it just to answer questions, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I get what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe that Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ When is it out?"
"__MOVIES__ June 2!"
