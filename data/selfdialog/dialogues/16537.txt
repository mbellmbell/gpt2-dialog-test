"__MOVIES__ Do you like horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They're okay."
"__MOVIES__ My favorites are the Friday the 13th series."
"__MOVIES__ Jason is all right. I like some of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies."
"__MOVIES__ I like them too, but not the second one. That was just bad."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the main character was too whiny."
"__MOVIES__ It's sort of the black sheep of the series."
"__MOVIES__ Robert Englund is always good no matter how cheesy it is, though."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed."
"__MOVIES__ I like the old ones a lot better than some of the franchises these days, like Saw."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Saw is just a little to disgusting for the sake of being digusting."
"__MOVIES__ Others are so forgettable, like the Final Destination series."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a lot of modern movies are like that. Or they go too far like the Human Centipede."
"__MOVIES__ Don't even get me started on Human Centipede. Just why?"
"__MOVIES__ And why a sequel? I think the filmmakers got too greedy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there was no way that shock value was going to last through a successful sequel."
"__MOVIES__ At least there are still classics, like Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
"__MOVIES__ Those were pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ You just don't see iconic characters like Michael Meyers anymore."
"__MOVIES__ You certainly don't."
