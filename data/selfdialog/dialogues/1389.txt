"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Creed's last album?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't. Is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not too bad, to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ Does it sound like their old stuff at all?"
"__MUSIC__ It actually does. With a few differences here and there."
"__MUSIC__ What are the differences?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a tad more pop-ish."
"__MUSIC__ Eh, I'm not sure how I feel about that."
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of like anything else on the radio these days."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. Which I don't really like."
"__MUSIC__ I saw the band last weekend and they still sounded great."
"__MUSIC__ Did they sing all of their hits?"
"__MUSIC__ And then some."
"__MUSIC__ I wish I would've went now!"
"__MUSIC__ You should've, man. Great concert."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to go when they come back."
"__MUSIC__ They'll be back eventually. They tend to come back pretty often."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and I keep missing them haha."
"__MUSIC__ I'l let you know when they come then."
"__MUSIC__ Now that sounds like a plan!"
