"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, how are your Broncos going to do this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Lynch is ready to step up, man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is he even the starter, officially?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but he's been looking good in camp."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotcha. That defense is still gonna be sick, I'm sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. Von Miller is all you need."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Super Bowl MVP, man. His performance was sick!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the best I've ever seen. That strip sack to end the game... wow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was amazing. What do you think of Siemean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's a good back-up QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you think that Lynch is better than him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. Just something about the way his mechanics are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just a gut feeling? I bet Matt Ryan had a gut feeling in last year's Super Bowl too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Boy, was that an embarrassment. I still think the Packers would have beat both of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll never know, considering Rodgers is always being beat in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He needs a better defense. It's just like with Brees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Brees' talent going to waste for the last half a decade has been criminal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, ever since their Super Bowl win, it's been downhill."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. But I'll catch you next month at a bar for the first preseason game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good, man. Broncos going for that second ring in three years!"
