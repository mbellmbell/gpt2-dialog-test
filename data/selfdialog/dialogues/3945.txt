"__MUSIC__ It must have been something to live in Manhattan in the 1970s."
"__MUSIC__ What, with all the gangs and blackouts and street crime? Must have been something, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Well, okay -- but the music scene. CBGBs. All of the punk and post-punk and New Wave, it all came through there."
"__MUSIC__ Right, there's that. I guess it makes sense that all the pain and poverty and chaos and whatever would turn into some groundbreaking art."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, art in general. There was Warhol and Studio 54 and everything. The night life basically came out of this whole scene -- everything we think of with dance clubs, and everything that came out of that."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, I get you. But actually living there --"
"__MUSIC__ Well, let's forget the practicalities and live in the glamour for a moment. You're right, there's a direct tie between the chaos and the art."
"__MUSIC__ There usually is."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but specifically. Like, the black-out, it meant all these impoverished people grabbed all this cutting-edge electronic equipment and used it to invent hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ That... is interesting. I mean, it makes some sense, if you think about what hip-hop is -- it's all of these borrowed pieces stitched together, I guess, like the equipment that it was made on."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly -- everything has its context, and is inextricably a part of it. That's the trade-off you get: live in boring times, and there's nothing to act against, except maybe that tedium."
"__MUSIC__ Makes you wonder, then, why so much dark metal comes out of, like, Sweden and Norway. Don't they have the strongest social safety nets in the world, or thereabouts?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess it's just a lack of sunlight. Everyone's depressed up there; it's like heart disease in the States."
"__MUSIC__ Thinking about it, how far back does this go? The blues were pretty obviously created in response to their environment..."
"__MUSIC__ See, yeah, and that shows a point as to why so much music comes out of black America -- it's such a unique cesspool of inequity and horror that they've got to create some damned strong art to keep their heads up at all."
"__MUSIC__ This is making me sort of uncomfortable to talk about."
"__MUSIC__ It should! Just about any music with a beat that you or I enjoy is a result of cultural appropriation. We took their bodies, their labor, their wealth, their dignity -- and finally their culture that they use to cope with all of our abuse."
"__MUSIC__ Man, I, uh."
"__MUSIC__ I know. But, we can't help the world we're born into; it just helps to understand what we're working with and why it's there, if we want to do any better with what we've been given."
"__MUSIC__ I guess, yeah, there's lots of raw material sitting around now to make something beautiful. I wonder if there's any way to repay the debt, though."
