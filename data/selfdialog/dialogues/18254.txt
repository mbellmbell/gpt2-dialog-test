"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the newest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Deadmen Tell Not Tales? I haven't seen it yet, but I want to! Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It was amazing! Although when is Johnny Depp not amazing?"
"__MOVIES__ That's good to hear! Sometimes when they have so many sequels, the movies start lacking story lines and action. I'm always unsure about seeing them."
"__MOVIES__ No! It did seem a bit long, but there was tons of action in the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Is it all the same actors/characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! All of those and some new ones, but most importantly . . . Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they are the most important ones . . . so handsome. Both of them!"
"__MOVIES__ Plus some of the favorites like Barbossa and Captain Salazar are in the movie and the special effects are out of this world!"
"__MOVIES__ It really is amazing how they are able to create the ghost pirates. They're so creepy and realistic. Gives me shivers down my spine!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It really pulls you in and makes you feel like you''re there! Swashbuckling pirates looting, killing, and taking over the sea!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you know when the movie came out? I'm wondering if I should just wait and buy it on dvd to add to my collection."
"__MOVIES__ I think it came out toward the end of May. Honestly, I'd still go see it in the theaters and then buy it on dvd when its available. The theater experience is like no other!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I suppose you do get more of the surround sound and quality picture in the theaters."
"__MOVIES__ The critics didn't rate it that highly, but what do they know? lol"
"__MOVIES__ Right. Usually if they don't like a movie, I like it! lol"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! I think the ending left it open to another sequel too!"
"__MOVIES__ No way! Wow! I wonder how many of these they're going to make?!"
"__MOVIES__ I would say that as long as it's selling and they can come up with a story line. Pirates of the Caribbean is huge at Disney World!"
"__MOVIES__ Very true and Johnny Depp has always done such a good job acting. If anyone could keep a movie going, it would be him for sure. I think I'll go see the movie tomorrow night! Thanks for the recommendation."
