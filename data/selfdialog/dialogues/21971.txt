"__DISNEY__ Are you excited for the new release of Thor: Ragnarok?"
"__DISNEY__ Nah.  I'm not really into those kinds of movies."
"__DISNEY__ I hear it's really good.  I don't really like those movies either, but they are fun to watch in the summer."
"__DISNEY__ I can agree with this.  I like super hero movies, just not Thor for some reason."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I don't get the appeal of Chris Hemsworth."
"__DISNEY__ I don't either, he's not even that good looking."
"__DISNEY__ They should put Orlando Bloom in a super hero movie."
"__DISNEY__ I can get behind that idea, he's gorgeous!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!  I've loved him since Lord of the Rings."
"__DISNEY__ He's so good looking in the Pirates movie series, too."
