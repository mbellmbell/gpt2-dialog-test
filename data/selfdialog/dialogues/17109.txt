"__MOVIES__ What do you think is Ellen Page's best performance?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, easy. Hard Candy."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Out of all the movies she's been in, that's your choice?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, even though she was young at the time, she gave an amazing performance."
"__MOVIES__ Alright. Personally I think her best role was in Super."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good choice, and a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ It really is. It's so messed up, but I love it."
"__MOVIES__ It really turns the superhero genre on its head."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like, other movies have deconstructed super heroes before, but I think Super does it best."
"__MOVIES__ I think the only thing that comes close is Kick-Ass, but I think Super is still better."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, speaking of Kick-Ass, Hit Girl, Chloe Grace Moretz, is another actress who started young and put out some really great performances."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I might say Hit Girl was her best role."
"__MOVIES__ I liked her in Dark Shadows."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen it. I've been meaning to watch Let Me In forever, too."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot she was in that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's been in a lot of movies."
"__MOVIES__ I think she's actually in three movies this year."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, she must keep busy."
"__MOVIES__ Making movies keeps people busy."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe so, but it keeps us entertained."
