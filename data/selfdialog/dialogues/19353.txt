"__MOVIES__ Okay. My favorite movie of all time would have to be Inglorious Basterds."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about 'all time' favorite, but it's certainly an amazing movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just think it's so good because because of the guy who played Hans Landa."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. That was Christoph Waltz. Isn't he fantastic?"
"__MOVIES__ He absolutely made that movie for me."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was good on it's own."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he is positively evil! And his voice is so chilling."
"__MOVIES__ I love the way he says the most rotten stuff with this horribly happy sounding tone."
"__MOVIES__ See? That's what makes him so good."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. Did you see him in Django Unchained?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course I did!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Obviously, I loved him. Everything he does it perfect."
"__MOVIES__ You really like this guy!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know how he was undiscovered for so long, but Quentin Tarantino made him a star."
"__MOVIES__ Hard to argue with that. He deserves it, too. He really is one of the greats."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know he doesn't even speak fluent Italian, but he still spoke it in Inglorious Basterds?"
"__MOVIES__ He must have practiced so much. What a talented guy."
"__MOVIES__ So, you see why I love him so much?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, okay! I guess I understand."
