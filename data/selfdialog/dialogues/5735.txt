"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite location in the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't remember all that many. I guess Tatooine?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why Tatooine?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it always felt like the home base for Star Wars. Both Anakin and Luke grew up there."
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I kind of like Hoth."
"__STAR_WARS__ The ice planet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. I'm really into the winter aesthetic."
