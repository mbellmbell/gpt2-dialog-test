"__ACTION__ I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time today."
"__ACTION__ Wow, that is a real classic cult action film."
"__ACTION__ It was nothing like what I expected."
"__ACTION__ John Travolta is brilliant in that movie."
"__ACTION__ He was like this cool contract killer, him and the other guy?"
"__ACTION__ Samuel L. Jackson?"
"__ACTION__ Yes! When he recited the Bible verse, albeit a little wrongly, it was so intense."
"__ACTION__ Then ended up shooting the guy any way."
"__ACTION__ Yes! I liked how all the stories bled into one another."
"__ACTION__ Yes, but some characters never even met. Like Bruce Willis and Travolta, their characters never meet,"
