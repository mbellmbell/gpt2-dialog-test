"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it is a shameless rip off of A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ I completely agree. Even down to Kylo Ren killing Hans Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ And blowing up the Death Star by doing a jump shot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, at least they made Rougue One to explain why there is a flaw"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a really good movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ And since everyone dies, we won't have any sequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or ill-concieved prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Revenge of the Sith was ok."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was seriously the only one they needed to make."
