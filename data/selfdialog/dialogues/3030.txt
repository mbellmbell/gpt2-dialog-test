"__MUSIC__ What type of music do you prefer?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm definitely a rock fan."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting, who is you favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say Pearl Jam."
"__MUSIC__ Not a fan of anything recent?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, I think rock has been a shame since the 90's ended."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Can you name one band that's Hall of Fame worthy since that time?"
"__MUSIC__ Now that you say that, no, not really."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, it's all been formulaic garbage since the 90's."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think that is?"
"__MUSIC__ I think rock has always been about rebellion, and Grunge was the last form of rebellion."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but people always are rebelling, so why nothing new?"
"__MUSIC__ Because other forms of music took over the rebellion platform."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ Emo, punk, those sorts of genres became the anthems of the new generations."
"__MUSIC__ And you don't consider those to be forms of rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I would say that they are actually borderline pop."
"__MUSIC__ So is there any hope for rock's future?"
"__MUSIC__ I think a return to the sounds of the 70's and 80's could go over well at this time."
