"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  I loved it-- great movie, awesome soundtrack, and Stallone is in it."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ Too many good parts to name-- it's a brilliant mix of comedy, action, and drama."
"__MOVIES__ I can agree with that.  Talk about taking some secondary characters, and making them super popular."
"__MOVIES__ James Gunn is a great director.  I really liked his movie Super, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's probably Rainn Wilson's best movie role."
"__MOVIES__ And, it has Juno in it."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, you mean Ellen Page?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, haha.  I loved her as Kitty Pryde."
"__MOVIES__ Kevin Bacon is in Super too, and would later be Sebastion Shaw in X-Men first class."
"__MOVIES__ And, Michael Rooker, who was Yondu in Guardians."
"__MOVIES__ Everything comes full circle.  You like Michael Rooker?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's solid.  I liked him in Mallrats, and Days of Thunder, but his role as Yondu is my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ How about Chris Pratt, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ I know, he went from a small name actor to one of the biggest stars in Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ And, how about Dave Bautista?"
"__MOVIES__ Guardians definitely made his acting career."
"__MOVIES__ No doubt-- pro wrestlers don't typically make a lot of good movies."
"__MOVIES__ Except the Rock.  He's one of the biggest stars out there."
