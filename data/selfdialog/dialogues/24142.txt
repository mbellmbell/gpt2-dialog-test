"__SUPERHERO__ Hey, did you see the latest trailer for Spider-Man Homecoming?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I did! It looks awesome, and I am really excited to see it!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, me too! I am so happy that Spider-Man is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, totally! I was worried that he would only appear in Captain America: Civil War, but it looks like, at least for now, he is here to stay."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know! It is so great! Having Spider-Man being able to interact with characters like Captain America and Iron Man is just so awesome!"
"__SUPERHERO__ You are completely right! Spidey is such an iconic part of the Marvel Universe, and the MCU just seems so much more real and alive with him in it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I couldn't agree more! And I am really happy that he is going up against a classic villain like The Vulture."
"__SUPERHERO__ So true. It is really great that they were able to include such a traditional Spidey villain without re-hashing a character that has already been done, like Green Goblin or Venom."
"__SUPERHERO__ For sure! Here's hoping they might be able to squeeze in some cool cameos as well."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, I hope so! I can't wait to see this movie!"
