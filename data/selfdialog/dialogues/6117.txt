"__STAR_WARS__ Can you tell me something about lighstabers?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What would you like to know?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, why are they so rare and hard to find?  I feel like they should be readily available on a galactic market."
"__STAR_WARS__ You'd think that but there are a couple reasons."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh? Like what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well the crystals are extremely rare first of all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is that all?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, technically they are only supposed to be assembled by a young Jedi, they are built by the user."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some sort of ritual?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a bit simplistic, more of a tradition among force-sensitives to go from being a padiwan to being a jedi."
