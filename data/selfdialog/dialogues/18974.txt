"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Lonesome Dove?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't, isn't Robert Duvall in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I think it's the best thing he's ever done, even better than The Godfather."
"__MOVIES__ There's no way it's better than The Godfather. Marlon Brandon is amazing in that."
"__MOVIES__ I think Marlon Brando was better in A Streetcar Named Desire."
"__MOVIES__ If we're talking about Tennessee Williams plays turned into film, I'm going to always pick Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, me too! I really love Paul Newman in that!"
"__MOVIES__ It's one of my favorite Elizabeth Taylor films too!"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite Elizabeth Taylor movie is National Velvet."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of horse movies, did you ever watch Sea Biscuit?"
"__MOVIES__ Sea Biscuit? The one with Tobey McGuire? No, I never saw that one."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good, even though I'm not a fan of Tobey McGuire's."
"__MOVIES__ I thought he was okay in Spiderman."
"__MOVIES__ I guess those movies were okay. I really enjoyed James Franco in them."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked James Franco in Pineapple Express."
"__MOVIES__ I really think James Franco should be in a Wes Anderson movie, that feels like it would be a good fit."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love Wes Anderson! The Royal Tenenbaums is one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a great one, but I really loved Moonrise Kingdom. Bill Murray was amazing in it."
"__MOVIES__ There should definitely be more Bill Murray in the world."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I agree. It doesn't get any better than Groundhog Day!"
