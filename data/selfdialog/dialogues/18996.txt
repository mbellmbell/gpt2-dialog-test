"__MOVIES__ Have you been to the movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I went last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ What did you see?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the re-air of Rear Window."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I didn't know that was even possible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Turner Classic Movies has these showings of classic movies at theaters around the country."
"__MOVIES__ I wish I would have known!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll let you know the next time they do something like this."
"__MOVIES__ That would be great. I love classic movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. And getting to see them in the theater again is the best."
"__MOVIES__ Much better than just on your tv, I would imagine."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, definitely! And they have restored the films as well."
"__MOVIES__ So they look good up on the big screen?"
"__MOVIES__ Really good. Cleaned up, no hissing or soft edges. Really sharp and nice."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen other films like this?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean in the theater?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, in the theater, re-airings."
"__MOVIES__ No, not other classic movies. That's why I really wanted to go this screening."
"__MOVIES__ Well, don't forget to let me know the next time!"
"__MOVIES__ Don't worry, I won't!"
