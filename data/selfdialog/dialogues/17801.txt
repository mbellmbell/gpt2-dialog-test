"__MOVIES__ What's your view on the new Wonder Woman movie ?"
"__MOVIES__ I am fairly pumped for it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it will be a good one ?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it has potential"
"__MOVIES__ I like her in the Batman and supernan film."
"__MOVIES__ She has a real presence."
"__MOVIES__ I think it will go over well in her solo film."
"__MOVIES__ It will for sure have a lot of action"
"__MOVIES__ Don't D.C. Movies always have action"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure this film will double up on action"
"__MOVIES__ Why would they do that ?"
"__MOVIES__ Since it's a gamble film. Wonder Woman is a well known, but never had her own movie"
"__MOVIES__ I get it. Needs a lot of D.C. Action cred"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Their movies are so much just non stop action ad power , I'm sure this one will be even bigger in that"
"__MOVIES__ I kind of hope so. I like the whole strong superhero, female superhero"
"__MOVIES__ It seems like that is something we will see more of in films"
"__MOVIES__ I think the Wonder Woman film is the perfect catalyst for it"
"__MOVIES__ The movie should have a lot of power, but also a softer side I bet"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder Woman movies could never be soft."
"__MOVIES__ So maybe no Wonder Woman romance film ?"
