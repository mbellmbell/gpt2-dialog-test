"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, when does the football season start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it starts September 10th."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Awesome. Who are you excited to watch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm most excited to watch the Patriots. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm most excited to see how the Cowboys play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys were great last year. Think they can keep it up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think they can do it again. Do you think the Patriots will make it back to the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure. It would be awesome to see Tom Brady win another ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Dak Prescott may challenge him this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did play great last year. But we will see if he can keep playing at that caliber."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he is an excellent QB and the Cowboys got lucky drafting him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Its not often a new QB can come and play that well in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I'm positive he will do it again this year and they will make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't it be cool if the Patriots played the Cowboys in the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be fantastic. Think it could happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots have a good chance of returning but can the Cowboys win a playoff game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are bound to win some with this team. Its only a matter of time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will wait and see. But I think this will be an amazing season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. Can't wait to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. September cant come soon enough."
