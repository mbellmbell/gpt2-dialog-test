"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think Lil Uzi Vert should be considered a rapper?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm not too sure. His beats are dope, but the bars are lackluster"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ok, true. But it's 2017, not 96 Reasonable Doubt era..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I agree... however quality is key."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And do you think his music isn't high quality?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Take someone new like Joey Badass and compare him to Uzi. It's high quality versus low-end rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But Uzi provides that vibe that you need sometimes..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ehh... quality and a vibe is better than just a vibe."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ok, I see what you mean."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ ...but regardless, if you like him, you like him. I can't judge!"
