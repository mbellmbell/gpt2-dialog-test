"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch Deepwater Horizon?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe so. Remind me, who's in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love Kurt Russell. Especially in Escape from LA."
"__MOVIES__ Ummm, yeah that's a random movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well it's one of his finest."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, Deepwater Horizon is about the oil rig explosion from a few years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, and then there was that leak that went on for months."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, well this is the story behind that explosion."
"__MOVIES__ Oh so almost like a docu-drama."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it makes BP look like a very evil company that didn't care about safety."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. Who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ Peter Berg"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man I love his work. I loved Friday Night Lights."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a good one. Battleship not so much."
"__MOVIES__ Oh dear, that was horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably one of those regret movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I'm sure most directors have a few of those."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, definitely check out Deepwater Horizon. A good movie overall."
"__MOVIES__ Okay I will. Thanks."
