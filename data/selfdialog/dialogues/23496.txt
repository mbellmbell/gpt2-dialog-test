"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the Disney's movie The Princess Diaries?"
"__DISNEY__ The Princess Diaries?? the one released back in 2001?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes thats the one I am talking about. It was such an interesting movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes i remember that movie, it was about a teen girl who unexpectedly happen to be princess of a small European State."
"__DISNEY__ Right, she was really shy and clumsy girl, then she discovers she is a princess, that was really a twist of faith!"
"__DISNEY__ Anne Hathaway acted really awesome as Mia Thermopolis. She was making me laugh quite a good!"
"__DISNEY__ Thermopolis!! even that name is funny right. Sounds like its a name of an instrument in a chemistry lab!"
"__DISNEY__ Actually her name is Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldi, Mia Thermopolis is her short name."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but longer is much better for a princess, longer name sounds more royal."
"__DISNEY__ That is true but a name that longer is not quite handy if someone is addressing her, thats why they call her Mia."
