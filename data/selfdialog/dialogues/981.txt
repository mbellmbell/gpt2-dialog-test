"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Streetlight Manifesto?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a great band to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, have you been to any of their concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I was just at their show in Philadelphia earlier this year."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, I last went two years ago. They played with Reel Big Fish."
"__MUSIC__ Did Thomas play anything early from his new album? He sometimes does that."
"__MUSIC__ He actually did, he played the new song off of The Hands That Thieve."
"__MUSIC__ That's neat. Do you remember his last band?"
"__MUSIC__ What was it, Catch 22 right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really think Keasby Nights is the best album ever made."
"__MUSIC__ I have to say it does include two of my favorite songs, but I like the remake better."
"__MUSIC__ The remake was okay, but the grittiness of the original can't be matched."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it was pretty funny that Tom went on to start streetlight."
"__MUSIC__ Catch 22 kept going and released a few more albums, some of them are very good."
"__MUSIC__ Woah, I didn't know that. What other ska bands do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well Less Than Jake is cool."
"__MUSIC__ They're good, I think they have a lot of catchy tunes."
"__MUSIC__ I think so too, the trumpet solos are off the chain."
"__MUSIC__ Well ska has a good variety of music I think, there's something for everyone."
"__MUSIC__ There definitely was for me, I didn't find out about it until a couple  of years ago."
