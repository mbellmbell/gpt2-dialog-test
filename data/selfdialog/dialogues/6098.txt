"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think Luke has been up to all this time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he pulled a Yoda and went into hiding."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Yoda was disappointed in himself and that's why he went all recluse."
"__STAR_WARS__ The next movie is called the last Jedi, so maybe he knew he was the last one and wanted to be around to teach the next generation."
"__STAR_WARS__ 'No there is another'. Leia could have been a Jedi, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but she never was a Jedi, she doesn't have any training."
"__STAR_WARS__ So is the last Jedi Luke? or is it Rey?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure, I bet it could go either way, but I imagine it is probably Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Technically Rey isn't a Jedi. At best she would be a youngling or a Padawin."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, but was Luke ever made a master? Is he even allowed to take a pupil on?"
