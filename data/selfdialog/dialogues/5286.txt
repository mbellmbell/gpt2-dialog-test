"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think the ghost of Yoda will be in the next movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I sure hope so, that little alien is my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Mine too! I love when he is in the swamp and he has gone slightly mad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right? Like, if I was Like and showed up and this slightly crazy alien was supposed to help me, I'd be a little worried."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but he couldn't leave because his ship was sunk in the mud."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the part where Yoda is digging through his food."
"__STAR_WARS__ There was probably not a lot of good snacks in the swamp."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe Yoda was looking for Space Doritos."
"__STAR_WARS__ He could use the force to make them appear."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that. Unless your midichorians are really off the scale."
