"__MUSIC__ What's your opinion on Bon Iver?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty mixed, to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ I love his old stuff, his new stuff is just okay."
"__MUSIC__ What makes you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really like all of they synthesizers in his last album, 22 A Million."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I see what you mean there."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not saying he's not talented you know, it just felt kind of fake."
"__MUSIC__ I never really felt that way, he still plays everything."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I thought it was prerecorded?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, not at all man. He composes all the music and has a back up band in session and on stage."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I didn't know that. I thought he just recorded the sounds."
"__MUSIC__ Nope, you should give it another shot."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I will. I really liked For Emma, For Ever ago."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that really landed him on the stage."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's funny. He doesn't look like it but he has such a great voice."
"__MUSIC__ I know, he can hit so many high notes."
"__MUSIC__ Skinny Love! I loved that song. Heck I still do."
"__MUSIC__ Great tune. I'm telling you, give his stuff another shot. It's a new style, but still pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the recommendation. I'll give it another whirl."
