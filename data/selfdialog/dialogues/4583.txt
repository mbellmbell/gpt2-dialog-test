"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Ed Sheeran album?"
"__MUSIC__ The one called Divide?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! It's so good!"
"__MUSIC__ I know. There's so many catchy song son the album and so many different melodies."
"__MUSIC__ I love the one that sounds like an Irish jig. It's called Nancy Mulligan."
"__MUSIC__ That one's so good. But my favorite is Shape of you."
"__MUSIC__ It does have a good beat. It's much more modern than  lot of the other songs."
"__MUSIC__ What about Castle on a hill. Did you like that one?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's really deep and makes me think of my childhood. I really get lost in his music."
"__MUSIC__ I feel the same way. All of his albums have been really good, I think."
"__MUSIC__ And isn't it cool the way he names his albums?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. First it was Plus, then Multiply, and now the third album is called divide."
"__MUSIC__ I like to think the last one will be called subtraction."
"__MUSIC__ It probably will. I wonder if the next album will be more country and jig-like like his latest album or if it will have more pop songs."
"__MUSIC__ It will probably have a lot of pop songs. Those seem to hit the top charts more often."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Shape of you and Don't got really popular."
"__MUSIC__ But so did his slower love songs like Photograph and Thinking Out Loud."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I guess every album he makes has a hit or two on it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I don't care what kind of song it is as long as he keeps making them. He always makes great music."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! I hope he just keeps writing new songs and releasing albums!"
