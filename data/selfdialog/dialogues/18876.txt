"__MOVIES__ I love watching good clean family movies that my daughter can watch, do you know of any?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure do, does it matter when they were made?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, I am just looking for lighthearted films that we can enjoy together."
"__MOVIES__ What about Matilda?"
"__MOVIES__ I have heard of that one, is there anyone in it that I would recognize?"
"__MOVIES__ Danny DeVito and Mara Wilson are the two main stars."
"__MOVIES__ Great! I have always enjoyed movies with DeVito in them."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, he is a legend for sure. I think the two of you should check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Can you tell me more about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, it is about a little girl who has magical powers; and she uses them to make up for a lackluster family and an evil school principal."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds very interesting, I think we will have to order that one and watch it."
"__MOVIES__ It has a great story to it, and it is one that will be great to watch with some popcorn!"
"__MOVIES__ Thanks for the advice, have a couple of others in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Another good one that comes to mind is Jumanji. It has a couple of bad words in it but it is mostly fine for kids to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I think I have seen that one, Robin Williams is in that one correct?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes he is, and he does a terrific job in hos portayl of a man that just returned from years spent in the jungle."
"__MOVIES__ I have seen that one, but I do not think my daughter has. There is another one for us to watch!"
"__MOVIES__ Tim Allen has some nice family movies as well, do you like him?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure do, my daughter and I just finished watching the Santa Claus movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Those are great! You should also check out Jungle 2 Jungle as well!"
