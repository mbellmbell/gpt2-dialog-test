"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite comedy movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Not sure -- either The Jerk or Meet the Parents."
"__MOVIES__ The Jerk? I have never seen that."
"__MOVIES__ You've got to be kidding me! It is seriously one of the funniest movies of all time. It stars Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I love Steve Martin. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Sort of a rags to riches story. A guy invents an eyeglass accessory."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out. Have you see the movie Dick?"
"__MOVIES__ Good Dick?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Dick. It is a parody of Richard Nixon and Watergate."
"__MOVIES__ Is it from the 70s?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think the 90s. Kirsten Dunst is in it. She and another teenage girl accidentally get a job walking Nixon's dog."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god, that sounds great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they get to see all the behind the scenes activities in the White House. I won't tell you everything, though."
"__MOVIES__ Historical comedy."
"__MOVIES__ That reminds me of A Knight's Tale, although that wasn't really a comedy, but it had some funny stuff in it."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Heath Ledger?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the Middle Ages people dancing to modern music."
"__MOVIES__ Too bad about his death, I really enjoyed his work."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too. Oh, he was also in Ten Things I Hate About you, with Julia Stiles. Also funny."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a good romantic comedy."
