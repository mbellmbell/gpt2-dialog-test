"__MOVIES__ What did you do last night?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I just sat home on the couch watching tv."
"__MOVIES__ What were you watching?"
"__MOVIES__ A movie I've watched a dozen times, The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really a big Adam Sandler fan. He seems kind of annoying sometimes, and not really that funny."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I agree. I'm not a big fan either. I just like The Longest Yard because of the movie plot."
"__MOVIES__ Because the prisoners get one over on the guards?"
"__MOVIES__ Not so much that, because you know in real life, prisoners often have horrible behavior, and guards are just there to do their jobs."
"__MOVIES__ What do you like about the plot then?"
"__MOVIES__ I like how all these prisoners, guys who you would normally think of as not nice people, come together and care for each other and try to help each other."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, like that scene when the black guys all decide to finally help them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and other scenes where the prisoners who are usually mean and selfish, stop and care for each other."
"__MOVIES__ It is a nice theme, that even people who normally wouldn't be nice to others, change and act in a civil caring manner to the people around them."
"__MOVIES__ I actually shed a couple tears when they show the guys gather around Caretaker's coffin and put all the things on top of it."
"__MOVIES__ That is really sad. You hear about people dying in prison, but a lot of times, you think maybe they were somehow to blame and fighting with people."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of emphasizes the fact that sometimes people die in prison and it's not their fault, that they are actually innocent victims."
"__MOVIES__ They have some great characters in this movie. I love all the WWE wrestlers in their roles."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite of course is Burt Reynolds. I've always loved Burt Reynolds. He is such a great actor. Adam Sandler seems to try so hard, kind of too hard, and Reynolds has that great acting skill of being able to deliver lines in a captivating way without seeming to try so hard to portray it."
"__MOVIES__ Burt Reynolds really is one of the great actors. He had such a long successful career."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the Smokey and The Bandit films. Burt Reynolds has such a great laugh that it makes you laugh too."
