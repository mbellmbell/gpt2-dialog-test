"__BASEBALL__ Are you watching the Toronto Blue Jays and the Seattle Mariners right now?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, low scoring game, but Marcus Stroman is pitching strong"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure is. Too bad he gave up that double to Ben Gamel in the 5th which scored a run."
"__BASEBALL__ I know! At least that only tied the game."
"__BASEBALL__ That's true, until Jarrod Dyson's singled to score Danny Valencia from 2nd base for Seattle"
"__BASEBALL__ Hey...Still more innings to be played. We can come back"
"__BASEBALL__ Woo!!! Home run from Kendrys Morales to tie it back up!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah!!! That ball got out of here in a hurry!"
"__BASEBALL__ Like you said, Still more innings to be played. Now it's a game again"
"__BASEBALL__ Looks like they are pulling Stroman, and Jason Grilli is pitching now"
"__BASEBALL__ Uh oh! Hope he doesn't let this one get away from him."
"__BASEBALL__ I know! he has been off and on all season so far."
"__BASEBALL__ And now he's given up a couple singles already."
"__BASEBALL__ But here comes Aaron Loup to hopefully get us out of this inning"
"__BASEBALL__ He has been pitching well for Toronto this season."
"__BASEBALL__ And he strikes out Seagar!"
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, they only put in Loup for one batter, now here comes Dominic Leone"
"__BASEBALL__ And Leone gets them out of the inning"
"__BASEBALL__ Let see if Toronto's Bullpen can keep this up"
"__BASEBALL__ Right! We could really use another win right now."
