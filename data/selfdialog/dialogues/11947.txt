"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, have you been following news of the Oakland raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, what's happening with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, this team has parted with 3 of their players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which ones did they let go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe it was Andy Mulumba, Anthony Kukwa, and Neiron Ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, I wonder why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about the other 2, but I do know that Ball missed last year, because of his knee injury and several surgeries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that leaves this team with 3 vacanies."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and I wonder who will get to fill them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Recently, I read about their former quarterback; Todd Marinovich."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't he have a drug problem?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but, he claims he has been sober since August of 2016."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well good for him. He got let go back in 1993, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And sobriety is always good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will never understand the athletes that give into things that destroy their careers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. It is not everyday that you make it to the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, I could only dream."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that's right, my days are over; too old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your never too old, from what I hear, Todd Marinovich is 48 and trying for a comeback, but not with the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard. It is with the SoCal Coyotes of the World Developmental Football League. Good luck to him. Go Raiders!!"
