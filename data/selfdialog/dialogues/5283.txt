"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the Dark side or the Light?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm a fan of the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish I had storm troopers following me around."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like how they jog around.  I like the sound of they make on the floor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like Finn as a stormtrooper?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was an interesting inclusion.  It's good to see more diversity in the First Order."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the rebel alliance is so much more diverse.  They even have interspecies commanders."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like the fish."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's exactly what I was thinking."
"__STAR_WARS__ Diversity for the universe!"
