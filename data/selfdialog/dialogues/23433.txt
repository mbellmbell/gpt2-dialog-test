"__DISNEY__ Are you kidding? It's my favorite movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Really?"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, I love how Merida is strong and doesn't marry anyone in the end."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, that's cool. It teaches girls that they don't have to fall in love so quickly."
"__DISNEY__ Yup and she looks pretty awesome."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, I think the animators actually studied celtic paintings and animated her based on that."
"__DISNEY__ Sweet, loving the historical element!"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, that's why I like the movie so much. I love celtic art."
"__DISNEY__ Same!"
