"__MOVIES__ So, I'm thinking of doing a pet movie marathon."
"__MOVIES__ Pet movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Like, the movies where animals have voices dubbed over."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so like Babe."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Or Homeward Bound."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Homeward Bound as a kid. So much."
"__MOVIES__ I did too. I even loved the sequel, but it was set where I grew up, so I may have a bias."
"__MOVIES__ So the Homeward Bound movies are an automatic yes then."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have any other ideas?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe Milo and Otis?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a good one!"
"__MOVIES__ It's another 'animals on an adventure' movie."
"__MOVIES__ I had a couple more ideas, but they're not quite in the same category."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what are they?"
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking Air Bud could be a good choice?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a little different. I think of it more as a sports movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's so funny though. Have you watched it recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Not in a decade or so."
"__MOVIES__ Then it's going on the list!"
"__MOVIES__ Alright, I'll look forward to it."
