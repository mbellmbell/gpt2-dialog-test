"__DISNEY__ Can you guess which Disney film this song is from."
"__DISNEY__ OK"
"__DISNEY__ Let's get down to business."
"__DISNEY__ To defeat the Huns! Ha ha, that's obviously Mulan, I've watched it literally a hundred times."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. Can't wait for the live-action remake."
"__DISNEY__ Wait they're making a live-action remake."
"__DISNEY__ Yep, it comes out next year I think."
"__DISNEY__ I hope Ming-na Wen reprises her role as Mulan, she's such a total badass."
"__DISNEY__ She's also as swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon."
"__DISNEY__ She's also got all of the strength of a raging fire and is as mysterious as the dark side of the moon."
