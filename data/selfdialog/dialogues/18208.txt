"__MOVIES__ you know which movie I just saw on FX?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ It was Interstellar"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that was the movie with Matthew McConeghey and Anne Hathaway"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, even though it came out in 2014 I never get tired of that movie"
"__MOVIES__ Really? Me too!"
"__MOVIES__ Even though I have watched it two times already I was fixed to the screen."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! the movie is so dramatic.. you never know what will happen next."
"__MOVIES__ What was the best part for you of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think when the robot contacts him back (Tark) from within the space time continuum and he is able to escape that demension then he returns to earth to meet his daughter."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was a very touching moment"
"__MOVIES__ I really thought he was going to get back to earth a lot sooner."
"__MOVIES__ I didnt expect him to return to space"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah me too. I thought he would be tired by now and just want to relax on the new earth."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the most exciting moment was when they found out that Dr. Mann was a fraud and he was trying to sabotage their mission"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I also felt like the entire mission would be just stopped right there"
"__MOVIES__ I was holding my breath because I thought Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) had destroyed the mission"
"__MOVIES__ I hope I can watch it again next weekend"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah check your cable network.. I think it might be on again"
"__MOVIES__ Ok I will buddy! Thanks!"
