"__BEATLES__ How did you like the Beatle's Anthology."
"__BEATLES__ There sure was a lot of stuff."
"__BEATLES__ Yes. I like the different takes on the songs."
"__BEATLES__ My reason for liking them is because it shows the creative process."
"__BEATLES__ Yes. We were talking a bout The Long and Winding Road earlier."
"__BEATLES__ That is the best non embellished cut."
"__BEATLES__ Some say there were too many undeserving cuts on the Anthology."
"__BEATLES__ Some people don't get it."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. They don't realize the point you made earlier"
"__BEATLES__ About the creative process, I think that is why it was put together that way."
