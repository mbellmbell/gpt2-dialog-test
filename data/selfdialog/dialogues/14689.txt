"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, how was your weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not bad.  How about yours?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Pretty good.  I saw a movie that I really enjoyed."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Which movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was called 'Split.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Is that an M. Night Shyamalan movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah.  Starring James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How was it?  I sort of lost faith in M. Night after 'The Last Airbender.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ This was really good.  I think it may be the comeback for M. Night."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's about a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three girls right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yea.  It's really unique."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'll check it out.  It can't be worse than 'Lady in the Water.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That was such a bad movie.  Don't forget 'After Earth.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That one was actually worse, and wasted Will Smith's talent."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It really was.  I can't say anything else about 'Split' without giving anything away, but there are connections with M. Night's previous films."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Now I'm really excited about it.  Who is Anya Taylor-Joy?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ She was in the movie 'Barry' and in 'Witch.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, I saw 'Witch.'  She's incredibly talented."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ She was perfect for this role.  Same with James McAvoy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I am a big James McAvoy fan.  I will see the movie this weekend."
