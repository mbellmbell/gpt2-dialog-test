"__HORROR__ What is the worst horror movie remake you have seen?"
"__HORROR__ That's a good question.  The first one that comes to mind is Nightmare on Elm Street."
"__HORROR__ The one with Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, that's the one.  It was scary, but they went too far into the back story."
"__HORROR__ Yes, I didn't like the direction they took Freddy Krueger and the parents."
"__HORROR__ That's because Wes Craven didn't have a part in the direction of this movie."
"__HORROR__ It was interesting to learn about micro-naps in the movie."
"__HORROR__ They did keep that part realistic.  That was actually a little scary thinking you could fall alseep without realizing it."
"__HORROR__ The ending was kept similar though with Nancy's mom getting pulled by Freddy."
"__HORROR__ The original was still better, even without today's digital effects."
