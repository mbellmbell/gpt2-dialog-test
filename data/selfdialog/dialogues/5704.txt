"__STAR_WARS__ Why did Finn turn on the stormtroopers in The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because of the atrocities he'd witnessed. He wanted to escape it."
"__STAR_WARS__ But didn't he grow up with them? Why was he the only one who objected?"
"__STAR_WARS__ As a fluke, his training and conditioning didn't take."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would've liked to see Finn express more remorse about it, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why? Finn isn't an evil person."
"__STAR_WARS__ But he turned on everyone he knew. He killed people he used to serve with."
"__STAR_WARS__ He did it for the greater good, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ That doesn't make it emotionally easy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Perhaps he's just stoic. He's burying how he feels because there's work to do."
