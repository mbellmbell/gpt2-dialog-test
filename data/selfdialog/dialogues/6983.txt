"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if they are going to address the whole issue that Anakin Skywalker was supposed to bring balance to the Force in The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean when Anakin Skywalker came around there were hundreds of Jedi's and two Sith.  When he became Darth Vadar all of the Jedi were massacred."
"__STAR_WARS__ There were two Jedis left, Yoda and Obi Wan, so it was balanced then, instead of there being hundreds of good guys and only two bad guys their numbers were evened out."
"__STAR_WARS__ But then with the advent of the Empire the dark side had effectively taken over the entire galaxy, so despite the numbers, the dark side had control of everything and so there was still no balance."
"__STAR_WARS__ Does that really matter? And was everyone in the entire Empire evil?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think it really matters if they are all working toward an evil purpose?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Was the entire purpose of the Empire evil?  Weren't they mostly just trying to bring order to the galaxy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The galaxy was ordered before the Empire, it was held in order by the Jedi.  It just changed hands from the Jedi to the Sith, but the Sith's ultimate end is evil, so the galaxy became ruled by evil people doing evil things, so the scales went towards evil instead of a balance."
"__STAR_WARS__ But maybe the balance is the number of people wielding the force and not the overall purpose of all the ordinary people in the galaxy."
