"__MOVIES__ So what have you been up to this evening?"
"__MOVIES__ Not much, just been setting around watching some movies."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds fun, what kind of movies have you been watching?"
"__MOVIES__ I decided to watch the Scream movies today."
"__MOVIES__ Are you talking about the Wes Craven films?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they have always been my favorite horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ They have made four of those, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I just wish they would come out with a part five!"
"__MOVIES__ Was Neve Cambell in all of those films?"
"__MOVIES__ She sure was! She is one of my favorite actresses."
"__MOVIES__ I remember her way back from The Party Of Five show."
"__MOVIES__ I do to, but I love her role as Sydney Prescott more so than any other."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't the girl from the show Friends also play in those films?"
"__MOVIES__ You are talking about Courtney Cox. Yes she was in all of them as well."
"__MOVIES__ Of the four Scream movies that they have made, which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say the original; that one is hard to beat!"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the original myself; but part three would be my pick."
"__MOVIES__ Part three is actually my second favorite in the series."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was the scariest out of all the movies."
"__MOVIES__ It was very scary, but the twist in the original can not be topped in my book!"
