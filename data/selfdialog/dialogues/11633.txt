"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think has the worst personality in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As far as players go, it's a toss up between Aqib Talib and Richard Sherman"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it something about playing defense that makes people so unpleasant?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know people gave Ndamukong Suh a hard time for being a dirty player, but at least he wasn't running his mouth off"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear bad things about Vontaze Burfict on the Bengals, too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know of any dirty offensive players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about dirty, but Odell Beckham Jr. has a pretty bad attitude and doesn't deal well with loss"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well when you play for the Giants, you ought to learn to deal with loss"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steve Smith Sr. had an attitude, I know, but he's retired now so I suppose that doesn't count"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he really showed up Talib when he played for the Panthers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That guy had it coming, playing aggressively and taking cheap shots and players"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You'd think he would have learned his lesson by now, but there he goes poking guys in the eye"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah what was that about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then he ripped Michael Crabtree's chain off his neck during a game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To be fair, there's no reason to be wearing flashy jewelry during an NFL game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not, but that doesn't give other people the right to destroy others' property"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw a guy get some of his dreadlocks ripped off during a game once"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that, and I remember the referees basically saying that players' hair is an extension of their uniform and that grabbing it isn't a penalty"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe Aqib Talib is bald because he's afraid his behavior will make people want to rip his hair out"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That, or maybe being a dirty player makes your hair all fall out"
