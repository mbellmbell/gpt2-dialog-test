"__ACTION__ Do you remember  'Last Action Hero?'"
"__ACTION__ Who could forget that movie?! It was Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role ever as far as I'm concerned."
"__ACTION__ I have to disagree with you there, I think his best role ever was 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day.'"
"__ACTION__ That was a really good one, not as good as 'Last Action Hero,' but it was really good."
"__ACTION__ I think that if they'd had more time to work on it, it would have been a lot better."
"__ACTION__ I do agree with you on that point. The studio did them dirty."
"__ACTION__ I also think that because of that is why Arnold slowed down his acting career."
"__ACTION__ That makes sense. I'd be pretty discouraged if I were him."
"__ACTION__ At least he came back for 'The Expendables.' What a fantastic movie."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I love that movie. Totally action packed!"
