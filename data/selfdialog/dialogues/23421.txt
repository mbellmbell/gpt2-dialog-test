"__DISNEY__ You know how I love those rewards programs they have for things, like gas purchases and airline tickets?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, you always tell me when you get something extra or save money."
"__DISNEY__ Well, now I have a new rewards program I'm using- Disney Movies Rewards."
"__DISNEY__ How do you get rewards for Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ If you buy eligible movies or theater tickets, you can enter it on the Disney website for points. You can use the points for special offers or rewards."
"__DISNEY__ Do you buy that many movies or theater tickets?"
"__DISNEY__ YES. I have three kids. I buy the movies all the time to keep them quiet and entertain them, and I take them to the theatre for special weekend trips with their friends."
"__DISNEY__ You're a really great parent."
"__DISNEY__ My kids love Disney movies, and the new Cars 3 came out this week, so I took them to see it, and already started racking up points."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe you can get some good offers and be able to save on future movies."
