"__BASEBALL__ How do you like the Detroit Tigers?"
"__BASEBALL__ They are pretty good.  Did you catch their game yesterday against the Angels?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah, brutal huh?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it was.  I can't believe they lost 0-7."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but their game on May 11 they beat the Angels 7-1"
"__BASEBALL__ Detroit's pitcher,  Fulmer is top notch!  He's partially why the Angels lost I think."
"__BASEBALL__ Detroit has a lot of good players, it just seems like sometimes they're hot and sometimes they're not."
"__BASEBALL__ Who is your favorite player?"
"__BASEBALL__ I like Upton.  You?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think Kinsler is pretty good."
"__BASEBALL__ How do you like Verlander?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's awesome!  Tigers are lucky to have him."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he's been with the Tigers for a long time now.  He's got to be one of their best players."
"__BASEBALL__ How do you like Wilson?  He's pretty decent."
"__BASEBALL__ He's okay.  I like Verlander better."
"__BASEBALL__ Wilson is still pretty new, but I think he shows promise."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you know who the Tigers are up against next?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they play the Angels again tonight and then again tomorrow."
"__BASEBALL__ I wonder how that will play out."
"__BASEBALL__ I know.  Seems like they're really on top of it or they get beat pretty badly."
