"__MOVIES__ What's your favourite Jim Carrey movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't narrow it down. The Mask was my favourite as a kid, even though it scared me."
"__MOVIES__ That was so good! And even as an adult there are some parts of it that creep me out."
"__MOVIES__ Liar Liar was so good too. The scene where he beat himself up was so good."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that! He really doesn't need any supporting actors to make a movie work."
"__MOVIES__ And the way he interacted with his son in that was so heartwarming. Like, I can't relate to the whole broken family thing and not having a dad you can count on, but the performances made me feel that firsthand."
"__MOVIES__ I got you. That's one of the marks of a really good actor is making you feel things you otherwise wouldn't feel."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I know it's not a good choice, but his role as The Riddler is one of my favourites."
"__MOVIES__ Why not a good choice?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I just know he didn't get much screen time and a lot of people don't like the job he did."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I feel like that's one of his forgotten roles."
"__MOVIES__ But I love it for some reason. I wanted to watch that movie again and again as a kid and I had such a crush on him in it."
"__MOVIES__ That's a weird character to have a crush on!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I don't know what it was about it."
"__MOVIES__ The thing I fall in love with is how he uses his face. It's like a whole genre of comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like in Dumb and Dumber. I especially liked his improvisation in that with 'the most annoying sound in the world'."
"__MOVIES__ And don't forget Ace Ventura!"
"__MOVIES__ He used more than his face as Ace Ventura."
"__MOVIES__ Too true. I think that's the movie he used the most of his body in for comedic value."
