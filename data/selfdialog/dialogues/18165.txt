"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Batman vs Superman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I didn't really care for it much."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it was poorly written."
"__MOVIES__ There were highlights though.  Ben Afflick proved me wrong."
"__MOVIES__ I know he was great.  How about Gal Gadot as Wonder Women?"
"__MOVIES__ She was awesome.  That movie was really good too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's been the only good one in the DC movie universe."
"__MOVIES__ I know, and Jesse Eisenburg was terrible as Lex."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I wish he would have bee a little more robust.  Like the cartoon Lex."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was one of the best."
"__MOVIES__ It was cool to have Doomsday in the movie though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Doomsday is always under represented outside of pure comics."
"__MOVIES__ A lot of people had never heard of him."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think Justice League will be good?"
"__MOVIES__ I hope so.  Maybe it can learn from the mistakes of Batman vs Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Like actually try and make sense."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't care for most of it either.  What was with those flash backs?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  Not the best written movie."
"__MOVIES__ But hey, at least we have a DC universe building."
"__MOVIES__ Let's just hope it catches up to MCU"
