"__LADY_GAGA__ What did you think of Lady Gaga's last album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I thought it was very different than her previous work."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well that's pretty vague. Was it different in a good way or a bad way?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like that she is not afraid to branch out and try something new, but I don't like her as a country artist."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. I think she has a fantastic voice though."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's a great singer, but I don't think her voice works for country music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's really good at jazz though. Her duet album with Tony Bennett was something different and it was pretty good."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What was your favorite song on that album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I really liked Cheek to Cheek. How about you?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think Lush Life was the best song. I'm not big on jazz, but that song is very moving."
