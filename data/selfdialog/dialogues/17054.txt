"__MOVIES__ You know how I love X-Men movies, I just caught, Logan, last night and loved it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that opening night, to be honest, I was a little bored by it."
"__MOVIES__ What? That's ridiculous, it was such a fantastic movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really well shot and production was terrific, but the pace was just something that really had me drifting off in attention."
"__MOVIES__ I love that slow build up and was glad it wasn't just another generic Superhero movie. The bleak atmosphere and world created was so different then what we were getting before."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe that's it, I was expecting more powers to be used, and more abilities to be shown. The story of the child was okay, it didn't engage me."
"__MOVIES__ That little girl was fantastic! Probably my favorite character in that movie, she was so good in performance being the gritty young Wolverine."
"__MOVIES__ I'll agree with that, she showed so much fire in her scenes, and the action scenes definitely gripped me and had me locked in."
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't believe they pushed it for the R-rating, we finally got the Wolverine we've always wanted to see in Logan!"
"__MOVIES__ I definitely was impressed they let him maul the bad guys the way he did, the way he just sliced and diced his way in battle. Something so sorely lacking in these other movies."
"__MOVIES__ They even had the little girl mauling everyone! I think that was like a big shocker to me, especially that one scene."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you mean THAT scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That scene where she slowly walks out of the warehouse, carrying the one tough soldiers head and just rolls it, that had me floored!"
"__MOVIES__ I cringed a little bit when that happened, but it was a pretty cool scene."
"__MOVIES__ We haven't even mentioned Professor X!"
"__MOVIES__ You're right, he was so good in this movie, with his aging self. It was fun to see him play a more out of sort Professor X than the mild mannered, always tempered, Charles we've seen prior."
"__MOVIES__ He definitely killed it in his performance, he gave the character heart and there was humor too in those scenes when he refused to take the pills. I laughed."
"__MOVIES__ It was sad and shocking to see how things ended for him, actually thinking more about it, after talking to you about this flick, I think I might have to watch it again down the road."
"__MOVIES__ I think you should! It is certainly my current favorite movie, Logan, did not disappoint!"
"__MOVIES__ All right, I will! Maybe I'll be more awake this time to fully appreciate the whole movie."
