"__HARRY_POTTER__ I watched The Half Blood Prince again yesterday."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, I love that movie, it's the best one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's really good, but with Voldemort's rise, and Draco Malfoy's dark experiences, it gets darker."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I feel as though seeing Draco Malfoy sad and desperate, like after Harry attacks him in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, makes him more relatable, not darker."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He still ends up following the Dark Lord though. He's just too scared to kill Snape in the end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He regrets it though. He's so sad and stressed out after taking the Dark Mark. You just don't know it until the end of the movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's still a choice though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He and his parents were sort of forced into it with Voldemort's threats. And Lucius wasn't the greatest parent, letting him have whatever he wanted, even all those brooms."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't remember Voldemort specifically killing them, though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He would though. Remember how his followers shamelessly murdered the Muggles on that bridge in the beginning of the movie?"
