"__MUSIC__ Are you excited to see Tristan und Isolde next week?"
"__MUSIC__ We're really going to that?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you said you love opera."
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't. I hate opera."
"__MUSIC__ Why would you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ I was either being ironic or trying to impress a girl who likes it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh...I thought this was a date for us."
"__MUSIC__ Sorry."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you like opera?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not that I don't like opera, it's that Tristan und Isolde drives me crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, this is in Wagner's particular style of endless melody."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that bad? It's creative!"
"__MUSIC__ Nothing repeats, ever. If you try to hum a tune when you get out, you'll only remember the last thing you heard."
"__MUSIC__ But, doesn't it prove he's a great artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. But the style is a mental and emotional drain."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder how the performers memorize it."
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea! I've always wondered how they can rehearse it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'll keep a positive outlook."
"__MUSIC__ Good luck! Sorry about the date."
