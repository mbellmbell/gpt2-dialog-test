"__MUSIC__ Hey, did you hear that new song by Rihanna?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the one called, 'Wild Thoughts'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that one!"
"__MUSIC__ I love that track. I love how they sampled Santana's old beat."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! Wasn't that originally in that song, 'Maria, Maria'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I think it came out around the early 2000's."
"__MUSIC__ I totally remember jamming out to that song as a kid. I loved the music video."
"__MUSIC__ So did I! What do you think of Rihanna's newest tracks anyways?"
"__MUSIC__ I do like them a lot, but sometimes I miss her old stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she has a lot of spunk now which is so cool, but sometimes the songs can get repetitive."
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree. Speaking of female vocalists, Remy Ma is on a roll isn't she?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, since she got released she has been just letting out track after track. Did you hear the Nicki Minaj dis?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I did. I think I like, 'No Frauds' better though, to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. That was an awesome single. I usually don't like Drake, but on that he was good."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I thought the same thing! I'm not a fan of him, but he was good on that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and so was Lil Wayne."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he was! I was surprised they featured him on it."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I didn't think he would want to get involved."
"__MUSIC__ It made for a good song, though."
"__MUSIC__ It sure did!"
