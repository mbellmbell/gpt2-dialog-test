"__MUSIC__ Do you like Go Radio?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I have heard any of their music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, have you ever heard of Mayday Parade?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I have heard a few of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Jason Lancaster was in Mayday Parade. He left and was in a band called Go Radio."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, that happens all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. He was my favorite member of the band so I was really happy when he started another one."
"__MUSIC__ That's great! I am glad he didn't just fall of the face of the earth."
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately, Go Radio has already broken up."
"__MUSIC__ Wow really? That sucks."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I liked them a lot too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry. Is he doing anything else?"
"__MUSIC__ He started a solo career, but it isn't great."
"__MUSIC__ Well maybe it will get better with time. Sounds like maybe he is hard to work with."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. He went solo after disputes with two different bands!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe their personalities just didn't work well together."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. I just want him to make good music again."
"__MUSIC__ I will give some of his stuff a listen."
"__MUSIC__ I can recommend some songs."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds great! Just send them to me."
