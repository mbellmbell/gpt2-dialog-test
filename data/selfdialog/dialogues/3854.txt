"__MUSIC__ You study music right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and I teach it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to it on the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean on NPR or the classical stations?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup!"
"__MUSIC__ No. I avoid it wherever I can."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, if I'm driving, classical will put me to sleep unless it's the right piece."
"__MUSIC__ Ahh, Mozart will cause crashes."
"__MUSIC__ I can't stand those stations"
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It's nearly impossible to listen to someone NOT be a snob."
"__MUSIC__ They're kind of elitist, aren't they?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup! They play a super-obscure piece that even I don't know and then say 'of course, that was Mozart's K.655'"
"__MUSIC__ Ha, they use the Kershel number when calling it on the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup! As if it's common knowledge."
"__MUSIC__ We all know the K-system but that's crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Plus, classical stations don't really reach well up here due to their low frequencies."
"__MUSIC__ Gotcha."
"__MUSIC__ Good in concept but really hard to keep going."
