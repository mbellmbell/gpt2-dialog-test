"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they can speed the game up anymore?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh they definitely can soon."
"__BASEBALL__ I would like to see batters take pitches quicker."
"__BASEBALL__ That is the easiest route to take."
"__BASEBALL__ I would say once they get the ball back they have 10 seconds to throw it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I would be OK with that."
"__BASEBALL__ And get rid of all the relief pitching changes."
"__BASEBALL__ I think thats a fine line they have to toe."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean by that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well who is to tell a manager who he can put it."
"__BASEBALL__ The problem is that takes 6 minutes sometimes to do."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah just eliminate the warm up pitches on the mound."
"__BASEBALL__ Then theres advertising dollars that are lost"
"__BASEBALL__ I dont think so because what if theres no changes."
"__BASEBALL__ True. Any more suggestions?"
"__BASEBALL__ I would start there and go forward"
"__BASEBALL__ I think you are on to something."
"__BASEBALL__ They may be able to reduce some times in other places but I am not sure what that would entail."
"__BASEBALL__ Trimming the roster?"
"__BASEBALL__ That could be the way to stop with all the relievers."
