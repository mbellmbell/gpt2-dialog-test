"__HARRY_POTTER__ I saw all the Harry Potter movies, but I haven't read the book."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? You definitely need to read the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know, sometimes I'm disappointed with books versus movies. I might just stick with the movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The books are so good, you have to read them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The books won't ruin the movies for me, and the movies won't ruin the books?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, not at all. I mean you will know most of what happens, but you will still like it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But don't I know it all, already? Reading the books after the movies seems like overkill."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The books have a lot of scenes that are not in the movies. And you will find out a lot more about some of the characters."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, maybe I will read the books, then."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You totally should. the movies are still great, though."
