"__MUSIC__ You know who's music I really like?"
"__MUSIC__ Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Neil Diamond. I know it's not cool to admit, but I just love his songs."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he's a little old and grimy but Cinnamon Girl is pretty good!"
"__MUSIC__ Cinnamon Girl? You're thinking of Neil Young, I said Neil Diamond."
"__MUSIC__ What's the difference?"
"__MUSIC__ Only everything! Neil Young plays classic rock and Neil Diamond plays classic pop."
"__MUSIC__ Are you sure? I mean, Horse With No Name was good too, I liked that song."
"__MUSIC__ No, that's still Neil Young. Neil Diamond sang Sweet Caroline."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard that song."
"__MUSIC__ How could you never have heard Sweet Caroline? What about America or Cherry,Cherry?"
"__MUSIC__ What about Heart of Gold?"
"__MUSIC__ That's still Neil Young! Sweet Caroline, bum ba dum, good times never seemed so good."
"__MUSIC__ You aren't making any sense."
"__MUSIC__ Neil Diamond is a musical icon. He might not be as popular today, but I can't believe you don't know who he is."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't he a part of Crosby, Stills, & Nash?"
"__MUSIC__ No! That was Neil Young too, Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young."
"__MUSIC__ I think you're confused."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not, but it's ok. Who do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like that guy in the sparkly shirts who sings Cracklin' Rosie."
