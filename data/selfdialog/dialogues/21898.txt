"__DISNEY__ I've never gotten around to seeing Zootopia. You've seen it before, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yes. That is one of my favorite movies."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I better go see it soon."
"__DISNEY__ You definitely should, especially because I heard a sequel is in the works."
"__DISNEY__ Really? It seems like the first one just came out."
"__DISNEY__ I know, but it really was a great movie. The voice acting by Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin was great."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that they were in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah. They play the main characters Nick and Judy."
"__DISNEY__ Cool. Is there anyone else I should listen for when I get around to watching it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, you probably weren't expecting this, but Shakira's in the movie too."
