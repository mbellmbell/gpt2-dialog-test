"__MUSIC__ What song are you completely embarrassed to love?"
"__MUSIC__ My god, I have so many. You first."
"__MUSIC__ No, you first."
"__MUSIC__ Fine. 'Livin' la Vida Loca' by Ricky Martin."
"__MUSIC__ HAHAHAHAHAHAHA."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, yeah, you said guilty pleasure, so you can't laugh at it."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, it's ironic that it's a gay man talking about a crazy woman he's in love with, but the music is great and upbeat and fun to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I can't stand his valley girl accent of sorts. I hate how his cadence."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I can understand that. So, yours?"
"__MUSIC__ Ready for it? It's bad."
"__MUSIC__ I'm totally excited."
"__MUSIC__ 'Spice up your life' by the Spice Girls."
"__MUSIC__ See? I'm not laughing, it's respectful."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks!"
"__MUSIC__ Hilarious, though. That song is awful"
"__MUSIC__ You lied!"
"__MUSIC__ Come on, The Spice Girls are super generic and nothing happens in their music."
"__MUSIC__ It's fun to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ It is, but the lyrics are a bit distracting. They don't match the harmonies."
