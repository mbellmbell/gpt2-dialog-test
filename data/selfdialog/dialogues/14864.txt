"__ACTION__ Are you excited about the latest Transformers movie, The Last Knight?"
"__ACTION__ Not really, Michael Bay really lost me after the second one, Revenge of the Fallen."
"__ACTION__ Revenge of the Fallen was so bad. The action sequences were good in it and I didn't mind Shia Labeouf's constant screaming or Megan Fox's sex appeal but the heavy inclusion of his parents was too much."
"__ACTION__ I agree, the stuff with his parents and the brownies, as well as all the unnecessary scenes with the dogs were off putting. The story line itself was a mess."
"__ACTION__ I can see why you gave up on the Transformers franchise. Michael Bay is going to give you action but nobody has ever said he knew how to work together a good concept to present through all those explosions and crashes."
"__ACTION__ That's exactly the problem with the Transformers films. I want to watch the films for Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron, not for the parents or Shia's love life problems."
"__ACTION__ I can't argue about that although I think the 3rd Transformers film, Dark of the Moon was pretty decent. Definitely a good bounce back from Revenge of the Fallen."
"__ACTION__ I haven't watched it but it has Rosie Huntington and Patrick Duffy right?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah Rosie replaced Megan Fox as Sam, or Shia's love interest. John Malkovich is also in the movie, but he plays more of a comic relief role."
"__ACTION__ I love John Malkovich especially in Being John Malkovich, and I think he's such a respectable actor that I almost watched Dark of the Moon for him but I wasn't sold because Michael Bay was directing."
