"__COMEDY__ I like the ones with Drew Barrymore in them."
"__COMEDY__ Me to. They're great together."
"__COMEDY__ As for Adam the worst movie he ever did is 'The Water Boy.'"
"__COMEDY__ I agree. That character is annoying."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, even the voice is. I don't like that stupid voice he does."
"__COMEDY__ What about the one in Little Nicky?"
"__COMEDY__ Also annoying. He's better without voices."
"__COMEDY__ I kind of agree. He overdoes it."
"__COMEDY__ Not as much as some actors but he does at times."
