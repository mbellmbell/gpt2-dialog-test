"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ CB's in the league took a bit of a hit last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean exactly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just seems like some depth at the position is missing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there's a lot of good CB's playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not saying they're not good players, but not really a top ten player right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean like a Deion of old?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, there will never be another Deion.  I would take a Revis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So any shutdown corner really."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  Patrick Peterson was probably the best last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's always been really good for the Cards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good, but not great.  You wouldn't vote him into the hall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't that one guy play well too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One guy?  Wow, that's helpful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy that plays for the Chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, Marcus Peters.  Yeah, he's coming up quick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a great draft pick by Andy Reid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I should probably include Sherman too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overrated in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but he's a great player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He"
