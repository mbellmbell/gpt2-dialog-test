"__DISNEY__ Do you remember A Goofy Movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I still watch it sometimes."
"__DISNEY__ I felt bad for Goofy in it, but sometimes he embarrassed Max a lot."
"__DISNEY__ I know. He didn't mean any harm, though."
"__DISNEY__ Powerline made some really good music."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely! That song 'I2I' is still good."
"__DISNEY__ Max's performance as Powerline was probably worth getting in trouble for."
"__DISNEY__ Remember when his friend made the leaning tower of 'cheeze-a?' It always looked so good."
"__DISNEY__ Animated canned spray cheese, a true delicacy."
"__DISNEY__ It's better than getting chased by Bigfoot like they do in the movie!"
