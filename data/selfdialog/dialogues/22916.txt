"__DISNEY__ Have you seen many Disney movies recently?"
"__DISNEY__ I watched Moana a short time ago. That one was all right."
"__DISNEY__ I haven't seen one of their animated efforts since Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ That one was great."
"__DISNEY__ I really liked it too. It was a bit different from the normal formula and just well done all round."
"__DISNEY__ Some of the ones that came before it were mixed bags, like Tangled and Brave."
"__DISNEY__ I liked Tangled, but Brave was just not very good."
"__DISNEY__ That one was just weird. It started being about one thing, and ended up somewhere completely different."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it was a little disjointed. Did you hear there's a Frozen 2 on the way?"
"__DISNEY__ I hope it's not horrible like most Disney sequels."
