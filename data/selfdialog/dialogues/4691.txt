"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any of Katy Perry's new music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not yet. Is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Did you like her older stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of it. I thought 'Firework' was great."
"__MUSIC__ That song is good. If you like that you would probably like her new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ As long as it's not like her earlier releases I'll be good."
"__MUSIC__ Are you talking about 'I Kissed a Girl'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that song is probably the most annoying song ever."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, It seemed like the radio played it every five minutes."
"__MUSIC__ That's probably the main reason I find it so annoying now."
"__MUSIC__ Every really popular song gets played too much, though."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. Is she releasing a new album or are the songs just singles?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a new album. It's called 'Witness'."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I'll definitely check it out."
"__MUSIC__ There's a song called 'Swish, Swish' on it with Nicki Minaj. It's pretty catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nicki Minaj fan."
"__MUSIC__ I think she's a good rapper. I don't like when she tries to sing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I agree. It's a bit too synthetic."
"__MUSIC__ There's definitely some studio magic going on with her singing voice."
"__MUSIC__ I don't blame her though. As long as she's making the music she likes it's no harm done to me."
