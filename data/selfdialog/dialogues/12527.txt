"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope the NFL doesnt make anymore rule changes or new ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either, it's gotten silly lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If it gets any worse it will be like Flag Football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought it was silly that players cant do a shimmy after a touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or slam the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's getting crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Between that and the concussions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the no helmets clicking rule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You cant always control that, it's silly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Serious, any play can have helmet contact."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's too bad we can petition the comittee for rule changes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the rules now are 'for the better'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are doing the same with Boxing,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Next you will have to wear a helmet for golfing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or safety gear for Bowling."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I fear it will only get worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess time will tell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do like your idea about petitioning the NFL Comittee."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how we go about doing that."
