"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Woo to the hoo, training camp and preseasons games start up next month!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they do, I've been looking forward to this all year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, football football football, best time of the year if you ask me"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd have to agree with you, if I even thought there was a good time of the year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh buddy, why so glum?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I was a Colts fan but mostly because I was such a big supporter of what Peyton Manning did for that team year after year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a great athlete, still is, I could see why you were bummed when he got traded"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ well of course you can see why, I'm wearing a t-shirt depicting Andrew Luck's head on a stake"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You sure are, pretty graphic"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Welp, that's how most of the real fans wanted to do in Indy felt when Manning was released"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding, I was there, we couldn't quite corner Luck being an angry mob of mostly non-athletes and Luck being one of the more athelitc young QBs in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he sure has proved his naysayers wrong"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ has he? We all said he sure was no Peyton manning, and I think so far that's proven 100% accurate, they are clearly different people, induspitably so"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Spot on you were with that call. What about Russel Wilson, how much time you think he's got left in Seattle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Welp if he goes, I go... out to the optomitrest, for a test, because I wouldn't believe my eyes to see anybody but Wilson suiting up at QB for the Seahawks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not in this lifetime, am I right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, actually, we'll both probably outlive Russel Wilson's tenure as a QB in Seattle or in the leagure period"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Welp, that's what some people probably said about Favre, and some of those people probably passed on before he retired, he was pretty old and some folks die unexpectedly young"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, especially folks that eat cheese a lot and live near cows and like Green Bay"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's so cold they probably get a lot of colds and there's not much Vitamin C in cheese"
