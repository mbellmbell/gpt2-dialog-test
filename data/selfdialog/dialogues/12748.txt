"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be the NFL's rookie of the year for 2017-2018?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's a tough one. I think there are a few contenders, but that Christian McCaffrey will be the rookie of the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he and Fournette will be some of the most dynamic playmaking rookies of the year, but I wonder who will be more successful?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ McCaffrey is going to a team with a good quarterback who needs to be flanked by a running game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Panthers really missed having a good running game last season and it showed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ron relied too much on Cam Newton to make plays and after he got hurt, he wasn't the same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam's body is too big to move the way they want him to, so having a running game will take the pressure off of his legs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's likely that McCaffrey will bring a lot to the team, I just hope the offensive line is healthy and can block."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ McCaffrey didn't have the best offensive line when he was in school, but he is fast and smart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could tell that at the combine and from draft analysis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read one scouting report about how he has some of the best footwork in the nfl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to make a statement like that before he has even taken a snap, but I am excited to see how he compares to some of the better vets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough to believe that he will have a year like Zeke Elliot had last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course Zeke had a good year, the Cowboys have the best offensive line in the nfl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but rushing as much as he did, it was also his skills that made him have all of those 100 yards plus games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He didn't quite get the 2000 yards that he was hoping to, but I think that's because the defenses he faced figured out the Cowboy's game plan and adjusted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he didn't really add anything new to his playbook during the season, but I think his blocking got better as it progressed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not sure that blocking really plays a factor in nfl rookie of the year consideration, but maybe that's the edge McCaffrey will need."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he can really stand out as a pass catcher, not just as someone running between the tackles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Cam is going to need all the offensive weapons he can so that he can stay a lot healthier this upcoming season."
