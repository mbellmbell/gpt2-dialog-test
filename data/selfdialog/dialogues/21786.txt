"__DISNEY__ I just found out they're making a sequel!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh that's gonna be dope. I love that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too. I feel like it was really underrated."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder what the plot is going to be?"
"__DISNEY__ From what I understand, they start exploring the internet."
"__DISNEY__ The whole video game world is full potential. There are a ton of fun ideas to play with in that mythology."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, Wreck It Ralph was actually one of the few animated films that I felt really lent itself to the possibility of sequels."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if eventually he'll evolve like Donkey Kong did?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Think of how Donkey Kong was essentially the villain in the begining, but eventually everything changed and he got his own set of games."
