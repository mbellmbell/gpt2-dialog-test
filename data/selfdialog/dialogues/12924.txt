"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I wasn't much of a NFL football league fan until I got in the office pool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're kidding! Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just never had much interest in watching a bunch of guys chasing a piece of rubber people call a football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean pigskin don't you? (laughs)"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever! I spent my Sundays making money by betting on the NFL teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you didn't know or cared to know anything about the NFL, how did you know who or what team to bet on?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had to learn the colors of the NFL uniforms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You didn't know the NFL team colors but you bet  on them anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! I had a system and the system used colors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What color is the New Orleans Saints team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Black and Gold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chicago Bears?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Blue and Orange."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Green Bay Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Green and Gold but everyone knows that don't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess but remember you didn't until you got in your office pool right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right? I didn't know none of the NFL's players or coaches either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how could colors help you pick NFL's team winners."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always bet on the team who's colors were primary colors. I never bet on secondary colored uniforms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're kidding right? None of this true right? Well I'll be a monkey's uncle! Get outta here!"
