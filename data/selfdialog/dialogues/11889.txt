"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, you into football at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I watch it some."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you watch pro or college most times?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a NFL fan. Don't watch much college. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm an NFL fan too.  Can't wait for the season to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either.  Who's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a cowboy fan from way back in the day.  What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bronco's.  Been one since Elway started for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you were there for their back to back wins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Best times of my life.  I still get chills watching him dive for the TD in his last superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he definetly went out on top.  But he really had Tarell Davis to thank for their being there both those years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's for sure and probably would have been a third year if he didn't get hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's something Denver has always had, a strong running game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Always seems they can churn quality backs out of there no matter when they were drafted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or if they were drafted.  Of course can't talk about Dallas and Denver and not mention the Cowboy win in '78"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, can't win them all I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the start of four superbowl losses for your team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they came back with a couple wins.  Your team lost some superbowls too you know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, true.  I'd just like to see Dallas in another superbowl again.  It's been a long dry spell now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not so much for the Bronco's I guess."
