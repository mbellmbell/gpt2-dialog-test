"__BEATLES__ Do you like The Beatles' music?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah, I love the Beatles. What's your favorite album?"
"__BEATLES__ I can't really decide, but I really like Let It Be. It has so many good songs that people ignore."
"__BEATLES__ Like which songs? The title track is pretty popular, I know"
"__BEATLES__ I Me Mine is one of George's better songs, and it's on Let It Be"
"__BEATLES__ I like that one. Get Back is another one of those classic songs that you don't hear enough of nowadays"
"__BEATLES__ Don't Let Me Down is a great song, but they didn't include it on the album originally"
"__BEATLES__ Why's that? I really like that song, too"
"__BEATLES__ I think it had something to do with their producer, Phil Specter"
"__BEATLES__ I heard about that. I'm just glad the other songs got released so we could enjoy them as they were originally arranged."
