"__MUSIC__ What are your thoughts on Fiona Apple?"
"__MUSIC__ I love her!  I think she's a really talented singer and pianist."
"__MUSIC__ I don't even know if she makes music anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it's really sad when musicians from when you were a teen/twenties stop making music."
"__MUSIC__ It's like 'You helped me through life!  Don't stop now!', you know?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, artists should know that we all need soundtracks to our lives so keep making music!"
"__MUSIC__ Fiona's first album was sooo good!"
"__MUSIC__ I remember when she came out and everyone thought she was so weird."
"__MUSIC__ Granted, she was a little different.  But she wasn't Bjork weird."
"__MUSIC__ Bjork!  I totally remember her and her swan dress at that awards show."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes I think artists are just too over the top.  I don't get the message she was trying to send."
"__MUSIC__ I don't either.  It was very strange."
"__MUSIC__ I think she won worst dressed that year."
"__MUSIC__ And rightfully so!  There's Lady Gaga strange and then there's Bjork strange!"
"__MUSIC__ Bjork did have some good songs, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you can't go wrong with Army of Me."
"__MUSIC__ Such a good song!"
"__MUSIC__ I had forgotten all about it until I saw it in someone's Spotify playlist."
"__MUSIC__ I love rediscovering old songs that way."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the older playlists from like when we were teens are really great."
