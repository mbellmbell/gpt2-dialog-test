"__BASKETBALL__ It looks like it's going to be Boston and Cleveland in the Eastern Conference Finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably but Washington isn't dead yet. They can still force a game 7."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but if they do game 7 will be in Boston."
"__BASKETBALL__ It doesn't matter. Cleveland is still going to the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Cleveland is going to have a lot of rest waiting around for the Celtics to finish their series."
"__BASKETBALL__ So will Golden State waiting around for the Spurs or Rockets."

"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, adding him to the Warriors is just too much."
"__BASKETBALL__ Last year was an upset, but not this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Unless Mike Brown screws things up."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's crazy that he used to coach the Cavaliers but now can beat them in the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, especially since he came up short when he was with the Cavs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Something tells me that LeBron is going to have to work really hard to win this one."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's going to have to put the team on his back again."
"__BASKETBALL__ He'll try but I think he's going to wear out this time."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's going to have to slow down at some point."
"__BASKETBALL__ We'll I'm not a big fan of either team so I just want it to be interesting."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too!"
