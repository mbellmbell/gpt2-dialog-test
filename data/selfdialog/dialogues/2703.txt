"__MUSIC__ You know now that I'm in my 60's I just can't seem to keep up with all the new music and artists that are out there."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean.  I feel the same way."
"__MUSIC__ I find that I don't listen to any of the new stuff because I don't like it much.  There are a few songs that I like."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there was this song that a radio station played and I never heard who sung it.  I was so frustrated."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever find it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I did.  I thought it sort of sounded like Justin Timberlake.  I searched on the internet and found it.  I play it a lot.  I like it."
"__MUSIC__ What is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called, 'I can't stop the feeling' by Justin Timberlake."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah I love that song !!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, it is really catchy and makes you want to get up and dance."
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen the video yet?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!!  I think the video is neat.  All the people dancing, even people that are my age are in the video.  Which I think is neat."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they did a good job of putting all the different people in the video and then at the end they all come together and dance."
"__MUSIC__ Even in my 'older' age I can still get into that type of music.  I guess that's not all bad."
"__MUSIC__ I think it shows that you are still young at heart.  Music helps lift the mood and makes you feel better.  Don't you think so?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I do.  I especially like to listen to praise and gospel music.  Now that will really lift me when I'm down and blue about life and circumstances that seem overwhelming."
"__MUSIC__ Any certain artist you like in that genre?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there are many, but I really find that the Hosanna Integrity music which has different artists really sooths me when I need it."
"__MUSIC__ That's great I will have to check into that too."
