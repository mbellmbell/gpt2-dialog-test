"__MOVIES__ I finally got to see Batman versus Superman."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ For starters, why does Batman use a gun in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought he was against guns in the comic and other movies."
"__MOVIES__ He is, or was."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ They were so many things going on, I don't know."
"__MOVIES__ What about Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ She was pretty dope."
"__MOVIES__ I hear she's getting a solo movie next."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I bet it'll be better than Batman versus Superman."
"__MOVIES__ How much did they fight in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Not much."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean not much?"
"__MOVIES__ There was more talk in that movie than anything else."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm glad I didn't go see that one."
