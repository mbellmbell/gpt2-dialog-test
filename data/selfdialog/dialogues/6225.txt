"__STAR_WARS__ Man, Rogue One is such a messy Star Wars film."
"__STAR_WARS__ In a good way though, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know. It just feels disjointed."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's disjointed about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ For example, they spend most of the first act looking for Saw Gerrera, and then he tells Jyn her dad is alive, and dies."
"__STAR_WARS__ So? He provided useful information?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Information which the characters already knew. He doesn't do much at all, besides eat up time."
"__STAR_WARS__ But he also tortures the Imperial pilot guy. So there's that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and the pilot gets better immediately. Nothing seems to much matter until they decide to go to Scarif to steal the Death Star plans near the end of the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose the movie may have benefited from a little extra time in the writer's room, maybe."
