"__MUSIC__ Hey, are you tired already of the 'Despacito' song?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I can't believe how much they are playing the song everywhere, but I kind of like it."
"__MUSIC__ I also liked it at first but I'm am starting to get fed up with it."
"__MUSIC__ I know it has been kind of extreme how you hear it everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ And the worst part is that I hear it and I get it stuck in my head for hours and hours..."
"__MUSIC__ It happens to me too. The melody is extremely catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know Luis Fonsi before the song was popular?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I have some Venezuelan cousins who hear a lot of music from him so I did know him from before."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, ok. I had never heard from him. But he is a good singer."
"__MUSIC__ He is a very good singer in fact in my opinion. You should listen to some of his old stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm not a fan of music in Spanish, but I could try it."
"__MUSIC__ Go ahead and listen to these 2: 'Imaginame SIn Ti' and 'Yo No Me Doy Por Vencido'"
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Are they also kind of dance latino music?"
"__MUSIC__ No. These two are more pop, like romantic songs."
"__MUSIC__ Okay then. Talking about 'Despacito' again, it's incredible how Justin Bieber makes everything popular these days right?"
"__MUSIC__ The kid has a gift for being in the right songs lately."
"__MUSIC__ What is your opinion on him?"
"__MUSIC__ I like him. I think he is very talented."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think he is an interesting character, but he is surrounded by too much drama."
"__MUSIC__ He is just groing up while everyone is watching. Of course there are going to be some objectionable things about a teenager."
