"__STAR_WARS__ How do you feel about the Star Wars prequel trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ When they were new I didn't care for them very much but over time I've come to appreciate them a bit more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which of the Star Wars prequels is your favorite movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably Revenge of the Sith. That's a pretty common opinion but I agree, it was the best out of the three."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which prequel was your least favorite. Let me guess, Attack of the Clones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right. I don't dislike everything about that movie but of the three, it probably has the worst dialogue and characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ But in Attack of the Clones, it was cool seeing a young Boba Fett right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I actually didn't like that part. What was good about Boba Fett was that he was this mysterious character and showing him as a kid takes away from that mystique."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was the worst thing about the prequels generally?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's a tossup between the overuse of CGI and the wooden dialogue. There's so much CGI in the prequels that they are almost cartoons."
