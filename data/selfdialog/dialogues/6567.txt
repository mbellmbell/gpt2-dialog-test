"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I haven't seen it."
"__STAR_WARS__ What! Why not you love star wars!!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I LOVED Star Wars. The original first three. The 'prequals' sucked."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, I liked The Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of the three prequals The Phantom Menace was the best. The 2nd one was boring and the last one felt rushed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rushed how?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I felt like they were in a hurry to wrap up the whole Darth Vader is Luke and Leia's father and then goes to the dark side. Poor story, poor development."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that makes sense, i hadn't thought of it that way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sorry to ruin it for you."
