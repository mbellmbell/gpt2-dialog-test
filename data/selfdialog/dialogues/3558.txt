"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Katy Perry's new song?"
"__MUSIC__ She came out with a new album?? What's the song?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called 'Swish, Swish.'  Sounds familiar?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, does that have a reference with Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ It sure does, it has some pretty interesting lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I am so stoked about it! What did she say about Taylor?"
"__MUSIC__ 'A tiger don't lose no sleep, don't need opinions from a shellfish or a sheep' is one of the lines from the song."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa, that's pretty intense! Compared to Taylor's 'Bad Blood' this is definitely bolder."
"__MUSIC__ I would have to agree, this feud they have is getting some crazy attention."
"__MUSIC__ They have been in the news a lot lately."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of Taylor, she is back on Spotify!"
"__MUSIC__ What?? Since when? She did not like Spotify at all!"
"__MUSIC__ Right! I guess she had a change of heart."
"__MUSIC__ I am so going to add her on my new playlist."
"__MUSIC__ I just thought it was a really interesting move."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she is a businesswoman after all and when you're not getting enough monetary credit I would pull back too."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you are right, but do you think it may have something relatable to a publicity stunt?"
"__MUSIC__ Just like the Perry/Swift feud? You might be on to something."
"__MUSIC__ Regardless, I love the new song 'Swish Swish.'"
"__MUSIC__ Haha 'Blank Space' by Taylor Swift is still my number one."
