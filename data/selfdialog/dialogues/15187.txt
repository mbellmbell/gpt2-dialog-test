"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think of the first Deathly Hallows?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was pretty good.  It's amazing to see how quickly the wizarding world fell."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Proof to how powerful Voldemort really is."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, baldy is pretty powerful.  And clearly has agents everywhere."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The cliffhanger at the end was insane too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ When Voldemort gets the Elder Wand?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes!  How are they going to battle that powerful wizard with that powerful object?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The parts about the Deathly Hallows was cool too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, seeing the history of these objects."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'd even someday like to see more on their history and former owners."
