"__HARRY_POTTER__ The Harry Potter books are some of my favorites, though I really like the movies as well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You didn't think they deviated too much from the source material?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, not at all!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, they did change a few things."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but that's going to happen with any screen adaptation. I think they stayed very true to the story's overall theme."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You mean love triumphing over hate and all that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, that was really the most important part, you know?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can see that. I just wish a few of the scenes hadn't been cut out."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True, but you never know. They might be released on extended editions someday."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I hope so!"
