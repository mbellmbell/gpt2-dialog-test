"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the recent trend of Disney doing live-action remakes of their animated classics?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think so. Aren't they coming out with a new Beauty and the Beast remake?"
"__DISNEY__ Yup, it's going to star Emily Watson!"
"__DISNEY__ Um, you're thinking of Emma Watson. The girl who played Hermione in the Harry Potter movies."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yea, that's right. So, do you think it's going to be any good?"
"__DISNEY__ Disney tends to have a decent track record with these things. Even if it's not better than the original, it probably won't be horrible."
"__DISNEY__ Indeed, I heard they are keeping it pretty faithful to the original, even the promotional materials show Watson's Belle in that classic yellow dress."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't know, I never actually watched the original."
"__DISNEY__ You're kidding me right?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I was like only two years old when the original came out and my parents never bought me the tapes or DVDs when I was a kid."
