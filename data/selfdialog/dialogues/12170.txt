"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Less than one month from opening kick-off. You pumped?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, I'm totally pumped. What do we have? Chiefs Patriots? That's going to be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Sounds weird, but I feel like football season helps signal the arrival of fall. Changing seasons. All that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. True. Even though it can still be hot as all get out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ New England early September. That should be nice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easy living. Who do you think'll win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Win? Man. Definitely the Patriots. I'm more interested in the spread and the over-under."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You wager?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Funny thing is, no, not really. But I do like to know the lines. Seems like the over-under regularly comes down to the final few plays of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right? Bookies are smart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very smart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of gambling, you think Oakland will be okay in Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Raiders' move? Oh yeah. No problems. You can bet anywhere. Any time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm with you on that. It'll be cool to see Mayweather's tickets, though. 500k here. Another 200 there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right? No. The Raiders will be good. What a great location to see a game. Afterwards, you hit the strip. Shows. Food. That is all good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll definitely be the hot ticket in the NFL for a minute."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. The England play seems pretty cool, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. I just wish they didn't send scrubs most of the time. I almost feel guilty to the British people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hysterical. But yeah. There's that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, pretty cool. Though the games start way too early."
