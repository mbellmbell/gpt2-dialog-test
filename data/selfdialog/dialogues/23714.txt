"__DISNEY__ I just saw the new Beauty and the Beast movie and it was amazing!"
"__DISNEY__ I have been wanting to see that!"
"__DISNEY__ I suggest you go! I went with my cousins and am so glad I saw it!"
"__DISNEY__ Was it like the original?"
"__DISNEY__ Very similar, but different in some ways."
"__DISNEY__ Like what? Would a fan of the original still like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so! There was more character development for Belle, and her father."
"__DISNEY__ That's interesting!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! Belle was the inventor in this one, but it was a good addition to the plot!"
"__DISNEY__ I'll definitely go see it!"
