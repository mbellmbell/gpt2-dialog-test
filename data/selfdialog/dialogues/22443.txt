"__DISNEY__ Who are your favorite characters in the movie Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ One of my favorites is Sven."
"__DISNEY__ Why is the reindeer one of your favorites?"
"__DISNEY__ Because he's funny, he has funny facial expressions and is sassy."
"__DISNEY__ So do you have any other favorites?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I also like Kristoff. He's like a real Prince Charming, without being a prince."
"__DISNEY__ So he saves the girl?"
"__DISNEY__ Not really. He realizes he cares for Anna, but thinks she loves another man."
"__DISNEY__ So who saves Anna?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, Anna sees Hans try to kill Elsa, so she jumps in front of him before he can kill her and her heart freezes and she turns to ice, and that act of true love is what saves her. Then she unfreezes."
