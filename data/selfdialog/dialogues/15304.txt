"__HARRY_POTTER__ So I'm watching Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix and I think this is the saddest one out of all the movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course it is! I'm still not over Sirius Black getting killed."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know! Bellatrix LeStrange is one of the best villains of our generation."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She really is, and Helena Bonham Carter is really excellent at being scary and creepy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wish they had let Tim Burton direct one of the movies! I think he would have brought them to an entirely new level."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, he really has an eye for the fantastic. He would have been perfect to direct Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Absolutely! I feel like the merpeople and the blast ended skrewts would have been amazing under him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Now I'm thinking about how poor Cedric Diggory died."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Poor Cedric! He just wanted to win something for Hufflepuff!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, Hufflepuff never got any kind of glory. Sad little badgers, they never won anything."
