"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie, Babadook?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think I've ever heard of it. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's an Australian horror movie. It came out in 2014."
"__MOVIES__ Oh interesting, not too many of those."
"__MOVIES__ It is about a child's imaginary friend that turns into a stalker."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty scary."
"__MOVIES__ It is accompanied with this pop-up book that is super creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Creepy how?"
"__MOVIES__ It has images of the Babadook, and ends with the mother killing the dog and the boy."
"__MOVIES__ Yikes, that does sound creepy. How do people even come up with stuff like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently the writer heard that her friend's son had a similar story."
"__MOVIES__ Truth is stranger than fiction."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mind if I tell you some spoilers?"
"__MOVIES__ No, go for it. Honestly I don't plan on seeing it, I don't like horror films."
"__MOVIES__ Well there is the big climax where the babadook keeps getting more and more visceral."
"__MOVIES__ what do you mean by Visceral?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean like, he keeps escalating his actions, the mother's fear of the Babadook becomes more and more apparent."
"__MOVIES__ Did the director leave any clues that the mother is losing her mind, or is the Babadook real?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, the mother keeps flinching and grabbing her jaw like she has a severe tooth ache."
"__MOVIES__ So like she just has an infected tooth and its just rotting her brain?"
