"__MOVIES__ What would you say is the worst book-to-movie adaptation that you've seen?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough question, considering most are usually not as good as the source material."
"__MOVIES__ If you had to choose one though?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably 'Eragon.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I remember those books.  The movie was so awful."
"__MOVIES__ I remember being so disappointed as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ I remember disliking it too.  It barely included the best parts of the book."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  They even had John Malkovich, but under-utilized him."
"__MOVIES__ It's a shame because it basically guaranteed that we probably won't ever see another live-action version."
"__MOVIES__ A movie for the second book would have been so fun."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Are there any adaptations you do like?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Harry Potter was well adapted for the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ Excellent choice.  That is mine as well."
"__MOVIES__ Not only was it adapted well; the movies also added different depths that the book did not have."
"__MOVIES__ I think you can thank the main cast for that.  Especially Daniel Radcliffe, who grew into a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yea he is truly talented.  Have you seen him in 'Swiss Army Man?'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did.  He had such a good rapport with Paul Dano's character."
"__MOVIES__ The script for 'Swiss Army Man' was great to begin with.  Combined with the acting talent, there was no way it could fail."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget the brilliant work of the director, Daniel Scheinert."
"__MOVIES__ Remember, they had two directors.  Dan Kwan was the second one!"
