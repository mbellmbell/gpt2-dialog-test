"__BASKETBALL__ Why did the Knicks give Carmelo that no trade clause?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No clue, he would have signed there no matter what due to the max contract they gave him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and now it is really coming back to bite them cause they clearly want him gone."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well that's what happens when your GM is running out of control."
"__BASKETBALL__ Or maybe just doesn't care at all."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, that is more likely."
"__BASKETBALL__ And now he is pissing off Kirstaps which is the worst thing he could do."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I bet he is gone as soon as he can be."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think he will demand a trade?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I think he knows that would really damage his image."
"__BASKETBALL__ True.  Hopefully this time on the Knicks doesn't poison him cause he is really special."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah is is the ultimate stretch player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Correct, and they are trying to run the dang triangle with him, Melo, and Rose."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah clearly that is not going to work"
"__BASKETBALL__ It just seems like there is no plan."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe that is because there is not."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well except for Dolan to keep cashing those checks."
"__BASKETBALL__ Haha, yes it must be nice to own the most valuable team in the NBA and do nothing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Except hire Phil Jackson to placate the fans."
"__BASKETBALL__ And then sit back and watch as he runs the team into the ground."
