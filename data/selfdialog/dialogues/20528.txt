"__MOVIES__ Did you get a chance to see Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?"
"__MOVIES__ I did!"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was fun, but maybe not as good as the original movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty much what I thought."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the special effects."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the magical duels looked great."
"__MOVIES__ And all the other magical effects."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the characters were a little thinly drawn, though."
"__MOVIES__ And the plot was a little far-fetched sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it was still entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the fight scenes were really funny."
"__MOVIES__ And I thought Jacob was sweet."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the ending?"
"__MOVIES__ It was cool to see that Grimblewald is back!"
"__MOVIES__ I never pictured him being played by Johnny Depp."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I think it works."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think Dumbledore will be in the next movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess we'll have to wait and see!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll definitely go see that one, too."
