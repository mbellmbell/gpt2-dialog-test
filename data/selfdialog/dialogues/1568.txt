"__MUSIC__ What does music mean to you?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a tough question."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because music is exceptionally hard to describe."
"__MUSIC__ No it is easy. Music is a sound that produces harmony."
"__MUSIC__ At it's basic levels yes that is exactly what it is."
"__MUSIC__ But you see more?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely! Music is an emotion, a heartbeat, a sensation. Music, although not flesh and blood, lives, breaths and has life."
"__MUSIC__ I can see where music can make you feel something but what do you mean that it has life?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to a song that made you happy or sad, laugh or cry?"
"__MUSIC__ I have had a song that made me happy but laugh no I don't think so?"
"__MUSIC__ So you didn't find 'Grandma got run over by a reindeer' funny?"
"__MUSIC__ Ok I will give you that one... it is pretty funny."
"__MUSIC__ Think about the songs that make your feet tap or the ones you find yourself singing or humming in you mind."
"__MUSIC__ Ok there are quite a few that effect me like that."
"__MUSIC__ Those are emotions, sensations. Have you ever heard a song that touched you to the point where you cried or at the very least teared up?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't think of one off hand."
"__MUSIC__ Well when you find one that when you listen to it the emotions will come to the surface like a bold powerful wave."
"__MUSIC__ I am going to start paying more attention."
"__MUSIC__ Don't just listen to the sounds but listen to the words, the tone of the singer's voice, the way the words ebb and flow and see how you feel."
