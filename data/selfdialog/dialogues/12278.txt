"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many games do you think the Miami Dolphins will win next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're going to win at most 8 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, just 8 games? Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's basically the same team as last year and coach Adam Gase isn't a great coach in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're going to win at least 10 games. Ryan Tannehill looked good last season and he's only going to get better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Tannehill and I think the Dolphins' wide receivers have a lot of speed but they're not the best receivers in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They spread the field and stretched it quite a bit last year. I loved it when they aired it out. Tannehill is impressive when he has full control of the offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's more to being a good wide receiver than just speed. You need to have really high field IQ and I don't see any of the current wide receivers having that kind of game feel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's really disappointing that Arian Foster didn't work out for them last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it was expected. Arian Foster is such a good running back but he can never stay healthy. He always gets banged up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was really hoping he would have been a good replacement for Lamar Miller."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lamar Miller looked great in Houston!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, there was such regret, but I was hoping that Arian Foster would escape his injury curse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The lack of a consistent running game did really hurt the Dolphins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can understand now why you don't think the Dolphins will win more than 8 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I just can't see it. I know their defense is overrated especially with all the big names they brought in like Suh, but I don't see them competing for a Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the defense ever gets on the same page and puts up a consistent season showing out their potential, the 10 wins are a possibility for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget they're in the same division as the Patriots. That means they have to play New England twice a year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have nightmares about Brady but to be honest we always play him tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true the Dolphins are one of the teams that has mild success in the regular season against Tom Brady."
