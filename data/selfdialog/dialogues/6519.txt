"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen all of the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I have seen the first three. How about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. Only the first three. I tried to watch the fourth one but it just wasn't the same without Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I know, althought Nathalie Portman as her mother looked pretty as the Queen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah from the previews she did. I can't even watch them when they come on TV. My husband likes them though."
"__STAR_WARS__ He likes the all day marathons they have been having I bet, huh?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll say. I can't get him away from the TV when they come on. He sets there and watches them one after the other. I have to get up and do something else."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not into all that sci-fi I guess."
"__STAR_WARS__ No I think its become too computerized for me. I much prefer the older ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know what you mean. But there is something to be said for a good space fight between star jets."
