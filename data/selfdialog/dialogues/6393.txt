"__STAR_WARS__ So if someone who never saw Star Wars was going to watch the entire series, how should they start watching it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, some die hards would say start with episode 4 and watch them in linear sequence."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hm, that would be kind of silly. I think starting with episode One and follow it thru to episode seven."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well now, that being the case you would have to tuck Rouge One inbetween episode Three and episode four."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. But what about the animated Clone Wars series. Would you tuck them in somewhere as well?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good question. Would you try to squeeze in the Star Wars Christmas special too?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Too funny. I guess you would have to sit down and plot out everything that is Star Wars and make a time line."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. You definately have to spend a little time and work it out."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess 'The Force' would have to be with you!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha ha ha, yes, it would have to be!"
