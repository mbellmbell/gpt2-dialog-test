"__MUSIC__ So, one thing I like about music is songs with really interesting lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like music that tells a story, or expresses some kind of emotion I really like.. besides something vapid like falling in love."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you don't like love songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Ahhh.. they're not usually my job of tea."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what are some examples of lyrics you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, for instance, the Three Doors Down 'Kryptonite.'  I really like the opening verse, 'I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind. I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time. I wanted the world float to the dark side of the moon.  I feel there's nothing I can do...'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, I remember that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it just really speaks to the sense of helplessness one can feel sometimes, watching the world and the way it's going.  Or at least, that's how I interpret it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like more upbeat, encouraging songs."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you're gonna laugh at this, but like 'You're the Best' by Joe Esposito."
"__MUSIC__ Why does that sound familiar."
"__MUSIC__ It was on the Karate Kid."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, man, hahaha."
"__MUSIC__ I knew it, I knew it."
"__MUSIC__ No, no, I'm not laughing at you.  Well, okay maybe a little bit."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, yeah, I'm a bit stuck in the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, they were a decent time for music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so."
