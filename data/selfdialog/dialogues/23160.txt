"__DISNEY__ Ah, the fairy godmother from Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ She is cute. She'd probably grant make some cool things happen."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly my thoughts, and her power seems to be short lived so one day is enough."
"__DISNEY__ Though who would not want more in that case?  Disney is great at creating a fantasy world you would love to be."
"__DISNEY__ Some storylines I would not want to be living out though. So much peril in some."
"__DISNEY__ That is a good point. Like snow white is always under attack."
"__DISNEY__ Most fairytales Disney movies are based on were even darker."
"__DISNEY__ Disney does do a good job and making them child friendly. Some still terrified me as a youngster."
