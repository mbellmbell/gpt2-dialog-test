"__BASEBALL__ Boy, those Battlin' Bucs really took a turn toward the basement of the NL Central Again this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, don't remind me."
"__BASEBALL__ They really had a chance to do something special the past 3 to 4 years and blew it."
"__BASEBALL__ Surprisingly, yes. I thought I would never see the day they finished over .500 again."
"__BASEBALL__ Same here. I'm still having flashbacks to the early 1990's."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, that was a difficult time. At least one of those teams should have won the world series."
"__BASEBALL__ They had a chance at a World Series the past few years also, but ran into a hot pitcher at the time."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, they always ended up in a one game playoff against the hot pitcher at the time."
"__BASEBALL__ Arietta, and then that guy from the Giants. I can't think of his name."
"__BASEBALL__ I know who you are talking about. He pitched a gem against them in 2014."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, what's his name?"
"__BASEBALL__ Lincecum?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, not him."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I know. It was that Bumgartner guy."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, him. He was pitching like he was Sandy Koufax or something that year."
"__BASEBALL__ The Giants won three world series on pitching and mediocre offense."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, they are one of the worst teams I've ever seen to win a World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, worst or not, they won the World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ If only the Battlin' Bucs would win one more."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, that would be the day. 1979 seems so long ago. Ugh."
