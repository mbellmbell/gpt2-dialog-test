"__COMEDY__ What was your favorite Hangover movie?"
"__COMEDY__ That's a tough one. They were all funny."
"__COMEDY__ For me, it was the first one."
"__COMEDY__ I would probably agree. The second and third one just seem to recycle the same jokes."
"__COMEDY__ The third one was a huge disappointment."
"__COMEDY__ I thought the one where they went to Bangkok was even worse."
"__COMEDY__ That was definitely stupid they just thought it would be funny by putting it in Bangkok."
"__COMEDY__ Plus the getting a tattoo like they did is over done."
"__COMEDY__ Well, I'm just glad that they've stopped making them now."
"__COMEDY__ Completely agree."
