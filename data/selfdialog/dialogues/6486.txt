"__STAR_WARS__ I'm wondering, did Mace Windu really defeat Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Windu knocks Palpatine down before Anakin arrives. Was that a ruse, or did Windu really win?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd assume Palpatine faked defeat to help turn Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but Palpatine wasn't a skilled lightsaber user. He was more powerful with the Force."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought the Force made you a better lightsaber duelist?"
"__STAR_WARS__ But, Windu was an incredible duelist, and had Palpatine cornered in a small room. He even blocked his Force lightning."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure. Maybe Windu really won."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's open to interpretation, but I think Palpatine really was screwed if Anakin hadn't arrived."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe. It could go either way."
