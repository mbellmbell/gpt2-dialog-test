"__BEATLES__ Hey, can you play Beatles songs on your guitar?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, a few."
"__BEATLES__ What's the hardest one to play?"
"__BEATLES__ Hmm, there are some tough ones. I'm learning Here Comes the Sun, and it's pretty tricky."
"__BEATLES__ Oh really? It sounds so pretty."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, the guitar part is tricky, you have to capo really high on the fret board â€” I usually just play it in open tuning though."
"__BEATLES__ What else?"
"__BEATLES__ Come together is pretty tricky too. It's not horrible, but it's not easy either."
"__BEATLES__ It's such a cool song though."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I love singing it! Generally, most of the George Harrison songs are tough because he was such a good guitar player."
