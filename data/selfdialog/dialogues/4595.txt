"__MUSIC__ That's ok. in music transformation is just changing a given set of notes by a rule. A set rule"
"__MUSIC__ An example of which is an inverssion? which is what?"
"__MUSIC__ let's say you have made a set of note forming a harmony, let's say c, c#, g#."
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ if I were to invert that, I woudl take the first c in c, c#, g# triad and make it an octave higher if I wanted an octave inversion."
"__MUSIC__ Wait,. so there are more than on kind of inversions?"
"__MUSIC__ There are. but note this is atonal music now and the postulate is that the interval; preserving tranformation are allowed."
"__MUSIC__ I am so confused"
"__MUSIC__ You can change the pitch of a note in the harmony, which is the inversion, but it still perserves the interval."
"__MUSIC__ ok, go on. What's retrograde?"
"__MUSIC__ That's just playing the notes backwards."
"__MUSIC__ Easy enough. And I guess a retrograde inversion is just an inversion done on notes being played backwards."
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ Ok now what?"
"__MUSIC__ So you got the postulate 3?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. Intervals in a row can be operatd on by interval preserving transformations. Yes I got that"
"__MUSIC__ Now the postulate 4 says, the row in the postualtes 3, may begin with any note on the chromatic scale, ie., it can be transposed into any of the 12 notes."
"__MUSIC__ Whoosh again."
"__MUSIC__ In pother words, let's say you have a row, and now you want to start a new row, then you can transform it and then start the new row with any note you would like"
"__MUSIC__ As long as no single note is repeated."
