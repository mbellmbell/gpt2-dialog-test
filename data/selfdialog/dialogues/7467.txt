"__LADY_GAGA__ How do you feel about Lady Gaga's music?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't actively seek out her music, but when it comes on the radio, I don't turn it off."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah? What song do you like most?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I've actually heard Paparazzi a lot lately and have found it stuck in my head."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Ha, that's funny. Are you aware of her support of LGBT rights?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, I actually saw her recently on RuPaul's Drag Race."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw that too. I just wish they would have played some of her music during the episode. I kept seeing her and wanting to hear Poker Face or Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. It was strange seeing her for that much of an episode, but not hearing any of her music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Does she have any new music coming out?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm not sure. I think she just had an album come out last year, so probably not."
