"__STAR_WARS__ What's the best Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's the original Star Wars, from 1977."
"__STAR_WARS__ The series never improved since then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The series did fine, of course - but the original is a classic!"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're all classics, to be honest."
"__STAR_WARS__ A New Hope is the most classic, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ It does have many great sequences, like the Death Star trench run."
"__STAR_WARS__ And it introduced us to all the great characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Still, though, The Empire Strikes Back told us so much more about them."
"__STAR_WARS__ But it only built on what A New Hope started."
