"__DISNEY__ Did you have any problems with Finding Dory?"
"__DISNEY__ There was one issue I had."
"__DISNEY__ What was it?"
"__DISNEY__ It was the octopus. How was he able to stay out of the water for so long and survive?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that's true. He was out of the tank and blending into walls."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe you should research as to whether octopi act like chameleons and can survive for a bit of time not in water."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I could just to clear that up."
"__DISNEY__ I thought the end with all the fish dropping out of the truck and into the ocean was hysterical."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that was funny. And I loved the song that played in the end."
"__DISNEY__ What was the name of it?"
