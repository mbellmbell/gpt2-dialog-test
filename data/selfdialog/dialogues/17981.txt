"__MOVIES__ Charles, I just saw the trailer for It Comes at Night and I have got to see that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Let me stop you right there. I have seen it and it is not what you think it is."
"__MOVIES__ How have you seen it? It hasn't been released yet?"
"__MOVIES__ In the United States it hasn't but it has somewhere else."
"__MOVIES__ Forgot about that. What's wrong with the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember The Village in which alot of audiences are expecting one thing and eventually given a very different film"
"__MOVIES__ That movie was a total let down. It could have been so much better."
"__MOVIES__ You see this is what I mean.  It Comes At Night is not a bad film, but it is not the film you are expecting."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me this, is it a horror?"
"__MOVIES__ No, this is not a horror film. There are no monsters or creatures."
"__MOVIES__ No monsters?"
"__MOVIES__ No. The movie doesn't even ALLUDE to there being a monster."
"__MOVIES__ Then what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ A family isolate themselves in abandoned house in the middle of the woods in order to survive against plague that is killing off humanity."
"__MOVIES__ A plague that is killing off humanity. What kind of plague?"
"__MOVIES__ The full effects of the disease are not known, but basically it gives you a really bad rash and kills you."
"__MOVIES__ That's why they lock up in an cabin in the woods?"
"__MOVIES__ It is a house and yes.  The main characters don't want this to happen to them."
"__MOVIES__ I think I won't be watching It Comes At Night."
"__MOVIES__ It's a cool movie. It's just not what you are expecting."
