"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey. How's it going?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Great. It's good to see you again."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's been a while since I've seen you."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. It's been about six years."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What ever happened with your girlfriend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ We actually got married and had a little boy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How old is your son now?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He's five and has completely taken over control of the house."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I hear you. When my son turned four, he started commandeering the TV remote control."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, my kid has done that too! We never watch what we want anymore because he'll throw a tantrum."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Haha! That's exactly what happens to us."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The worst thing is when I want to watch a movie. He won't let me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, that's very hard to put up with. The other night, I wanted to watch Captain America, but we had to watch Paw Patrol for the umpteenth time instea."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know exactly what you mean. If my wife and I want to watch a movie at home, we have to wait til late night when our boy goes to sleep."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Right. And it's hard to enjoy a nice movie when you have to be awake in six hours for work."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I hear you loud and clear!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But i just want my son to be happy. And at least we spend time together watching his shows."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, soon enough he'll be off doing his own thing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, it was great to see you again. It ws great to catch up with you."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Likewise. And I look forward to movie time soon, haha!"
