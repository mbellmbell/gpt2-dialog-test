"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so glad we're doing a Star Wars movie night!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am too. Are we just starting from the beginning?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I've never just watched them all the way through. I thought Phantom Menace would be a good place to start."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not my favorite, but I think it could be fun."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I just never cared for Jar-jar."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, you can go get us snacks during those parts!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. What's a good snack to eat while watching Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Popcorn, obviously."
"__STAR_WARS__ You set up the movie, and I'll go pop some!"
