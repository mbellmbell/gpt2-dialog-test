"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen any of the Clone Wars series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I have seen most of them but not the last season."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh nice, are you planning on finishing it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I want to, I just haven't found the time."
"__STAR_WARS__ You should! The animation and production quality of that show got better and better each season."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, it was a really well made show."
"__STAR_WARS__ By the time they got to the sixth season it was a master piece of animation."
"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite episode?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to say if I had to pick one it would be the one where Ashoka gets framed for killing the prisoner and the council disowns her."
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved that episode too, I think there were several about that part of the story."
