"__MOVIES__ Hey there! I just saw the best movie! Have you seen Inside Out?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it when it first came out! You're only seeing it now?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm a little late to the movie game. But wasn't it adorable?"
"__MOVIES__ And so heartfelt. How many times have we been confused about our emotions?"
"__MOVIES__ All the time. I loved how the movie portrayed each emotion as a character."
"__MOVIES__ And our brains as like a theme park! The memory orbs were really cool, too."
"__MOVIES__ I heard the filmmakers consulted with psychologists to get down some of the science."
"__MOVIES__ Like memories and REM sleep? I think I actually learned some science during the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Who was your favorite character?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought Phyllis Smith did a beautiful job with Sadness."
"__MOVIES__ Her voice was made for this role! Her whole role on The Office was basically the same thing."
"__MOVIES__ Hah, yeah. They cast the voices so well! I especially loved Amy Poehler as Joy."
"__MOVIES__ When do you not love Amy Poehler?"
"__MOVIES__ You got me. Always. Leslie Knope 2020!"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about how they wrote Riley?"
"__MOVIES__ Adults tend not to take kids seriously, and here, everything she felt was very real."
"__MOVIES__ So true! Childhood is so confusing, and adults belittle kids all the time."
"__MOVIES__ This movie says that it's okay to feel everything we do, no matter our age."
"__MOVIES__ In the end, Sadness was just as important as Joy--same as all the characters."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'm a more realized person after Inside Out. Do I have to go to therapy this week?"
