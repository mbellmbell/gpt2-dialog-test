"__MUSIC__ So what have you been up to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Not to much, just making my mom a CD for her birthday."
"__MUSIC__ It is nice to know that other people still listen to CD's these days!"
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. It seems like most people are listening to music on their phone, or on some other high tech device."
"__MUSIC__ I just like to listen to old fashioned CD's on my boom box for the most part."
"__MUSIC__ My mom is like that as well, she loves to listen to her CD player while she does things around the house."
"__MUSIC__ So, what type of CD are you making her?"
"__MUSIC__ I am making her a mixed CD with a lot of different music on it."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a great little gift for her!"
"__MUSIC__ I hope so! I am trying to put a few Travis Tritt songs on there, but I am not sure which ones would be good."
"__MUSIC__ Is she a big fan of his?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, she has always really loved his music! I am not familiar with the specific songs that she likes though."
"__MUSIC__ I love country music so I could maybe help you out with it. Does she like slow songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Thank you! She does love slow songs, especially if they are heart felt and romantic."
"__MUSIC__ I will give you a few songs to listen to of his and let you decide if you want to add it to the CD or not."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds great! Because after I get three of his songs on there it will be all done."
"__MUSIC__ The Best Of Intentions, Help Me Hold On, and Anymore are all great songs from him."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard Best OF Intentions but I had forgot about it. That is a great song!"
"__MUSIC__ If you do not like one of those just let me know and I will recommend another."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, those three are perfect! Thank you so much."
