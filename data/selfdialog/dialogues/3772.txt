"__MUSIC__ Did you get the tickets?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I did! You think I'd leave Leopold's without them?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, sometimes you forget stuff. And you never really liked Backstreet Boys did you?"
"__MUSIC__ I never admitted to liking Backstreet Boys. But um..."
"__MUSIC__ You sly cat! All this time I've been lusting over Donnie Wahlberg in secret I could have shared my love with you?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't go that far. I kinda liked the little one, what's his name?"
"__MUSIC__ The little one? Weren't they all little?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh no. Not your boy Wahlberg, he was a tough guy."
"__MUSIC__ He was. Girl I still have my NKOTB puzzle with a big picture of his face."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh you do? I have to see it."
"__MUSIC__ Here. This came out right after 'Please Don't Go Girl' was burning up the airwaves."
"__MUSIC__ Oh snap, I love that song!"
"__MUSIC__ Please don't go girrrrrrrrrrrl! It would ruin my whole worrrrrrrrrld."
"__MUSIC__ Um. What did he write on here?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that? Just some super hip slang."
"__MUSIC__ Super hip slang, huh? Pretty sure it says--"
"__MUSIC__ 'Peace Out On The Strength! - D.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh it sure does. Is he... kissing his fingertips?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you know how all the tough guys used to do that back then while singing falsetto."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah that. I almost forgot. Real cool, that Donnie Wahlberg."
