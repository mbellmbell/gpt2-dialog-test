"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Penn State is hosting its first concert in the football stadium?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I did hear about that. It is in July right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is going to be a country concert."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I thought. Who is going to be there?"
"__MUSIC__ Blake Shelton is the headliner. And I think the others are Chris Young, Big and Rich, Adley Stump, David Ray, and Ben Gallagher."
"__MUSIC__ I know Blake and I've heard of some of the others, but I don't think that's a concert I'd go to."
"__MUSIC__ I know and I even like country music."
"__MUSIC__ Now if it would have been Blake Shelton with Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban, Darius Rucker, and artists like that, I may be interested."
"__MUSIC__ Well with that lineup you should expect to pay dearly!"
"__MUSIC__ That's true. Even though I like the country music that's out now, I really like the older style better."
"__MUSIC__ Like the really 'twangy' kind?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, not necessarily. More of the like the southern country rock."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so like Outlaw Country."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I knew there was a name for it."
"__MUSIC__ I like that too. It has such a classic sound, but for its time, it really bucked the country trend."
"__MUSIC__ I know. And unfortunately we now have artists that think country and rap go together."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Don't you hate that?"
"__MUSIC__ I do. But some newer artists are keeping the old traditions alive."
"__MUSIC__ Not enough though."
"__MUSIC__ I couldn't agree more."
