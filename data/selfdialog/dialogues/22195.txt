"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ My favorite is definitely Aladdin! I love that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ That's so old fashioned! I meant something new, like Frozen or Rapunzel."
"__DISNEY__ I like some of the newer movies, but I think I prefer the old fashioned ones."
"__DISNEY__ What's so great about that out-dated animation?"
"__DISNEY__ There's something so charming about it, the traditional animation over the digital animation, the characters, and most importantly, the story-telling."
"__DISNEY__ The story telling? What's so different about animated story-telling versus digital story-telling?"
"__DISNEY__ It isn't the visuals. It's just that, I don't know, the plots were explained better, the characters were more developed. Things were explained to children more in the past, whereas now the movies also geared toward adults."
"__DISNEY__ I guess you're right. Children don't know the difference between old school cartoons and CGI animations, but adults do."
"__DISNEY__ My point exactly! The technology has evolved for adults, not children. Children will always enjoy a good cartoon no matter what the format. Adults, not so much."
