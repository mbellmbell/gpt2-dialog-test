"__MUSIC__ You know when I was a kid I really hated country music?"
"__MUSIC__ No kidding! I've always loved it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It all sounded sad, and dumb to me."
"__MUSIC__ You're talking like that's in the past."
"__MUSIC__ Well a few years ago I started listening again and I found myself really liking it!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? What changed your mind?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it started with that band Sugarland."
"__MUSIC__ They're the ones who do Stuck Like Glue, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! That song's really funny."
"__MUSIC__ Country isn't all sad you know."
"__MUSIC__ I'm learning that. After I heard that song I looked up some of their albums and listened some more."
"__MUSIC__ The Incredible Machine is a great album of theirs."
"__MUSIC__ That's the next one I listened to. The opening song All We Are was really powerful."
"__MUSIC__ It's a great song. Cheerful and strong at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ And wow what a voice she has!"
"__MUSIC__ That's always been one of Country's strengths."
"__MUSIC__ True. I used to say I loved the singers and hated the songs."
"__MUSIC__ Now you're liking some of the songs too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, some energy and joy and fun really makes a big difference."
"__MUSIC__ It absolutely does. Sad has its place too but not all the time."
