"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen that new movie Everything Everything?"
"__MOVIES__ No."
"__MOVIES__ Why not? It looks like it will be a good romantic movie."
"__MOVIES__ I have no interest in seeing that movie. I'd rather die first."
"__MOVIES__ Come on now, Sheena."
"__MOVIES__ I am serious. Why is that they are always pushing this white and black relationships down our throats?"
"__MOVIES__ I see where you are coming from?"
"__MOVIES__ You telling me that black girl couldn't have found happiness with someone of her own color or race."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Everything, Everything is not for everyone, but it will satisfy a certain subset of teenage girls who are compelled by watching fragile girls come-of-age with the help of a pretty boy."
"__MOVIES__ Black boys can't play the lead of a pretty boy? Why must they keep doing this?"
"__MOVIES__ Doing what?"
"__MOVIES__ Trying to keep us stupid and wanting to be with their kind. Like there is something wrong with us being with our own kind."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think about it that way."
"__MOVIES__ Of course you didn't."
"__MOVIES__ 'Everything, Everything' is a flawed film in many ways, but there is one that's a deal breaker."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't make you cry."
"__MOVIES__ Her mother should be crying for what her daughter is doing in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's a sweet romance movie, nonetheless."
"__MOVIES__ In your closed eyes."
