"__MUSIC__ Techno music is awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't you a little old for EDM?"
"__MUSIC__ Most definitely, but strangely enough I took a liking to it a few years back. It was the rage in the 90s when I lived in Germany."
"__MUSIC__ But at 32 you were too old for it then haha."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I did not go clubbing in Munich, but it was always playing somewhere, from Oktoberfest to the grocery store."
"__MUSIC__ Ah yes, the earlier years. Eiffel 65 I'm Blue. Loved it. Still do."
"__MUSIC__ And anything by Anna Lee."
"__MUSIC__ Two Times! Great song."
"__MUSIC__ I got back into it in 2007. Had a friend I met on YouTube who turned me on to a Dutch online radio station."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of electronic music do you like best?"
"__MUSIC__ I really got into Chill Out music at the time and I still love it."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard much of it really, what's it like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's, as named, pretty mellow. Lots of babbling in French, sometimes insidiously or not so insidiously sexual."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha babbling in French, really?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha maybe it was because I was listening to European radio. I also love Zero 7, with Sia, and other stuff here and there, don't catch all the names."
"__MUSIC__ I love Zero 7! Didn't realize that was 'Chill'. Love Fine Social Scene!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too! And Destiny. Chill always makes me feel floaty. Not sure why young folks need ecstasy - the music is really intoxicating by itself."
"__MUSIC__ Agree. Did you ever see the Love Parade in Berlin?"
"__MUSIC__ I never went, but I watched it on TV most years I was there. What a kick!"
"__MUSIC__ That would be a crazy scene in person, but I saw a few videos of it and it looked like good fun."
