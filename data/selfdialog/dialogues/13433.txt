"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think Johnny Maziel was such a bust?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the guy had some talent but he was way too interested in partying and not improving himself in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the browns gave up on him too quickly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, if anything I think the Browns stuck with him for too long. It was evident that this guy was a cancer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really think he might have succeeded if he had been drafted by another team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree that the browns did him no favors by drafting him but I don't think there would have been any difference if he went to a different team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could put almost any quarterback behind the browns offensive line and they wouldn't be able to move the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. However, Manziel was way too short for the game and he was too big of a kid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He won the Heisman though. He's got to have some talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There were some flashes of hope with him. Maybe if he were to clean up his act, he could have gotten better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he will ever get back to the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I kind of doubt it. Maybe one day a team will take a chance on him as a backup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a team might grab him sooner than you think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it. It would have happened by now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but teams situations are always changing along with their needs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think anyone is going to take a risk on him after all of the goofing off he has already done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think the browns took a chance on him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At that time, it wasn't as much of a risk. The guy looked much more appealing because he had just won a heisman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Haslem regrets drafting him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has openly admitted to it."
