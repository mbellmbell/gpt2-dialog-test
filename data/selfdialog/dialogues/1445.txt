"__MUSIC__ I heard a song on the radio the other day but can't figure out who it was by."
"__MUSIC__ What were the lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ It was a pop funk type of song. The lyrics were something like don't stop till you get enough."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like it was Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ You think? This does not sound like any of the Michael Jackson I know."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah his early work had a much different feel than the work he did towards the end of his career."
"__MUSIC__ When I think Michael Jackson I think thriller not the song I heard."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I prefer his earlier work. It had so much soul and character."
"__MUSIC__ So what album should I get that has some of his early music?"
"__MUSIC__ The thriller album has some great songs on it that have a much different feel than the title track of the album."
"__MUSIC__ What other songs have that early Michael Jackson feel?"
"__MUSIC__ Rock With You is my personal favorite."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound very good. Is it a rock song?"
"__MUSIC__ Hardly. It has kind of a disco funk sound it's a great song."
"__MUSIC__ Disco funk. That sounds interesting. Nothing like his later works."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he worked with a lot of good producers. They put out great songs that went with the current trends of music."
"__MUSIC__ Did he ever make any songs in his later career that had a similar feel?"
"__MUSIC__ One that comes to mind was Butterflies."
"__MUSIC__ That title sounds kind of corny."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I know, but the song is really great."
