"__DISNEY__ I think Snow White is one of the best Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it was one of the first ones. So it kind of started something larger."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that's true. Is the movie itself that great though?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it! The dwarves were funny and the witch was really creepy."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I remember I used to have nightmares about her trying to offer me an apple as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ I also just loved the animation style back then. It was hand-drawn!"
"__DISNEY__ It is kind of neat that they used to do that."
"__DISNEY__ I wish they still made hand-drawn movies."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe Disney will eventually go back to that!"
