"__MUSIC__ I've been getting back into a lot of the rock from the 90s lately."
"__MUSIC__ 90s Rock was the best!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, I found a great playlist on Amazon music and I've been listening to that and the 90s alternative Rock channel they have on there."
"__MUSIC__ What bands do they normally play?"
"__MUSIC__ I personally listen to mostly 90s alternative rock, like Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stone Telmple Pilots."
"__MUSIC__ Oh ok, so all the alternative rock greats. You just motivated me to take a trip back in time and listen to all my favorite songs again."
"__MUSIC__ Oh ya, what were your favorite songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I have so many favorite songs from that time. If I had to name a few I would definitely say Nirvana, Smells like Teen Spirit."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, that song and the opening riffs of it will always be epic. What else?"
"__MUSIC__ Popular by Nada Surf was another favorite of mine."
"__MUSIC__ What about The Cure?"
"__MUSIC__ Amazing music! I could never forget The Cure. Friday I'm in Love has to be one of the best songs ever."
"__MUSIC__ Is The Cure Gothic Rock?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard the band categorized that way before but I don't think they liked that label."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, ok well I guess I will continue calling them plain old alternative rock then."
"__MUSIC__ You know what other band I just thought of that was great in the 90s?"
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ Bush, remember them? Their lead singer was Gavin Rossdale."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I remember them.  They were on the soundtrack of a movie I really liked in the mid 90s called Fear."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that movie. The song Come Down was on it."
