"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, how are you today?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi, I'm good. The weather is great."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I agree, have you had a good month?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, it's been pretty good anything new with you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm going to see Kasey Chambers next week, pretty excited about that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Never heard of her, what's she sing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ She's not very popular so not many people have heard of her, country folk music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I thought you didn't like country?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't but her music just spoke to me at the right time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well one of the lyrics was 'we're all gonna die someday.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That sounds really dark."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nah, it's a really cheery song you should listen to it sometime."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Maybe I will, it sounds interesting."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ In that song one of the lyrics is 'it hurts down here cause we're running out of beer, but we're all gonna die someday.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's a really funny lyric. Sounds like I might like the humor in it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Even if you don't like country you'd probably like her, just like me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'll be sure to wear my cowboy hat when I listen to her."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You know I'll be wearing mine at the show!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yee haw! Go get 'em cowboy!"
