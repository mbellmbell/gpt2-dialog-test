"__STAR_WARS__ Which is your favorite Star Wars light saber battle?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the mood and the music really shows Luke Skywalker's anger and struggle."
"__STAR_WARS__ And when he finally bests Vader and chops his robot hand off, it is so intense."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the whole Vader redeems himself at the end thing?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess seeing his son getting destroyed by Palpatine stirred something in him."
"__STAR_WARS__ And then Vader got to become a force ghost at the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ But then George Lucas changed the original force ghost to Hayden Christensen from the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a bit of an odd choice."
"__STAR_WARS__ As were many of George Lucas' changes to the original films."
