"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite planet in the Star Wars universe?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say Coruscant."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why that one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It just feels right, I love how it's this big bustling planet."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well from what we've seen in the movies it's this huge sci-fi city and I believe thats pretty much all we've seen of it.  I just love the fact that it's all busy and advanced."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point, you'd think with how advanced all these species are that most planets would be like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree I always thought it was odd when a planet felt like they were less advanced than we are."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought about it but you make a good point."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's why I liked it the most though some of the other planets were good too."
