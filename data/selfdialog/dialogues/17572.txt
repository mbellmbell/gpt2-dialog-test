"__MOVIES__ I just went to see The Wedding Plan."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie that came out earlier this month."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I've never heard of it. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a woman that cancels her wedding a month before, and another woman takes over the reservation even though she doesn't have a fiance."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds romantic, who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ No one that I recognized.  Noa Kooler and Oz Zehavi."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of them before."
"__MOVIES__ I think most of the cast is Jewish."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really wonderful.  I went to see it expecting your average romantic comedy, but this also had tastes of religious faith, loneliness, and culture."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that sounds great. Who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ Rama Burshtein.  She also wrote it."
"__MOVIES__ It must have been very important to her then."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I could tell that it was. I really recommend going to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to convince my boyfriend to go this weekend.  He might enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he might!  There are really strong characters so it's easy to get sucked in."
"__MOVIES__ I'm excited!"
"__MOVIES__ Let me know what you think!"
"__MOVIES__ I definitely will."
