"__MUSIC__ Whats the worst song you've ever heard in your life?"
"__MUSIC__ Easy! Friday by Rebecca Black."
"__MUSIC__ No that's too easy pick another one thats not from an amatuer."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, ok. I'd say 'Wobble Wobble' by 504 boyz."
"__MUSIC__ I can't say I'm familar with the group or the song."
"__MUSIC__ You should consider that a blessing to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ On a scale of one to ten how bad would you rate the song."
"__MUSIC__ Ten being the worst?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ I'd give it a 10 hands down. The song was just terrible all around."
"__MUSIC__ So it had no redeeming qualities?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely none to speak of. It was one of those mindless songs."
"__MUSIC__ Mindless?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you know how a song will come out and nothing about the lyrics or song has any kind of substance?"
"__MUSIC__ What you mean like no story or message?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah exactly like that, but add on the fact the melody is bad too."
"__MUSIC__ That does sound bad but to get the full effect I'll have to give it a listen."
"__MUSIC__ I honestly think you can skip the full effect. It's gotta be one of the worst songs ever made."
"__MUSIC__ I still think I'll give it a listen. It's just not the same until  I hear it."
"__MUSIC__ Hey it's your ears."
