"__MUSIC__ Do you watch The Grammys anymore?  I watched it the other night."
"__MUSIC__ I watched it but I swear there are so many artists today that I have never even heard of."
"__MUSIC__ I did like that Adele won for Album of the Year for 25."
"__MUSIC__ She has a beautiful classic voice.  She would sound gorgeous in any era."
"__MUSIC__ Personally, I'm not a big Beyonce fan even though everyone loves her Lemonade album."
"__MUSIC__ My son actually had to do a homework assignment about Lemonade!  Wish we had homework about the Beatles when I was kid."
"__MUSIC__ I actually like some of the new music.  I totally miss hearing The Fugees.  I thought their remake of Killing Me Softly was better than the original."
"__MUSIC__ Lauren Hill is so underrated.  Did you ever hear her remake of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off of You' the old Frankie Valli hit?  It's awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I love it when I'm surprised by a remake of a popular song.  You always think it's going to be worse, so you are blown away when it's good."
"__MUSIC__ Just goes to show you that you can't prejudge till you hear it. You have to keep an open mind."
"__MUSIC__ I have to confess, I don't always do that.  Can I give you another example?"
"__MUSIC__ Don't tell me you love rap music because I won't believe you!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, when I first heard a version of Rehab by Amy Winehouse, I liked the song, but then when I heard the mix with Jay Z, I thought it was incredible."
"__MUSIC__ That shocks me.  I  figured you for strictly old school.  I liked that version but some of the lyrics turned me off, think there was some profanity."
"__MUSIC__ I think that so much rap music would have a broader audience but for the language.  That doesn't mean it has to be 'Gettin Jiggy With It' by Will Smith"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, some of Tupac Shakur's music was powerful without the bad language."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it certainly seems that for two older ladies, we have fairly broad taste in music!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, when my kids come over at least I know who Lady Gaga is, I guess that's progress."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like the artists that are the best like Adele or Lady Gaga know they owe a debt to the older artists, like Tony Bennett."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that Cheek to Cheek album they did together was pretty good.  Tony Bennett is 90 years old so guess we can all learn something new about music!"
