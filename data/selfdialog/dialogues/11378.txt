"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will anyone break Peyton Manning's passing record for yardage?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Brees really has a good shot at it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Tom Brady could even do it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had my money on it though it would be Matt Ryan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has alot of weapons at his disposal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did the other guys we mentioned."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but hes young and hes playing in a time when passing is the name of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brees has literally done nothing but throw the ball in New Orleans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and I think he will break it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why do you bring up Ryan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will end up with even more yardage"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its interesting but I cant see Ryan throwing for 5000 yards ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither, but he never gets hurt and has the weapons around him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know he had a great year but Shannahan is not his coordinator anymore"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true but hes still an elite talent"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they take a step back though this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With that defense and receiving corps? No way!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The super bowl hangover is a real curse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah I forgot about that. You are probably on to something"
