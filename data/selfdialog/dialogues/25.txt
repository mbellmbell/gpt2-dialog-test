"__MUSIC__ What do you think of rock n roll?"
"__MUSIC__ I love it. I think it paved the way for modern music and then other genres to follow."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think that is true? Music has been around for centuries."
"__MUSIC__ Well many of the rock bands of the 60's-80's learned from the blues and spun off from there. Very influential."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Some of those great blues artists set up many of the great rock bands."
"__MUSIC__ Even the Beatles and many of the Great Britain bands like Led Zeppelin, etc. studied and learned from American blues"
"__MUSIC__ BB King and Buddy Guy as well as others still influence bands today."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think rock is fading?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I think it isn't fading, just evolving."
"__MUSIC__ Heavy metal came around in the 90's like AC/DC, Metallic and others."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a much harder sound for sure, but enjoyable once you get used to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, my sons started listening to Green Day and Nirvana, etc and I hated at first."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. But after a year or two I came to really appreciate their talents."
"__MUSIC__ What I am struggling with is today's version of pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because they are talented showmen, but lack instrumental skills."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm....interesting, I wish I knew why that was."
"__MUSIC__ I suspect the music will come full circle in the next 50 years or so, but  I'm not sure."
"__MUSIC__ Certainly pop has gotten more popular because of all the coverage on MTV, award shows, etc."
"__MUSIC__ The rockers are having to still play to make a living because the music indusrty has been dramatically ltered."
