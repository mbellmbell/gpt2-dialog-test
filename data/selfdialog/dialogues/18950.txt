"__MOVIES__ I just thought of another cover I really like."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, which one's that."
"__MOVIES__ 'Bette Davis Eyes' by Kim Carnes"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wow, I just heard that recently on the film 'Final Girls'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember that.  What's crazy though is I didn't even it was a cover until about year ago."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought it was an original, but turns out someone in the seventies originally song it.  Uh... shoot, can't recall the name, I'd have to Google it or something."
"__MOVIES__ Ahh, that's okay."
"__MOVIES__ You know, what's really interesting?  A lot of people have speculated on what the song means really."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have a theory?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just go with the 'it's about a mysterious woman who happens to look like Bette Davis' theory myself, but I've heard some other interesting ideas."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, some say the song is a allegory or drug addiction."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, it seems like nearly every other rock song in existence has someone saying it's about drug addiction."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's true.... I don't recall the reasoning, but I know, some of them point to the line, 'She's pure as New York snow.' as a reference to a drug or something."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I can kind of see that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but to me, I've always thought the lyric was being ironic."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if you know anything about snow in New York (literal snow) iit quickly becomes grey and slush because of the pollution.  As since white is usually a symbol purity the phrase 'pure, ie 'white' as New York snow' is being ironic."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, interesting idea."
