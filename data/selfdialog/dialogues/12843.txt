"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only a few more weeks until we get some football back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's only pre-season, but I'll take it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You guys had a decent run last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the regular season was really good, but the playoffs were a bit of a let down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, what happened there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well first our starting QB got hurt right at the end of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then our backup QB was OK but our left tackle got hurt and we couldn't protect him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's brutal. I thought you guys had a real shot last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we're going to be strong again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Except that the Raiders have a really tough schedule this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially the last few weeks of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you'll still have a better season than my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, who's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Los Angels Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they were pretty brutal last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, there's been so many changes in the off-season because there's so many things to fix."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least you've upgraded the head coach and defensive coordinator quite a bit. That should help."
