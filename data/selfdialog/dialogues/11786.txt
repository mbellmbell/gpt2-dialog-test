"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your favorite NFL player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean of all time? Probably Joe Montana from the 49ers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he's a legend all around. What about current players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overall, I think my favorite is probably Aaron Rodgers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Rodgers is better than Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Patriots have more of a dynasty than the Packers do, at least recently, but I think Rodgers is the superior player overall"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And yet Brady will probably go down as the greatest quarterback--if not overall player--of all time"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't really argue against that when the numbers back it up"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The numbers are one thing, but who would you want to lead your team when your best players are hurt or have retired?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that the Patriots are statistically worse when Rob Gronkowski isn't playing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and same with Brady, so you know the two of them have an enormous impact"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without Aaron Rodgers, the Packers would probably be average at best"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now there's a sign of a really good player, even if the team doesn't have as many wins as the Patriots do"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who is your favorite current player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's so hard to choose, but I like defense so I think I'd say J. J. Watt"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah he's really good, and people thought he was a bad pick when he got drafted"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hindsight is 20/20, after all. Just look at what happened with RGIII"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he got hurt a lot and the Redskins totally mismanaged his career, he was really talented and had a lot of potential"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he'll bounce back again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not with the Browns, he won't."
