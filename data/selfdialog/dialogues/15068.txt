"__ACTION__ Kill Bill 1 or 2: which do you prefer?"
"__ACTION__ One, for sure."
"__ACTION__ Why is that?"
"__ACTION__ It has the insane violence with the Crazy 88."
"__ACTION__ Yeah but it's a bit TOO much and not believable."
"__ACTION__ I take it you like the second?"
"__ACTION__ Yes."
"__ACTION__ Why? It's less action, but an action movie!"
"__ACTION__ It has great dialogue, which Tarantino is known for."
"__ACTION__ Well I'll give you this: at least Bill dies."
