"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, so who would you list as the greatest NFL quarterbacks of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is tough. So many factors go into the rankings, and it can be hard to compare QBs of different eras."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I guess the most important question is: do Super Bowl wins matter?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they do. Winning a Super Bowl is a team accomplishment; many great QBs had to carry their teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're saying someone like Dan Marino shouldn't be left out just because the rest of the Dolphins couldn't get it together enough to pull off the big win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. Marino had some amazing stats and even held the touchdown record at one point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, if you HAD to make a list, where would you start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose the current obvious choice for a top pick is Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That man is a machine. Hardly feels like he's been aging atl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right? He's been in the league going on 18 seasons now and has only missed the post-season ONCE."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His win percentage is something ridiculous too, isn't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was over 75% (.773) last I looked. Just incredible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, so who else? Can't forget Joe Montana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely not. Montana is a legend. Brett Favre, too. Peyton Manning. Dan Marino."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Here's a good one: Joe Montana or Steve Young?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, easy. Montana all the way. He has a higher win percentage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet the 49ers would kill to have either of them playing for them now, eh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that 2-14 regular season record in 2016 was painful to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who even is their current QB?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley. I don't think either has been named starter for the new season yet."
