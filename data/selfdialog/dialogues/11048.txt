"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am so excited for the Cowboys this season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! They are going to be so good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott had such a good rookie season last year he may only be able to go backwards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it. He looked so confident on the field I don't see him moving backwards this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really hope you are right. The Cowboys offense is so good they just need a half decent quarterback to score."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. All Dak Prescott has to do is not be bad and they should be able to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think Ezekiel Elliot will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he had over 1000 rushing yards last year so it may be hard to beat but he ended the season strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was amazing. He should have gotten the MVP last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to disagree about the MVP but he was insane for a rookie running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok but this year if he puts up similar numbers there is no way he does not get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to agree there. If he puts up the same or better numbers this upcoming season he deserves to be MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the offense can carry the Cowboys to the Superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about the Superbowl. I would just be happy if they made it to the conference championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. Last season's loss to Green Bay was gut wrenching."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was but that game was probably the best playoff game out of them all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That game was so great. The Cowboys looked like they were out at the begining but fought back to almost take it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They came really close. I was on the edge of my seat to the last minute of that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers played lights out. I don't think any team could have beat him that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are probably right. Without his extreme performance Green Bay does not win that game."
