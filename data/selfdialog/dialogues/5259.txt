"__STAR_WARS__ I just came back from Seeing The Force Awakens. I don't understand why people think that Rey is a Mary Sue."
"__STAR_WARS__ Because she can do everything so easily, without any training."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, she did everything so quickly and so easily, like she was following some sort of quick and easy path."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think she's going Dark Side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Just watch it.  She's a huge ball of anger, and she uses the Force when he's angry, it's classic Dark Side."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think that's the intent."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it wasn't, but the signs are there.  She doesn't start beating Kylo until she's angry. That's Dark Side right there."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point.  Rey is flirting with the Dark Side.  I don't think the guys at Disney are that subtle, either."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. It's possible that they completely missed the point.  I wouldn't put that past them. But that's why we have death of the author."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet the next movie completely fails to confirm your idea."
