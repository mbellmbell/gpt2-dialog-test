"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is something that bothers you about the characters in Harry Potter?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I always thought the Ginny transformation was quite abrupt."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you mean?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, she went from all shy to being an absolute badass."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, that's true, but I think that happens to a lot of kids once they reach a certain age,"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I get that, but you would have thought they would have eased us into it a bit more."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True. In the course of one summer (between books) she became completely opposite."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly. I love her character and feel like it was necessary though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Also, do you think the Harry and Ginny romance was tacked on?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know, I always kind of rooted for it, so I might be biased though,."
