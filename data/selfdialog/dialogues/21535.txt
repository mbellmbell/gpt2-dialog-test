"__DISNEY__ Did Fantasia make any sense to you?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but I don't think it was supposed to?"
"__DISNEY__ How do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it was sort of just music and imagery right? There was no narrative."
"__DISNEY__ No, there definitely was not. I was not expecting that."
"__DISNEY__ Well, it's still art isn't it?"
"__DISNEY__ I suppose. It was pretty bold for the 1940s. No kid could have sat through that."
"__DISNEY__ No, but it was still stimulating."
"__DISNEY__ And beautiful. The animation was really quite good."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, they were sort of interpretive vignettes eh?"
