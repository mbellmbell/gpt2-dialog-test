"__ACTION__ Have you seen all the Lethal Weapon Movies."
"__ACTION__ Yes, I have seen them all at least twice."
"__ACTION__ Which one is the best?"
"__ACTION__ That is hard to say. I like the first one because it really sets up the characters."
"__ACTION__ Is Joe Pesci in that one?"
"__ACTION__ No, he was introduced in Lethal Weapon 2. He was a witness that had to be protected."
"__ACTION__ Is he in any others?"
"__ACTION__ He is in all of them after the second one. He provides a lot of humor."
"__ACTION__ I think I will check them out."
"__ACTION__ Great. Just start with the first one and watch them all!"
