"__MUSIC__ What are you up to today?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I'm just listening to some electronic music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? You usually do."
"__MUSIC__ I like to a lot, it's good background music."
"__MUSIC__ How come you want background music?"
"__MUSIC__ Electronic music to me just fits nicely into whatever I'm doing because it doesn't distract me."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it's very good productive music."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well you can focus more on what you're doing but still not have to listen to silence."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that I can understand."
"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to music like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, I prefer stuff with singers."
"__MUSIC__ There are a good amount of electronic bands with singers, well at least with words in them."
"__MUSIC__ What does that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of groups will edit in recordings of people or voices."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right. I remember, like club music."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of, I don't really go to clubs so I wouldn't know."
"__MUSIC__ Club music is like electronic, but has some words here and there and heavy beats."
"__MUSIC__ As long as it's musical, I'll probably like that kind of electronic music."
