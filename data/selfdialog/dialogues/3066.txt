"__MUSIC__ Have you been listening to any new music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ New as in released in the last few months, or new as in new to me?"
"__MUSIC__ Either, I guess. Mostly new to you."
"__MUSIC__ New as in released recently, no, but new as in new to me, I'm enjoying Von Thronstahl and Black Goat of the Woods."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of either of those things. Do I even want to know what that is?"
"__MUSIC__ Von Thronstahl is mostly instrumental, it sounds like Lord of the Rings or something should be happening in the background. Very epic and dramatic."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds kind of awesome, actually. Anything in particular I should check out?"
"__MUSIC__ The entire Imperium Internum album is pretty intense, highly recommended if you like that sort of thing."
"__MUSIC__ I'm guessing Black Goat of the Woods is sort of a Lovecraft type of thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of. It's completely avant garde, so a song might last forty-five minutes and it won't sound like what most people would even call a song."
"__MUSIC__ So, it's a little like Coil, or some of the experimental Rozz Williams stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say so, it would fit into a playlist with either of those perfectly. Add a little Current 93 and some of NASA's Voyager recordings, and stir until done."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, that actually sounds awesome. Both very strange and very relaxing."
"__MUSIC__ Other than collecting ever more music that makes people say, 'What's wrong with your stereo?' I'm listening to a lot of oldschool punk."
"__MUSIC__ Aw, man. Sex Pistols, Clash, Dead Kennedys kind of stuff? I miss when punk was PUNK and not radio-friendly trash like Green Day."
"__MUSIC__ Even less popular than that. Stuff like The Germs, the Circle Jerks, and The Ultras."
"__MUSIC__ I love The Ultras. Man, I wish there was more than that one album. That IS all there is, right?"
"__MUSIC__ As far as I know. I would probably surrender a kidney to have a live Ultras show, especially if it was video and not just audio."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'd take either one, it's really depressing how much art has been lost because there weren't cellphones then."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, how I agree. Broke punk kids in clubs tended not to have the ability to make bootlegs of shows."
