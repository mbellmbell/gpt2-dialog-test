"__MUSIC__ Do you like rap music?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of it, yes. It depends."
"__MUSIC__ Depends on what?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't like the kind of clubbing and drugs rap music around nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of rap do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Older rap, like Tupac, and modern rap like Kendrick Lamar and Run The Jewels."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love Run The Jewels! Have you heard their latest album?"
"__MUSIC__ 'RTJ3'? Yes, I love it."
"__MUSIC__ It's really political, which I like a lot."
"__MUSIC__ That's one of the main reasons I like them and Kendrick, actually. They're not scared of getting political."
"__MUSIC__ They call Donald Trump out by name on a few songs, I remember."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. And Killer Mike had that song 'Reagan' which was very critical."
"__MUSIC__ Kendrick has gotten more political, too."
"__MUSIC__ And, again, in my opinion his music is better for it."
"__MUSIC__ It just adds a layer of depth to modern rap that people don't expect."
"__MUSIC__ Or give credit for! There is some good rap around today with substance, but not much."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you - I'm sick of hearing rappers talk about drugs and women."
"__MUSIC__ It just isn't why rap came about. It was supposed to be for the disenfranchised to get political."
"__MUSIC__ Nice to see some people keeping that legacy going."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, and with pride. Kendrick isn't ashamed to come from a poor part of LA, and I respect that a lot."
