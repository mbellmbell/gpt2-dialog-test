"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Reinxeed?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember, they are metal, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  They have songs like 'Fantasia' and they're from Sweden, sort of melodic power metal."
"__MUSIC__ Now that you mention it, I vaguely remember someone playing a song from them awhile back.  They're fast, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they're fast and melodic and their singer has an amazing range!"
"__MUSIC__ That I do remember.  The guitars were going real fast and his voice can go high or medium."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe 'Fantasia' was the song your friend played for you!"
"__MUSIC__ I remember it started fast with the guitars and then he screamed really high to get things going."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, that's the one.  It's a great song that really sums up the best of what they do."
"__MUSIC__ The thing is, when that friend played it for me, I wan't in the mood to listen to something fast like that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, everyone gets like that, even me if you can believe!"
"__MUSIC__ Now that I find hard to believe.  Oh yeah, you do sleep sometimes right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, hahaha.  Let's listen to the first 10-20 seconds and see if that's the song."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's it, that's the one.  Those guys are so talented!"
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever hear their rendition of 'Lay All Your Love On Me' by ABBA?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I imagine it's awesome with his voice.  What's the singer's name?"
"__MUSIC__ Tommy Johansson, though he also goes by Tommy Reinxeed."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's a good song for the road then.  We'll fire it up on the freeway while we're driving out to Lakeside later on."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I love listening to good music while driving!  Why don't I make sure it's on my MP3 player so you don't have to use data on your phone."
"__MUSIC__ Good deal.  Put whatever you want on the MP3 player and save me some data!"
