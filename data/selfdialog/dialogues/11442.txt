"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you as excited as me for the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! I need some football in my life in the worst way!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's talk about who the best defensive team is going to be this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like fun, who do you have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this year the Seattle Seahawks will emerge as the leauge's best defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a pretty good pick in my opinion. Pete Carroll has focused on that side of the ball ever since he has been there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea and he has a good defensive coordinator to run things in Kris Richard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure do have a lot of talent on defense as well, and that always helps!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were able to keep Richard Sherman this year and that was huge!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I kept hearing rumors that they were looking to trade him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is what was in the news, but who knows how true that stuff really was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Sherman is the most important player that they have on defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure about that, Earl Thomas is pretty important himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure is! After he went down with that broken leg last year their defense was never the same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it was not. Do you think the Seahawks will be the best D as well?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, although I am pretty high on the Houston Texans' defense for this upcoming season myself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot about them! Yea they should be pretty good on that side of the ball this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Mike Vrabel as the defensive coordinator, plus they have great talent as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ J.J Watt might be the best defensive player in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea and do not forget about Jadeveon Clowney either, he is a beast in his own right."
