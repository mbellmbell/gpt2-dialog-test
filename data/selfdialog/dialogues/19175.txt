"__MOVIES__ Hey, Elizabeth, how would you like to go see a movie tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great! What would you like to see?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know... how about that new horror movie at the Arlington Theater?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I heard about that. It sounds a little scary to me. I'm more into romantic movies. Or maybe a romantic comedy."
"__MOVIES__ No way! I hate that kind of stuff!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? Well then, what kinds of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'm really into action and adventure type of movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, well I guess they are okay, as long as they aren't too bloody. I also heard about this great new musical that just came out. What do you think about that?"
"__MOVIES__ Musical? I don't know. That doesn't sound too exciting. Is there anything we can agree on?"
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't seem like it. Oh, I remember another movie that came out last week. It's a mystery and it had a little romance and some action, too. I heard it's pretty exciting because nobody can guess who the killer is and it has a surprise ending. What do you think about that one?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess that doesn't sound too bad. What time does it start?"
"__MOVIES__ It starts at 8 PM."
"__MOVIES__ Great. Would you like me to pick you up?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that would be lovely. Will you buy me popcorn at the film as well?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, I would be happy to get you all the snacks that you like."
"__MOVIES__ I love to have a snack during the movies. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I do as well! But I sometimes worry I might drop the snack if I get scared,"
"__MOVIES__ That is a funny worry to have. Will you hold my hand if I get scared?"
"__MOVIES__ I absolutely will. I am a gentleman."
"__MOVIES__ Thank you! I can't wait for the film tonight."
