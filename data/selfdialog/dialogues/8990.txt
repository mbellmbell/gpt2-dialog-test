"__BEATLES__ Do you have a favorite Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ Probably 'Abbey Road'. You?"
"__BEATLES__ Mine would be 'The White Album'. It's a tough choice, though."
"__BEATLES__ Oh I forgot about 'The White Album'! I love that one!"
"__BEATLES__ It's so great isn't it? It's the only 2 disc album, too."
"__BEATLES__ Was that towards the end of their career?"
"__BEATLES__ Kind of yes. 'Abbey Road' was the last album."
"__BEATLES__ With the iconic cover! I would love to go to that street one day."
"__BEATLES__ Wouldn't we all? And recreate that album cover?"
"__BEATLES__ Exactly. Everyone knows it."
