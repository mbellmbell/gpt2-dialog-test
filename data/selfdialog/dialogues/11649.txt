"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts about the NFC East this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to tell. I would assume that the Cowboys are still the best team in that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Their offense is still one of the top ones in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did lose some players on defense and that will definitely hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense has been their downfall over the past few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems to let them down at the wrong times. I could see them going either 12 and 4 or 11 and 5 despite the defense losses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds about right. What about the other three teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a difficult assessment. The Redskins, Giants and Eagles didn't seem to make a huge splash in the offseason and they were all mediocre last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mediocre is right. They are basically eight and eight teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eight and eight, but if one of the teams get hot, they could end up ten and six."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which of those teams is more likely to get hot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, probably the Giants. They still have Odell Beckham and he can win a game or two just by himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Giants always seem to be in the mix."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they do. The Eagles and Redskins are pretty much feast or famine. Playoffs one year and out of playoffs the next."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This will probably be a year where both teams are out this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could agree. I guess my final prediction is Cowboys 12 and 4, Giants 9 and 7, Eagles 7 and 9, Redskins 6 and 10."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that. I will go with Cowboys at 12 and 4 and Giants at 8 and 8. Eagles and Redskins both at 6 and 10."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not too far off of my prediction."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all. I would be surprised if anyone besides the Cowboys won the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here."
