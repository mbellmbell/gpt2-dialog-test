"__MOVIES__ I heard you're kind of an expert on films, is that true?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure is, I see one just about every weekend!"
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, that's commitment. Can you suggest one for me then, maybe?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, what genre do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I wanted to go see a movie with my brother this weekend, and he likes sci-fi."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, how about The Circle?"
"__MOVIES__ What's that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a woman who gets a job at a social media company, then discovers some big-brother style secrets."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Emma Watson, John Boyega, and Tom Hanks star in this film."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I loved John Boyega in Star Wars!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's quite the breakout actor."
"__MOVIES__ And Tom Hanks, he's in everything."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't think there's a single film genre he hasn't been in at some point or other."
"__MOVIES__ I love him in Saving Private Ryan, but boy is that a tough one."
"__MOVIES__ He doesn't shy away from the tough roles."
"__MOVIES__ The Circle isn't as rough as that, is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, The Circle's much more tame. More of a B-type dystopia movie."
"__MOVIES__ Okay then, I guess I'll see it. Thanks!"
"__MOVIES__ No problem, enjoy your film!"
