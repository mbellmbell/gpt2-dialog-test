"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think is the most attractive woman character in the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, back in the original trilogy it would have easily been Princess Leia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Now, something is different?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I think Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala has her bested."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, you do not think it is just because it is newer?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is kind of hard to tell I guess."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, everybody in 1970s TV now doesn't look as attractive."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is the hair the clothing, maybe just the film definition is not as good."
"__STAR_WARS__ You did not like Rey in The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, she is cute too but not like Senator Amidala."
