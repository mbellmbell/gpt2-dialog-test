"__MOVIES__ Were you a fan of those older horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean like the slasher flicks?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Movies like Halloween or Friday the 13th."
"__MOVIES__ You know what is interesting about that?  I don't identify with the movies as much as I do with the actual characters."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean.  Most people don't point to individual movies."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  Instead people talk about Jason or Freddy Krueger."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if you'd agree with me, but I think Freddy Krueger is the most iconic of all of them."
"__MOVIES__ I do agree!  I think Freddy is the only character that made its actor an icon as well."
"__MOVIES__ Robert Englund, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Englund.  One of the best actor and character combinations of all time."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Going beyond just this horror genre, Englund's portrayal is simply among the best in movie history."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  He made the character of Freddy Krueger so iconic."
"__MOVIES__ So what do you think about the newer slasher flicks, like Scream?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Scream is over twenty years old.  It's not exactly newer.  But I know what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, Scream is pretty old now, but it did kind of resurrect the genre."
"__MOVIES__ I have watched all the Scream movies.  They definitely are well done."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I thought they were excellent homages to the earlier slasher flicks while bringing something new to the genre."
"__MOVIES__ Scream also helped resurrect Drew Barrymore's career a bit."
"__MOVIES__ True, she was in the movie for a short time, but everyone remembers her role."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, one of the more shocking moments in any movie."
