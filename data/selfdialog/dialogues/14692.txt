"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Since Twin Peaks is being revived, I decided to go back and watch the Twin Peaks movie, Fire Walk with Me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh. I remember that vaguely. When did that come out?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ 1992. Not a lot of people saw it. Many people hated it because the tone was quite different than the show."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ In what way?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, it's very dark. It doesn't have as much quirky charm as the show Twin Peaks."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It focuses on the time period immediately before Laura Palmer death. You get to see what her life was like and the issues she was dealing with."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Who stars in it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ David Bowie makes a small, but memorable, appearance. Also Chris Issak, Keifer Sutherland, David Duchovny as a transgendered FBI agent, Harry Dean Stanton, Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise, Grace Zabriskie and more people. It has a big cast."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It sounds interesting. Did it get any awards?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh no. Absolutely not. It did not have any mainstream success. It received many poor reviews, but it's one of my favorite movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, it must be somewhat bad to receive so many bad reviews, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Obviously, I don't think so. I think people went in the theater with certain expectations, and when they were not met, they were upset."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So, what kind of issues was Laura dealing with in the movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, mostly she is coping with abuse."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ From her father?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, but in the movie she is uncertain about who is abusing her. This is because of combination of factors. Most certainly one of them is denial."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you recommend that I watch it before I watch the new episodes of Twin Peaks?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. If you are fan of Twin Peaks, you should definitely consider this must-see material."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Okay. Well, I consider myself a fan of the Twin Peak world, strange as it may be. I will check it out."
