"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, what's up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not your team's win lose record, that's for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, why are you always hating on Manning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not that I hate on Manning, it's just Brady is obviously much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You seriously can't acknowledge that 0-4 isn't the best the NFL's has seen in a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can acknowledge Brady can kill that record with very little effort."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What he could do and what he can do are two different things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is true, but 4-0 is really no big deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You say Manning's record is no big deal, but no one has beaten it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't matter. Manning's 4-0 is still not worth bragging about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, what has Brady done on the field?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What has Brady done? He's done multiple Super Bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, Brady's team has done multiple Super Bowls. What are Brady's acomplishments as a player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That team would have never seen a single Super Bowl without Brady. That's his contribution."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, that's a team effort. Brady does not stand out of the pack."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ben, Brees, Romo, these guys would kill to play alongside Manning not Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fantasy football doesn't win Superbowls. Players would kill to get a ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What good is winning the Super Bowl if everybody's going to focus on poster boy Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'd still have their place in history as Super Bowl winners and not fade into the sunset like miserable Manning."
