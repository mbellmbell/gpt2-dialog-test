"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, how's it going?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm good, how about you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Doing good, so, did you hear about that new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, DC movies usually are pretty bad though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not this one, it has been getting really good reviews."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah? That is surprising."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hard to believe that it is our first super hero movie that is all about a female."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess when you put it like that it is."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Anyways, do you have Spotify and listen to any music?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I like listening to Throwback Thursday. That's always fun."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah, what is that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They play old music centered around a theme."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That does sound pretty cool, I guess I'll give it a listen."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Are you going to see Wonder Woman in theaters?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I think so. I just need to find someone to go with."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Movie tickets are kind of pricey these days, especially iMax ones."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Definitely, maybe it is better for it to just come out for rent."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, if you want to go with me then I'll go."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Thanks, yeah. We should go see the movie then."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Alright! Let's see if it meets all the hype!"
