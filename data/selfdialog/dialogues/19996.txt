"__MOVIES__ Hey Walberto, have you seen anything good on Netflix recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Hi, Janoris, I watched Zodiac the other night."
"__MOVIES__ Zodiac?  Is that about astrology?"
"__MOVIES__ No, good guess but no, it's about a serial killer."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the Zodiac killer from the 60s?"
"__MOVIES__ 60s and 70s.  But yeah."
"__MOVIES__ Were there any actors I would recognize?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it had Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, and Mark Ruffalo in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it had two Avengers.  Ha, that's funny."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I hadn't realized that, but yeah there were two!"
"__MOVIES__ Was the movie good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was very good, it was quite suspensful."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, nice, I love suspense."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, my wife, Esmerelda, even liked it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so it would be a good date movie with my girlfriend?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure about that, does she like movies with suspense?"
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes, as long as they aren't too bloody."
"__MOVIES__ Then she will probably be ok with this one, while there is some blood it isn't over the top."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, I will have to watch it soon!"
"__MOVIES__ Good choice!"
