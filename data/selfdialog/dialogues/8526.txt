"__BEATLES__ You listened to the Beatles when you were younger, right?"
"__BEATLES__ Sure, I think everyone did."
"__BEATLES__ Well, I wasn't a huge fan until I became an adult."
"__BEATLES__ Really, that is weird."
"__BEATLES__ I was really into Elvis, my mother played his music all of the time."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, so when you did get into the Beatles which one did you think was the cutest."
"__BEATLES__ I switched back and forth. At first I was crazy for Paul."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, he was so cute but I had a huge crush on John."
"__BEATLES__ I never had a John crush. I would switch to George."
"__BEATLES__ Poor Ringo, he never made the crush list."
