"__STAR_WARS__ I have a confession to make."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's on your mind?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My absolute favorite thing about the Star Wars films are the machines."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean like the robots?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Pretty much, yeah. I love the AT AT walkers for absolutely no reason at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's actually kind of funny. Don't get me wrong, I like them too."
"__STAR_WARS__ But don't you like the actual characters a lot more?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't beat yourself up over it. You like what you like."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, thanks for being considerate."
"__STAR_WARS__ No problem! How about we go watch The Empire Strikes Back?"
