"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited about the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am and hope there is less drama and more football this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You must be reffering to the 49ers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and primarily their quarterback Colin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was all the drama about anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honnestly, I am not sure.  All I can say is Colin destracted from the game and made me not want to watch it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was Colin any good at playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Colin was not good at all!  The 49ers won only 1 out of 11 games with Colin as quarterback!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ WOW, the drama must have been to get attention away from how bad the 49ers were!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is what I was thinking!  He was going to get cut and then created a bunch of drama to put the spotlight on himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is he playing this year for the Niners?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, Colin got cut from the 49ers shortly after the season ended!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is funny, I guess the 49ers didn't want any more Colin drama!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so and I am glad to get rid of the drama and watch some pigskin get tossed around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has Colin been picked up by any other teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, as of now Colin has been shunned by all other teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess nobody wants the Colin drama on their team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, his drama did nothing but ruin the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your right! the Niners had a horrible season last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope this NFL season is drama free and back to football."
