"__DISNEY__ I wonder what Disney movies will be released on dvd this year?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, you mean the ones that are from the vault?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I try to purchase them as soon as they come out."
"__DISNEY__ Well, let me grab my phone and do some googling for you."
"__DISNEY__ Thank you so much for doing this."
"__DISNEY__ It seems the latest release was Bambi and it was two weeks ago."
"__DISNEY__ I haven't gotten that one, yet.  I think I need to go to the store now."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that is all the vault releases for this year.  In January, Pinocchio was released."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I have that one."
"__DISNEY__ Then, it seems you are all caught up for the year as soon as you get Bambi."
