"__DISNEY__ I can't believe it's been twenty years since Hercules came out in theaters."
"__DISNEY__ I know, it seems like time has flown by since then. I remember seeing it when it came out."
"__DISNEY__ Me, too. I liked Danny DeVito's character in it, the satyr."
"__DISNEY__ I think my favorite part was when the little kid is in trouble and his friend says, 'Someone call IXII!'"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah! Except wasn't that not really kids, but a trap by Hades?"
"__DISNEY__ True. It was his two little sidekicks, Pain and Panic."
"__DISNEY__ Right. That was when Hercules was still trying to get some fame."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, trying to defeat the Hydra."
"__DISNEY__ Before he went from 'zero to hero.'"
"__DISNEY__ Nice. I like that song!"
