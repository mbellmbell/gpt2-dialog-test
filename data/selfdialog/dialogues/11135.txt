"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you gamble on the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but it can be tricky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can I use the weather information to make better totals bets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ By getting early information. You’ll see adjustments to our lines once information comes out, but you still need to be careful; lousy weather doesn’t always = under. We’ve been burned by that misconception more than a few times"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On analysis, is it better to put less weight on the passing & put more on rushing & defensive discipline?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting question. I believe you need to incorporate both…it’s still a passing league and teams are shifting away from run-heavy offenses. Need to put equal weight on all phases of the game and find the strength of each team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will there be fixed wagering limits on NFL in-play markets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We have limits on live betting and will adhere to them at a minimum. However, we may at certain times increase limits for marquee games or as we see fit for certain games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the Seahawks record at (home field) CenturyLink, how does HFA factor into lines compared to the rest of the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like any game, HFA is taken into account and incorporated into the line. As it’s week 1 and fresh off a Superbowl victory, Seattle, which is historically tough at home, will be extra raucous. That’s also taken into account when setting the line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you expect lines to move a lot more early in the season until more info on teams comes in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely. We need time like anyone else to figure out which surprises are legit. That means the lines aren’t as stable as they would be later in the season. Same is true of any sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that provides more value for bettors or more concerns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it can be more value for those that take the time to evaluate and analyze, but it can also be concerning for those taking shots in the dark or making assumptions"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much does a team’s popularity factor into markets? Enough to move handicaps?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That’s tricky. Teams in high-population markets with good teams can move the markets, but our clientele is sharper than the average sportsbook’s, so our lines won’t move as much in that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which teams get the biggest bumps that way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It’s what you’d expect. Teams that make the Superbowl, that have national brands, that are fun to watch. It depends on he spread though…if you have the Broncos as a 14-point favourite, our clientele know there may be value on the dog because of the inflated line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How does stronger enforcement of pass interference/illegal contact impact week 1 lines?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That’s a good question…hadn’t really considered it. I don’t think it affects the spread much because it’s a two-way game, but you may see an increase in the total points scored per game. We’ll watch that through the season and see if it has an effect, and whether it’s called as much as in pre-season."
