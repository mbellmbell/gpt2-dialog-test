"__MOVIES__ Did you go to the movie theaters this past weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I did."
"__MOVIES__ What did you go and see?"
"__MOVIES__ Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the beginning with the good, visually this film is fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, what about the rest of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ the special effects of all of the ships, the destruction, the villainous characters, it's all very well done and doesn't take you out of the film at all."
"__MOVIES__ What about the story line?"
"__MOVIES__ The first half was great but it just got so strange after that. The final battle was so confusing and weird but some of the sexual jokes were quite funny."
"__MOVIES__ So this is not as the good as the first two Pirates of the Caribbean is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not to me. It could've been better and had a really quirky second half but it was at least enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ Well, at least you thought it was enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ For the most part. That Turner kid was a boring character and for some reason Jack don't sound like he used too."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think you went into this movie expecting too much from it?"
"__MOVIES__ No. If I am paying my money to be entertained, then I should be entertained."
"__MOVIES__ You think this movie is over hyped?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Yes I do."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it time to retire this franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, just time for something different with it. Because what they are doing now, is killing it."
