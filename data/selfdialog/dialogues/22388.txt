"__DISNEY__ Snow White always used to freak me out as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Why's that, it's one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ Well the scene where the Huntsman attempts to kill her is disturbing."
"__DISNEY__ Oh very true, the animation was very fluid and realistic."
"__DISNEY__ Yup that's what would do me in, it was a really tense scene for a kid."
"__DISNEY__ I thought for sure you were going to say the dwarves scared you."
"__DISNEY__ Oh they did, I can't leave them out."
"__DISNEY__ But they're all so adorable."
"__DISNEY__ Not really, a bunch of little men living in the woods like that give me the willies."
"__DISNEY__ You're something else my friend."
