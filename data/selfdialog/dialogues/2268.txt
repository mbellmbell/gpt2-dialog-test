"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to foreign music at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah sometimes when I am studying I listen to other stuff. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Well lately I have been listening to alot of French Jazz."
"__MUSIC__ Why French, Jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably because I have been back and forth to France within the last few months"
"__MUSIC__ And what type of songs do they listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well. That's the funniest thing. At every shop or market  or even in the hotel lobby where I was staying there was always American artists playing on the radio"
"__MUSIC__ That is really odd. Did they play any french music ?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes. But mostly they would switch back and forth between American and french"
"__MUSIC__ You know when I listen to French music I hear the accordion as the prominent sound"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I know. Even in their jazz music you hear the accordion"
"__MUSIC__ But apparently they prefer American music?"
"__MUSIC__ It's so odd. When I think about that because alot of people there don't even speak English yet they listen to American lyrics"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that is odd. You should ask about that, the next time you go there."
"__MUSIC__ I intend to. When have you ever gone into an American establishment to hear French music playing ?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow... Never . I guess they think these English speaking artists are the best!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. But in the meantime I will continue to listen to French Jazz"
"__MUSIC__ You ought try to attend a concert the next time you visit"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I intend to, that's definitely on my list"
"__MUSIC__ Just make certain it's not an American Group playing...."
