"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you think Tom Brady is gonna be able to win another Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, I don't think so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? He still looks pretty good and healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think that he gets carried by his team too much and never really plays a great Super Bowl where he dominates."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess I can see that. But if you think about it, it really is all about being part of a great system."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I think Tom Brady is getting to that point though where the system can't help him anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You do have to admit though, he still played great last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but a year is a long time for a professional football player. For all we know his body can break down soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but then again, if you think about it, he didn't even have Gronk in the Super Bowl and they still won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Super Bowl win was more of a matter of the Falcons making stupid decisions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it is odd that the Patriots won their last two Super Bowls off of stupid choices by the other teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he should still continue playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think he's still their best choice at quarter back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually think the back up Jimmy is a better choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think he's pretty good, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually think they should start him soon and cut Brady because Jimmy is about to become a free agent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think that would happen. New England fans would riot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but when Jimmy gets signed by another team and does better than Brady, they're going to wish they had kept him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that would be funny."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely would love to have Jimmy as the quarterback on my team."
