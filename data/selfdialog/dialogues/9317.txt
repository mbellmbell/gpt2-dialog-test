"__BASEBALL__ Have you been keeping up with the games lately?"
"__BASEBALL__ To some extent. You?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. I try to. I can't say for sure how the Rangers will do."
"__BASEBALL__ The Rangers! I remember their team from the early '90s, even."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah? Rafael Palmeiro?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure. I don't recall them all."
"__BASEBALL__ They weren't bad. They're doing really well lately."
"__BASEBALL__ It helps to finally make a world series."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. That was one hell of a dry spell, wasn't it?"
"__BASEBALL__ At least. People joke about Boston, but sheesh!"
"__BASEBALL__ They have some quirky characters on their roster lately."
"__BASEBALL__ The one guy from Bolivia(I think) qualifies."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure. How many baseball players have huge pirate-style beards?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's the only one coming to mind right now."
"__BASEBALL__ In all seriousness, though, maybe they'll have another chance soonish."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe. I do like that they get by without a Steinbrenner type running the show."
"__BASEBALL__ How so? What about him do you mean?"
"__BASEBALL__ I mean their success doesn't seem entirely dictated on who can afford the best players."
"__BASEBALL__ Simply because their owner's rich, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly. That gets tiring."
