"__STAR_WARS__ Are you looking forward to the next Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ A ton! It's so nice that they come out one a year now."
"__STAR_WARS__ What are you looking forward to?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, we didn't get to see much of Luke in the last one. I'm hoping for more of him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like Mark Hamill. I wish he was in more things."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's always cast as the villain when he acts elsewhere. I'm excited to have him as a hero again!"
"__STAR_WARS__ But are we sure that Luke's a hero still?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He must be. He's Luke Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. I guess that could never really change."
"__STAR_WARS__ It definitely couldn't!"
