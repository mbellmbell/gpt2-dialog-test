"__HORROR__ Has David Lynch done any horror movies?"
"__HORROR__ That depends on how you define horror. Mostly his films are more weird than scary, though I think Fire Walk With Me was horrific."
"__HORROR__ What's that one about?"
"__HORROR__ It is a prequel, and kind of a sequel, to the TV series he did with Mark Frost, Twin Peaks. It follows Laura Palmer up to when she was murdered."
"__HORROR__ I have not seen that show. Is it any good?"
"__HORROR__ It is amazing! But not as dark as the movie. Sheryl Lee, the main actress, conveys fear and anguish so well in the film, compared to the quirkier show."
"__HORROR__ Do I need to see Twin Peaks before I watch Fire Walk With Me?"
"__HORROR__ You probably should. Especially since there is a new season that has a lot of horror elements, that picks up 25 years after the movie."
"__HORROR__ What makes Fire Walk With Me scary?"
"__HORROR__ There are these supernatural beings and bizarre happenings surrounding Laura Palmer, but nobody but her seems to know about it. She is just a teenager but she is being targeted by spirits from another world."
