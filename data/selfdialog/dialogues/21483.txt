"__DISNEY__ Thank goodness my son is too young to be into Disney movies. I love them, but I can't stand to watch the same movie over and over again."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, he will get there. You just wait."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm. I wonder which movie he will be into the most."
"__DISNEY__ Probably Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ Olaf is the greatest, and they have part two coming out in the future."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, my kids can't wait. I'm looking forward to having a new song blaring in the car on repeat. I hope it's as catchy as Let it Go."
"__DISNEY__ Disney does a pretty good job with their soundtracks."
"__DISNEY__ Yes they do."
"__DISNEY__ I'm feeling a solo coming on..."
"__DISNEY__ Oh please, don't start singing in public again."
