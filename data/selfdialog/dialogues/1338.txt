"__MUSIC__ Gosh, i cant get that stupid song out of my head"
"__MUSIC__ Huh?  What song"
"__MUSIC__ You know - thaaaat song...goes da da da da"
"__MUSIC__ hahah - yeah, I think I know which one you mean.  it is catchy"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but its by that singer.  You know, that popstar singer.  I don't like that kind of music.  I am more of a grunge kind of guy."
"__MUSIC__ well - hey, I mean she has many platinum albums, so obviously a lot of other people think her music is catchy, too"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess - I just dont like that teeny bopper music"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think shes like 30 now, but shes also been singing and stuff since forever.  Remember when she came out when were in high school?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, man - everybody looooved that first song.  It was all over the place.  I am humming it in my head now!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I told you its catchy.  But I think shes a good entertainer.  I am not a huge fan, but I can respect what she does. She makes music that just makes people feel good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can see that.  I think I read she went through a lot of bad things transitioning from child star to adult"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I remember that.  I think thats why I dont mind her music, shes been through a lot and I guess now she just wants to have fun"
"__MUSIC__ yeah, but I like artists who write their own stuff and make their own music"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I do too, but at the same time, i can appreciate a silly pop song now and then.  I think its fun to just hear a song about dancing and whatnot, as an escape"
"__MUSIC__ Would you ever see her in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I dont think so, but i think I'll just hum along with you, haha"
"__MUSIC__ But I looked it up and she has a new album coming out in like three weeks."
"__MUSIC__ yeah, I think i saw she already released her new single"
"__MUSIC__ Lets find it online!"
"__MUSIC__ And we can hum along!"
