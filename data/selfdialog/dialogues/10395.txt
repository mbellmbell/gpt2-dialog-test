"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you seen that new Tupac biopic?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nah, I don't really have much interest in seeing that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really? Why not?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I was never a huge Tupac fan. I think he's quite overrated."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well of course he's a bit overrated. That's to be expected."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you mean?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ His life has gotten turned into a myth. If he were still alive people would view him much differently."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, that's very true. And I think the same goes for Biggie."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yep. They're both very good, but not the greatest of all time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, if I had to choose between the two I would take Biggie every time."
