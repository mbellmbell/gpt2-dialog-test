"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the Harry Potter films?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have seen all of them. Have you?"
"__MOVIES__ I have not seen the last film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 2. Which one was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved the first one, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It holds so much nostalgia for me."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Although, my favorite from the series would have to be Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that one too. Are the Harry Potter movies your favorite of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, no. My favorite movie franchise is the Captain America movies."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I have heard a lot of good things about those movies, but I have never seen them."
"__MOVIES__ Really? They're thrilling. They follow a WWII soldier, Steve Rogers, after he has been frozen in time for over 70 years!"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds really cool. I'm going to watch that soon. Which movie is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Captain America: Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It follows the Avengers and their struggle with the law: what is constitutional and humanitarian and what is best for the public."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds complex. I'll have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You should. What's the best movie you've seen recently?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough question. Probably Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen that! Wade Wilson is absolutely hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, man! Although a little bit inappropriate."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but that's what makes it so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was an entertaining movie."
