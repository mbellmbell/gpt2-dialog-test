"__MOVIES__ Just got done watching some movies from when we were growing up."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  What made you do that."
"__MOVIES__ I was bored, and couldn't find anything on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ haha, I think we've all been there.  What'd you watch?"
"__MOVIES__ I just got done watching Surf Ninjas haha."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I haven't even though about that movie in years."
"__MOVIES__ It was so corny.  I can't believe how much I liked that as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ I bet it was, what else did you watch?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I got to Surf Ninjas because I watched 3 ninjas first."
"__MOVIES__ I completely forgot about that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ It was just as corny, but so good."
"__MOVIES__ Now you've got me wanting to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Do it! My wife is getting annoyed because I keep saying 'Rocky loves emily'"
"__MOVIES__ I forgot about that part too! I wonder if those guys did any other movies."
"__MOVIES__ I looked it up, the kid who played Rocky only did the two 3 ninja movies and was an extra in another movie."
"__MOVIES__ There's another 3 ninjas?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah haha, I haven't watched it but it seems terrible!"
"__MOVIES__ No way it's terrible, I'm going to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ I bet it's bad, let me know how it is so I can decide if I want to watch it or not."
"__MOVIES__ I will!"
