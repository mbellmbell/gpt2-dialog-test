"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well Seattle has won the big game and been to it twice in the past couple years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea and for that, I would not count them out either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, having all pro safety's like Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman doesn't hurt either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, would you want to go over the middle to find either of those guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that I wouldn't and I do not think Odell does either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I think that fear factor is one of the main reasons that they will remain in contention."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. That defense will just have to stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they aren't getting any younger, but man are they fierce."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are. It would also be nice if Jimmy Graham brought back some of his magic from New Orleans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he seems to be focusing too much on blocking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! His receiving is what separates him as a player. He should use it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I mean the blocking is good for Russell Wilson, but he can do so much more to help out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Russell Wilson could use all the help he could get."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, when you're a quarterback until six feet, you could really use some playmakers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, especially since I do not even know who is carrying the ball for them this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, me either. Better hope they have a strong offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they are going to need that to stay relavant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but I wouldn't doubt them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. They have as good of a chance as anyone still."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. They definitely do!"
