"__BEATLES__ So where do you fall on the Beatles vs. Stones debate?"
"__BEATLES__ The Stones, but both are bands one should respect."
"__BEATLES__ I think so too. I'm more of a Beatles fan personally."
"__BEATLES__ I think they had a couple of very good songs, but I just can't get into them that much."
"__BEATLES__ Have you tried Revolver?"
"__BEATLES__ I have, but it didn't really do it for me."
"__BEATLES__ What about their solo material?"
"__BEATLES__ Well I think Paul did some good stuff."
"__BEATLES__ You should check out George Harrison's solo material. It's very underrated."
"__BEATLES__ That's for the recommendation!"
