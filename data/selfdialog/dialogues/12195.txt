"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where was the Superbowl held this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was in Houston Texas"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Houston so I wish I went! Where was it last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was in California in 2016."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very nice! It always is in such great locations."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it varies and would depend on what you consider a great location..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where is it going to be next year? Let me guess - New York, Las Vegas or Miami???"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually it's going to be in Minnesota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've never been interested in going to Minnesota, so I don't think I should go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Were you planning on actually going to the game, or you're going to sightsee."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't have minded a bit of both."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How would you get tickets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess if I decided to go, I'd just get tickets when I get there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't suggest that. Getting a ticket is very hard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It probably was hard this year in Houston or last year in California, but how many people actually want to go Minnesota?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thousands! Thousands of people will be interested in going to Superbowl no matter what city it is in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess maybe die-hard fans would be interested even if it's not an exotic city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will be playing next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way of telling yet. We will only have a better idea once the season is well underway."
