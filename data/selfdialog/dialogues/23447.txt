"__DISNEY__ Did you hear about Disney getting hacked in May?"
"__DISNEY__ No, what happened?"
"__DISNEY__ Some cyber thieves stole one of Disney's new movies coming out. They want a ransom in bitcoins, or they're going to post it on online for people to steal."
"__DISNEY__ So is Disney paying the ransom?"
"__DISNEY__ No, they are insisting they won't pay ransom. Someone already stole 10 episodes of a Disney tv show and posted it online."
"__DISNEY__ What movie did they steal?"
"__DISNEY__ Disney wasn't saying, but they had Pirates of the Caribbean and Cars 3 coming out soon."
"__DISNEY__ I bet it was Pirates of the Caribbean. There would be a bigger audience for that than a kid's movie."
"__DISNEY__ Probably. Johnny Depp's character in the Pirates movie is pretty popular."
"__DISNEY__ They probably would like that it's a movie about pirates, stolen by online pirates."
