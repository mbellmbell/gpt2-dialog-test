"__STAR_WARS__ I'm still bitter about George Lucas re-editing the middle three movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't blame you.  I don't think they added anything."
"__STAR_WARS__ The worst part was at the end of Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, when he put in Hayden Christensen?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah - I never wanted to see him again."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same here - he drained all the energy out of the room."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus, they changed the music at the end.  I liked the original song better."
"__STAR_WARS__ You actually liked that song?  Ha!"
"__STAR_WARS__ In my defense, I was five when the original came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now I have something new to hold against you."
