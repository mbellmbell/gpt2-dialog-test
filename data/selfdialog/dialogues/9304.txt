"__BASEBALL__ Did you see tonight's Met game?"
"__BASEBALL__ I can't believe they almost blew it."
"__BASEBALL__ But they didn't. If they win tomorrow they'll be back in it."
"__BASEBALL__ They're still four games under 500."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe, but the rest of the NL isn't doing much better."
"__BASEBALL__ It's only a matter of time before the Cubs start winning."
"__BASEBALL__ We're getting Lugo and Matz back soon."
"__BASEBALL__ But we don't have a bullpen."
"__BASEBALL__ If the starters pitch to expectations, we won't need one."
"__BASEBALL__ We still need a bullpen."
"__BASEBALL__ The offense has been good. If the starters can pitch seven innings and not give up five runs, we'll win games."
"__BASEBALL__ I still don't trust the offense."
"__BASEBALL__ Bruce is a good player, and they don't really need Granderson."
"__BASEBALL__ But why do they keep pretending Wright will contribute?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't think they do."
"__BASEBALL__ Then why is he still on the team."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he's earned the right to decide when he's done."
"__BASEBALL__ Not if it hurts the team?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's not. They have Reyes."
"__BASEBALL__ Reyes isn't reliable."
