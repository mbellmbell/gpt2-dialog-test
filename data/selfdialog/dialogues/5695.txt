"__STAR_WARS__ You know what I never understood about Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why those storm troopers were such horrible shots"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's true, they missed a lot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they were supposed to be these highly trained soldiers"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yet they were always missing their targets."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well except for when they shot Leia at the end of Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't remember that one"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was the scene where they were at the shield generator door"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, but Han took care of him later."
