"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Grand Tarino?"
"__MOVIES__ It was alright."
"__MOVIES__ Alright? what did you not like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ The old man was mean."
"__MOVIES__ The old man? You mean Clint Eastwood?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he was so mean to the neighbor kid."
"__MOVIES__ You do realize he tried to steal his car?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but the boy was forced to steal it."
"__MOVIES__ He didn't know that at the time."
"__MOVIES__ well that explains a lot."
"__MOVIES__ So what did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I like how he drove up and helped the girl get away from those gang members."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. When he pulls his hand out of his pocket and acts like its a gun, only he could do that and make it look cool."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was funny when he kept giving the boy dating tips"
"__MOVIES__ It was cool when he gave him the grand tarino"
"__MOVIES__ I would so drive that car, classic muscle cars rock, perfect car for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, a mustang would have ruined it. A 1966 camaro would have been cool too."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, wouldn't have made near as an intriguing title."
"__MOVIES__ I hated it when he died."
"__MOVIES__ He was going too anyway, he was sick. At least he went out in style."
