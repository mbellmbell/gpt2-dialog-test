"__MUSIC__ What did you think of the newest Kendrick Lamar album?"
"__MUSIC__ Damn? I thought it was fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, I didn't like it all that much."
"__MUSIC__ Why not? It has arguably some of Kendrick's best work on it."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I guess the lead single kind of turned me away from it."
"__MUSIC__ So you didn't actually listen to the whole album?"
"__MUSIC__ Alright, you got me. I didn't."
"__MUSIC__ So then why are you judging it?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm just afraid that the one song sets the tone for the whole album, and I really don't like that style of rap."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that judgement for the song, but not the whole album. You really should listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Is it as good as To Pimp a Butterfly?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe not as good, but it really isn't that far behind. I have some songs that you might like."
"__MUSIC__ Alright then. Which ones."
"__MUSIC__ I highly recommend DNA, Element, XXX, Lust, Fear, and Duckworth. Those are the more lyrically profound ones on the album."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have good beats?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. Some of them are more catchy, while other ones are more atmospheric."
"__MUSIC__ Is there a best song on the album, at least in your opinion?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely Fear. It's incredibly atmospheric and tells a great story about Kendrick himself."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds good. How long is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's actually 7 minutes long, so you're definitely in for a treat."
