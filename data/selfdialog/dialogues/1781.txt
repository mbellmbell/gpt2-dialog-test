"__MUSIC__ So what decade do you think was the best for music?"
"__MUSIC__ The decade that produced the best music was the eighties in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That is strange because I was thinking the same thing!"
"__MUSIC__ There were so many great artists' that were discovered in that decade."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me about it! Micheal Jackson really blew up in the eighties like nobody else."
"__MUSIC__ Yea there is no debating that. However, there were many other great performers throughout that era as well."
"__MUSIC__ Many of them are very underrated to this day in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ I used to love Blondie. I thought she had some great songs back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Me to! I used to love that song Call Me."
"__MUSIC__ That was probably her biggest hit. Did you ever hear that song The Tide Is High?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so; Blondie actually started her career in the seventies. She even puts out music to this day!"
"__MUSIC__ That is a very long career that she has had! What other eighties music do you remember?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to love a lot of music from Queen also. Are you familiar with them?"
"__MUSIC__ I remember their song Another One Bites The Dust really well."
"__MUSIC__ That was a great song! Their most famous song however was We Are The Champions."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you on that one. Under Pressure was another good song that they had."
"__MUSIC__ It sure was, did you ever listen to any songs from Duran Duran?"
"__MUSIC__ I sure did! I loved that song Hungry Like The Wolf."
"__MUSIC__ That was a really good one. I also liked A View To a Kill."
