"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the New Orleans Saints are going to do this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll do okay since they picked up Adrian Peterson and some other new players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking they'll win 8 or 9 games this season but not more than that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They made some improvements on offense, but they also lost some quality players at wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true but I think a 8 or 9 game win season is very possible.What do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I figure that they'll win 6  games this season...maybe 7 but that's about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why are you thinking so few?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they did do some improvements on offense, but they didn't do anything to improve their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You do have a point as that could be a huge problem once again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I have no idea why they chose not to improve the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither as they had chances in the draft to pick up some youth and free agency had some good players available."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but for some reason they concentrated on offense again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So true as the fact that their defense was weak really cost them last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely as it doesn't do any good to lead the league in scoring if you are the worst in the league in points given up per game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sadly, it been that way for the last several years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no idea what Sean Payton is thinking as if he doesn't coach the team better this year, he'll be fired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am thinking the same way as he has had plenty of time to get the team to improve."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, the last few years haven't been great and I think that he's just not coaching material anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll have to see how this season goes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, if it goes poorly, he's going to be out of a coaching position."
