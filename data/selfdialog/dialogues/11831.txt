"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HI! Are you ready for the NFL football season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm ready. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm ready as well. Will you go to the Cardinals team practices before the season starts?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Those are open to the public, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. I'm not sure where the open practices will be this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'll be at University of Phoenix Stadium like last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh! I didn't go to them last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You probably thought the San Diego Chargers would stay in San Diego."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Should I go to the Chargers practices in Los Angeles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I've heard the actual Chargers games will be held in a soccer stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you plan to get season tickets for the Chargers games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard Chargers season tickets are already sold out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will the Chargers play the Cardinals this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I checked the schedule. The Chargers will not play the Cardinals, but the Los Angeles Rams will."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd hoped to see Philip Rivers and Antonio Gates."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You'll have to see them when the NFL games are broadcast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will you keep your Chargers jerseys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I burned the number 17 jersey, which is River's, at the protest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I may have to pick a new favorite NFL team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard the New England Patriots or Cleveland Browns are available."
