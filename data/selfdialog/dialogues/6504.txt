"__STAR_WARS__ Let's talk about The Force Awakens. Where does it fit?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean with respect to the other 6 films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's right. Where does it rank?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Let's take this piecemeal. First, it has to be better than the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Has to be better? All of the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first two prequels were a total disaster. The third was solid, but still far more full of cheese and CGI than The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Fair enough. So where does it rank with respect to everything else?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's harder. First, it simply can't be as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those are sacrosanct? Is it better than Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ultimately, it isn't. It's solid, but Return of the Jedi has such important scenes that it can't rise above."
