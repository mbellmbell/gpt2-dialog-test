"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Lifehouse?"
"__MUSIC__ I have yes!"
"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan?"
"__MUSIC__ I am actually a big fan, I have even met the band before."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That's awesome, where at?"
"__MUSIC__ They were actually the church band where my family went every Sunday when I was young."
"__MUSIC__ That is really cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it was before they got famous so I didn't really know how cool it was at the time."
"__MUSIC__ They have kind of faded away lately it seems."
"__MUSIC__ Well you certainly don't hear a lot about them."
"__MUSIC__ They kind of had their time in the lime light already."
"__MUSIC__ Its sad because I still think they could make great music."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like its been years since they have released an album."
"__MUSIC__ I think has been something like ten years since their last album?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a long time."
"__MUSIC__ I was a huge fan of their 'No Name Face' album, its probably one of my favorite albums of all time."
"__MUSIC__ I have to agree, I remember I loved that album so much I learned how to play the songs on guitar."
"__MUSIC__ That is cool, I've always wanted to learn guitar but I never have."
"__MUSIC__ Its pretty easy to learn, you can get their music in the form of 'guitar tabs' which are a simplified version of sheet music and learn that way."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to check it out, I really want to learn to play their songs."
