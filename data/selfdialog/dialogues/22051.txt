"__DISNEY__ Moana is something else, isn't it."
"__DISNEY__ Isn't it! I don't... totally know how to take the Pacific Islander thing, because that's not my culture so I don't know what they might be stomping all over, but as a movie it's just delightful."
"__DISNEY__ Yeaahh... now that you mention it. I wonder how all of that goes over."
"__DISNEY__ I mean. It's a Disney movie; it's going to be laced with all that neoliberal imperialist garbage, in the name of multiculturalism."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. And I'm not sure what culture, exactly, this is supposed to represent -- just a cross-section?"
"__DISNEY__ I dunno; a bunch of the proper names are familiar enough. Maui, Te Fiti (Tahiti)..."
"__DISNEY__ That's... curious. Does this work as sort of... a made-up origin legend for a bunch of existing mythology, like, I dunno, The Wind Waker?"
"__DISNEY__ Ohh, that's a comparison to make. But, I don't know and I haven't researched."
"__DISNEY__ Anyway, put a pin in that and... as a movie, it's so... it makes me feel so optimistic."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the character development -- that's probably the ticket. Moana feels like someone you can try to be, in your life."
