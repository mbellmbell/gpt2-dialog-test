"__MUSIC__ Hey, did you hear that Garth Brooks is coming to town?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry, no I didn't, I don't even know who Garth Brooks is."
"__MUSIC__ What?!?! He's only the greatest country music star ever."
"__MUSIC__ I doubt it if I have never heard of him"
"__MUSIC__ You have never heard the song, ' Friends in Low Places'? Or 'The Thunder Rolls?'"
"__MUSIC__ Well Yeah I've heard those songs, they are classics, but I didn't know who sang them."
"__MUSIC__ That is Garh Brooks!!"
"__MUSIC__ oh, I see."
"__MUSIC__ He may be an older country star, but he is still amazing"
"__MUSIC__ I really don't think hes bigger than some of the country stars today though."
"__MUSIC__ He is the biggest selling American solo artist of all time. He has sold more albums than Elvis. So I think you are wrong"
"__MUSIC__ He's sold more albums than Elvis? That's ridiculous"
"__MUSIC__ he has sold over 148 million albums. that is more than Elvis. The only band that has outsold him is the beatles. look at his wikipedia"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I really must be out of touch on my country music"
"__MUSIC__ Its ok. Stick With me and I will educate you"
"__MUSIC__ I guess so. When is this concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Its in October, We need to get tickets quickly though"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I guess we probably do"
"__MUSIC__ I will buy them and you can pay me back, deal?"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good."
