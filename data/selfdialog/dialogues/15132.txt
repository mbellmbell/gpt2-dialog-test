"__ACTION__ What was your favorite Matrix movie?"
"__ACTION__ The third one!"
"__ACTION__ You're joking!"
"__ACTION__ I actually am.  I would probably go with Part 2."
"__ACTION__ For me, the original was the best.  The gunfights were awesome in it."
"__ACTION__ Sure, but the second one had the freeway battle."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, that was probably the best set piece of the entire series."
"__ACTION__ It must have cost a fortune to film."
"__ACTION__ Well, I think they built their own freeway section to actually film it?"
"__ACTION__ Really?  That's incredible."
