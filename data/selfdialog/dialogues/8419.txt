"__BEATLES__ There was an article the other day about the top five songs on the Billboard chart for 35 years ago this week."
"__BEATLES__ Who was number one?"
"__BEATLES__ One of the Beatles, Paul McCartney, singing a duet with Stevie Wonder called 'Ebony and Ivory.'"
"__BEATLES__ That song was really popular."
"__BEATLES__ It was the longest song Stevie Wonder ever had at the top of the charts."
"__BEATLES__ Did he write the song?"
"__BEATLES__ No, Paul McCartney wrote it. It was also McCartney's longest song at the top of the charts since he had played with the Bealtes."
"__BEATLES__ I'm glad McCartney stayed in music after the Beatle's broke up."
"__BEATLES__ I know, it's nice to see people go on and keep doing what they love, instead of letting circumstances end things for them."
"__BEATLES__ It doesn't matter if it's not as successful as before, just that you are doing what you enjoy and you're good at."
