"__DISNEY__ I don't want to watch Disney movies tonight."
"__DISNEY__ Why not?"
"__DISNEY__ Because! Snow White is just a girl that sleeps, I don't want to watch something about a toad, and I hate the snow!"
"__DISNEY__ You should really give them a chance. They're more than just sleeping girls and animals."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, Mulan, for instance. She saves an entire kingdom by herself."
"__DISNEY__ Really? How?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, you'll have to watch it to find out."
"__DISNEY__ Fine. I guess we can watch Mulan. But nothing else!"
"__DISNEY__ Let's watch Mulan, then. At least you're giving it a chance."
