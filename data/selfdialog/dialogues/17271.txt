"__MOVIES__ Hey, look at this review in the New York Times! It's for a movie called 'The Big Sick.'"
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It looks like it's a romantic comedy, but updated for 2017."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds promising. What does the review say?"
"__MOVIES__ The main character is Pakistani-American, so it says there is plenty of cultural nuance and humor."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The review says Zoe Kazan."
"__MOVIES__ I love her! I loved that movie she did with Daniel Radcliffe."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Wow, look at this? The actor and his real wife based the story on their own relationship."
"__MOVIES__ Look--another article says his wife was actually in a coma!"
"__MOVIES__ And they based the movie on that?"
"__MOVIES__ The NPR article says that it helped her deal with what happened while she was in a coma."
"__MOVIES__ I bet that would be healing in a way."
"__MOVIES__ His wife in real life, and in the movie, are white girls. So there must have been some cultural tension there in the family."
"__MOVIES__ I think immigrant parents want their kids to say within their cultural group. But they also have to know it's a new generation."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Nanjiana, the actor, says in the interview, that his parents 'decided that their love for me was bigger than whatever sense of obligation.'"
"__MOVIES__ He talks about how his parents are still changing their perspectives--I bet that comes through in the movie too."
"__MOVIES__ I'm really curious to know more about his life before we see the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ It sounds a lot like what I've been through with my parents."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. Let's go to the movies!"
