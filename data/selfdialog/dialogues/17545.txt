"__MOVIES__ Any good movies you've seen lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, there haven't been a lot of good movies to come out."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of feel that way, too."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like every year there's a new superhero movie that people are dying to see."
"__MOVIES__ I also feel that way, it feels like a money grab sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's probably what it is, though I know Wonder Woman got great reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I've heard that too. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not yet. I've been meaning to fairly soon."
"__MOVIES__ I would like to see it, I have high hopes for it and I love what people have been saying about the way it's directed."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they would do more monster movies sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Don't they have a lot of horror movies that have monsters in them?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I wouldn't really say so. A lot of horror movies lately have been about murderers or dark realistic concepts."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you could be right. I'm not into horror movies really so I wouldn't know."
"__MOVIES__ The Babadook was technically a monster movie."
"__MOVIES__ Was that any good?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was great, but it's still kind of an older movie. It came out in 2014."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's still a new movie then, anything older than five years to me would be an old movie."
"__MOVIES__ If you say so. I just love that fear of something fantastical, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ I can understand that, it's a fun feeling."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I get a big thrill out of watching the characters try to survive something unreal."
