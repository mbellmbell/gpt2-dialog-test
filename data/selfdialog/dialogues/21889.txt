"__DISNEY__ Did you see Cinderella yet?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you talking the cartoon?"
"__DISNEY__ No, the newer movie that came out a few years back."
"__DISNEY__ Ah, yes, yes I did.  It was quite good!"
"__DISNEY__ I thought so too!  Loved the music in it."
"__DISNEY__ The costumes were really well done.  Her dress looked beautiful."
"__DISNEY__ I think her dress was pink, right?"
"__DISNEY__ No, at the ball it was blue."
"__DISNEY__ I might be confusing her with sleeping beauty."
"__DISNEY__ Probably so.  She's nothing like Aurora."
