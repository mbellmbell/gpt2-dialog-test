"__MUSIC__ What musicals have you seen?"
"__MUSIC__ In person, on TV, or movies?"
"__MUSIC__ All three, of course!"
"__MUSIC__ You're far too chipper for your own good. In person I've seen Jesus Christ Superstar once, The Book of Mormon twice, Pippin once, and Miss Saigon twice."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard great things about the Book of Mormon"
"__MUSIC__ The actual book is awful and hogwash. You know I hate real Mormons."
"__MUSIC__ I meant the musical..."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right, sorry. It's written by the guys from South Park and the music is a collaboration between them and the composer of Avenue Q."
"__MUSIC__ You haven't seen Avenue Q?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I've listened to it."
"__MUSIC__ What about TV and Movies?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't consider movies-with-music to be musicals. So no Disney."
"__MUSIC__ Gotcha."
"__MUSIC__ I've seen Cats, Rent, and all the NBC musicals they've done live."
"__MUSIC__ I love cats!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but I hate the musical."
"__MUSIC__ Why???"
"__MUSIC__ Because it's the most insanely stupid thing I've ever encountered."
"__MUSIC__ That's a bit much."
"__MUSIC__ No, there's no plot. The music is fine, but nothing happens."
