"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of any good horror movies coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ yeah, actually there are a lot of sequels to recent horror movies coming out. Movies that I thought were good."
"__MOVIES__ You never know, with sequels though."
"__MOVIES__ That is true, but there are plenty of originals too."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me the sequels first?"
"__MOVIES__ OK, based off this [picture I've seen on social media; purge 4, orphan 2, mama 2, wrong turn 7, lights out 2, saw 8, scream 5, jeepers creepers 3, annabelle 2, conjuring 3, insidious 4, and a few other older comebacks too."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, there's so many sequels and you said more?"
"__MOVIES__ Terminator vs. predator, cult of chucky, and there's a new Halloween movie too, also a remake of IT."
"__MOVIES__ What are some of the new originals?"
"__MOVIES__ The Nun, Heidi, phoenix forgotten, and......SLENDERMAN!!!"
"__MOVIES__ no way!!! a slenderman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I know right?"
"__MOVIES__ the remake of IT seems like it could be really good too. The previews for the Nun freaked me out as well."
"__MOVIES__ I also would like to recommend some movies I found while googling for other movies recently."
"__MOVIES__ Sure."
"__MOVIES__ I was watching trailers on youtube and found The pet; was a movie from a few decades ago that was remade last year and It looks like a pretty intense psychological thriller. There was actually a surprising amount of horror movies that received little to no recognition that looked really good."
"__MOVIES__ Anything REALLY DARK?"
"__MOVIES__ Like Human Centipede dark?"
"__MOVIES__ yeah!"
"__MOVIES__ I suggest the movie titled: A Serbian Film."
