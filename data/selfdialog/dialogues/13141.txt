"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ he only time he looked ok is when we were running uptempo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the very next game when he was told to run Bill O'Brien's offense, he was not good at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do give him credit for not turning the ball over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Here is stats since being a pro."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its nothing eye popping and nothing to write home to momma about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let me tell you, this signing is a Mike Devlin special as Giacomini played under him when he was with New York Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could he work out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We're about to find out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ However, according to Pro Football Focus, Giacomini is a below-average pass blocker like Clark, allowing four sacks and 44.3 grade off 266 snaps on the field in 2016 (which included just five starts)."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ PFF also notes that in 2015, Giacomini's last season as a full starter, allowed 54 quarterback pressures compared to 67 in 2016 for Clark."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overall, Giacomini seems to be more closer than an average pass blocker rather than Clark who is well below-average."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not to mention that he has been riddled with back injuries through last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 304-pound 31-year-old became available because the Jets cut him after last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i surely hope the Rookie pick up the playbook quick. Because this dude is just as bad as Clark. No thanks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Foreman is terrible in pass protection."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ he is not taking the starting job from L. Miller."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He will take snaps from Blue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ that's a possibility as well since Blue knows this offense better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ According to the Chron's Aaron Wilson, the Houston Texans have signed veteran tackle Breno Giacomini to a deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could he be the answer at right tackle?"
