"__MUSIC__ I need a duet to sing for an upcoming karaoke night."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, let me think for a minute. What type of music do you like to sing?"
"__MUSIC__ Basically anything without a super crazy vocal range."
"__MUSIC__ What about 'No Air' by Jordin Sparks and Chris Brown?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. I'm not really a huge Chris Brown after the huge Rihanna incident."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I forgot about that. That really made me lose a lot of respect for him."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I just can't listen to his music the same anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I feel that."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know of any other duets that might work>"
"__MUSIC__ Possibly 'A Whole New World' from Aladdin."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! That's actually perfect!"
"__MUSIC__ Yay, I'm glad I could help."
"__MUSIC__ It's a bit pitchy but I'll deal with it because I just love that song so much."
"__MUSIC__ It is a great song."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I can't believe I didn't think of it. It's one of my all time favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ Same here! I used to be absolutely obsessed with it when the movie first came out."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I was a little kid and would just sing it all the time."
"__MUSIC__ You'll have a lot of fun doing karaoke to it."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely will. It will take me right back to being a little kid again."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad I thought of it. Good luck!"
