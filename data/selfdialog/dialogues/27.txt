"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite boy band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ I love Nsync. I always had a huge crush on Lance."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that he's gay?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, but he's so dreamy."
"__MUSIC__ My parents let me listen to Nysnc but not Spice Girls."
"__MUSIC__ Why? Digital Getdown was definitely not great for a kid to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I think my mom just didn't like the message of 'if you want to be my lover, you gotta get with my friends'."
"__MUSIC__ That's actually a better message than a lot of boy bands had sometimes!"
"__MUSIC__ Right. I always thought so."
"__MUSIC__ Personally, I prefer the Backstreet Boys."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously? Mmmbop wasn't any better than Tearin Up My Heart."
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding me? Mmmbop was by Hanson, not BSB."
"__MUSIC__ Well then, who did Quit Playing Games?"
"__MUSIC__ That was BSB. I think Nick Carter was the lead on that one."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't his little brother famous too?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, his name is Aaron. He did some song about candy that was popular, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Nineties music was the best. I feel old but I can barely remember it."
"__MUSIC__ I'll never forget it, Imagine how our parents feel!"
"__MUSIC__ True. Their idea of a boyband was The Beatles and Herman's Hermits."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, and The Temptations!"
