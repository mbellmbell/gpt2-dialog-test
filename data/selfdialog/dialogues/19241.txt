"__MOVIES__ Did you see La La Land?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I never did, but I wanted to."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it, you should definitely see it. I thought it started a little slow, but by the end, I was really into it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'll try to see it then. I really like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone."
"__MOVIES__ I like them both, too, but especially Ryan!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, then, you probably saw Lars and the Real Girl."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't, actually, but I've heard a lot about it."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of my favorite movies. It's funny, but also serious in parts and very sweet."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good. I even have the DVD, so I'll have to watch it soon."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of favorite movies, I heard you haven't seen one of mine - The Shawshank Redemption."
"__MOVIES__ It's true, I haven't, but a friend got it for me and I've been meaning to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ You should. I think it's on most people's Top 10 List. I think it's in my Top 5."
"__MOVIES__ Was it really based on a book by Stephan King?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, not one of his longer books, but more like a novella. It's written so well and the movie is very faithful to the book."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ The two main stars are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman narrated the movie."
"__MOVIES__ He has a terrific voice for that."
"__MOVIES__ He does. It's a great story with great characters and great acting."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see it. I loved Tim Robbins in Bull Durham."
"__MOVIES__ Me, too, but this is a totally different character and he does a great job. This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over and over again and not get tired of it."
