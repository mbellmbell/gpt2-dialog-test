"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know the Bills haven't made the playoffs since Tom Brady was at Michigan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I knew it was quite a while. It is hard to win in the AFC East."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Patriots, Patriots! I remember when the Bills were near great. Four consecutive Superbowl appearances!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All losses.I think they should have won at least one of those."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Scott Norwood, the kicker, shanked a 48 yard fild goal.It would have beat Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least they got there four times. The Dolphins, just one appearance since the beginning of the Marino era. That, also, was a loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets are nearly as bad.They won their only SB when Namath called it against the Colts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just proves how dominant the Patriots are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember when the Pats went 1-15 under Rod Rust!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rust was a great defensive coach.He just was not the head coach type."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The best tackle any Patriot made before the Bill Era was John 'Bull' Bramlett tackling a fan who ran onto the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember.He really leveled him.Those were the days!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is amazing how the Patriots turned it around.It really started with the hiring of Chuck Fairbanks from Oklahoma"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He came in and they changed the culture.They should have won the Superbowl in the late 70s!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The ref, Ben Dreith, made a phantom holding call on Ray Hamilton. It won the game for the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that well.It still irks me!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, look at us now.Is it possible to be sick of winning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we are both old enough to remember Carl Garrett, Mike Taliferio, ad nauseum. They were lucky to win 4 games a year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I will take the present!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go Pats in 2017!"
