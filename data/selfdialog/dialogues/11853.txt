"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you were growing up, did you have a favorite NFL coach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think coaches are usually overrated. But I liked Tom Landry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember Tom Landry. He's the one that always wore a fedora hat. I don't remember what happened to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When Jerry Jones bought the team, he fired Tom Landry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must've made a lot of people mad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It did for a while, but Jerry Jones hired Jimmy Johnson and they started winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do people think Jimmy Johnson was the reason they started winning? I wonder what it was that he did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They drafted a bunch of young players, pretty much started from scratch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must've been when they hired Troy Aikman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they drafted a bunch of players around that time that went on to become Hall of Famers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember they beat the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that game, the Buffalo Bills went to four straight Super Bowls. They never could win one though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was that when Emmitt Smith was rushing for the Dallas Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Dallas drafted Emmitt Smith about the same time as Troy Aikman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they got Michael Irvin at the same time as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Troy Aikman, Emmett Smith, and Michael Irvin. Are they all in the Hall of Fame?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All three of them. Emmitt Smith was the last one to be inducted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Emma Smith, one of the greatest running backs ever. I seem to remember he played a few seasons in Arizona."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he went on to Arizona when he should've retired. He must've hated to stop playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haven't heard much about Emmitt Smith since he retired. Out of the three, the one I see the most is Troy Aikman as an announcer."
