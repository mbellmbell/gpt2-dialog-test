"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see the new Aliens movies tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Me either, I grew up watching the originals."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I still have the box set on VHS."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, I just have the dvds."
"__MOVIES__ The Original Alien still holds up after all these years."
"__MOVIES__ Sigourny Weaver was so good as Ripley."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when she battles the Alien mother in the second movie in the Robot lifting machine, what a brilliant fight scene."
"__MOVIES__ I almost forgot about that, man it was the best ending."
"__MOVIES__ She was nominated for an academy award for Aliens."
"__MOVIES__ i didn't know that, she's not in this new movie is she?"
"__MOVIES__ No, i don't think so."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know who directed Alien Covenant?"
"__MOVIES__ Scott Ridley"
"__MOVIES__ That's fantastic.  Didn't he direct the original too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I am excited to see what he does differently with this remake."
"__MOVIES__ From the trailers and pictures i have seen the aliens look like they did in the old movies."
"__MOVIES__ As long as they stick to the suspence and not just gore, this movie should be as scary."
"__MOVIES__ I hope so, I want to be as scared as I was when I watched the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I want to be hiding in my sweatshirt."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, i am gonna hide behind my tub of popcorn."
