"__MOVIES__ Is Jackie Chan still doing movies? I don't think I've seen him that Karate Kid remake."
"__MOVIES__ He's still acting. Most of his recent works have released in China first then in the US without much fanfare."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I didn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ You should check out Chinese Zodiac. That one was released in 2013 I think."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Something about stolen relics he has to find."
"__MOVIES__ It's action right? Lots of martial arts?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. I'll look into it."
"__MOVIES__ You might want to try Skiptrace too. It was released in 2016 in China."
"__MOVIES__ Is it in English?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course."
"__MOVIES__ It would be nice if they did another Rush Hour."
"__MOVIES__ With Chris Tucker?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I loved the first two movies. The last one wasn't as good."
"__MOVIES__ I remember hearing a rumor about there being a Rush Hour 4."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I hope it's true."
"__MOVIES__ Those guys are too old for that kind of action if you ask me."
"__MOVIES__ That could be the plot of the movie. Both Chris and Jackie are helping out a rookie cop and his or her partner."
"__MOVIES__ I'd like Chris' character to go to China this time and get caught up in Jackie's work, just for a change of scenery."
