"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL season is coming up soon!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right it is!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be a sleeper team this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a weird feeling that the Chargers are going to be a surprise"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely drafted players for Philip Rivers to utilize."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have to. He only has a few years left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's crazy that he's the only quarterback out of the main three from the draft to not have a ring"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who were the others again? Big Ben and Eli"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah those are the ones. It would be nice if he won a ring  finally"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but that defense is still kind of so-so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I doubt they will win it all, but I think they will grab a wild card spot"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will, but they will probably lose in the first round"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just so sad that Marlon McCree single-handedly stopped Rivers from winning that ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All he had to do was give himself up and it was a done deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those early 2000 Charger teams were amazing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Shaun Phillips and Merriman were completely unstoppable"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, then you had V-Jax and LT."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I miss watching LT dominate every time he touched the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just realized he never won a ring as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So many great chargers players may end up saying the same thing. Such a shame."
