"__DISNEY__ Did you like the Tarzan cartoon?"
"__DISNEY__ The one by Disney?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that one."
"__DISNEY__ It was okay.  I just didn't think that it was one of their best."
"__DISNEY__ Really?  I loved it."
"__DISNEY__ Well, it came out just a couple years after Hercules.  Hercules was much better."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I liked Hercules a lot better."
"__DISNEY__ I mean, the popularity from Hercules still wasn't up when they released Tarzan."
"__DISNEY__ Still, Tarzan was a totally different story."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, you're right.  It was much more heartwarming."
