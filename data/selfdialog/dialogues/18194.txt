"__MOVIES__ I watched The Great Wall last week."
"__MOVIES__ I wanted to see that but never got around to it."
"__MOVIES__ I was pretty disappointed with it."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Like how?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it just seemed to be rushed and you didn't really engage with the characters."
"__MOVIES__ I have noticed that the movie industry is more about rushing a movie out before they truly have a sense for what people want."
"__MOVIES__ I think a lot of it has to do with opening weekend revenues."
"__MOVIES__ Yes the bottom line is money."
"__MOVIES__ The movie was long and drawn out and too loud."
"__MOVIES__ That's how I felt about the last Transformers."
"__MOVIES__ Now that was a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ My family liked it but I didn't get into it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the others?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I had no problem with those."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it's just starting to play out and you're getting tired of the storyline."
"__MOVIES__ That could be it. I just want the movie industry to bring new and fresh movies."
"__MOVIES__ They have relied on sequels and existing stories for a while."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it doesn't take much to make a super hero movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, and you're likely going to have a lot of stories to tell."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and that seems like an uncreative way to make movies."
