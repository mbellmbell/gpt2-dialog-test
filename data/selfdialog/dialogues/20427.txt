"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the Wizard of Oz?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but not in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ That movie is really weird."
"__MOVIES__ Some of it use to scare me as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the guy hanging in the trees during the scene in the forest?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but they say it was just a bag of sand or something else hanging from a rope."
"__MOVIES__ Well, did you know Toto the dog was paid more than the munchkin actors?"
"__MOVIES__ What, that's insulting to those actors."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know what dance they do in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I know the scene, but what is the dance?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the 1939 latest dance craze, the jitterbug."
"__MOVIES__ Man, that movie is old."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad they haven't tried to do a complete remake of it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you know they will eventually."
"__MOVIES__ There are just some movies that don't need remakes."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that."
"__MOVIES__ They should just leave the Wizard of Oz alone."
"__MOVIES__ You know someone in Hollywood is pitching or has pitched remaking that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I really wish they would make new movies instead or remaking movies."
"__MOVIES__ It almost seems like Hollywood has run out of ideas."
