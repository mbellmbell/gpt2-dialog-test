"__MUSIC__ What did you think about what Tinashe said last week?"
"__MUSIC__ What did she say? And who's Tinashe again?"
"__MUSIC__ '2 On'... remember that song and Drake did a remix?"
"__MUSIC__ Ah, yes, her! What did she say?"
"__MUSIC__ She was like, she didn't get accepted by the Black community because she doesn't appear to be fully black."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! I didn't even remember her music."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I don't think anything of hers is memorable to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ It's apparent visually, that she's black. Is she bugging?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she's really not thinking about her quality of music."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! Especially with this competition."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Rihanna has bops, Ariana has hits..."
"__MUSIC__ ... and Tinashe has one-hit wonders."
"__MUSIC__ That's not nice! I think she's pretty talented actually."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? How so?"
"__MUSIC__ I know she's a trained dancer, but her voice is really nice actually."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can see what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ So sad she had to release such weak songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I would've never known that it was her song and not OVO's"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, maybe this will make her more hungry to drop more quality hits."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, I hope so."
