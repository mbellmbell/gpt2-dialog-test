"__ROCK__ So my parents went to a Pink Floyd concert tonight."
"__ROCK__ Actual Pink Floyd or a tribute band?"
"__ROCK__ Not sure.  I just know that they'll be home super late."
"__ROCK__ Pink Floyd is an interesting band for sure.  They sure indulged in some unusual activities."
"__ROCK__ I already know where you're going with that, but I doubt my parents will be interested."
"__ROCK__ I'm not knocking them.  I like listening to them in the background while I work on homework."
"__ROCK__ Really?  I didn't know that."
"__ROCK__ Yeah.  I like the instrumental stuff."
"__ROCK__ Sounds like we should have gone tonight instead of kicking around this place."
"__ROCK__ Not with your parents though.  I'm too cool for that."
