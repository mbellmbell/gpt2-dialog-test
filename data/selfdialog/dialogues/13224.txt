"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Chargers are going to win the west this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, the Raiders are by far the better team. I think they will win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chargers are healthy and Bosa going into his second year is going to be a beast on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think the Chargers can stay healthy though. Look at the Raiders with Carr at QB they are just too good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They aren't going to look that good when Bosa sacks Carr at least twice both games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're crazy! Also, the Chargers just moved to that tiny stadium in LA and most of their fan base jumped ship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will do better in a smaller place and those guys are hungry for a championship. They will have more than enough fans in LA trust me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chargers have been hungry and they always choke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm telling you, this is their year. Rivers finally has some protection from the line and great true receivers to throw to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Rivers deserves a super bowl ring I just don't think the Chargers are going to get him one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see where they're at mid-season, I really think you're going to be surprised. Rivers is going to get what he's worked so hard for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They aren't going to beat the Raiders though, they are just too tough. Look at that defense from last year they were beasts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Raiders are overrated and its going to show this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overrated? Youu must be joking. Did you see we signed Lynch in the off-season. Beastmode!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's old and should have retired. Hope he enjoys getting planted by Bosa and crew every game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You'll see Lynch is going to put up huge numbers and run all over everybody."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see it happening, not in this division. I think you're going to see Gordon put up bigger numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gordon got lucky last season. Do you not remember his rookie year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I remember. He was awesome last year and he's only going to get better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll just have to wait and see then."
