"__BEATLES__ Yes officer, I was visiting my friend Eleanor Rigby who lives on Penny Lane."
"__BEATLES__ That’s near the Beatles Strawberries Fields Forever am I correct?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, we had tickets for the Magic Mystery Tour but we encountered Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Heart’s gang."
"__BEATLES__ And then what happened?"
"__BEATLES__ They said they were Fixing A Hole for Martha My Dear?"
"__BEATLES__ And that’s when all Helter Skelter broke out?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, The Girl Sexy Sadie said they started working on the hole the night before"
"__BEATLES__ The office thought silently to himself before he spoke..."
"__BEATLES__ And Your Bird Can Sing right? So how many of the Beatles songs do you think the two of us have mentioned?"
"__BEATLES__ No Reply. The End."
