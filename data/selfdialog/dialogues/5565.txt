"__STAR_WARS__ How do you feel about the new Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're alright, I guess. Although I've only seen the Force Awakens and not Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ How'd you like the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was ok. I am more of a fan of the very first Star Wars trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the characters and the new storyline at all?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was interesting to see what happens after Darth Vader was killed and how there's pretty much another Darth Vader in training."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, it was such a surprise when I found out Kylo Ren was Han and Leia's kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, I would have never guessed that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I felt like that actor did a good job though of playing that part."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, I was kind of skeptical at first, but I really enjoyed his performance."
