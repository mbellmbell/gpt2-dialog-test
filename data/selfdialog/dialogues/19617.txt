"__MOVIES__ Let me ask you, have you seen any great documentaries lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I know just the one for you to see. It's about Anthony Weiner."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really? That dude's a trip."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right? This documentary is fascinating, because it's a true inside look at a campaign falling apart at the seams."
"__MOVIES__ How did they get that kind of access?"
"__MOVIES__ So what happened was Weiner brought in this documentary to film what he thought was going to be his big comeback."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it almost was!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was way out in front of the polls in the mayor's race."
"__MOVIES__ So they were there for the downfall."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. When the sexting scandal broke again, this documentary film crew was already there."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man. His wife really stuck it out, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, honestly, she was the star of the film. She's always giving Anthony these looks like, how did I get stuck with you?"
"__MOVIES__ It's funny how this stuff can be so fascinating when you know how it ends."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! I followed the story as it unfolded pretty closely. It was an epic implosion."
"__MOVIES__ What makes it such a great documentary though?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they had nearly unprecedented access to a campaign in upheaval and despair. You actually see the wheels coming off in real time."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy."
"__MOVIES__ So you want to watch it this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I go, let's do it! Then we can watch All the President's Men too!"
"__MOVIES__ Poly Sci movie marathon!"
