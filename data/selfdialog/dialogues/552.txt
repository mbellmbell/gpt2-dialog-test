"__MUSIC__ Ever heard of Trance music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's like Techno but slower."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I've heard of that. I don't like it much though."
"__MUSIC__ Well it's a lot different. You should listen to some of it sometime."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, cool. Anyone you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I recommend checking out Temple One and Adam Nickey."
"__MUSIC__ It must be bigger in Europe than the US I guess?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it's massive over in Europe."
"__MUSIC__ I can imagine. A big nightclub scene and raves?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely! People like to party a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Not like here though?"
"__MUSIC__ No, as in go out and dance in clubs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, here when people party they go over a friends house or something."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, it's totally different. I was in Russia once and they also dig their Trance music."
"__MUSIC__ Man, over here when you see cars go by you can hear rock, country and many other genres. I bet it's different in Russia?"
"__MUSIC__ You can hear it coming out of the cars. Trance that is and other electronic music. It's actually refreshing."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'll plan a trip to Europe sometime just to see how different the music scene is."
"__MUSIC__ You really should. You won't regret it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure it'll be awesome!"
