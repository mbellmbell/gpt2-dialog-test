"__MOVIES__ Are you excited to watch the upcoming star wars film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah what's it called? The Last Jedi?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's the one, what do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I hope it has more original content than force awakens."
"__MOVIES__ Sure; I'm sure it will."
"__MOVIES__ Because Force Awakens was almost the same as A new hope"
"__MOVIES__ That's what everyone says."
"__MOVIES__ I know they did it to have the same kind of story for a new generation."
"__MOVIES__ But I agree they could have put more original content."
"__MOVIES__ What would be your favorite star wars film then?"
"__MOVIES__ Empire strikes back for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Not return of the jedi?"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, Empire had a lot more dark undertones and a uncertain ending."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget about the introduction of Yoda"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah a classic character was established after seeing him."
"__MOVIES__ And the scenes in Cloud City."
"__MOVIES__ Where Han Solo gets stuck into carbonite."
"__MOVIES__ And the snow battles."
"__MOVIES__ SO many classic scenes."
"__MOVIES__ The AT-AT has to be my favorite vehicle."
