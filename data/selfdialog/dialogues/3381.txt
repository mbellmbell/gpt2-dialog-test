"__MUSIC__ Did you go to the Wind Symphony concert last night?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! I always go."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for supporting us!"
"__MUSIC__ No problem, I love the kids at this school."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think of the Maslanka Symphony?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, you all played it super well, but I hate his music passionately."
"__MUSIC__ Really? It's deep and religious."
"__MUSIC__ I get that, but it doesn't mean it's good music."
"__MUSIC__ What was wrong with it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, his music has no true structure."
"__MUSIC__ Sure it is, it's theme-and-variations."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of. His music is very ADD, and there are other issues as well."
"__MUSIC__ What's wrong with that piece specifically?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's too in-your-face sectional theme-and-variations. There's no subltety."
"__MUSIC__ Anything else?"
"__MUSIC__ The clarinets blowing on their mouthpieces in the middle made no sense. It was 'weird for the sake of weird'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wasn't a fan of that. But what about the brass?"
"__MUSIC__ The brass part was great, I loved it, but of course it was just a slow major scale."
"__MUSIC__ Did you meet him after the concert."
"__MUSIC__ I've met him before, actually, so I left."
