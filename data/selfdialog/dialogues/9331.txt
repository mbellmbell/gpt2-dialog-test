"__BASEBALL__ Who were the Golden Glove winnders on the Giants for 2016?"
"__BASEBALL__ They got THREE!  Buster Posey (catcher), Joe Panik (second base) and Brandon Crawford (shortstop)."
"__BASEBALL__ Is Brandon Crawford off the DL?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, he's back.  He was gone for a while because of bereavement leave for his sister-in-law.  He injured himself right around the same time.  But he's back."
"__BASEBALL__ Are there any other Giants on the DL right now?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Giants have been having a lot of back luck with this.  Madison Bumgarner of course.  But he should be back in June."
"__BASEBALL__ Anyone else?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, Mark Melancon, their new closer, has a right pronator strain.  He just returned and saved the game against the Cardinals on May 19."
"__BASEBALL__ Michael Morse is back, too.  In his first at-bat of 2017, he hit a home run off of Pedro Baez of the Dodgers."
"__BASEBALL__ He was pinch hitting.  Good to see him back."
"__BASEBALL__ Nunez is a base-stealing king.  How many bases has he stolen so far this 2017 season?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's stolen eleven so far.  He has a career number of 116.  Can't turn your back on him."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't understand something.  What is the 'infield fly rule'?"
"__BASEBALL__ Wikipedia defines it this way:  'The umpire's declaration of an infield fly means that the batter is out (and all force plays are removed) regardless of whether the ball is caught. '"
"__BASEBALL__ So if the defense doesn't catch the ball, it doesn't matter?"
"__BASEBALL__ Kind of.  It's up to the umpire.  He has to make a determination based on what he thinks is the 'ordinary effort' to catch the ball."
"__BASEBALL__ So if, say, a short-stop should catch a batted ball easily but he lets it slip through his mitt, the umpire can invoke the rule because the short stop should've caught the fly ball?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's up to the umpire's discretion.  It's why they're trained and go to umpire school, I guess.  Makes sense."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, what's 'ordinary effort'?  Is there some criterion or is it just whether the umpire is having a lousy day?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, there are criteria.  Like weather, lighting, abilities of the player(s) involved, etc.  It's not as arbitrary as it might sound."
