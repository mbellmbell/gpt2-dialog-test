"__BEATLES__ Were you ever able to go to a Beatles' concert when they first came to America?"
"__BEATLES__ No, but that would be quite a memory to see them at that time period. The earlier songs are the best."
"__BEATLES__ I really liked P.S. I Love You and Do You Want to Know A Secret."
"__BEATLES__ Do You want to Know A Secret was one of the few earlier songs sung by George Harrison."
"__BEATLES__ Their earlier songs were so optimistic and joyful.  Why do you think they were so popular at that time?"
"__BEATLES__ I think that there were so many Baby Boomers coming of age, that they just fell in line when it came to the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles really worked well together in the beginning. Love Me Do and Please, Please Me harmonies were so addictive to listen too."
"__BEATLES__ I think I Saw Her Standing There just epitomizes the earlier songs -- full of energy and the great guitar of George Harrison."
"__BEATLES__ These early songs really targeted the teenage girl audience.  I recall all the screaming and fainting when they sang!"
"__BEATLES__ Yes. The first line of If I Fell In Love With You just seemed so personal and the women loved it!"
