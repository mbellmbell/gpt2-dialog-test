"__BASKETBALL__ Did you watch the game between the Celtics and Wizards last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course! It was the only NBA game on last night."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, that's right.  All the other series are decided."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  It was a great game though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you think the Wizards would be able to pull it out?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It was really looking bad for them at the end there.  The Celtics had the lead."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree.  I thought the Wizards season was over at that point."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, it was some extremely clutch basketball by them at the end of the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ John Wall is just an amazing player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed.  He hit the game winner."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think Wall gets the recognition he deserves like other point guards."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed.  It's all about Harden and Westbrook this season, but Wall might be a more complete pure point guard."
"__BASKETBALL__ Even in this series, it's mostly been about Isaiah Thomas."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean that's fair, Thomas has been absolutely amazing."
"__BASKETBALL__ But so has Wall, right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, both have been playing some amazing basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, so what do you think happens in Game 7?"
"__BASKETBALL__ You have to go with the home team, especially in Boston.  All that history!"
"__BASKETBALL__ That being said, Game 7s are always a bit of a crapshoot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed.  All I know is I will be watching!"
