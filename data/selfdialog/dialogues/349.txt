"__MUSIC__ Hey! What's your favorite song on the Billboard music charts right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably the song, 'Airplay' by Gainer."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of that song! I wish we could see more pop music on the top charts, though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah? What type of pop music would you like to see top the charts more?"
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking maybe some more Selena Gomez or Demi Lovato."
"__MUSIC__ They're really great musical artists! I've been listening to a lot of their stuff lately."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Demi song?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely Neon Lights, she really brought her A game in that one!"
"__MUSIC__ I absolutely love that song. The lyrics along with the music video were both amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree! And as for Selena, did you hear that she is dating fellow R&B and pop star The Weeknd?"
"__MUSIC__ I did hear about that! Imagine if they released a duo together?"
"__MUSIC__ Now that is a song I would really love to listen to!"
"__MUSIC__ The two of their voices mixed with their unique personalities would create the perfect combination for a great hit."
"__MUSIC__ I bet it would top the charts for sure!"
"__MUSIC__ I totally think you're right. They're styles would be perfect for a musical release that would stay at number one for awhile."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if their record labels would let them collaborate together even?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure they would. The money that song would rake in would be amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of R&B artists, what do you think of Bruno Mars' new hits?"
"__MUSIC__ I like them, but they're a bit too old fashioned for my taste."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, I liked it better when he had more of a modern edge on his singles."
