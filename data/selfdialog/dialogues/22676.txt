"__DISNEY__ We watched Disney's Mary Poppins last night.  Ever see it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but way back in the day!"
"__DISNEY__ Sounds like you liked it too?"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely, especially the music. 'A Spoonful of Sugar' is my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, cute.  I like 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.'"
"__DISNEY__ That's a mouthful.  I guess the cartoon animation was new at the time."
"__DISNEY__ I don't remember other movies with that."
"__DISNEY__ I wanted to be Mary Poppins for a while."
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha! I see what you mean though."
"__DISNEY__ She was practically perfect."
