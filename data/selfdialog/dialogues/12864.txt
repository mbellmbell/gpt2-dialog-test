"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football season is here are you excited as I am?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yes...I've been waiting since January.I know my Atlanta Falcon's 'Dirty Birds' will win the Superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only in your dreams my friend, they don't stand a chance against the Saints!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Please we have dominated the Saints for the past two years! Who Dat! They're nobody."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what your hoping, but the Saints will run over the Falcons like a Mack truck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not with the Matt Ryan and Julio Jones on the field think again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan? He was a one time show not again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man you crazy, the Saints have no answer for us!"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure they did, that is why the Patriots won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least we made it to the SuperBowl, where were the Saints?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We under performed last season which happens sometimes with many teams. The important thing is how you rebound and the Saints will watch and learn."
