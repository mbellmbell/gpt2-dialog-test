"__HORROR__ Is there any movie you saw with your parents but instantly regretted?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, Titanic for me."
"__HORROR__ Why's that?"
"__HORROR__ Well, it was my first topless scene and I was 13. My dad said I was very annoying on the way home."
"__HORROR__ Ha, nice job."
"__HORROR__ Thanks. You?"
"__HORROR__ American Pie. The apple pie scene was pretty bad."
"__HORROR__ The webcam scene is far worse."
"__HORROR__ True. But at least he put a note on the apple pie at home."
"__HORROR__ Ha, I'd love to see that."
