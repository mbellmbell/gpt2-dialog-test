"__ROCK__ I just found my old Soundgarden CDs."
"__ROCK__ Oh wow. You still have those?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I looked for them after Chris Cornell died. Were you into Soundgarden or Temple of the Dog?"
"__ROCK__ I liked them both. I was more of a Nirvana and Pixies fan at the time."
"__ROCK__ Oh I love Nirvana. What's your favorite album."
"__ROCK__ Nevermind, of course! That album is a classic!"
"__ROCK__ Yeah but some of the earlier stuff is good and In Utero was pretty good too."
"__ROCK__ Yeah. I was just reading a Spin article where Kurt Cobain was placed as one of the top 100 guitarists of all time."
"__ROCK__ Hm, yeah I'd say so. He didn't shred all that much but the songs were good."
"__ROCK__ Kim from Soundgarden was also on the list of top guitarists. I miss 90s rock!"
