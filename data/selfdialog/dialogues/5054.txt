"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So what did you think about Fast & Furious 7 ?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's the one where Paul Walker was still alive right ?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea he was able to act for some of the movie, his brother had to do the rest with the help of CGI."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wow, I couldn't even tell that it wasn't Paul himself acting."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, the movie was done so well a long with the outstanding acting from the crew."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yep, so who was you're favorite character in the movie ?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well if i'm being honest it would be Paul."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me too, it's sad he passed away."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you think about their decision about containing the series ?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think that it was a great spot to stop at in the story-line and with Paul gone,but we'll have to see how it goes."
