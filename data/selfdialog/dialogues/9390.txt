"__BASEBALL__ Who is the best center fielder of all time?"
"__BASEBALL__ Mickey Mantle."
"__BASEBALL__ I was thinking it'd have to be him or Willie Mays."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right, that's a coin flip."
"__BASEBALL__ I'd even give the edge to Mays because he was a little better with the glove."
"__BASEBALL__ Both were great. Mays had the legs though."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, that's a common mistake people make. Mantle was actually the faster of the two, but Mays stole more bases in part to Mantle's injuries."
"__BASEBALL__ We can throw Ty Cobb into the mix too."
"__BASEBALL__ Another good one."
"__BASEBALL__ What about best CF for modern times?"
"__BASEBALL__ That's a little easier probably."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe have to go with Trout since he's very similar to a modern Mantle."
"__BASEBALL__ Trout is a machine, but still early in his career."
"__BASEBALL__ Then I think you have to go with Griffey without an argument."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, you're right I can't think of anyone close to Griff in the past 50 years."
"__BASEBALL__ You mean Andy Van Slyke isn't close?"
"__BASEBALL__ Haha. Good player but noooooo."
"__BASEBALL__ Kirby Puckett and Beltran for modern guys, but they're not Griffey."
"__BASEBALL__ Always forget about Kirby, if he didn't have the eye thing he might have his numbers would have been even better."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that's a shame it got cut short."
