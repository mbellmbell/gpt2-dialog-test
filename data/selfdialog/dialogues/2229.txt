"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the band Wintergaten?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't. What are they like?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they're German, but they do all kinds of interesting music using machines."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ They have this one song that's really popular on Youtube called Marble Machine."
"__MUSIC__ Is it actually about a marble machine?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, in fact. The guy built this machine that uses thousands of metal marbles to play a song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's really cool. What does the song sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ The machine uses a glockenspiel for most of the stuff, but it also has a bass and drums built in."
"__MUSIC__ That's very neat. Are all the songs like that?"
"__MUSIC__ They only have the one song that uses that complicated of a machine, but other songs are similar."
"__MUSIC__ How are they similar?"
"__MUSIC__ There's another song that uses a small machine that plays a music box."
"__MUSIC__ Very cool. It sounds like the music is really relaxing."
"__MUSIC__ It definitely can be. They choose a lot of tasteful sounds in their music."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of the other instruments they use?"
"__MUSIC__ They use a typewriter for some of the percussion bits."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I would have never thought of a typewriter as an instrument."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the main guy also has an electric violin type synthesizer he built himself."
"__MUSIC__ Very wild, I'll definitely look them up online."
