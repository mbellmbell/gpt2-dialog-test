"__MOVIES__ Are you into really weird movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, why do you ask?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just saw one that was the weirdest I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ What is the name of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called Naked Lunch, ever seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't, What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is about an exterminator in the 1950's who starts injecting bug spray."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that sounds pretty nasty."
"__MOVIES__ It is, and it gets even weirder."
"__MOVIES__ What happens to him after he injects bug spray?"
"__MOVIES__ He basically starts having really vivid hallucinations."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of hallucinations?"
"__MOVIES__ At first, he sees giant cockroaches, and typewriters turning into cockroaches."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that's pretty freaky."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it gets even weirder."
"__MOVIES__ What happens later in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he meets an alien in a bar."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, wow this is the weirdest movie I have heard of."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he just pretty much loses his mind."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like it, I will have to check it out."
