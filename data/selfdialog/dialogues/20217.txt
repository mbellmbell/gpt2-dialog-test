"__MOVIES__ I see To Kill a Mockingbird is in your Netflix queue."
"__MOVIES__ So it is! I've already watched it but I might watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was great. Have you read the book?"
"__MOVIES__ I have not. I'm guessing the book was better."
"__MOVIES__ Overall yeah. The things I like about the movie though don't really apply to the book."
"__MOVIES__ What things?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the things I appreciated about the movie were the music, photography and acting."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, yeah you don't get that in the book."
"__MOVIES__ The book I thought was hilarious but the movie was so serious."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everything I'd heard about it sounded so depressing, but the book was funny in a very natural way."
"__MOVIES__ I never would have guessed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't like books where you can tell the author tried to sneak in jokes even if it doesn't make sense in context. The humor in the book was right in line with how the characters were and it was just humourous in how they were, not in what they said, telling jokes and such."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool. No humour in the movie though?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it got really disappointing about half way through and then after that I just didn't know what the point was."
"__MOVIES__ But you're always complaining about how movies turn out unrealistically happy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and this movie probably is more realistic than most, but it was still surprising and sad when Tom died."
"__MOVIES__ You can't always have everything you want."
"__MOVIES__ I've accepted it now and take the movie as it is."
