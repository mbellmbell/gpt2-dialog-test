"__MUSIC__ I just saw Citizen Cope live."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not familiar with them--is it one musician or a band?"
"__MUSIC__ It's one guy, but I think he's been playing with the same backup musicians for years."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music does he play?"
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to describe. It's very urban sounding and has all kinds of different influences--blues, soul. He was busker before he got a record deal, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. I've never heard of him. Has he had any big hits?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. He's really great, though. No one else sounds like him. His music is very atmospheric. I think some of his songs have been in movie soundtracks."
"__MUSIC__ How was he live? Was that the first time you'd seen him?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and he was exactly the way I hoped he'd be--very authentic. You could tell that the crowd was full of true fans. He's got a lot of heart, and it shows."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, his lyrics are full of humanity, and he expresses a lot of gratitude for his fans. I think he actually turned away from a major label so he could have more independence."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I should check him out."
"__MUSIC__ You definitely should. Highly recommended."
"__MUSIC__ Any album in particular?"
"__MUSIC__ They're all good. Start with the first one--Citizen Cope. I think he may have had an earlier one, but I'm not sure it's available."
"__MUSIC__ How did you first hear about him?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a friend who's a music critic. He turned me onto him years ago. He said there wasn't a single false note on that first album, and he was right."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's high praise."
"__MUSIC__ It's well deserved. And I've liked all his other albums, too."
"__MUSIC__ I'll definitely check him out."
