"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of Panic! At The Disco lately, I really dig them."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard too many of their songs, but what I have heard, I really like."
"__MUSIC__ They have a super unique sound, I've never heard anything like them."
"__MUSIC__ Me either."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know they started out as a Blink 182 cover band?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I had no idea!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, its a bit ironic, because they are so much better than Blink 182."
"__MUSIC__ I can totally agree with you on that."
"__MUSIC__ Who have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of old pop punk albums. I guess I'm on a nostalgia kick."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Alkaline Trio, The Artaris, and Digger, mostly."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow Digger, its been a long time since I've heard them!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I found the album when I was moving and haven't stopped listening to it since."
"__MUSIC__ I miss when pop punk used to be really good."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I remember when Alkaline Trio first came out, I was totally blown away."
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe with Trump as our new president, we'll see a resurgence of good punk rock music."
"__MUSIC__ What makes you think that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's what punk is about, right? Fighting the establishment, tearing down the government, and so on."
"__MUSIC__ You do have a good point there. Hopefully, you're right!"
