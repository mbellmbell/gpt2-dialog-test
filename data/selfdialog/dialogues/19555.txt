"__MOVIES__ I wonder what movie Josh picked for tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, what sort of things does he usually bring."
"__MOVIES__ It's been a mix. Last time it was the remake of The Italian Job."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I've seen that."
"__MOVIES__ There are a lot of mini-coopers. You'd remember it if you had."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Okay. So it could be a heist."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. But then the time before, he brought The Notebook."
"__MOVIES__ The Notebook?!"
"__MOVIES__ He absolutely loves that movie. He just likes chick flicks in general."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Last time he had to fight to get to watch Steel Magnolias."
"__MOVIES__ I mean. Steel Magnolias is a fun movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's fun and then it's sad."
"__MOVIES__ So it really could be anything that he'll bring."
"__MOVIES__ I hope it's something fun. I could use a laugh today."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I could bring a backup?"
"__MOVIES__ What did you have in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe Galaxy Quest? With Tim Allen and Alan Rickman?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd love that!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll pack it, just in case."
