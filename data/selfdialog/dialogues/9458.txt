"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Dodger game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah. Kershaw was pitching. I never miss the game when he pitches."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. I feel the same way. But I thought he looked off last night."
"__BASEBALL__ I didn't. Why do you say that? They won."
"__BASEBALL__ I know but his fastball was missing bigtime."
"__BASEBALL__ But they were swinging at it anyway. I guess they just think it is going to be in there all the time."
"__BASEBALL__ The only reason they won was that the big bats were working. I couldn't believe how the game ended."
"__BASEBALL__ I missed that...my phone rang and I forgot to pause it. But I heard about it on Sports Center this morning."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, it was the bottom of the ninth and they were only winning by 2. Don't you know the Rockies get a single putting a man on 1st base. Then the closer walks a guy. Now a guy on first and second."
"__BASEBALL__ Then what happened? How many outs were there?"
"__BASEBALL__ There were 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth and the count is 3 and 2."
"__BASEBALL__ You've got to be kidding."
"__BASEBALL__ No way...with 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth, the guy lines one into left field and the players take off running."
"__BASEBALL__ Who was on base?"
"__BASEBALL__ Two of the Rockies best runners."
"__BASEBALL__ What happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ The first runner scores, the score is now 3-2."
"__BASEBALL__ I bet the place was going wild."
"__BASEBALL__ It was...until the second runner was thrown out at home! The throw from the outfield was perfect."
"__BASEBALL__ I could kick myself for not seeing that."
