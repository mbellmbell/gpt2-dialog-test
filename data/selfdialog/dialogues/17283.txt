"__MOVIES__ What do you think about Director Kevin Smith?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure I've seen one of his films in awhile."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, his latest movies like Yoga Hosers have been strange, but still pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ OK - Johnny Depp's daughter is in that film, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Depp is also in it!"
"__MOVIES__ Really?   I don't remember him in the advertisements."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he plays a character with a funny nose in all those movies."
"__MOVIES__ All?     He appeared in some other Smith films?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the current series includes at least a scene or two with Depp in each one."
"__MOVIES__ Wow!     That's news to me!"
"__MOVIES__ What about his older movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I remember that black and White One."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Clerks was his first movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's it.     Isn't there some story behind it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he paid for it himself, and sold his stuff to make it."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool.     It shows determination."
"__MOVIES__ Not just determination, but it made a career!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that.       Which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the one with Ben Affleck and the cute blonde lead.    Chasing Amy."
"__MOVIES__ That love story one?     Geeky and with a cute girl?    I am in."
