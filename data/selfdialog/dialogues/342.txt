"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Jay-Z Album?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Reasonable Doubt. You?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Reasonable Doubt. Any others, and do you think he's declined over the years?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably The Blueprint. And I can say that his old music is better than the new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. But I can understand that he's a family man now."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, but still gotta feed the family through those quality rhymes."
"__MUSIC__ I'm wondering how 4:44 will sound like."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, those ads have been everywhere..."
"__MUSIC__ I'm just really waiting to see how the production turns out."
"__MUSIC__ Right, hopefully it won't be like the Blueprint 3."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't like the production on BP3?"
"__MUSIC__ I loved it, just didn't love the lyrical content..."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I see. Yes, you're right with that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, BP3 was weak. Listen to it, then listen to Reasonable Doubt and you'll see..."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I see your point. Think we'll get a feature from the twins?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, I hope so."
"__MUSIC__ I know they're rolling in dough already."
"__MUSIC__ Both parents millionaires and billionaires!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's unbelievable"
"__MUSIC__ Funny how rap can really have you stacking money like that!"
