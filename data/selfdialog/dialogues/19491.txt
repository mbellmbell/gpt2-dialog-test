"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite 80s movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The first movie that came to mind was Dirty Dancing!"
"__MOVIES__ I love Dirty Dancing!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I must have watched that like 100 times in the 80s and then 100 times since!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, I watch it every time it comes on TV. I can't help it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I love all the dancing and the corniness of it. I think Patrick Swayze was so hot!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I also like him in Ghost."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah that was good. Whoopi Goldberg was so good in that."
"__MOVIES__ She's still funny! What movies is Demi Moore in these days?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea. The last film I saw her in was G.I. Jane back in the 90s."
"__MOVIES__ I never saw that one, was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, actually, it was pretty good. And I am not a huge fan of army type movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so you haven't seen American Sniper or Hurt Locker?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. I would rather watch something weird like Birdman."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I never saw that. I heard it was good though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the cast was really good. Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Naomi Watts were really good."
"__MOVIES__ I like Edward Norton, he's always great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he hasn't been in anything quite as good as American History X or Fight Club though."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't he in something else?"
"__MOVIES__ I vaguely remember that he was in The Illusionist. I didn't watch it, though."
