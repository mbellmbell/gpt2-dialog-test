"__DISNEY__ Did you like the original Beauty and the Beast or the live-action version better?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't seen the live-action version, so I like the original best."
"__DISNEY__ I like both of them a lot, but I agree, the original is my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I love all of the characters in it, especially Lumiere and Cogsworth."
"__DISNEY__ I think that Gaston and LeFou are pretty funny, too, even if Gaston is a little scary."
"__DISNEY__ Belle definitely didn't belong with someone as bad as Gaston, even if he was entertaining!"
"__DISNEY__ Gaston never would have fought off wolves for her like Beast did."
"__DISNEY__ I was so worried that Beast would get killed when he was fighting the wolves!"
"__DISNEY__ I was even more worried when he fought Gaston at the end."
"__DISNEY__ I am so glad Beast was okay, he ended up being a good guy after all."
