"__HORROR__ Have you ever seen The Ring?"
"__HORROR__ Yes I have and it was terrifying!"
"__HORROR__ I couldn't even look at a vhs tape after watching that movie."
"__HORROR__ Same here! I was afraid that watching the video within the movie might put me in danger too."
"__HORROR__ That movie freaked a lot of people out. The sequel wasn't all that great."
"__HORROR__ That's true, even with Naomi Watts in it again it still fell short."
"__HORROR__ Have you seen the new version?"
"__HORROR__ I have and I wish I could get the time back that I spent on it."
"__HORROR__ Me too, it was pretty bad. I love when the girl Samara steps out of the tv screen though."
"__HORROR__ That never gets old to me. I always wonder though, why don't they just pull the plug?"
