"__MUSIC__ Kendrick is one of the new best rappers out right now."
"__MUSIC__ I agree hes very lyrical and one of the best to do it."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what his next move is going to be."
"__MUSIC__ After loyalty came out I'm not really sure if he's got to do much more."
"__MUSIC__ Someone else who's really stepping up is J cole."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I wasn't sure if he was any good."
"__MUSIC__ J Cole is definately one of the best out as well. 2014 Forest Hills Drive was a classic."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to give that album a listen when I got some time."
"__MUSIC__ You have to! I think it really defines the kind of experience he has in music."
"__MUSIC__ But is he better than Kendrick?"
"__MUSIC__ No I don't think many people are, but that doesn't mean hes not great still."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that is true. Who would you say he raps similiar to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well he said himself he was influenced by Nas and even has a track about him."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? Nas actually thinks this guy is good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. The song 'Let Nas Down' was about his interactions with him and wanting to strive in music."
"__MUSIC__ Wow thats interesting and really makes we want to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and after you listen to that album you can head to his older stuff which is also good."
"__MUSIC__ Which one should I pick up?"
"__MUSIC__ Cole World : Sildeline Story is his first so I'd start there."
"__MUSIC__ Alright cool! Thanks for that."
