"__POP__ Uh no, who is that by?"
"__POP__ Daddy Yankee, some other Latin artist, and Jusitn Bieber."

"__POP__ He sang that Gasolina song.  Also, Rompe."
"__POP__ Yeah, I still don't know who he is."

"__POP__ I've heard it, I'm not crazy about it."
"__POP__ This song taught me what despasito means."
