"__ICEHOCKEY__ What do you think about the Red Wings this year?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Datsyuk's departure doesn't bode well, but we'll see what happens."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well they're supposed to build the new stadium!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that will be cool.  It's going to be called the Olympia right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yep.  All shiny and new.  Big time development down there planned by the Mayor."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's cool.  How good is this new guy Nielsen they're bringing in?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He's fast and he's a good shooter, we've already got some big guys in there as you know."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think Franzen is the biggest enforcer we have right now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sheesh, I used to love Darren McCarty, he used to majorly enforce back in the day!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, he was cool to.  I saw him at Kid Rock's New Years Eve party smoking bud with the Kidster himself!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Amazing.  Good thing the police don't patrol the inside of clubs!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, really.  I'm glad they're still a good team and made the playoffs last season."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too.  Hopefully they can be number one again."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that would be cool.  Respect Detroit!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, lol.  As long as the Illitch family owns the Wings, there's enough money to get some good players!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah really.  It's so weird how these young guys have growth spurts after they're signed!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, one of the young guys grew like two inches since they signed him up!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I guess that's what happens when they draft kids who are just 18 years old!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, haha!  Then they've got guys who are almost 40 in the same team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well I guess they can be the ones with the steady hand, to guide the younger guys."
