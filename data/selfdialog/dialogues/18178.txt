"__MOVIES__ There are some pretty bad movies out there this year."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that always the case? Enterprising filmmakers have been cranking out horrible stuff for decades."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know of any films that are so bad they're good?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure. The one that comes immediately to mind is Plan 9 From Outer Space by Ed Wood."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, that name is familiar...there was a movie about him some years back, with Johnny Depp. I didn't see it though."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was the movie Ed Wood. I think Depp really captured the guy."
"__MOVIES__ So who was this Ed Wood?"
"__MOVIES__ The real Ed Wood was this earnest, good-natured, cross-dressing, profoundly untalented director from back in the 50s. He made several movies."
"__MOVIES__ How does a no-talent guy make more than one movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Perseverance, I think. Plus he cultivated a friendship with Bela Lugosi, who by that time was an old washed up has-been."
"__MOVIES__ They were actual friends?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Ed put Lugosi in several of his movies. Go see the movie Ed Wood, and you'll get an idea of how they were."
"__MOVIES__ So tell me about Plan 9 From Outer Space."
"__MOVIES__ It's about space aliens who turn corpses into zombies to take over the world. It is hilariously bad."
"__MOVIES__ What makes it so funny?"
"__MOVIES__ The dialogue is just awful. But the movie is so sincere - Ed was really trying to make a masterpiece."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you have to admire the guy for getting films made."
"__MOVIES__ I remember the first time I saw Plan 9, at about 3 in the morning with a couple of buddies who had memorized all the dialogue and would quote whole scenes during the commercials."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, what a movie memory!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Plan 9 and car ads from Cal Worthington in the middle of the night. You can't get any more entertaining than that."
