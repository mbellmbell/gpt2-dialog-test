"__MUSIC__ Hey bro, did you check out the new Mors Principium Est album?"
"__MUSIC__ Mors Principium Est did another album? Isn't that like 500 by now?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe seven or eight. But seriously, they have not lost their edge even after all this time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I believe it, MPE is dreamy, just like Insomnium."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, right? While We Sleep by Insomnium made me cry man tears, I'm not even joking."
"__MUSIC__ Man tears?"
"__MUSIC__ Not exaggerating. The song is so poetic and depressing and as soon as they hit the bridge it's all water works from there."
"__MUSIC__ Well on a less depressing note, I'm seeing Amon Amarth in concert next week."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious? You didn't tell me about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Dude I told you about it for the last month. You were all stoked about going to Paganfest or Chicago Open Air or something."
"__MUSIC__ No I want to go to Wacken Open Air, in Schleswig-Holstein."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard of that, supposedly its the biggest metal festival in the world."
"__MUSIC__ You bet, Devin Townsend was there a few years ago with The Devin Townsend Project."
"__MUSIC__ Devin Townsend, you mean from Strapping Young Lad?"
"__MUSIC__ That's the one. I would pay large sums of money and give up large sums of vital organs to go see him perform."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man me too, Wacken sounds awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I'm thinking we should go, I think Amon Amarth is part of the lineup. Along with Kreator, Heaven Shall Burn, and Saltatio Mortis."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Get your passport ready because our heads are gonna explode from awesome guitar riffs!"
"__MUSIC__ Right on!"
