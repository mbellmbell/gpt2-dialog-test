"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite film?"
"__MOVIES__ Hard to choose, I have several - I love The Godfather and Fight Club."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Have you seen The Godfather sequels?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I still prefer the first one though. I know a lot of people like The Godfather 2."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like it all that much, to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither."
"__MOVIES__ Fight Club is great though. And so true to the book."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, most film adaptations of Palahniuk's books stay pretty true."
"__MOVIES__ I guess the story is already so good, why mess with it?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Brad Pitt really killed it in Fight Club."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the casting was perfect in that movie. Norton and Bonham Carter did great too."
"__MOVIES__ Totally, I can't imagine any one else playing any of those parts."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like any of David Fincher's other films?"
"__MOVIES__ He's one of my favorite directors - I love Se7en."
"__MOVIES__ Another one where Brad Pitt was awesome! Kevin Spacey absolutely makes that movie."
"__MOVIES__ You spend so long waiting to see him, but it still isn't a let down."
"__MOVIES__ And he's genuinely really scary!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! I would never think Kevin Spacey could be such a scary character."
"__MOVIES__ He's really creepy in American Beauty, too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he's great at that mid-life-crisis kind of crazy."
