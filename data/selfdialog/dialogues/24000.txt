"__SUPERHERO__ Hey, I'm thinking about watching a movie today. Any suggestions?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, I heard Wonder Woman was good."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's the one with Gal Gadot, right?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think so. Chris Pine is in it too."
"__SUPERHERO__ DC movies haven't been too good recently."
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad were kind of all over the place."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right right right. I know what you mean. Wonder Woman is way better though."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'll check it out then."
"__SUPERHERO__ Have fun!"
