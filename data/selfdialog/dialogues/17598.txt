"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that movie La La Land?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it. Didn't think much of it. I really don't understand why everyone is raving about it."
"__MOVIES__ Why didn't you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Take Emma Stone's performance for example. She's not really all that great a singer, and for me it really ruined the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That was all Emma singing throughout the whole movie though, no voice doubles. You have to admire that?"
"__MOVIES__ Why? Because the 'It Girl' of the moment landed a role because she's popular, and not because she has talent?"
"__MOVIES__ It's all about popularity and selling movie tickets, you know that. Her voice was good enough."
"__MOVIES__ That's just it. 'Good enough' isn't good enough for me. When I watch a musical, I want to be wowed."
"__MOVIES__ So who would wow you then?"
"__MOVIES__ Think of the great musicals of all time. The King and I, The Sound of Music, West Side Story ... CATS for goodness sakes?"
"__MOVIES__ CATS? Oh come on!"
"__MOVIES__ Obviously you've never seen CATS with Betty Buckley on stage singing, 'Memory.' If you had, you'd never forget her voice."
"__MOVIES__ Okay but Betty Buckley is performing minor roles in horror movies now. I don't think her vocal chords are all that active anymore."
"__MOVIES__ There's still Barbara Streisand."
"__MOVIES__ So what other musicals do you recommend, if La La Land isn't so good?"
"__MOVIES__ Check out the 80's movie Labyrinth. David Bowie literally cries with his voice."
"__MOVIES__ I know one! How about the remake of Annie?"
"__MOVIES__ No way, can't compare to the original. The kid can't sing in the new one. It's like a little girl singing in the shower. She can't hold a candle to Aileen Quinn in the original - I wonder if she still sings."
"__MOVIES__ You're crazy. Anyway, La La Land won the Academy Award."
"__MOVIES__ My point exactly."
