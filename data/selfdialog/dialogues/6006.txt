"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Jabba the Hutt as a villain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh he was excellent. I really liked the whole concept of the bounty hunters being involved."
"__STAR_WARS__ They really are a big part of the Star Wars universe that you don't always think about."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I mean Boba Fett is one of the most iconic characters in these movies and he barely had any screen time!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if Captain Phasma from The Force Awakens will end up with the same sort of cult following."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's hard to say. Kind of depends on what they do with her."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like that they used Gwendoline Christie from Game of Thrones. Adds an extra nerdy fandom element in there that makes me happy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah she's a great actress. I hope we get to see her face a little. But knowing how Star Wars works, we may not."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. Also another character I liked a lot was General Hux."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he might be a huge first order baddie in the upcoming movie. They better give him a big role!"
