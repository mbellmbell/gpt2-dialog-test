"__MOVIES__ You know I used to work in a video store right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I remember you saying you loved the job."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was great. The customers were fun and all the movies I had access to was so vast."
"__MOVIES__ That would be a wonderful to get anything to watch and it's free."
"__MOVIES__ One of my favorite things was each employee was asked to pick out two of their favorite movies and put the whole collection on display."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember what you chose?"

"__MOVIES__ Insane premise  to that movie but well done."
"__MOVIES__ I don't recall anymore at the moment. We would change them out every once in a while."
"__MOVIES__ Movies are fun to share with others. It lets people see another side of who you are in an indirect way."

"__MOVIES__ It's too bad that video stores are pretty much all gone now."
