"__MOVIES__ I shouldn't say this but I remember when Star Wars first came out."
"__MOVIES__ You mean back in 1978?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I was 8 years old. And I loved it ."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing that movie 7 or 8 times. It was the first movie I could to without an adult."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy. Your parents let you go by yourself?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I went with my cousins. There was 4 of us we all loved R2D2. We collected the cars, had digital watches, etc."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like you were all decked out. I was about your age too but I don't remember being that big of fan."
"__MOVIES__ It was amazing. The movie was just magical. We had never seen anything like that before!"
"__MOVIES__ I remember thinking C3PO was annoying but I couldn't believe some one was skinny enough to fit in that suit."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember that too. My brother had a X-wing fighter. He was a huge Jedi fan."
"__MOVIES__ Did he have one of those that shot stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, one of the ones that recalled."
"__MOVIES__ Too bad. Bet that thing is worth a fortune now."
"__MOVIES__ You know it. The marketing back then to go with movies is nothing like now. There was something kind of innocent about that time period."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the first one was the best. I followed the other movies but they seemed to lose something for me."
"__MOVIES__ The Empire Strikes back was good too. A lot of people consider that to be the pinnacle."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can't say I'm one of them."
"__MOVIES__ I was glad to see they brought back Mark Hamil for these new ones."
"__MOVIES__ yeah, they did do a  good job blending the old and the new. I remember thinking Han Solo was old then!"
