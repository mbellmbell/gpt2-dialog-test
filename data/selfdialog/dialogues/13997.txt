"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think should happen to the NBA's bottom-feeders?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Teams like the Magic, Knicks, Pistons, 76ers, Suns, Lakers, Timberwolves."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, what about them?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They're awful pretty much every year."
"__BASKETBALL__ So? Doesn't the draft help that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It helps a bit, but clearly some teams never have playoff-caliber years."
"__BASKETBALL__ So, I have no idea. What should happen?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think if a team is bad every year, they should get far more high picks in the draft."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, why should the team who won the championship even have a chance at the no. 1 pick?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's awful. If you win the title, and your players are locked up in contracts, you shouldn't get any first-or second round picks."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree--maybe make the first round exclusive to teams who were below .400 for two or more years."
"__BASKETBALL__ What about teams who intentionally lose?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's a rarity. If in a competitive sport, it's found people intentionally lose, they just flat out shouldn't be paid."
"__BASKETBALL__ Performance-based pay in the NBA?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sounds crazy, but why should they get guaranteed contracts playing a game if they don't put forth the effort? If no fans show up they still get paid."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but they are drama queens."
"__BASKETBALL__ Performance-based pay would never work."
"__BASKETBALL__ Imagine that in real-life. $9/hr flipping burgers but if your productivity goes down you're fired."
"__BASKETBALL__ Meanwhile in the NBA, if you miss 2/3 of your shots, you still are rich. It's crazy."
