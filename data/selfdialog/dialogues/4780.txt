"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you like rap or hip-hop?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, definitely. I'm not as in to more modern artists, but I love rap/hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool, what artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Like I said, I'm into older rap. I think Tupac, Biggie, Eminem, and Jay-Z are probably the best rappers of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I think pretty much everyone who likes rap respects those guys. They're incredibly talented."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's fun to debate who's the best, but I think they're all the best at what they do for different reasons."
"__MUSIC__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Tupac is the best lyricist and Notorious BIG has the best flow. I think Eminem is the best at rhyming."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can see that. It's hard to choose a best, especially since Tupac and Biggie died so tragically and so young."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've often wondered what music they would've put out if they were still alive. They were young and probably could've come out with a lot more material."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it sucks."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. What artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely like older rap, like the artists you listed, but I also like more modern rap."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool, I'm not as informed about more modern rap. I like some more modern rap, but I don't know a lot of artists."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there are a lot of unique rap acts out there these days. Some are even pretty eccentric, but in a cool way."
"__MUSIC__ What artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ In terms of more modern rap acts, I like Migos, Flatbush Zombies, Lil Uzi Vert, Future, and Logic. I'm sure there's more, but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head at the moment."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I think I've heard of Migos, but I'm not familiar with the other artists."
"__MUSIC__ They're all really talented. You should hop on Youtube and check them out."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'll do that. I've been meaning to expand my rap music library and knowledge."
