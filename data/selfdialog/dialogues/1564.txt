"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Christmas music?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly? I love it. What's your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it has to be Judy Garland's version of 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas'"
"__MUSIC__ That is a great one. It has a hint of sadness to it, don't you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree. What is your favorite Christmas song?"
"__MUSIC__ Carol of the Bells by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  It's just so beautiful"
"__MUSIC__ I love that one! I have to say that I love any version of that song. What do you think about the Transiberian Orchestra?"
"__MUSIC__ Amazing! I love them. I saw them live."
"__MUSIC__ How was the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ It started out a little dull, but they totally made it up for it later on with an excellent and LOUD stage presence. Lots of pyrotechnics."
"__MUSIC__ That's great! What's your favorite song of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ It has to be the one with the kids. I can't think of the name."
"__MUSIC__ Christmas Canon"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's it! Unfortunately, when we saw them, they didn't have any children's choir. It must have only been for the recording."
"__MUSIC__ That's a bummer. I like the Wizards in Winter Song."
"__MUSIC__ I like that one too. I liked the video a few years back with the Christmas lights synchronized to that song."
"__MUSIC__ That was great. Christmas Eve/Sarajevo is a good one too."
"__MUSIC__ That is a good one. I love how they put a spin on older songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, me too! I feel like that's why everyone loves them so much."
"__MUSIC__ That's probably true!"
