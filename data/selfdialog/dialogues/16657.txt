"__MOVIES__ I had a Harry Potter marathon the other night.  Whats your favorite set of movies to have a marathon with?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure.  I had a Pirates of the Caribbean marathon this weekend so I could catch up for the new one."
"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite character in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Johnny Depp was the best of course."
"__MOVIES__ See I really thought Kiera Knightly did well.  She hasn't been in all of them though."
"__MOVIES__ You don't like Captain Jack Sparrow?"
"__MOVIES__ I do but I think Johnny Depp overplayed him a little bit. He acts extreme in a lot of his films."
"__MOVIES__ I think he's a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Mortdecai?  That movie was absolutely awful."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but look at all the hits he's been in.  Edward Scissorhands, Sweeny Todd, and Blow those are some great movies."
"__MOVIES__ I will give you that, he's been in some good ones.  I just think lately he acts like one character and that's it."
"__MOVIES__ Some people say the same thing about Helena Botham Carter or Jim Carrey."
"__MOVIES__ Jim Carrey has done some good dramatic work.  The Truman show was a really good movie."
"__MOVIES__ He was kind of goofy in that one too which is kind of how he is seen by people."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Speaking of him did you see Dumber and Dumber To?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I thought that movie was terrible.  They shouldn't have bothered making a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ The first one was funny but the second one was just silly."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see that the first part of the end credits shows clips from this movie and the original?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't even catch that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, most people were out of the theater before the movie was even over."
