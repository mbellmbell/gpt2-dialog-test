"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Giants this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are going to be pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but it is a tough division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, the Redskins will be good too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think the Cowboys are better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that Cousins is the better quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but Zeke might run for 2000 yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but that is only because Dez Bryant is old and not as good as he was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean, their receivers are trash."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Eagles will compete in the division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps, but I'm not sure how good their offense will be, it was pretty bad last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are still suffering from hiring Chip Kelly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, he should have stayed at Oregon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, trading away Shady McCoy was his was of snubbing the team, the writing was on the wall with him leaving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was too stubborn to take advice and learn from mistakes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of mistakes, how about Eli's interceptions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no. There is that. Maybe getting Marshall will help, he is a big bodied target."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I'm excited to see him out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they still have Cruz?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, I'll read up on that."
