"__SUPERHERO__ Who was the better Mary Jane you think?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, I think Emma Stone was better, but Kirsten Dunst is cuter."
"__SUPERHERO__ Nah.  Emma's got that deep voice that's perfect."
"__SUPERHERO__ But Kirsten has a better figure overall."
"__SUPERHERO__ No way!  She's got a snaggletooth."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh please.  Like that would stop you."
"__SUPERHERO__ Listen, I know who I would want as my Mary Jane and it ain't Dunst."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's fine.  You can have Emma and I'll have the real beauty."
"__SUPERHERO__ You should watch the newer movies and you'd think differently."
"__SUPERHERO__ Fat chance."
