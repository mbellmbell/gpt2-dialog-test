"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Jaws?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Looks like a stupid shark movie like Sharknado or Sharks on a Plane or something stupid."
"__MOVIES__ You've got it all wrong."
"__MOVIES__ Prove it to me."
"__MOVIES__ Jaws came along before there were dozens of movie about two headed sharks and sharks with tentacals. Jaws was the original shark movie."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I still don't hear anything that impresses me."
"__MOVIES__ Jaws isn't a shark movie like all the shark movies out now. Jaws was a suspense movie. Jaws was a horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ A shark horror movie: I'm not seeing how this is any different."
"__MOVIES__ They build up the tension throughout this movie about the shark. Just how big is he? But they show very little of him."
"__MOVIES__ Then what's the movie about."
"__MOVIES__ That's what makes it a great movie. The subplots all keep you engrossed. The best subplot is about the chief of police having to take on this shark."
"__MOVIES__ What happens?"
"__MOVIES__ This guy isn't your typical hero. He's afraid of the water. He's not brave or bold. He's an ordinary guy. But he has to do something extraordinary because so few people really believe there's a threat, or they think the threat is exaggerated."
"__MOVIES__ Is it?"
"__MOVIES__ They throw in some incidents that may be from this shark but then aren't. So nobody believes there's a huge man eating shark. But there is. And he's attacking near the beach where tons of people swim and fish and boat."
"__MOVIES__ How does he fight this shark if he's afraid of the water?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the great thing: he just does. Nothing helps him get over it, nothing proves it's an irrational fear. Quite the opposite."
"__MOVIES__ But he faces the shark anyway because he's convinced no one else will."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. He doesn't overcome his fear. He does it even though he's afraid."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds cool."
