"__MUSIC__ What was the first music concert you ever went to?"
"__MUSIC__ Hall and Oates. We won a contest, and they came to our high school and played."
"__MUSIC__ what was the contest?"

"__MUSIC__ How did your school write the most papers?"
"__MUSIC__ Our teachers were really supportive. They let us write during class while they talked."
"__MUSIC__ That's amazing the teachers would let you do that."
"__MUSIC__ The art class teachers let their classes spend the whole time cutting up papers for everyone."
"__MUSIC__ They must have really wanted you to win."
"__MUSIC__ Our high school was very competitive. The sports teams always won awards. They wanted us to learn to strive to be winners."
"__MUSIC__ Was it a good concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. We were all teens, and most of us had never been to a concert."
"__MUSIC__ Did you live in a small town?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and it was very conservative, and the 70s, so for a lot of us it was our first rock music concert experience."
"__MUSIC__ Were you a fan of the band?"
"__MUSIC__ They had a song out that played on the radio all the time called 'Rich Girl.' I used to drive my dad nuts singing that song."
"__MUSIC__ He didn't like it, or you sang it too much?"
"__MUSIC__ It had a cuss word in it. Witch only with a B. So he made me sing Witch, but I would always sing the bad word when he wasn't around, and he was always trying to catch me doing it."
"__MUSIC__ Was your dad really strict?"
"__MUSIC__ YES. WHen I was 16, some friends were traveling to Chicago to see Pink Floyd, and my dad refused to let me go. He said a sixteen year old girl does not need to go to Chicago, or to a Pink Floyd concert."
