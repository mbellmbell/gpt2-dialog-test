"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you think that Adrian Peterson will come back strong this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't have faith in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, you've given up on his career?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not given up, but I just am not sure if he can recover his greatness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I see, and I actually agree with you on this one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had Peterson on my fantasy football team last year, and he did horribly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I drafted him as my first pick in fantasy too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he got hurt the first or second game, and that was pretty much the end of his season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it was a crushing blow for Minnesota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he carried so much of that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do remember a couple years back that he recovered from another injury quite well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he was a monster in rushing yards the next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone, including analysts and experts, were saying that his career was over before he came back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and Peterson proved them all wrong immediately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's when he was getting a lot of praise, and people were calling him a freak of nature."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I couldn't believe that he healed that fast, and was better than ever after that injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you don't think that Peterson will do the same thing again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess now that I am reminded of that other injury a few years ago, I might still believe in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does that mean that you will draft him in fantasy football this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I probably will, but I definitely won't draft him in the first couple rounds."
