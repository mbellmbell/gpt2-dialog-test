"__STAR_WARS__ Would a Palpatine backstory be a good stand alone movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it would, I'd like to see how he trained, and how he manipulated the Senate from his perspective."
"__STAR_WARS__ He did a masterful job of destroying the Jedi from within.  He deserves more screen time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, he was the most powerful character, except maybe Yoda in the whole story."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I wish they had more battles.  That was a clash of titan in Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd also like to see more Darth Maul."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he needed more screen time.  He was one of the few high points from Episode One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Him and the improved fight scenes."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree on that, even though the original movies were far better made the fight scenes took a huge leap forward in the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ That and the continuity, they were more consistent in the prequels.  Just not as well written."
