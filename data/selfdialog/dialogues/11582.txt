"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think this year will be the year for the Washington Redskins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have lost my optimism a long time ago for the Washington Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. I really wonder what it will take to the Washington Redskins around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have been a decent the past couple of seasons with Kirk Cousins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have been better, but they always seem to hit a wall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Robert Griffin's first season was the Redskins was probably the last time I had hope in the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Redskins were actually fun to watch when Griffin was on playing well!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure what happened to Robert.  I don't know why he can't replicate what he did back in 2012."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think his injury during the wildcard game back in 2012 against the Seahawks is what started his downfall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was very athletic back then and that injury seemed to take something out of him in the years that followed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the problem is that he needs more help on his fundamental skills.  He depends too much on his athletic ability."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That may have something to do with it.  I have some other ideas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, all the teams that he has been on seem to have a terrible offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You aren't wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both the Redskins and the Browns could not keep the pressure off of Griffin.  He never has enough time to sit back in the pocket."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that Kirk Cousins seems to be doing better with the Redskins offensive line than Griffin?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  From what I hear, players actually seem to like Kirk Cousins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did the Redskins players not like Griffin?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is the rumour.  If it is true, that may be one of the reasons why the offensive line didn't put any energy into defending Griffin on the field."
