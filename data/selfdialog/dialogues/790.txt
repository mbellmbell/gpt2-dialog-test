"__MUSIC__ This album seems pretty good, despite it's instrumentals being mediocre."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, This beat seems really good to me!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I researched them on some of their collabs. It appears that Green has some sort of hearing issue."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really, who's Green?"
"__MUSIC__ He's the drum player of alt-J."
"__MUSIC__ His drum skills are pretty meticulous!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it appears despite that he can't hear, he overcame that obstacle with his drum playing!"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I might start to like this band more now!"
"__MUSIC__ How? What's getting you into this?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually used to play the drums when I was little, but stopped due to studies and other priorities."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, maybe this can be a breakthrough for you!"
"__MUSIC__ Nahh, I wouldn't say for sure, I do like this music a little more now!  This is Indie-Pop, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Say, about instruments, what do you think about the lead guitarist's choice of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Ummm, not much of a guitar fan. (shrugs)"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think he played that solo at the interlude pretty well."
"__MUSIC__ What the hell's an interlude?"
"__MUSIC__ It's sort of like a beginning, but short song to an album that introduces the mood and kind of shows what the purpose of the album is meant for."
"__MUSIC__ meh, I don't care as much."
"__MUSIC__ Well, let's talk about something else now, then."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, how about what to buy for your girlfriend this coming Valentine's Day? Like a black full length fox fur coat? Or maybe a full length coyote or lynx fur coat?"
