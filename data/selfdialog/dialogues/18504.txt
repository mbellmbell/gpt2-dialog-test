"__MOVIES__ So I just watched a movie, and I didn't like it."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously? Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ It´s called 500 days of summer. Whit actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I have watched it, why didn´t you like it? I thought it was very good."
"__MOVIES__ It´s so hard breaking, how could she be like that to him?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's what the movie is about, about accepting break ups, and that life goes on, and you´ll meet someone else."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I felt that it went to long, she totally broke his heart."
"__MOVIES__ Well is only a movie, you don't have to get all mad about it, you are allowed to not like it."
"__MOVIES__ I know I´m sorry, I really like both actors, it just this movie seemed depressing."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I can name you a few movies with those actors that won't be romantically depressing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, please tell me, I need to erase the image I have of them in my mind."
"__MOVIES__ Let´s start with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Start by watching Inception, Snowden, 10 things I hate about you."
"__MOVIES__ Snowden? Like the real Snowden?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it´s a movie about his life, it´s really good, it´s not romantic, you´ll definitely think about him differently."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I will see it. What about Zooey?"
"__MOVIES__ You can watch The Happening, Our Idiot brother, I think she has more tv shows than movies."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I´ll give it a try. What is the movie 10 things I hate about you, about?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh you´ll love it! It´s about typical high school drama, but this one is definitely romantic, it´s a classic."
"__MOVIES__ What other actors are there in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles.. There is a part where Heath Ledger sings, it´s amazing!."
