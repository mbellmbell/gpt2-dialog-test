"__MOVIES__ Can you believe they made another 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I had no idea they did that."
"__MOVIES__ I mean it's hard to believe that they can even have a story to tell after five or six movies."
"__MOVIES__ What is this new one called?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called 'Dead Men Tell No Tales.'"
"__MOVIES__ Who stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Johnny Depp is Jack Sparrow again.  Also reprising his role is Geoffrey Rush."
"__MOVIES__ Anybody new?"
"__MOVIES__ Brenton Thwaites plays Henry Turner.  Will Turner's son."
"__MOVIES__ I know who Breton is.  He was in 'Gods of Egypt.'"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see that one.  That was the Egypt movie with no Egyptian actors in it, right?"
"__MOVIES__ That's correct.  I can't believe movie studios keep pulling stunts like that."
"__MOVIES__ They had the Scottish Gerard Butler play an Egyptian god.  He didn't even hide his Scottish accent for the role."
"__MOVIES__ That must have been a strange thing to watch...and listen to."
"__MOVIES__ It was.  To be honest, Hollywood blockbusters have been letting me down in recent years."
"__MOVIES__ Too many sequels and not enough depth."
"__MOVIES__ I would rather watch an original movie with a low budget, than another multi-million dollar 'Pirates' sequel with a similar plot."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe Indie films are something you should look into."
"__MOVIES__ I've been watching them more frequently.  Netflix has a solid selection of them."
"__MOVIES__ Amazon Prime video has a good selection of Independent films too."
