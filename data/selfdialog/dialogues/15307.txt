"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wish I had a fast broom."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So you could sweep faster?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No.  Imagine having a broom you could fly around on."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Like a witch?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What are you talking about?  I'm talking about Harry's super deluxe broom he got as a gift."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, the one his uncle gave him.  Very cool."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would fly everywhere on that thing.  It wouldn't be just for Quidditch."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it would be uncomfortable."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You think so?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sure.  Have you ever sat on a broom before?"
