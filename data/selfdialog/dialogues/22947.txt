"__DISNEY__ Have you ever watched some of the older Disney movies, the ones with Haley Mills?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't remember.  What are some of them about?"
"__DISNEY__ There's one called Summer Magic.  It has her going to Maine with her family."
"__DISNEY__ I'm still not remembering. What else?"
"__DISNEY__ They rent a house from this rich guy they've never met.  An old man is the caretaker and he agrees to let them stay."
"__DISNEY__ Wait a second!  At the end, the rich guy turns up and he's young and good looking!"
"__DISNEY__ Right! He immediately likes Haley Mills character and the movies ends with you having the impression that they will get together."
"__DISNEY__ I do remember that!  I remember one where she traveled on a ship looking for her parents."
"__DISNEY__ I think that was called In Search of the Castaways.  It had some really great special effects for the time period."
"__DISNEY__ It did.  Disney put out some good movies back in the day."
