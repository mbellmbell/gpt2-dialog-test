"__MUSIC__ Woah, have you heard Duke Ellington's 40s music?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, I have. It's just downright incredible. The early stuff with Blanton on bass and Webster on sax is mind blowing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I had Jack the Bear as my ringtone for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I figure it's attention grabbing, but won't annoy people on elevators."
"__MUSIC__ I'll bet they loved it! What's your ring tone now?"
"__MUSIC__ Pow R Toch by Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ Chhhhhh chhhhh.    Chhhhh chhhhhhhh.   Doy doy!  Doy doy!"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly!  It's fabulous."
"__MUSIC__ I love it!  I'll have to change my ringtone."
"__MUSIC__ What are you going to change it to?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  I'll have to think about it.  Maybe Singin' All Day!!!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's a great choice!  Will you use Tull's or Tommy Dorsey's."
"__MUSIC__ Now that's a hard choice!  Which version did you hear first?"
"__MUSIC__ Dorsey, if you can believe it!  I'd heard a lot of Tull, but not that song!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's great!  So you heard Jo Stafford rocking out in the 40s, and then Tull's version?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I couldn't believe it! It's amazing how much groups harken back and transform things."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love the part in it when Tull sings, 'Is that her in the fur coat, no it's not December yet, my my my.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and I love the part where he sings, 'I sing very softly so if the phone rings .... I can hear it...I can hear it!'"
"__MUSIC__ I love that, too!"
