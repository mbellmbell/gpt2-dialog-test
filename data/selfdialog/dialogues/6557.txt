"__STAR_WARS__ Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yes, I can't wait!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you also excited for the Han Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I am. I am a little worried that it will be as good as Rogue One or not."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, me too. I did hear yesterday that Disney fired the two people who were directing it because their creative vision didn't align."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard that too, I think that is a good sign."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet they were trying to make it all artsy and have the characters be all sexual and emo and that's not what Disney is about."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I take it as a good sign that Disney is willing to fire directors if they feel they aren't taking Star Wars in the direction they want."
