"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if we'll ever get 3D releases of the other Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ There are 3D releases for some of them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Only Episode I. Supposedly they had episodes II finished, and possibly III but they never released them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Just as well, I'm more interested in 4K releases anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not that it matters in the case of Episode II."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the movie was filmed in 1080p, so a 4K release would only be upscaling it."
"__STAR_WARS__ The older ones are fine though, because they were made on film, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but some of the CGI on the Special Editions was probably made at a lower resolution before being put back on film."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I don't care that much as long as it looks nice."
