"__MUSIC__ There are so many bands out there that are just trying to be The Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that makes sense. They're probably the most successful band of all time."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. And I guess that means there are going to be a lot of high-profile copycats."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think Oasis was convinced they were going to be the next Beatles for most of the nineties."
"__MUSIC__ I always forget about them."
"__MUSIC__ I really don't think they're very good."
"__MUSIC__ Well, okay. I can agree with that. Who else?"
"__MUSIC__ The Pillows?"
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ They're a Japanese band, but they sound a lot like the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That's very surprising."
"__MUSIC__ Some of their music videos are even modeled after them."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's a little bit silly."
"__MUSIC__ See? There are lots of bands like this."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I can see that. But is it really a bad thing?"
"__MUSIC__ I think if we just recycle influences, music as a whole never really evolves."
"__MUSIC__ So you think it's slowing music down."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. I don't know. I could be crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Not at all! What you're saying makes sense."
