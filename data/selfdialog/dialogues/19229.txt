"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any decnet movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ In all honest I really am not too amped for the majority of movies."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Personally they are either dry reboots, standard chick flicks, and duds."
"__MOVIES__ What's the last movie you've seen?"
"__MOVIES__ John Wick 2 was the last movies that I saw. I was very excited to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Actually now that I think about it, that film was the only movie as of late that has delivered on the entertainment scale."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. People are hyping up Wonder Woman but part of me thinks it will be ruined like Ghost Busters was."
"__MOVIES__ Ghost Busters? How was that ruined?"
"__MOVIES__ You didn't see the remake? It was a gender bend of the original film."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't sound too bad, what exactly ruined it for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the fact that the film made it seem like the original never happened and they every guy in the film was portrayed as a bumbling idiot."
"__MOVIES__ Come on every guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes every single one. Even stand ins."
"__MOVIES__ Yikes, that does sound a bit bad, but I don't think Wonder Woman will be anything like that."
"__MOVIES__ I have my doubts, I don't think it will be as bad as Ghost Busters but I can already imagine there will be some kind of shot at men in the film."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure there will be one or two but I can over look it as long as the film is good."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to wait till it hits amazon or something."
"__MOVIES__ Why that long?"
"__MOVIES__ It just seems like most movies now a days are being rushed to digital media."
