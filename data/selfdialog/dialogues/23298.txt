"__DISNEY__ Do you think they'll do a live action of The Little Mermaid now that they've done one for Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Under water?"
"__DISNEY__ It wouldn't be the first underwater movie to exist."
"__DISNEY__ Good point. I don't know! I would definitely see it."
"__DISNEY__ Did you see the Broadway musical?"
"__DISNEY__ I didn't! Did you?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! It was so good and so creative. Makes me want to see a live action movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I would definitely see it if it existed. I've just never thought about it."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they would keep some of the songs from the musical."
"__DISNEY__ As long as Part of Your World is in it, I'd see it."
