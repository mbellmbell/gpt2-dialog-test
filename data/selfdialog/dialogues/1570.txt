"__MUSIC__ Hey! Have you heard Katy Perry's new song?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. What is it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It is called 'Swish Swish' and the song features Nicki Minaj."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I love Nicki Minaj."
"__MUSIC__ I know! That is why I am shocked you have not heard 'Swish Swish'."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I don't really listen to the radio that much to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ Forget the radio. She is coming to concert soon."
"__MUSIC__ She is? You mean she is coming to our city!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Tickets are going on sale at midnight."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I would love to see her in concert."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I think the cheapest ones start at $59."
"__MUSIC__ That is not too bad. Are you buying them online?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I will put them on my card and you can pay me back."
"__MUSIC__ Alright. Sounds like a plan."
"__MUSIC__ I was never a fan of Katy Perry's old music but her new stuff is so good."
"__MUSIC__ I have always liked her music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, then you will certainly like her new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I am sure that I will."
"__MUSIC__ When I get the date for the concert make sure that you request it off from work."
"__MUSIC__ I will! I am so excited!"
