"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah man I love the Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ That one isn't so bad, but I hate the rest so badly. Well, aside from the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ What the heck, why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like they ruined then prequels, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi were all masterpieces, from Luke finding out he's force sensitive to him pretending to go with Darth Vader, his father, to the dark side, they were phenomenal."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're looking at them thru rose-tinted glasses, they were good but the recent ones are much better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Just because they used more computer doesn't mean they're better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well no, but the new characters are great and the stories are more complex and better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Jar Jar Binks is the worst creation in all of film history, so there's that."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're just a hater of new things man :("
