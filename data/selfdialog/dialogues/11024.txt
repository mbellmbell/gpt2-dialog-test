"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited like I am for the new NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I can't wait - last year will be hard to top though - it was a fantastic season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You must be a New England Patriots fan huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is one of the teams I watch regularly, I am a Tom Brady fan too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do admire him, he is a real professional and committed to his craft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, I can't understand the people who hate on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither - as a Broncos fan - I have good reason to hate, but its hard to hate or criticize excellence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that must be tough - you Broncos fan do have a rivalry with the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it has been one of those - oh no we play the patriots late again this year - almost every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If it's not the playoffs it seems you guys always meet in the late regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we knock each other out of the playoffs regularly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you guys play them last year in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No we didn't even make the playoffs last year - It was a down year for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must have been disappointing after a super bowl win huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it was - thats why I could admire Brady so much though this year I guess - he didn't knock us out and go on to win"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is funny, How do you think the Broncos will do this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At this point - I'm thinking worse than last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way really? Not going to make the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything can happen for sure, but the division looks tough this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the Raiders seem to be everyones favorite"
