"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is there a worse divison in the NFL than the AFC South?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, that'd be hard to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Texans somehow went 9-7 to win the division last year, but they were awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and the Titans were even worse, but somehow they also went 9-7."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Colts might be better, but they haven't given Andrew Luck any help at all and should be lucky to finish .500 this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Jaguars are the Jaguars - that is to say, bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. Whoever wins this division figures to be a first-round playoff elimination."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Same could be said of whoever wins the NFC West."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. The Seahawks win every year, but their 10-5-1 record was inflated last year by playing three lousy teams twice each."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Cardinals are OK, I guess, but the Rams and 49ers just are putrid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Neither team should match its win total from last season, and they were two of the NFL's worst teams last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Niners won two games - and they could be WORSE this season if that's possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. Who the heck will play quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but they let Colin Kaepernick go so it doesn't look good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't see any Super Bowl contenders coming from either division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're right. These division winners will get little more than participation trophies."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The AFC South is a bunch of middling teams beating up on each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and the NFC West is one slightly above average team feasting on a bunch of bad teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose it gives each team something of a shot, though, unlike the AFC East."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but none of those teams is going anywhere."
