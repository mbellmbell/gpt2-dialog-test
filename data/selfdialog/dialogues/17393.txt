"__MOVIES__ I watched the movie 'Big Fish' last night."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that's an old one isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was made in 2003. It was a pretty good movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think I saw it before, was it about a man that was dying and he had told lies most of his life."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think he enhanced some of his life stories to make them more interesting."
"__MOVIES__ He live in a world where some of the things were impossible, right."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was the point of the plot. You either believed him or you didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Well, his son didn't believe him as a matter of fact he was mad at him about it."
"__MOVIES__ I think the son really wanted to know who his father really was. He was trying to find the truth about him."
"__MOVIES__ I can't remember who were the actors in it."
"__MOVIES__ Albert Finney played the main character,  Jessica Lange played his wife, and Billy Crudup played the son."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I do remember he worked at a circus for years to get information about the girl he wanted to marry."
"__MOVIES__ I really did like the fact that he stayed at the circus and worked for free just to get a clue about her every month."
"__MOVIES__ See, that right there tells you the man told lies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think the point was he felt it was love at first site and would do anything to find his future wife."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the big fish didn't think about the other fish in the ocean, did he?"
"__MOVIES__ There was a part where the son is talking to a woman and asked if she was his father's mistress. She answered there were only two women in his life, his wife and all the others."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't he turn into a big fish when he died?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, but his son told him a story about him turning into a big fish. He wanted his father to die the way he had lived."
"__MOVIES__ Then his son becomes a story teller himself. See, most men wind up acting just like their fathers."
