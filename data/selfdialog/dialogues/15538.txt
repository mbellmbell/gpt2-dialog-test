"__HARRY_POTTER__ Severus Snape as a character absolutely disgusts me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What! Why?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Because he unapologetically abused his students for years."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But he loved Lily though! He saved Harry because of his love for her!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, because of a creepy obsession with a woman whom he called the equivalent of a racial slur."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He was under stress at the time! And he protected Harry to try and make it up to her!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He made it up to the love of his life by treating her son like subhuman garbage for seven years?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ ...Well when you put it like that..."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly. I acknowledge that Snape saved a lot of people, Harry included, by doing what he did, but that does not absolve him of a lifetime of being an abuser."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think I need to reread the series now..."
