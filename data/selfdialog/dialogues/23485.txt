"__DISNEY__ Did you see that there's a new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I know. I'm so happy they made another one."
"__DISNEY__ I heard this was going to be the last one."
"__DISNEY__ That's sad, but how long could Johnny Depp keep playing Jack Sparrow?"
"__DISNEY__ Forever! He's the kind of character that would still be great at 70."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe. I do love Depp and Sparrow."
"__DISNEY__ And it isn't like it is romance heavy."
"__DISNEY__ True. Though at some point it has to end."
"__DISNEY__ No, no it doesn't."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, you are right. Long live Jack Sparrow, even if he has to come back as a ghost."
