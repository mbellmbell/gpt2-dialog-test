"__MOVIES__ So what's your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Shawshank Redemption."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's a lot of peoples' favorite."
"__MOVIES__ I know but it really is that good."
"__MOVIES__ I never understood what was so great about it...Can you enlighten me?"
"__MOVIES__ For one thing, it's been said that almost every story is one of slavery to freedom.  This movie is the perfect representation of that."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense.  I just didn't enjoy it that much."
"__MOVIES__ I also thought the acting was superb."
"__MOVIES__ Morgan Freedom is still getting paid handsomely to narrate movies to this day!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he has quite the career going.  There is something soothing and authoritative in his voice."
"__MOVIES__ True.  He was an excellent choice to be cast in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was also Tim Robbin's most notable role.  I have heard both of them say that it was their favorite role."
"__MOVIES__ Did they say why?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they said it was because it touched so many people.  I guess they still get letters and comments."
"__MOVIES__ Wow!  When was it released again?"
"__MOVIES__ 1994, I think."
"__MOVIES__ That was a long time ago now!"
"__MOVIES__ I know...time moves so fast."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess I'll give it another chance."
"__MOVIES__ You really should!  We can watch it together!"
