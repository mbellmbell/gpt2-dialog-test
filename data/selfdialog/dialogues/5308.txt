"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know Harrison Ford got paid just over 10K for the original Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No way. Well, he wasn't really that well known back then"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope. Star wars helped his career greatly. But still only a 100 a week was what he was paid"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's still good money even today's standards. That's like 4 thousand bucks a month. Well over middle class income."
"__STAR_WARS__ yeah, and adjusted for inflation, it's over $39K today."
"__STAR_WARS__ So wait, adjusted for inflation, he was paid close to $16K a month? That's a lot."
"__STAR_WARS__ yep. And the last movie, the force awakens goes over $1 billion, Ford will make over 34 million from that"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sometimes I wonder if actors are paid way too much"
"__STAR_WARS__ How come?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No one deserves to get paid 34 million for being in a movie that's 2 hours long, at least if you ask me. Meanwhile school teachers barely make their bills. It's not fair."
