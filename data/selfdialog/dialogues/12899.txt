"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ who do you think will win the superbowl this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard not to think the Pats are going to be there again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess but they didnt win in as much as the Falcons lost last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you can argue that point which is couldnt they have just given up"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes of course and I guess thats what makes them so good but again the Falcons threw the win away"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok so thats one team do you think the Falcons are going back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure they were that good last year and Matty Ice had a great season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true but they have a phenominal offensive array of weapons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what about their defense do you think they are good enough to help them get back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and no but truth is who has that great lockdown defense in the NFL now anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally I like the Steelers I think they have all the ingredients they need to win"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great QB but not much else and even he couldnt get them to win a home game against the Giants"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh now that you mention it the Giants! Yes they are pretty good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dont like their running game and they are totally inconsistent but your right they are right there"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a good not great defense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. But what about their offense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they did rather well in this draft by plugging holes they had I think they have the best shot out of the NFC."
