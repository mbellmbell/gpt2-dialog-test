"__BASKETBALL__ Hey were you at the game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Which game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Shiners and the Warriors game."
"__BASKETBALL__ No!  I didn't know they were playing last night."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the Shiners killed the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, that's kinda surprising.  I thought the Warriors were supposed to win."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's what I had heard too but apparently not."
"__BASKETBALL__ So what happened?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, it was pretty close at half time but towards the end Williams got several three pointers and then some free throws that really tipped things in their favor."
"__BASKETBALL__ Williams always gets the long shots."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I know.  It was close though."
"__BASKETBALL__ What was the final score?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it was like 78-75 or something like that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow that is close."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah!  So next week the Shiners are playing the Combats at home."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'll probably go to that one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, be sure to go early.  There was almost no parking left when I got there."
"__BASKETBALL__ Where were they playing?"
"__BASKETBALL__ At the Johnson Center."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, yeah their parking always sucks."
