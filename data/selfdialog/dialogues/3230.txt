"__MUSIC__ I heard a musician I love.  I can't wait to buy their cd."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah?  (Kind of bored and disinterested.)"
"__MUSIC__ I can really imagine doing my schoolwork listening to this.  It was beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ (Dutifully but still bored.)  Who is it?  What kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a band called Grace and the music is instrumental - it's gentle and soothing."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds boring, honestly.  But if it makes you happy....."
"__MUSIC__ When you study what do you like to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I like lots of music.  I can't say I've ever listened to just instrumental, though."
"__MUSIC__ When I study I  can ONLY listen to instrumental-only."
"__MUSIC__ It would put me to sleep!  I need something lively."
"__MUSIC__ I enjoy gently and flowing music.  I like to light a candle and listen to flowing music."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of instruments are on this cd?"
"__MUSIC__ Piano I think.  Maybe some guitar, some flute, and rain sounds."
"__MUSIC__ Omg.  Just save yourself the money and sit outside."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to check if there are several cds by this band."
"__MUSIC__ It's your money."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess people do what fits themselves best.  My music works for me - it doesn't have to for you."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's true."
"__MUSIC__ I love classical music - baroque strings mostly."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever!"
