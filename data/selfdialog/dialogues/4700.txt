"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like progressive metal."
"__MUSIC__ What's that? I've heard of progressive rock and metal, but not progressive metal."
"__MUSIC__ It's basically just those two things put together."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, but how does that work?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you start with heavy metal, and then you add some of the wilder time signatures and song structures found in progressive rock."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I think I've got it. It's more like Metallica than Yes or Genesis?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, most of the time. Though there are some bands like King Crimson that have approached from a more progressive rock angle."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that makes sense. I had always thought of King Crimson as progressive rock."
"__MUSIC__ They mostly are, though they stretch to progressive metal sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. So what are some of your favorite bands?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Dream Theater and Symphony X."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I think I've heard of Dream Theater. Haven't they been really popular lately?"
"__MUSIC__ They have. Their last few albums were top 10 hits."
"__MUSIC__ And they have all those crazy song structures and time signatures you were talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ They do. They write some of the most complicated songs in the genre."
"__MUSIC__ It's weird that they've gotten so popular with that type of music. Why do you think it's happened?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, with file sharing services, I think bands really have to offer something extra in order to get people to buy their albums."
"__MUSIC__ You mean like more complicated songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly."
