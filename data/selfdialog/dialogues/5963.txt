"__STAR_WARS__ How old were you when Star Wars came out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wasn't even born yet. That was before my time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you familiar with the movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The only one I've seen is A New Hope. I'm going to watch The Force Awakens tomorrow."
"__STAR_WARS__ You should really watch them in chronological order so you can understand everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know, I've been making it a point to do that. Maybe I'll do it over the next two days and then see The Force Awakens this weekend."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good idea. I know you're going to enjoy them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm sure I will, I love epic sagas and that's definitely a huge one."
"__STAR_WARS__ George Lucas is a genius. I heard he created the languages for the movies, and they have actual translations."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? That's incredible. That's real dedication to your work."
