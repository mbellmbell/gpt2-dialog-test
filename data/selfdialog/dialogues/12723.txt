"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what I can't figure out about the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why are the Dallas Cowboys America's team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe back in the day, you know, with Roger Staubach and Walt Garrison and Tom Landry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Preston Pierson and even Tony Dorsett. Remember Ed Too Tall Jones?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, who could forget him? They had everything. Remember that flex defense that Landry invented?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, he invented the 4-3 too, way back at Baltimore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I agree they were good. No doubt. But now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got this Prescott guy from Mississippi State. He was awesome for a rookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wad awesome for a pro."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got that right. And then that running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ezekiel Elliott from Ohio State. He reminds me of Emmitt Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's built just like him, isn't he? Runs low to the ground."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like a bowling ball. Hard to stop, hard to bring down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I guess they'll be good again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll be honest, I thought they were going to the Super Bowl last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. Didn't they have the best record in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. In the conference anyway.All without Tony Romo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought their season was over when he got hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe that's why they're America's team. Overcoming adversity."
