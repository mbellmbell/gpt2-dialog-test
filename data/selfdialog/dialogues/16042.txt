"__ROCK__ I wish we'd hear more rock on mainstream radio."
"__ROCK__ I agree, there are so many bands though that how do you choose what to play?"
"__ROCK__ I don't know, it's just a bummer to me to hear obvious radio hits not make it to radio."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, stuff like Here Comes My Man by Gaslight Anthem would have been huge if it got airplay."
"__ROCK__ And that's what I'm talking about, I don't mind that I don't discover artists on the radio, it's just a shame."
"__ROCK__ The music landscape is so different anyway, most people are listening and discovering on Spotify."
"__ROCK__ Yeah but there's so many artists on there that a good rock band will get lost in the shuffle."
"__ROCK__ I hear what you're saying, you want these rock bands on the radio alongside the pop acts."
"__ROCK__ Exactly, because so many rock bands like Gaslight and Jamie T have hit hooks."
"__ROCK__ I guess we'll see if any of them ever break through."
