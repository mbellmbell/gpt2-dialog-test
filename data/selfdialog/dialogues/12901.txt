"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey do you want to come watch the NFL Football game at my house this Sunday?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, I'll see if I can make it, I might even have tickets to go to one this weekend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Which one are you going to?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My friend has tickets to see the Miami Dolphins and I would love to take a road trip to Miami to see them Monday night."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's amazing! I always thought you were a Tampa Bay fan more than a Miami fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I am but you cant turn down going to a Monday night football game especially when it's so warm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you like their new logo and uniforms?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are really cool. I do miss the old logo but I suppose the new dolphin could grow on me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think their color has changed? The green just seems a little bit different to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the colors seem a little different but whatever it takes to progress and update the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of updating the team, what do you think of them getting a DE in the first round of the draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not really sure! I don't follow the team that closely to have an opinion but I hear he's really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah my friend watched the entire draft at my house and now I have all this useless information in my head!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't say it's useless, I wish I knew it before I go to see the game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where are your seats located in their stadium?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right behind the goal posts so we'll get to see all the extra points go through the posts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully you'll get to see a cool celebration if they all aren't still banned by the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they're playing the Steelers so Antonio Brown will probably dance in the end zone for us!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so jealous, I wish I could go too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I don't end up getting tickets we will have to watch it at your house!"
