"__MUSIC__ How many types of music do you listen to regularly?"
"__MUSIC__ Three, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ What are they?"
"__MUSIC__ I listen to country music quite a bit. Mostly older stuff but some newer."
"__MUSIC__ What else?"
"__MUSIC__ I listen to Jazz. Mostly what I think of as Smooth Jazz. No words, just music."
"__MUSIC__ Why no words?"
"__MUSIC__ It's soothing but it's not distracting. It's good for when I'm reading or writing. I don't find myself singing along with the music."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that makes sense. So what's the third type of music you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of music from the eighties."
"__MUSIC__ Why the Eighties?"
"__MUSIC__ That's when I got into music. I turned eleven years old in nineteen-eighty. It's when I became me."
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to anything else?"
"__MUSIC__ At different times, I'll listen to almost anything. Except Rap."
"__MUSIC__ Not a fan of rap?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. Never seen the beauty to it. Just don't like it."
"__MUSIC__ So what else do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ They do music channels on cable TV. They have a Rat Pack channel."
"__MUSIC__ Rat Pack?"
"__MUSIC__ Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis jr. That bunch. I'll listen to that sometimes."
