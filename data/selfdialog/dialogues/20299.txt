"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Force Awakens?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I know a lot of fans are unhappy, but what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it definitely could have been more original - I mean, it was a structural replica of Episode IV - but in itself as a film, it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I thought. It could have been better but it was still enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ Some people aren't feeling the nostalgia. I actually liked it a lot, and that was partially because of all the feeling flooding back from all the other movies"
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. When they find the Millenium Falcon?"
"__MOVIES__ I almost cried but I figured I should save my tears for later"
"__MOVIES__ And you were right."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of wish I hadn't been"
"__MOVIES__ When Han fell and Leia felt it?"
"__MOVIES__ That hit me hard. And think about it, Luke had a similar connection to Han and was Leia's twin, so he probably felt it too."
"__MOVIES__ I hadn't thought of that. That's pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ There's so much to unpack about it. I feel like a lot of people didn't give it a chance."
"__MOVIES__ The internet was annoyed because Rey was so good at everything for no reason, but Luke was annoyingly good at everything his first try too"
"__MOVIES__ Well that's the thing, it's not Rey's first time. She grew up as a slave salvaging mechanic parts so it makes sense that somewhere along the way she learned some engineering"
"__MOVIES__ You're right. It completely made sense for her to have some experience. Luke just sat home his whole life with his aunt and uncle"
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of Luke, I'm stoked for the next movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! That was a pretty great cliffhanger."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. She was just about to hand him the lightsaber and then the credits rolled."
