"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey buddy, are you excited for the upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it! The Giants have been on a tear with acquisitions this offseason!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but Wentzylvania got some weapons this off-season! Alshon and Torrey Smith, I think the Eagles are gonna be great!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, man, the Eagles? When was the last time they won a ring? The first Super Bowl was before the Eagles' roster was even born."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We...don't have one. But hey, the NFC East is looking weaker too, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You must be praying for Zeke to get hurt, we're both in trouble with that 1-2 punch in Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is true, but hey, they'll lose in the playoffs like they did to Green Bay last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That Aaron Rodgers is a BAAD man, definitely 1st QB off the board in fantasy this year. Detroit's just praying for no more Hail Marys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of which, have you talked to the commissioner about doing our fantasy league again this year? I need to defend my crown"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, without a doubt! He told me the draft will be next month, who you got first?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easily Antonio Brown, the best wide receiver in all of the NFL, stat-machine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man, Big Ben is reaching the end of his rope, you think he'll hold up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easily, I think the Steelers have a couple more runs in them, especially with their weak division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Poor Cleveland, think they'll struggle again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably, they had a strong draft but they're a few years away from being competitive, barring bad luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, who's your sleeper this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Tennesee Titans, they are certainly underrated coming into the season and adding more weapons, how about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd have to say the Arizona Cardinals, they've got a strong core who had an off-year, I think they'll be back to the Big Dance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, bold call, but it's been a pleasure, I must be going, i'll see you at the draft!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same to you, very fun. Talk to you soon!"
