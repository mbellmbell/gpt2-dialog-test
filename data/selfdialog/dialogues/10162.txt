"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who is the best female rapper?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm not sure, I don't know a lot of female rappers. Maybe Nicki Minaj?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nicki is good, but I don't think she's anywhere as good as Lil Kim or Missy Elliot."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, I haven't heard those names in a while."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They might be older, but both of them have the rap chops that I don't think Nicki has."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nicki can rap really fast though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but rapping fast doesn't mean everything."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess that's true."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The really important things are whether or not you are doing some unique and original, and I think Nicki is kind of basic."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, she kind of is."
