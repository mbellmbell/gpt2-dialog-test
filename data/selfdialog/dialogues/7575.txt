"__LADY_GAGA__ Hmmm,  that's a tough question.  She has so many good ones."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, I know.  But which one or two really stick out to you?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Okay, even though it may sound a bit lame, I'm going with Poker Face."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's a not lame at all.  That would probably be my choice also."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's just so catchy.  It's hard not to sing along when it comes on the radio."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you ever see the South Park episode that had Cartman singing it?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ That was awesome!!! It might be one reason why hearing this song always makes me smile."
"__LADY_GAGA__ All right, now that we've established your first choice.  What's your second favorite song?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm going with Just Dance.  It's one of my favorite songs to run to with that great beat."
