"__BEATLES__ Tell me something about the Beatles that you thought was questionable, or very different about their music."
"__BEATLES__ I always thought that their travelling to India was pretty weird."
"__BEATLES__ Why did you think that?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, I used to wonder why George Harrison got into Indian music. I mean, did he just meet up with Ravi Shankar and jam with him, and decide to become an Indian swami himself?"
"__BEATLES__ Do you think that was wrong?"
"__BEATLES__ I thought they were all way to drugged out and just wanted to go to India to get their hands on some far-out opium or something like that."
"__BEATLES__ Did you believe that they were using drugs? Drugs like opium, or heroin?"
"__BEATLES__ I think that they were tripping a lot, dropping tons of acid, and that they wanted a different sort of head. And they couldn't do that legally in England or America, so they traveled to where they could get it easily."
"__BEATLES__ Does that make them bad in your eyes?"
"__BEATLES__ I was too young to really understand drug use. I only knew it was bad, and I thought they they were being led astray by foreigners from far-off lands."
