"__STAR_WARS__ So here is a question about Star Wars, why is it not more disturbing that Leia and Luke pretty much got it on?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess in the future incest is not frowned upon"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I guess considering people are even sleeping with Aliens"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yup, like Jabba the Hut"
"__STAR_WARS__ No way that Alien is doing anything with Women."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know why else would he have dressed Leia up in that skimpy little bikini looking thing"
"__STAR_WARS__ True, I guess I didn't look at it like that"
"__STAR_WARS__ Still the Visual is pretty freaking gross"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it is, now I need to go look at some pretty lady's to get that out of my head"
"__STAR_WARS__ Too true i'm right behind you."
