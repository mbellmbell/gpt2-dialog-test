"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga's new song Perfect Illusion just came on the radio again on the way home."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I finally heard it!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Isn't it great?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love the intro. It almost has an Eighties feel to me, but then it gets really hard."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. I like that it's a little poppy, but kind of angry."
"__LADY_GAGA__ The lyrics are perfection."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I really like the lines, 'That's what it means to crush, now that I'm waking up...'"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. It fits that moment when you realize the person you loved wasn't real."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love that her lyrics feel so real and raw."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. It's a great, empowering, break up song."
