"__MOVIES__ I wonder what the best movie ever made was."
"__MOVIES__ Most people say Citizen Kane."
"__MOVIES__ And I say no way."
"__MOVIES__ Have you even seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't like old movies."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the best movies are old though."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I've been raised on color TV, quick cuts, and constant action. I can't go back to the slow, talky-talky films of yesteryear."
"__MOVIES__ Come now, we still get slow talky-talky films now and then. Tarantino makes plenty."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, but you see, his films also contain action. It's not all dialogue."
"__MOVIES__ But it's a big part of it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but movies are more than just talking. If I wanted to watch someone talking non-stopped I'd watch a vlog."
"__MOVIES__ You might be partially right. Movies are the whole package."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ The lighting, the editing, the dialogue, the composition. There's an art to everything in film."
"__MOVIES__ You sound pretentious. I just like me some explosions, okay?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not disagreeing with you. Michael Bay films are some of the most amazingly edited movies ever made, in fact."
"__MOVIES__ I thought critics hated Michael Bay movies?"
"__MOVIES__ As far as plotting and characterization goes, they're not always great. But his action set pieces and the way they're put together are masterful."
"__MOVIES__ Huh, I never thought about that. Maybe I should look a little deeper into movies now and then."
"__MOVIES__ You should. Film-making is an interesting art."
