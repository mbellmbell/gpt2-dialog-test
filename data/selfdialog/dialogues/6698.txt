"__STAR_WARS__ Do you know about how Star Wars is divided into Trilogies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. Like A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which trilogy series is your favorite, the original or the prequel?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmmmm.... I liked the Empire Strikes Back, but I also really liked Revenge of the Sith. I'll say the prequel series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked Revenge of the Sith, too. I liked the idea of Obi Wan and Annakin Skywalker working together to rescue the Chancellor and their adventures."
"__STAR_WARS__ For me, I liked the story behind the movie. Apparently, George Lucas reworked the entire story-line to change how Annakin fell to the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard a little about that. So, what happened?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Chancellor Palpatine convinced Annakin that the key to his rescue was in Annakin's turning to the dark side, which he did and then changed his name to Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's part of the original plot though, no?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, but what Lucas changed was having Count Dooku kidnapped along with Palpatine during the opening scene and then having Annakin murder Dooku as part of his turn towards the dark side."
