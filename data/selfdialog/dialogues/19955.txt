"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie The Bucket List?"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Jack Nicholson in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes he is and so is Morgan Freeman."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah I have seen that movie and I really liked it."
"__MOVIES__ I just watched it the other day for the first time and it was one of the best I've seen in awhile."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is a really good movie and I bet it made you cry at the end."
"__MOVIES__ I was bawling like a baby at the end of it. You have no idea!"
"__MOVIES__ That is funny. It was sad at the end though."
"__MOVIES__ Yes especially when you saw the two coffee cans with their ashes in them at the top of Everest."
"__MOVIES__ One of my favorite parts was when Edward took Carter to the racetrack."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know and Carter got to drive the Mustang Shelby!"
"__MOVIES__ That really made me smile."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I loved when they were sitting at the top of the pyramids. The view from up there would be great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's too bad you can't really do that. I was happy when Edward made up with his daughter."
"__MOVIES__ And he got to meet his granddaughter! It was just sad knowing she wouldn't get to know him for very long."
"__MOVIES__ At least he got to meet her though. Did the movie make you want to create your own Bucket List?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah of course I've got several things I want to do before I die."
"__MOVIES__ I think all of us probably do. I'm not sure if it's quite as fun as in the movie though."
"__MOVIES__ Talking about it has got me wanting to watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah me too. Let's go see if it's on Netflix or Hulu."
