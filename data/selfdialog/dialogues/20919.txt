"__THRILLER__ Anything good on tonight?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I'm watching Hush. It's a thriller about a deaf woman who lives in the woods and someone is stalking her."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, my sister watched that the other night! She loved it."
"__THRILLER__ You should watch it! I don't usually recommend movies, especially thrillers, but it's so unique and well done."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah it seems like it would be different from anything done before."
"__THRILLER__ There is a great scene near the beginning, I won't spoil it for you, but it's one of the most impacting and climactic scenes I've ever seen."
"__THRILLER__ Ooh, you're keeping me in suspense, now I have to see it."
"__THRILLER__ Please do. It puts you kind of in the shoes of the deaf woman by eliminating sound in certain parts which I thought was very interesting."
"__THRILLER__ That is a very scary position to be in."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, but you kind of see how it helps her in the end. I won't say any more than that for fear of giving spoilers."
