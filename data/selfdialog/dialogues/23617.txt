"__DISNEY__ Ok, what do you think is the best Disney ballad?"
"__DISNEY__ Colors of the Wind!"
"__DISNEY__ That's good, but not as good as Reflection."
"__DISNEY__ That's just because of Lea Salonga."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, you might be right. What about Part of Your World?"
"__DISNEY__ Does that count as a ballad?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm. Still not as good Colors of the Wind."
"__DISNEY__ Colors of the Wind has a killer bridge, I agree."
"__DISNEY__ It's so inspirational, honestly."
