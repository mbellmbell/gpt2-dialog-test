"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yo, what do you think about the Eagles chances this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, I am so excited for Philly sports this year, especially the Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles have been making moves in the off-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Carson Wentz is going to be really good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he will be. Last year he was really good and he was only a rookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He still doesn't have that many wide receiver options though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alshon Jeffery is pretty good though, he can go to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess, but I'm still concerned about the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense is actually good, they have made some moves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got Derek Barnett and Chris Long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will probably end the season 10-6."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a little optimistic, I definitely see them being a playoff team though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Superbowl team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see. I don't think so. I think Wentz needs to mature a bit and we need an all-star running back or wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah maybe, and an all-star on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right now I wouldn't consider any Eagles player an 'all-star', but an all around good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see, anything above .500 I would take."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's setting the bar too low man, a healthy Wentz will definitely give you that though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, I just hope they are competitive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will be."
