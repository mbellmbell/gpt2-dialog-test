"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Eagles will do against the rest of the NFC East this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its hard to say- I think so much of last year was spent fixing the Chip Kelly disaster"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I'm still not completely sure about Doug Pederson"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, he managed the team way better than Chip, but after so many years of dominance with Andy Reid, he has large shoes to fill"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited the performance of Carson Wentz in his rookie year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too- he set the record for most completed passes in a rookie season- I can't wait until he has more experience under his belt"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The organization also went out and got some offensive help which is really exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, remember when we had such all-star receives like Owens and Desean Jackson"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its such a help for any quarterback, but especially a young one- I'm glad they are spending money"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea Jeffrey was like the number one free agent and the Eagles picked him up!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Between him and Torrey Smith we should have some great WR targets for Wentz"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also got Blount to help with our run game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that will be exciting to have a big, tough running back"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sproles is good, but he is small so you can't use him in every situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus all these offensive weapons are veterans- which will help Wentz"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think these decisions bode well for the next couple of years as far as building a winning sustainable team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope our defense gets better this year too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we need to work on that. We used to have such an imposing secondary- its what we were known for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah yes, sheldon brown, brian dawkins, troy vincent, trent cole....reggie white!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea they made defense fun to watch!"
