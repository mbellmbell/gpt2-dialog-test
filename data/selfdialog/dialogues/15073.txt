"__ACTION__ I want you to tell me quickly what is the best action movie of all time?"
"__ACTION__ Has to be 'Crank' hands down"
"__ACTION__ No way 'John Wick'  is the best action movie ever made, just look at how many people he kills"
"__ACTION__ True, but in 'Crank'  Jason Statham is killing people with his heart all messed up"
"__ACTION__ Okay i'll give you that, but I would at least rank Taken a little bit higher than Crank I think Liam does a great job"
"__ACTION__ Yes Liam Neeson is great in pretty much any movie he doe's and I will give you that Taken is an awesome movie"
"__ACTION__ And don't forget since you obviously like Jason Statham that he also did the Transporter series"
"__ACTION__ Yes those are also some killer action movies, especially when he kicks the door in."
"__ACTION__ Yeah or the fight scene in the garage where he is slipping through the oil"
"__ACTION__ Oh man I forgot all about that scene"
