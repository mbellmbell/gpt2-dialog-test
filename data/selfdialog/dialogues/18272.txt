"__MOVIES__ Do you remember Hoodwinked?"
"__MOVIES__ That kids movie from forever ago?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is the one."
"__MOVIES__ It came out around the same time as Skrek if I remember. I don't remember a ton about the film itself though."
"__MOVIES__ I was just thinking about how it was a surprise hit the year it came out, which was 2005, actually."
"__MOVIES__ How well did it do?"
"__MOVIES__ It made over a hundred and ten million dollars."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that definitely isn't bad."
"__MOVIES__ It's actually especially good when you know the budget. The film was made with less than eight million dollars."
"__MOVIES__ I can't even comprehend that! Talk about a big success."
"__MOVIES__ So successful it got a sequel. After six long years."
"__MOVIES__ What. Why would they wait so long to make a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, but I guess it had issues with the production or something. It was supposed to come out in 2010 originally."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess, another big hit?"
"__MOVIES__ The opposite in fact."
"__MOVIES__ It bombed?"
"__MOVIES__ It barely made back half its budget of thirty million dollars. The reviews were savage as well."
"__MOVIES__ Even if the movie was bad, I bet it would've been successful if it didn't come out so much later than the first."
"__MOVIES__ We'll never know for sure. The first one actually is a good movie, though."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll rewatch it if I ever see it on Netflix then."
