"__HORROR__ Isn't it cute that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. are still married?"
"__HORROR__ It's adorable! Weren't they in a horror movie together at one point?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, it's called I Know What You Did Last Summer."
"__HORROR__ What is that movie about?"
"__HORROR__ It's about a group of people who cover up a car accident and then they're stalked by a killer."
"__HORROR__ Oh, stalker horror movies are the best."
"__HORROR__ I know! They always give me the creeps."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I start looking over my shoulder a lot more after watching one."
"__HORROR__ And I get paranoid about hearing things in my house at night."
"__HORROR__ I guess that's the point of watching a horror movie."
