"__STAR_WARS__ Want to hear a fun fact about the third movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I imagine you're going to tell me anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ Indeed I am.  It was originally called Revenge of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Instead of Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  They changed it weeks before opening the film."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like return better anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess they thought it didn't make sense because a Jedi shouldn't seek revenge."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they don't seem vengeful to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ You would have thought someone would have caught that earlier."
"__STAR_WARS__ Guess they were busy getting the film finished, eh?"
