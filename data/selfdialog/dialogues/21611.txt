"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the movie Frozen that came out few years ago"
"__DISNEY__ yea, it feels like almost yesterday, cause that was such a guilty movie"
"__DISNEY__ why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it has something to do with the main theme music, let it go"
"__DISNEY__ haha, it's so addictive right? I can't stop humming it after seeing the movie"
"__DISNEY__ exactly, and we are all adults now, so that automatically makes you feel guilty"
"__DISNEY__ but kids really love them, Disney really has the magic of making great animations"
"__DISNEY__ that I can't deny, can't wait to see the next Disney animation"
"__DISNEY__ me too"
"__DISNEY__ I heard there is a new one coming out in July"
