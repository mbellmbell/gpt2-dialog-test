"__THRILLER__ What do you think about thriller movies switching from gory violence to more psychological?"
"__THRILLER__ I like it, for the most part; 'Babadook' was incredible, but I wish they would quit with the sequels."
"__THRILLER__ I agree, it's like the find a good niche and exploit it until they've run the idea into the ground."
"__THRILLER__ Exactly! 'Sinister', for instance, was crazy scary, but the sequel was a clear cash grab."
"__THRILLER__ I felt really weird watching the sequel too, it was basically just watching families get murdered in terrible ways with a little plot thrown in."
"__THRILLER__ And can we talk about Shannyn Sossamon's southern accent? I kept wondering how no one on set said anything."
"__THRILLER__ In that same vein, have you seen Insidious or the sequels?"
"__THRILLER__ I saw the first one. I thought it was really good until the end, it got weird and campy in the last third of the movie."
"__THRILLER__ It definitely violated the idea of 'less is more' when it comes to showing a monster."
"__THRILLER__ They just got excited about using those scary prosthetics, I guess."
