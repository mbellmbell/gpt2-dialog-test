"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL football is pretty unique compared to the sports in the rest of the world, isn't it?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did America's version of football become what it is today, do you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It basically was derived from English sports like Rugby and Soccer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do they call it football in America, when football is actually a completely different game everywhere else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's because, when the game was invented, most games at that time were played on horseback, such as Polo. Since it was played on foot they called it football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that the same reason Europeans call soccer football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but we call their football soccer to differentiate from our own game played on foot, which we call football."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL doesn't make as much money as you might guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much do they make?"
