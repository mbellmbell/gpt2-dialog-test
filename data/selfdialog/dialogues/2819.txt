"__MUSIC__ What are some good, upbeat songs?  You know, stuff that'll put you in a godo mood?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, let's see.. got several of those.  I think 'Send Me On My Way' by Rusted Root is a decent example."
"__MUSIC__ Not sure I've heard that one."
"__MUSIC__ It's from the first Ice Age film, got this whole 'sixties' vibe to it.  It's pretty nice though."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, let me give you one of mine... 'This Is How We Roll' by Florida Georgia Line."
"__MUSIC__ Ahhh interesting choice."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know, there's some people who don't like because they say it's not 'real' country, but I don't really judge songs by that.  I just think it's a lot of fun to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that it is.  Okay, let give you another of mine.. Walk the Moon, 'Shut Up and Dance'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's is an awesome song!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  It almost always puts me in a good mood."
"__MUSIC__ Although I imagine it might not if you were someone who didn't have anybody to dance with."
"__MUSIC__ Well, then you just do what Elvis did."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ 'If you can't find a partner, use a wooden chair.'"
"__MUSIC__ Where's that from?"
"__MUSIC__ Jailhouse Rock."
"__MUSIC__ Ahhhh... forgot about that line."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, man, I am so ashamed of you right now."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I know..."
"__MUSIC__ You're a disgrace to your family!  Haha!"
