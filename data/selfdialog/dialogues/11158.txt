"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So i see Houston has to face New England in the third game of the pre-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, i'm not looking forward to seeing that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, New england crushed it last season, i don't see why they wouldnt do it again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully that dynasty will get crushed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, i'd like to see the Texans take a stab at it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got some good draft picks this year, ya never know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What day is the Texans / New England?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 24th. They have to face The Jags and the Bengals first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jacksonville will be no problem. They have low stats for years now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. They got a couple of good draft pics as well, maybe they could up their stats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldnt hold my breathe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear ya. Now the Bengals my be a bit of a challenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they too didnt do well last year either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better than Jacksonville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most teams did! LOL!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, My fingers will be crossed for Houston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, we'll see. I think Denver has a shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eww, really? Denver?"
