"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you watch football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm for the Green bay packers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty cool. I've never been much a fan of football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I just think other sports are more interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's uninteresting about football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just feels slow, and less skill."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay dude. You gotta love the beauty and strength in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And how's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football is about the bulk of the frontline and the precision of the backline"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In a sense. Football is like a war, breaking enemy lines. It's pretty complicated and there are so many stratgies."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I never really followed football that closely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have all these unique soldiers joining the battlefield. The meta game shifts constantly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In that sense, football seems pretty interesting. Other sports don't have too much meta shift."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. We should watch a game sometime. Root for the packers with me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah dude. The patriots!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't be a bandwagon man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ PATRIOTS!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright alright. I'll order the pizza."
