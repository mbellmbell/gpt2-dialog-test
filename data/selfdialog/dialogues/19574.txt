"__MOVIES__ Did you see the last Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did. It was cool."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it on opening night."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't, I had to work so I went the next day."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it can be overrated to see it on opening day. It's so crowded."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I think too. I'd rather stay away from the crowd."
"__MOVIES__ Mark Hamill sure looks older."
"__MOVIES__ Of course he does, look how old he is! He's 65."
"__MOVIES__ Are you going to watch the next one?"
"__MOVIES__ I most certainly am!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure when it's coming out. Do you know?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's May 24, 2019."
"__MOVIES__ Oh bummer, I was hoping it was going to be this year."
"__MOVIES__ I thought I heard it was supposed to be, but I guess not."
"__MOVIES__ How old were you when you watched the first movie? I was 7."
"__MOVIES__ I think I was around 8 years old."
"__MOVIES__ All the Star Wars movies are good in that they are pretty much for all ages."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah my Mom didn't let me watch a lot of movies, but she let me watch Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ May the Force be with you!"
"__MOVIES__ You too dude, catch you later."
