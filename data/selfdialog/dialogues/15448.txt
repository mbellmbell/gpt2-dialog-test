"__HARRY_POTTER__ So I watched the first Harry Potter movie again yesterday.  It's the first time I've watched it in years."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too!  I think it's the best one they made."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, when everyone got older it just seemed a little strange."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The last movies seemed to take a darker, more serious tone too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They weren't as fun as the first one was."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The first movie really was inspiring.  It made me dream about what it would be like to live in that world."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It made everybody want to live in that world too.  It had more hope in it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Also, it made me hope Hermione and Harry would get together."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I did too. I think they made a better couple."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I want to watch that movie again today!"
