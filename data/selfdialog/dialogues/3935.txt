"__MUSIC__ Have you been to any concerts lately?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I've kind of grown out of concert going - what about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking about going to the Oregon Jamboree. They've got a bunch of country artists."
"__MUSIC__ I like country music too, just not the whole concert scene. I'm not too crazy about some of the new artists though. I like the older stuff.  Although I do like Chris Stapleton, Eric Church, Brothers Osborn and some Keith Urban."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds to me like you like a lot of current country!  I like those too. I also like Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I like them too. I miss some of the oldies like Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks and Brooks & Dunn."
"__MUSIC__ Have you been to many country concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ A few - my all time favorite was Chris Ledoux. There was no one like him."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love Chris Ledoux - he is truly missed. He was an original.  Johnson County War is my favorite CL song."
"__MUSIC__ That's a great one. The funniest is Yukon Rose - Copenhagen is a good one too."
"__MUSIC__ I miss the 90's bands like Blackhawk and Little Texas."
"__MUSIC__ Those were great - they had so many great songs."
"__MUSIC__ Who else have you seen in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they aren't country, but my very first concert was 10,000 Maniacs. I also saw Sawyer Brown, Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill."
"__MUSIC__ Wow!  Those are some big names!  Sawyer Brown would have been fun - they have so many good songs."
"__MUSIC__ I actually got to see them twice!  So much fun!  I saw Toby Keith before he was a big star. Same with Tim McGraw."
"__MUSIC__ I also love some of the older rock groups like Aerosmith and Tom Petty."
"__MUSIC__ Love those too!  Steven Tyler is my favorite. Nobody can hit the high notes like Steven."
"__MUSIC__ And I can't forget Prince - what a talent."
"__MUSIC__ Such a shame to have lost him - Little Red Corvette and Raspberry Beret are the songs of my youth!"
