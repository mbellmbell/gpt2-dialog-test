"__STAR_WARS__ I am excited for the next Star Wars movie. Do you think Luke is the last Jedi from the title?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jedi could also be plural and could be referring to several characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, I hadn't thought of that. I hope we will find out who Snoke is."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it would be funny if it turned out Snoke was really tiny in real life and his giant hologram was just him compensating for that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, we'll see. I do have a lot of faith in the director Rian Johnson that he made a good movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked The Force Awakens but I felt it stuck a little too close to the old Star Wars formulas. I hope the next one has more surprises and fewer Death Stars."
"__STAR_WARS__ It will also be sad to see Carrie Fisher on screen after her death."
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently she wanted Princess Leia to be featured in the 9th movie so it's a shame she didn't get to see that happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is amazing we will be getting new Star Wars movies each year for the foreseeable future."
"__STAR_WARS__ You said it. I never would have imagined this a few years ago when George Lucas was in charge."
