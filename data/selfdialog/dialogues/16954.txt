"__MOVIES__ Hey, we just saw a fun little movie the other night!"
"__MOVIES__ What was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was that movie called 'Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot'."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Tina Fey is the main character, and I think she also wrote the story."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know that movie! Wasn't it adapted from a book?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe..."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I'm pretty sure it was. Is it about a war correspondent in Afghanistan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I saw it. It was pretty neat."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it actually, and I'm a big fan of Martin Freeman as well so I was happy."
"__MOVIES__ He's so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ I love him in Sherlock!"
"__MOVIES__ And in the Hobbit - he was pretty hilarious in the Hobbit!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he adds a bit of sarcasm to the whole thing, which is welcome because those movies are heavy."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they are! A lot of movies for a little book..."
"__MOVIES__ Still, I enjoyed them. I guess I just go with the flow."
"__MOVIES__ I know, they're really well made."
"__MOVIES__ And the landscapes are amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I heard most of those movies were shot in New Zealand."
