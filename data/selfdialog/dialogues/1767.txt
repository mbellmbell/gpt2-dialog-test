"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Aurora?"
"__MUSIC__ The Northern Lights? Yes, I've heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ No, I'm talking about the singer Aurora. She writes and performs some amazing songs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yes. I've heard of her."
"__MUSIC__ You have? What's your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I like 'Puppet.' It's about a girl who controls guys."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard that one. It has a really haunting backing track to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and the words fit with the tone of it, too. It makes you think if in a relationship."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it does. It's a very haunting song."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite song of hers?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like a lot of them, to be honest. But I think 'I Went too Far' has some amazing singing in it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the runs and such."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and also a haunting song. But I've got to say, I like the upbeat 'Conqueror' best."
"__MUSIC__ Why didn't I think of that one? Yeah, that one is really good."
"__MUSIC__ The music video for that one is really fun, too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, with the guy not really there. What does the song mean, though?"
"__MUSIC__ It's about a person wanting someone to take care of their problems."
"__MUSIC__ Hm. What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ The person really needs to take care of her own issues, and stop waiting for that someone to make her life happy and perfect."
"__MUSIC__ These songs of hers are really deep, and we could talk about them all day!"
