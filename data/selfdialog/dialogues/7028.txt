"__ICEHOCKEY__ Have you been keeping up with the Dallas Stars?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Not really...things were looking good for them but their season fell apart, right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh, yeah, it was a rough season, but the good ole days maybe back!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What do you mean?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They have hired Ken Hitchcock back as manager."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh, wow, wasn't he the coach when they won the Stanley Cup?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yep, the days of us Texans learning hockey and having another team that could win a championship!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh, yeah! I loved when they moved into town and brought Modano with them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He was so great to watch!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And a good guy at that!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you remember the time he was injured and had to be carted off the ice?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hmmm, that doesn't ring a bell."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Look for it on YouTube...you'll never believe what happened to him!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I have no idea what you are taking about...how did he get hurt?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, no...it's what happened next...they dropped him!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What do you mean they dropped him?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ As they brought him out on the stretcher, they dropped him onto the pavement!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh, wow, you can't let that happen to the guy that you built your franchise around."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, of course I wish we had a new Star to build the future upon!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, we have Hitchcock back; maybe Modano can come back from retirement...and avoid the stretcher!"
