"__MUSIC__ This party is boring. Put on some tunes!"
"__MUSIC__ What do you suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ How about some electronic music?"
"__MUSIC__ Oooo, that could be fun. Electro coming up!"
"__MUSIC__ This stuff is weird. What band is this?"
"__MUSIC__ Its a pretty popular guy call deadmau5."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of him, but this is definitely unlike his regular music. Very ambient."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he tends to make things all over the spectrum."
"__MUSIC__ I can groove to this though. It makes a great atmospheric."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad you like it!"
"__MUSIC__ The party is way better with music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, anything to help fill those awkward silences, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Could you imagine going to a swanky club and just hearing voices?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be really weird."
"__MUSIC__ All that dead air and alcohol, and nothing to dance to."
"__MUSIC__ What a shame."
"__MUSIC__ Turn it up!"
"__MUSIC__ Don't mind if I do."
"__MUSIC__ I like my music loud."
"__MUSIC__ Good thing I have loud speakers!"
