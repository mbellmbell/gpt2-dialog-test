"__MOVIES__ Do you like British films?"
"__MOVIES__ Does James Bond count?"
"__MOVIES__ Hardly, it's as much an American property as it is English."
"__MOVIES__ Come to think of it, didn't Sony fund a few of the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. Might as well consider it a Japanese franchise then."
"__MOVIES__ It's multinational."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Maybe one day we'll have an American 007."
"__MOVIES__ People would boycott the movie. It'll never happen."
"__MOVIES__ Why not? We've had a British Spider-Man, and a British Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Their actors were British, the characters were not."
"__MOVIES__ Eh, same difference."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all. Even if the characters are played by British actors, they themselves aren't British."
"__MOVIES__ So, we could have an American actor play a British James Bond, you're saying?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, if he could do a really convincing English accent."
"__MOVIES__ So you finally agree with me, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ I said maybe. I think people would still be upset with the idea."
"__MOVIES__ Then we need to make our own James Bond. An American one."
"__MOVIES__ We have one. He's called Jason Bourne."
"__MOVIES__ That's not really the same thing though, is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's as close as we're likely to ever get."
