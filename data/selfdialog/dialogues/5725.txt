"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the first set of Star Wars movies, or the recent ones best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first set, because they had better story lines."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, me too.  I think there was a lot better development of the characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ The element of using 'The Force' was way cool, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was almost kind of like what passes for religious beliefs these days."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, in the older movies they treated it that way, but in the newer movies they treat it more like they are a police force rather than a religion."
"__STAR_WARS__ There were better action scenes, even without the improved special effects they have today."
"__STAR_WARS__ There was nothing like it back then, they were way ahead of their time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I guess it's true, can't beat old school storytelling."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, these days it's like all they can come up with is remakes, nothing original any more like the original Star Wars!"
