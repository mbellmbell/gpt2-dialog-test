"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of country music lately"
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? You always surprise me."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, mainly female singers like Dixie Chicks, Kacey Musgraves, and Miranda Lambert."
"__MUSIC__ So not the bro country about trucks and hunting?"
"__MUSIC__ Not so much. A lot of deadly revenge towards abusive husbands though."
"__MUSIC__ How did your new genre acquisition happen?"
"__MUSIC__ I get tired of the same stuff, so I go down some Pandora rabbit holes sometimes to find myself a new genre niche."
"__MUSIC__ You haven't switched to Spotify yet?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, I've had Pandora so long, my channels there have so much training."
"__MUSIC__ Sunk cost fallacy?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much. I'll probably be the last Pandora hold out."
"__MUSIC__ So you're pretty satisfied with it?"
"__MUSIC__ The problem with getting most of my music through Pandora is that I actually have no clue who is currently popular."
"__MUSIC__ Ed Sheeran? Katy Perry? Drake?"
"__MUSIC__ I know who those people ARE, generically. But I don't know what songs they have that are popular now."
"__MUSIC__ Google says Ed Sheeran's Shape of You is the most mentioned song on the web for 2017."
"__MUSIC__ Nope, never heard it."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'm going to make you a playlist. You need to catch up with the times."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm getting way too old."
"__MUSIC__ We both are."
