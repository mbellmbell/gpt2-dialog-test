"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you like in the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, the Patriots are tough but they can't win it every year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Cowboys to get to the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. Dak Prescott had a great rookie season, but opponents started figuring him out late in the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but he's young and has time to develop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess but if you keep in in the pocket his accuracy is poor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the NFC East is the strongest division. The winner probably comes from those teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Redskins will be okay if they're able to sign their QB Cousins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're kind of in a similar situation with the Cowboys. Is their defense strong enough?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, their offensive line is inconsistent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eagles? Good young QB and a strong defense!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see them doing well. They signed Alshon Jeffrey from the Bears this off season. He had 80 catches for Chicago recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't see the Eagles doing much. They lost their two starting cornerbacks to free agency and I think they'll start two rookies."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, Carson Wentz seems to be struggling with his throwing mechanics. He may not blossom at QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That leaves the Giants. Eli Manning already has two SuperBowl rings!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he throws too many interceptions and he's, well, old, aged, past his prime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli didn't have a great year last year - not much talent on offense other than Beckham - but he averaged over 400 yards passing and had 25 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He will have a little more talent surrounding him this year. And the Defense was in the Top 5."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm, tough to say. Hope somebody other than New England wins it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm tired of hearing all the talk of Brady being the Greatest of All Time."
