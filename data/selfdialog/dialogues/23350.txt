"__DISNEY__ Okay if you had to pick a side, whose side would you pick, Buzz or Woody?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you talking about the characters from Toy Story?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes now pick!"
"__DISNEY__ The whole point of the movie is to not pick sides but to be friends and work together."
"__DISNEY__ I know that, this is only hypothetical. I would pick Buzz."
"__DISNEY__ If I had to choose, I would pick Woody since he is such good friends with all the other toys like Rex, Slinky Dog, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but Buzz can fly!"
"__DISNEY__ Or is it 'falling with style'?"
"__DISNEY__ Very funny! I love that movie. Its such a great idea and story."
"__DISNEY__ You have to give it up to Disney and Pixar. They make such good movies!"
