"__MOVIES__ Hey, what's the best movie you've seen lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Gosh, that's a hard choice!  I watched a good kids movie recently."
"__MOVIES__ What was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Barbie: The Princess and the Popstar.  It was actually really good."
"__MOVIES__ Are you serious? It sounds corny."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I know, but it wound up having a good story.  The songs were great, too."
"__MOVIES__ I guess a lot of those Barbie movies are pretty well done."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they are.  The graphics are good and the storylines are usually pretty interesting."
"__MOVIES__ My older daughter watches a lot of them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I watch them with my daughter.  There's another called Barbie In the Pink Shoes that's good."
"__MOVIES__ What's that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about ballet and dancing.  It has some really funny parts."
"__MOVIES__ I saw one about Mermaids? It think it was called a Mermaid Story?"
"__MOVIES__ Barbie and a Mermaid Tale."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one.  It was pretty good too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it had the surfer girl.  I liked it allright but I think the Princess and Popstar one was the best."
"__MOVIES__ Well maybe I will check it out.  What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's kinda like the Prince and the Pauper."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so it's a remake of the old story?"
"__MOVIES__ Something like that."
