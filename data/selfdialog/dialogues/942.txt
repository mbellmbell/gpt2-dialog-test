"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to really relaxing music while I work lately."
"__MUSIC__ What sort of stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, none of it has any lyrics. For example, there's this one band called Hyakkei."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound like an English name."
"__MUSIC__ It's Japanese."
"__MUSIC__ Got it. So what about them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, all of their stuff is really slow, and the songs are just named after places."
"__MUSIC__ What sorts of places?"
"__MUSIC__ Like 'Library By the Sea' or 'City Lights.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so it's very visual."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It really gives you the feeling of being in a specific, relaxing place."
"__MUSIC__ That's really nice. I imagine that sort of thing is tough to compose."
"__MUSIC__ It must be! I usually only get that feeling when I've been in a certain place, listening to a specific song."
"__MUSIC__ Give me an example."
"__MUSIC__ I was on an airplane the first time I heard Norwegian Wood, and now whenever I hear it I remember airplanes."
"__MUSIC__ That's really funny. I don't think I have any songs that are that way."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you like to listen to when you relax?"
"__MUSIC__ Usually something classical. I really like Yo-Yo Ma."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, his cello performances are great."
"__MUSIC__ We should go to a concert sometime!"
