"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a lot of great young running backs in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the position is kind of in vogue again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Used to be a team was scared to draft a running back high."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a lot of busts at the position in the last 20 years or so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, and a lot of money tied up in those busts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but that was back when a top five pick made more than anyone on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the new salary cap rules are much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you could take one running back right now to start a team, who's your workhorse?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ezekiel Elliott, end of story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I was going to say the same thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Young, tons of mileage on the tires, no holes to his game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's probably making teams rethink their decision to draft guys in later rounds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, his line helps, but he's got everything in place to be a MVP candidate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you like Le'Veon Bell's chances?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also tons of talent, most patient runner in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But how does that translate to wins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See, his line, while pretty good, just isn't the same as EE's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think he's a step quicker and faster than Ezekiel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibly, but he's not somebody who can grind you down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, a real weapon in the passing game though."
