"__BASEBALL__ Did you see Werth from the Washington Nationals?"
"__BASEBALL__ Which game?"
"__BASEBALL__ Last night when he had four hits."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but he strikes out a lot."
"__BASEBALL__ But he wins as many games as Babe Ruth."
"__BASEBALL__ What are you? His agent."
"__BASEBALL__ No, just a big fan."
"__BASEBALL__ I bet you have a Werth jersey."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, actually you're right but it's from Philly."
"__BASEBALL__ Big deal. Why don't you get one from Washington?"
"__BASEBALL__ I can only afford one jersey at a time."
"__BASEBALL__ Then you're not that great of a fan."
"__BASEBALL__ My salary isn't anywhere near Werth's."
"__BASEBALL__ Whose is? He's not worth a fraction of his salary."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe I should get an agent."
"__BASEBALL__ For what? You don't have any talent."
"__BASEBALL__ Let's get back to the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Okay, what was the score?"
"__BASEBALL__ I forgot. I'll check my ESPN app right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Okay, please let me know."
