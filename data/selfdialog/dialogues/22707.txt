"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the third Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ No, but I have seen the first two."
"__DISNEY__ You should see it. I think it's my favorite out of the three."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really? I loved the first two. Woody and Buz are my favorite characters."
"__DISNEY__ Ya three seemed like it had a great message for adults about how fast life goes."
"__DISNEY__ Oh man that does sound interesting. I know Andy is getting older and going away to college."
"__DISNEY__ Ya and then all the toys have to deal with that where they don't know what is going to happen to them."
"__DISNEY__ Thanks for reminding me of that I guess I will have to watch it."
"__DISNEY__ I think if you loved Toy Story and Toy Store two you would really like it."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't they kind of deal with that in two with Jessy feeling sad about loosing the girl she had been with?"
