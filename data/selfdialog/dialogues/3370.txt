"__MUSIC__ I've been really into listening to Madonna again lately."
"__MUSIC__ She is a bit underappreciated lately."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I mean, I know her older stuff is still pretty popular, but her newer work should get more attention."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's not all good."
"__MUSIC__ True. The last album could have been trimmed of a few songs, but most of it was pretty great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Dance music in general always has a tough time in the US though."
"__MUSIC__ It's true, every time it seems like it's starting to really break through, it sort of fades away again."
"__MUSIC__ It did seem like it was having a moment there. Seems to be all back to rap now though."
"__MUSIC__ Mostly. Though there are still some acts that crack the charts."
"__MUSIC__ The Chainsmokers have been doing pretty well for themselves. And Zedd and Kygo have managed some minor hits recently."
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately, they all border more on pop than real dance music."
"__MUSIC__ At least the radio hits do anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Well, The Chainsmokers especially don't really make what I would call dance music, it's very pop."
"__MUSIC__ True, though the same could be said for Madonna."
"__MUSIC__ She is definitely a pop act, but much her output is far dancier than The Chainsmokers."
"__MUSIC__ That could be what's been hurting her though."
"__MUSIC__ That is what I was getting at eariler."
"__MUSIC__ Well it is what it is. Things don't need to be hits to be able to enjoy them."
"__MUSIC__ No, I suppose not."
"__MUSIC__ If that were the case no one would even listen to rock music anymore."
