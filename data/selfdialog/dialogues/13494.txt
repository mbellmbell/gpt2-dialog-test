"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear about NFL losing more ads?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, what happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Two of their major advertisers dropped out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, really? How come?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL ratings are tanking, it seems like. Either people aren't watching it or they're doing it and not watching the ads."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we knew knew things like TiVo and the internet were gonna change. How's the NFL handling it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More merch, I guess. I think they gotta get more exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, I don't know if you can get more exciting than last year's Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The comeback was amazing, but I think the fact that it was the Patriots left a sour taste in people's mouths."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Americans like the underdog."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That, and most of us are sick of Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess there aren't as many interesting teams any more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are some--I'd like a redemption story for the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a really great season last year, despite their loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they just choked at the end there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan still their quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, him and Schaub. Both Matts though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mm. They don't really have any star players, I wouldn't say."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but they work together well as a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well. Hopefully they can bring some fire back to the NFL."
