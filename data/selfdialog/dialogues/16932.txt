"__MOVIES__ Did you see the film The Sixth Sense?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It is one of my favorite films."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ First it was a different kind of role for Bruce Willis."
"__MOVIES__ What was different about it?"
"__MOVIES__ He normally is an action star.  In this one all he did was talk."
"__MOVIES__ Did you enjoy his acting?"
"__MOVIES__ He was understated in the role compared to being overstated and loud so I did like that."
"__MOVIES__ What else did you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the kid did a great acting job."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Haley Joel Osment will have a great acting career."
"__MOVIES__ The story seemed to start out as a love story."
"__MOVIES__ It sure did.  The tone changed however and I did not know what to expect."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  I thought they would end up being a problem solving team for dead people."
"__MOVIES__ Well, there was one round of that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  The mother killed her daughter and was exposed by the team."
"__MOVIES__ That was satisfying.  It was early enough in the film that I expected an even bigger case."
"__MOVIES__ There was sure a twist that did not go in that direction."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I was completely fooled.  I loved it!"
"__MOVIES__ So did I.  So many movies are predictable, but not that one."
