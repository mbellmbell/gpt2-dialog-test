"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that movie, Split?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I watched it last night with my husband.  I liked it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you believe that people can have that affliction?"
"__MOVIES__ What? Split personalities?  Yeah, why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  I do know that he was pretty good at making me think he was Patricia or Hedwig."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he didn't have to do much changing of wardrobe, now did he?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was kinda stupid but then I guess those kind of people wouldn't change their outfits, or would they?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know but that therapist or psychiatrist was freaking dumb."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's true.  The therapist should have seen it coming but she was blind."
"__MOVIES__ I don't understand, though, how anyone could be kidnapped in broad daylight!"
"__MOVIES__ Those girls were stupid, especially the one sitting in the front seat!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, right! Why didn't she move faster, I know I would have!"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the other M. Night movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Practically all of them.  I liked most of them."
"__MOVIES__ Did you catch the tie-in at the end, with Bruce Willis??"
"__MOVIES__ Is that who that was!  I thought he looked familiar!"
"__MOVIES__ I think Willis was referring back to that movie, Shattered."
"__MOVIES__ That would make sense.  That's the one with Sam Jackson in it.  That was good."
"__MOVIES__ I just don't get what Shattered has to do with M. Night.  I don't think he had anything to do with that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, but I'm going to have to re-watch it now!"
