"__MOVIES__ You've seen The Hunger Games trilogy, right? Do you know that the idea was ripped off from a Japanese movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen them, but I didn't know that. Which movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Battle Royale."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen that one, and I never made that connection. It seems so obvious now..."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't it? Do you have a preference?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought Battle Royale was a lot more entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ The Hunger Games was so Hollywood. Too much lame suspense and baiting with tension."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. In Battle Royale, there was also an overall air of absurdity that indicated some self-awareness in the film, which I liked."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The Hunger Games was total fantasy, and we are expected to take this ridiculous premise as fact."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the teacher in Battle Royale?"
"__MOVIES__ He was played by Takeshi Kitano, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. How do you know him?"
"__MOVIES__ After watching the movie I thought he looked so familiar, so I looked him up. He's the host from Takeshi's Castle!"
"__MOVIES__ I was surprised to find out he has a very prolific film career in Japan as an actor and a director."
"__MOVIES__ I had no idea. Based on these two things I have seen him in, I bet he's funny."
"__MOVIES__ He commonly plays in yakuza (Japanese gangster) films."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have any recommendations I should check out?"
"__MOVIES__ Sonatine, Outrage, and Brother."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome. I hope they are on Netflix."
