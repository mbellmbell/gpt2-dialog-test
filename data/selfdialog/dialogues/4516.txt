"__MUSIC__ I'm looking for something new to listen to, have you heard anything good lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes quite a few things actually. Anything in particular that you are looking for?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's finally starting to get warm so I thought I'd make a new summer playlist."
"__MUSIC__ On Spotify?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's my go-to nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ Well I heard a great song the other day by this new Japanese band called BiSH, have you heard of them?"
"__MUSIC__ No, are they a metal band like Babymetal? You know I don't like that stuff."
"__MUSIC__ No they are more pop punky."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm go on then."
"__MUSIC__ Well they've got a new album out with this song called Summertime on it, you'll love it."
"__MUSIC__ But are they singing in Japanese? Makes it hard to sing along to."
"__MUSIC__ Well yes they do usually, but this song is sung entirely in English."
"__MUSIC__ How odd, is it a cover?"
"__MUSIC__ No, one of the members of the band wrote it. Although I have to say that her grasp of English is ... inventive."
"__MUSIC__ That just means it's terrible, don't try and fool me!"
"__MUSIC__ No no, it's perfectly understandable, it just feels like it's been run through Google Translate once. It's cute!"
"__MUSIC__ And what is it like musically?"
"__MUSIC__ Like I said it sounds like a punk pop classic, like a long lost Buzzcocks b-side."
"__MUSIC__ Well OK I'll give it a shot."
"__MUSIC__ All their stuff went up on Spotify last week, if you like it they have three albums of stuff to explore."
