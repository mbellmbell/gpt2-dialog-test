"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wowie. What happened to you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's been a rough week, I don't wanna talk about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, that's fine by me. Anyways, we were just talking about the football players of old, what say you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I overheard that Richard Seymour's back in poker recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? How'd you find out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The latest and last tournament of the WSOP season, the WSOP Main Event, it's going on right now throughout this week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay....... since when did you hear about Richard Seymour playing poker?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, he's been playing for a while now. But he's not a pro at it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. I did remember him retiring long ago. But I didn't think he'd play poker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He won a couple of tournaments here and there. Small ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, okay. Anybody else that's not playing football after they're retired?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. It's because they showed Seymour playing in the WSOP tournament."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, okay. Now that makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. What else are you talking about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not much. Hey, what about Joe Namath? What does he do now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not sure. He's old as heck, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I meant football players of old, I meant football players of old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You didn't imply of the recently retired ones?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. Speaking of Joe Namath, what do you think of his daughter, Jessica?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think she looks pretty hot in that fox fur jacket."
