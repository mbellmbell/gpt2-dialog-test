"__MUSIC__ I am into so much music these days I think it is all coming out my ears."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I just can't hook myself into one genre. i can listen to jazz, country, reggae, rock, indie, pop in one day and not blink and eye. What type of music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Like you, that's kind of hard to pinpoint for me."
"__MUSIC__ Amuse me."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, if i name one then I would have to say I like k-pop."
"__MUSIC__ What is k-pop?"
"__MUSIC__ K-pop is short for Korean pop. Lots of people in the united states really get a kick out of the sound."
"__MUSIC__ So they sing in the Korean language?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Well, they kind of mix it up. Some English words along with Korean."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite k-pop band then?"
"__MUSIC__ That's easy, they are called BigBang. They are kind of a boy band."
"__MUSIC__ You mean like the old Boys to Men boy band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, but much cuter and they sound amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me the name of a few of their songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Bang Bang Bang, Fantastic Baby and Loser. But that is just a few."
"__MUSIC__ They do sound interesting and maybe I could add another genre to my growing list."
"__MUSIC__ You should really check them out."
"__MUSIC__ If you do, give me feedback. I want to know if you really like k-pop of not."
"__MUSIC__ Of course!"
