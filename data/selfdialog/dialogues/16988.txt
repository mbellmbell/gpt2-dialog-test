"__MOVIES__ What do you think of these live versions of musicals NBC keeps doing?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not the biggest fan of musicals anyway and these are just not good."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen them all?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw The Sound of Music and part of Grease."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like Carrie Underwood's performance?"
"__MOVIES__ I love her but she was not a believable Maria."
"__MOVIES__ That's actually what I thought too. What about Grease?"
"__MOVIES__ I hate Grease in all its forms."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ I do. It's annoying. Some of the songs are OK but that's it."
"__MOVIES__ I don't mind it but it's not the best or anything."
"__MOVIES__ I refused to watch the other ones because they weren't movies or plays I ever enjoyed."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I watched every single one. I may have missed one."
"__MOVIES__ All these remakes keep coming out. It's not just these NBC things."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know. Disney keeps doing it."
"__MOVIES__ I'd like to see some new ideas."
"__MOVIES__ It almost seems like Disney has run out of them. I wonder if that's true."
"__MOVIES__ You'd think they'd get new writers or something."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't seem to me that any company that size could run out of ideas but then you see all these remakes and wonder."
"__MOVIES__ I had the same thought when I saw them doing Beauty and the Beast."
