"__ROCK__ So what are you doing this summer?"
"__ROCK__ I'm going to see Poison at DTE music theater."
"__ROCK__ Wow, sounds fun!  So you're really into that 80's rock then?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, big time.  Those bands always put on a great show."
"__ROCK__ What did you think about the '90s alternative grunge rock?"
"__ROCK__ It was okay, it didn't grab me like the '80s hair bands did though."
"__ROCK__ It was a shift away from that pop-metal or melodic hard rock, I will have to admit."
"__ROCK__ Yes it was; it was sort of depressing by comparison."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, some people have said that."
"__ROCK__ I don't mean any disrespect though, those band undoubtedly had skills and whatnot."
