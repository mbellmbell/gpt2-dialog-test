"__MUSIC__ I love listening to the radio and zoning out with the music on the way home from work!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! Music brings up so many memories, doesn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Especially when I hear the positive songs from my teen years. Oh to hear the hair bands screaming about lost love."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely makes you think back to that first crush, first school dance, summer vacation, and lots more!"
"__MUSIC__ Right. And then when the rap songs come on, those always remind me of fun times too! Back when rap was real."
"__MUSIC__ I know! 2Pac, Biggie, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Snoop rapped about truth! Now we have posers that just say what sounds tough. Ridiculous!"
"__MUSIC__ And then sometimes I flip the station to the older songs that my parents always listened to on the radio when I was young."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes! Air Supply, Brian Adams, and the Beach Boys for me!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely all of those! Plus The Eagles, Elvis, Reba, The Oakridge Boys, and Alabama."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't it make you feel almost like you're a little kid again?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Sometimes I can remember the smells or where we were going when a certain song was played. Music transports me back in so many ways!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to more of the older stuff? Or do you listen to today's popular music too?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I listen to it all! I have a 21-year-old and an 8-year-old, so they keep me hip and young!"
"__MUSIC__ It's just not the same as what we liked back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ No, not at all. I used to have my bedroom walls covered with all of the hottest hair bands. Groups like L.A. Guns, Motley Crue, Guns n Roses, and Skidrow."
"__MUSIC__ Oh Sebastian Bach from Skidrow! Man he could sing and he was so good looking with that long, shiny hair!"
"__MUSIC__ I think I had a crush on every one of those guys in them bands back then! To be young again!"
"__MUSIC__ I am going to have to start listening to some of my older favorites. I found myself listening to jazz today and almost couldn't believe it myself!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, our music taste evolves as we age, but I relish every genre these days. Classical and jazz can be soothing for the soul."
"__MUSIC__ I agree and my day was particularly stressful, so that's probably why I turned it on and zoned out to it."
