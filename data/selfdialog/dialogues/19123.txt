"__MOVIES__ Hey Tony, have you seen that movie about time travel?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, hey Jack...a time travel movie? Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, the one where those guys go back and forth in time..."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Keano Reeves?"
"__MOVIES__ No, no, no, no...the one with the three guys in a pub."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm. Three losers in a pub...talking about the good old days? That sounds like my life."
"__MOVIES__ Right. If you had two friends..."
"__MOVIES__ Ouch. Accurate, but still painful."
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm talking about the movie where those three guys inadvertantly stumble into a time leak located in the Pub's bathroom."
"__MOVIES__ A leak in the men's room. Still sounds like my life."
"__MOVIES__ Very funny."
"__MOVIES__ And we're in a pub right now!"
"__MOVIES__ And you're acting a bit pissy, too."
"__MOVIES__ Sorry. Sorry..."
"__MOVIES__ It's the one where those three guys chase that chic around alternate timelines in a quest to become time lords."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right. The three guys, the pub, the chic, time leaks, timelines, time Lords..."
"__MOVIES__ Right!"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen it."
"__MOVIES__ You haven't seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, at least not in this timeline. But if it's really important to you, I could head to the bathroom and look for one of those leaks."
