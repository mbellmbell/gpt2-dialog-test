"__MOVIES__ So what was up with Beauty and the Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ Not sure what you mean I guess."
"__MOVIES__ The movie banked a ton of money yet the singing was suspect."
"__MOVIES__ The songs were great in it.  I'm not sure what your beef is."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not explaining myself well.  I'm talking about Emma Watson."
"__MOVIES__ Her performance was just fine for me and she looked great."
"__MOVIES__ Has nothing to do with how she looked, everything to do with her voice."
"__MOVIES__ You must be talking about the infamous autotune."
"__MOVIES__ I certainly am.  If she couldn't sing, why cast her?"
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't that bad really."
"__MOVIES__ There are tons of actresses that look pretty, can sing and perform.  Why take someone who only met 2 of the 3 qualifications?"
"__MOVIES__ She had name recognition too."
"__MOVIES__ There would have been no harm in not having her sound more natural."
"__MOVIES__ But Belle is supposed to have a pretty singing voice."
"__MOVIES__ Then don't make it so obvious that it's electronically enhanced."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, you are really caught up on this one."
"__MOVIES__ I'm just saying, if they couldn't find the right person, keep looking."
"__MOVIES__ The movie made a bazillion dollars, so they obviously did something right."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I know, but I'm just calling it out anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you were jealous that you weren't the beast, eh?"
