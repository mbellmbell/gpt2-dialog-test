"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies yet?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course! I love them, although not as much as the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love Order of the Phoenix. I think it has a more wholesome idea of adventure because of the TriWizard tournament."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? Voldemort killing Cedric is wholesome?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, but you know what I mean! It's more adult than the earlier movies but it's still a bit more lighthearted."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's true. The scene with Moaning Myrtle in the prefect's bathroom made me laugh."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, I almost forgot about that! My favorite scene might be when we meet the students from the other schools."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wish things had worked out differently with Viktor Krum. He was so gorgeous!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sooo dreamy. But Hermionie and Ron are meant to be!"
