"__HORROR__ I watched this movie called Train to Busan recently and thought it was so good!"
"__HORROR__ Is that the zombie Korean movie?"
"__HORROR__ That's the movie. It's about a train that's been infected by a zombie outbreak. The passengers are trying to avoid infection and can't get off the train so it's really suspenseful and scary."
"__HORROR__ That's been on my top list to watch. Korean horror movies have really taken a step up in terms of quality. I have gotten tired of movies like The Conjuring and those Paranormal Activity movies."
"__HORROR__ Oh this is definitely still a take on zombie movies but they just know how to add good drama to go along with the heavy horror elements. I was at the edge of my seat the whole movie, as it's such a quick pace movie, the zombies run!"
"__HORROR__ Is this like the World War Z zombies that chase and pile on each other?"
"__HORROR__ Actually it kind of is, there's one scene where the zombies outside the train are trying to catch onto a train and create a chain to reach the train, it was pretty awesome."
"__HORROR__ Do you know who the main characters are in this movie?"
"__HORROR__ I don't remember their names but the group of characters center around a father and his young daughter as well as a group of people who are really good actors. I cared for all of them, rooting for them to survive."
"__HORROR__ I'll have to give Train to Busan a watch, this sounds like the fresh type of horror movie I need to catch."
