"__DISNEY__ I'm not really sure! I love the original so much."

"__DISNEY__ I agree. The background on her mom was pretty cool."
"__DISNEY__ I also thought the enchanted objects of the palace were beautiful but I kind of missed the animation."
"__DISNEY__ But, the live action movie had Emma Watson!"
"__DISNEY__ I know! I liked it. Really, I did. But, I will always like the original better."
"__DISNEY__ I think I liked the live action one better."
