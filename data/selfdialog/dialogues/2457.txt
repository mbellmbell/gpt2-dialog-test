"__MUSIC__ Did you hear Seattle Opera is doing Mozart's Magic Flute?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh really, when are they doing it?"
"__MUSIC__ Next weekend,  I'm thinking of going to the Saturday showing, do you want to come?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure,  but I don't really know much about the opera."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's okay,  it's really easy to follow,  it's basically a kind of fairy tale with an evil queen and heroic Prince."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds great,  but isn't it in German?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes,  but there will be English subtitles so you can follow along."
"__MUSIC__ Nice,  I would really love to hear the orchestra again too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes,  they're very good,  and the overture is lovely."
"__MUSIC__ Wait,  what's an overture?"
"__MUSIC__ It's basically the introduction to the piece,  it highlights some of the major themes of the opera."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so is it sung?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh no,  it's all the orchestra, it happens at the very beginning."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, just there's no dancing right?"
"__MUSIC__ No,  definitely no ballet scenes in this opera."
"__MUSIC__ Oh good,  I'm really not a big fan of dancing."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really,  why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Well when I was younger we went to the Nutcracker ballet every year,  i must have seen that 14 times."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my, that would be boring,  but this should be much more fun,  I promise."
"__MUSIC__ Can't wait then,  I'll buy the ticket today."
