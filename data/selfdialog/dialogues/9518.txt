"__BASEBALL__ What is your favorite food and drink for a baseball game?"
"__BASEBALL__ At the stadium, or at home?"
"__BASEBALL__ Both. Amuse me."
"__BASEBALL__ Either way, beer is the go-to."
"__BASEBALL__ Duh? Do you know some parks serve wine?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I love wine, but outside in 90 degrees during a baseball game out of a plastic cup is an awful idea."
"__BASEBALL__ Some parks even have sushi! That's a health hazard right there."
"__BASEBALL__ I love the craft foods and beer at ballparks, but they have their issues. Can you imagine eating a $15 lobster mac and cheese and having someone knock it down by accident?"
"__BASEBALL__ That's why pizza is better. Simple game, simple people, simple food."
"__BASEBALL__ Where I disagree is on beer."
"__BASEBALL__ Of course you would. How so?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, first off, MLB parks shouldn't allow ONE company to sponsor their beer choices. Limited options are always a bad idea."
"__BASEBALL__ But, no one wants a 10% double IPA while watching baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Actually, I do. And, all ballparks are surrounded by breweries. Having them on tap is great for everyone."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure, but most baseball fans at the games are rednecks who'll never drink the hops."
"__BASEBALL__ That's why ballparks need to allow craft beer in cans at the stadium, instead of just on tap. Plus these breweries make pilseners, lagers, and all other redneck styles."
"__BASEBALL__ Best food you've ever had at a ballpark?"
"__BASEBALL__ Done with the beer discussion? Sure...I want to watch the game with a pretzel with cheese. Pizza is too greasy, and with a hot dog you have to walk around with ketchup and mustard on it until you get back to your seats."
"__BASEBALL__ I like pizza."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but then your hands are greasy. hard to cheer on the team and give out high-fives when your hands are covered in pepperoni juice."
