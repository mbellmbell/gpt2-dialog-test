"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Man, i'm so sick of all of these poppy-rap songs!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah man, tell me about it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why can't radio stations go back to the good old days where rap gods dominated the airwaves?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Personally, I think it's time the rap game go back to what made it great."
