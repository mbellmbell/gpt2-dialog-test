"__STAR_WARS__ Do you remember the red guards in Return of the Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, who were those guys?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They were the emperors special guards."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never saw them do much though?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There's a deleted scenes clip on youtube that shows them in action?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Like fighting and stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well not a big fight, but they pull out their spears."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting. I wonder why that scene was cut."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably to save on time and was unnecessary."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah probably right."
