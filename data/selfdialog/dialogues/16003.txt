"__ROCK__ I heard my favorite music couple isn't going to be on The Voice tv show anymore. Gwen Stefani supposedly isn't returning, but Blake is."
"__ROCK__ They're still together though, aren't they?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, but I'll miss seeing them make cute faces at each other."
"__ROCK__ I don't know, I always thought they were a weird couple- she's an alternative rock star and he's a country star."
"__ROCK__ I know, her band No Doubt and her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale's band Bush were both alternative rock bands, so they seemed like a perfect couple."
"__ROCK__ It just seems like they would have had a lot more in common, her and Gavin both been rock stars, like they would have enjoyed listening to the same music."
"__ROCK__ It doesn't seem like she would have a lot in common with Blake, he's a country boy who likes hunting, and she's a California girl who loves make-up and clothes."
"__ROCK__ Well, you know what they say about opposites attract."
"__ROCK__ I think it was more a rebound affair after Gavin cheating. Not surprising he did, touring so much with women throwing themselves at him."
"__ROCK__ Maybe Gwen and Blake will give each other a new admiration of their respective music genres."
