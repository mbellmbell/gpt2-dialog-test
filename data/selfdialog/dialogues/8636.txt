"__BEATLES__ Would you rate the Beatles as the greatest rock band of all time?"
"__BEATLES__ Probably.  One could make that argument based upon the sheer volume of their work, its success in the market and how they remain relevant today."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, and they produced such a variety of music, too."
"__BEATLES__ Definitely.  One of their great talents was how varied their music could be."
"__BEATLES__ John and Paul were fortunate to have each other.  I think the music they produced when together was much better than what they did as solo artists."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I agree.  Some of Paul's music after the Beatles was downright sappy."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, the Silly Little Love song crap versus great songs like All My Loving, Here, There and Everywhere, For No One, Blackbird to name a few.  He was downright prolific in that short time."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, and John, too.  Songs like A Day in Life, Girl, In My Life, No Reply to name a few."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, and let's not forget George.  He was more of a late bloomer, but Something and Here Comes the Sun are masterpieces."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, and when the Beatles broke up he seemed to have the best unreleased catalogue at the time given the All Things Must Pass album."
