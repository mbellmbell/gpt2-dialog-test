"__BASEBALL__ The new Atlanta Braves baseball stadium is amazing."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you know they have to turn off the waterfall in the outfield during the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ I heard about that, I think the baseball rulebook would consider it a distraction."
"__BASEBALL__ Speaking of distractions, some players on the Mets don't like it when fans do the wave."
"__BASEBALL__ That's surprising, the wave is one the best parts of the game for the fans."
"__BASEBALL__ It can make a boring game more fun, but I think it upsets the players if the game is close."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think Harper is going to have another MVP year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I hope he does well, he has a lot of fans in Washington."
"__BASEBALL__ I haven't really taken to instant replay in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too, I find that it distracts from the integrity of the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you know that every instant replay is reviewed remotely by someone in New York City?"
"__BASEBALL__ That's amazing, no wonder the reviews tend to take so long."
"__BASEBALL__ On a good note, Freddie Freeman is having another amazing year for the Braves."
"__BASEBALL__ If Freeman and Harper were on the same team, I'd be really excited."
"__BASEBALL__ The game has changed, players get shuffled around much more these days."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, it's harder to really bond with a team and form a connection with the players."
"__BASEBALL__ Who do you think the World Series champions are going to be this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Cubs are going to do it again, Epstein is genius general manager."
"__BASEBALL__ Epstein is an amazing general manager, I agree, first the Red Sox and now the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ I can definitely see him bringing that magic to the Milwaukee Brewers some day!"
