"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey do you know if Palmer is playing this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the quarter back for Arizona? I think so. At least I haven't heard otherwise..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was just wondering. I thought they were looking for a new QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure they are looking. Their defense is pretty solid but they do need more offensive players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I was thinking the same. Like they need good receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they have a good running back though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who? Oh, you mean the Johnson guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, David Johnson. He's pretty exciting. Reminds me of Mike Bell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did he play for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a free agent played for Broncos, dolphins, Saints...he was on the team when they won the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He doesn't play any more?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. Anyway David Johnson reminds me of Bell. Like same type of player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe he will be a lucky charm for the Cardinals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know who can use a lucky charm?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who? I'm sure there are several..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh my gosh! They need a lot more than a lucky charm...like they need a whole football team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahaha...you are right. They had the worst season ever!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They can only improve now,right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't imagine how they can play worse!!"
