"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you like about football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL or college football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, good, because I prefer professional football to college football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  Calliber of play I suppose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I guess it is also because I like getting to know the players and cheering for the same ones year after year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but so many of them move from team to team. Doesn't that bother you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It used to bother me, but not anymore.  I watch many different teams,  and it is a delightful surprise when I find a player that I once liked on one team make a place for himself on a new team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it is like that in life..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can say that again!  I have had four different jobs in 10 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The first company closed down, the second job was temporary, the third job was with a state agency that ran out of money, and the foruth was a start-up made out of others that had lost jobs in the horrible Obama economy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds rough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I learned something new at each company, met new friends, and stayed alive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you employed now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm trying to get a job with an NFL franchise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are too old to be a player!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, and I was never good enough for the NFL, but I would wash towels just to be associated with my favorite franchise!"
