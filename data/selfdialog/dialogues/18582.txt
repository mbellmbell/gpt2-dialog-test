"__MOVIES__ I just watched the entire Jurassic Park series - what a great series."
"__MOVIES__ You think?  The first is obviously a classic, but the others?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Jurassic Park II gets a lot of criticism for nothing... now the third..."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about Jurassic Park II.... but III was just god awful!"
"__MOVIES__ Well we agree there.  Jurassic Park II had some fun dinosaur scenes though, cmon!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it tried to do a whole King Kong movie in the last 20 minutes!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's true.  Nothing holds a candle to the original, obviously!"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing in the series at least... did you see Jurassic World?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, at least three times in theaters!"
"__MOVIES__ What'd you think about it then?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I totally loved it.  It brings back the roots of the series!"
"__MOVIES__ You didn't think it was a little too goofy?  Chris Pratt, who turned from TV goofball to suddenly 'Hollywood Hottie'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh cmon, Chris Pratt is great in it!"
"__MOVIES__ He's not the worst thing about it.  How about the whole plot!  Genetically modified dinosaurs..."
"__MOVIES__ Well if you're watching any Jurassic Park, some level of suspension of belief has to be taken."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's true.  But Jurassic World is just a CGI fest."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure you're being fair... besides the original it's the best of the series.  It tries to the bring the roots of the series back."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you could say that... it tries!"
"__MOVIES__ We'll have to agree to disagree.  But seriously you should check out the Michael Crichton book, I just finished it.  It's way better than the movies, even the original."
"__MOVIES__ OK, I'll have to check it out.  Thanks for the recommendation."
