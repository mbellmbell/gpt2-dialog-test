"__STAR_WARS__ In Star Wars, let's say that the Confederacy wins the Clone Wars? What changes?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think they could've. They were designed from the start to lose."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, let's say that Sidious' plans go south, and he has to have the Seppies legitimately win the war as his backup. What's different?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In that scenario Sidious has to rule from the shadows instead of being the true ruler. Count Dooku is the head of the state as far as anyone knows."
"__STAR_WARS__ And what about the Rebellion? Does that happen?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably, as their motivations would be more or less the same. They want to restore the Republic, but the difference is they're restoring it from an outside takeover rather than an internal transformation."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the Jedi? No Order 66, so they wouldn't be wiped out."
"__STAR_WARS__ I imagine that Dooku would simply exile them as part of an agreement of surrender with the Republic. That's easier, and more reasonable than simply killing them all."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that means no Darth Vader, and the Chosen One prophecy would be wrong."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the prophecy would still come true, and the Sith would be destroyed. It would just happen differently than what we saw in the films."
