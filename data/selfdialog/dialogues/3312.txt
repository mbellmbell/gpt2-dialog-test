"__MUSIC__ Did you see that the new Lorde album, Melodrama, is out?"
"__MUSIC__ No way? Already? I love the song 'Green Light.'"
"__MUSIC__ I do too! But that's not the best song on the album."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think is the best song on the album, then?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like the track, 'Hard Feelings/Loveless.' It's over 6 minutes long!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to listen to it. How do you think 'Melodrama' compares to her last album?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Lorde is defintiely growing up. 'Pure Heroine' was written in the middle of being a teenager. This album feels more adult."
"__MUSIC__ She was still a teenager when she wrote it though, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she was 18 and 19 I think. She's 20 now. But she was 16 when 'Pure Heroine' came out."
"__MUSIC__ How does it feel more mature?"
"__MUSIC__ There's a lot more heartbreak on this album.There's still a sense of youthful recklessness, but she's more jaded."
"__MUSIC__ She's always been a little jaded. Never your candy teenage pop."
"__MUSIC__ Anything but! She did get some critcism on 'Green Light' for being too similar to Taylor Swift, though."
"__MUSIC__ They're good friends, aren't they?"
"__MUSIC__ They are. But did you see the comment Lorde just made about their relationship? A lot of people are quite angry."
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't. What did Lorde say?"
"__MUSIC__ She compared her friendship with T-Swift as like having a friend with an autoimmune disorder. As in, there's many things she can't do."
"__MUSIC__ That's rather insensitive. Why did she say that?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know! Lorde should know better. But here comes the public apology!"
"__MUSIC__ Why don't celebrities just think the first time around?"
