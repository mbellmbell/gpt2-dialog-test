"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you seen the 49er depth chart this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not yet.  Why do you ask?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because it's arguably the worst in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought they were okay on the defensive side."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense is young and they've stockpiled some talent there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I'm not too concerned about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They drafted that Solomon Thomas and he's supposed to be super good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus Eric Reid and a good stable of linebackers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Defensively, they can hang, it's offense that's the problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their offense is pitiful"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Kaep gone, I think Brad Hoyer is starting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously?  Yuck, that's all I can say."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's the worst QB situation in the league by far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's their backup even?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's Matt Barkley who's on his 4th team by now or something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe they didn't go after a QB harder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I imagine that this year's draft will see them look for their next Montana or Young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would accept a shell of that over Hoyer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will struggle this year.  They just need some playmakers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Give them a few years and maybe they can push."
