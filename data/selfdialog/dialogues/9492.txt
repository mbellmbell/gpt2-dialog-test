"__BASEBALL__ I love the Cubs!"
"__BASEBALL__ They'll never win the World Series again."
"__BASEBALL__ Please, they are going to win it all again this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Never happen. Their pitching isn't good enough."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they have minor league guys they can trade for better pitchers."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe, but they got lucky a lot last year."
"__BASEBALL__ I'd rather be lucky than good."
"__BASEBALL__ I'd rather be lucky and good. The Nationals are the best team this year."
"__BASEBALL__ The Nationals are all right. Bryce Harper is such a showboating player."
"__BASEBALL__ If you were as good as Harper you'd showboat too."
"__BASEBALL__ It's bad sportsmanship. If I hit a home run I would just run the bases like it was no big deal."
"__BASEBALL__ If you hit a home run you would cry with happiness."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but I would do it while I was running. Besides the Nationals don't have good pitching either."
"__BASEBALL__ Good enough. Better than the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ But the Cubs have guys to trade. The Nationals don't have a good farm system."
"__BASEBALL__ I admit, the Cubs have a very good farm system, but the Nationals have a lot more money to spend on free agents."
"__BASEBALL__ The Cubs have a huge payroll!"
"__BASEBALL__ But will they spend as much this year now that they have actually won the World Series?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes they will, because they want to win again."
"__BASEBALL__ The Cubs will win the World Series again in about a hundred years."
