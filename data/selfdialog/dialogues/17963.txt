"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the remake of Dirty Dancing?"
"__MOVIES__ No, and I'm not planning on it, because some movies should never be remade! Patrick Swayze is probably spinning in his grave."
"__MOVIES__ Roadhouse was Patrick Swayze's best movie ever, although Point Break was also really good."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? Who else was in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ So it's not only the ever-wonderful Patrick Swayze, but also Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey. Have you seen anything else good lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm a little embarrassed, but I saw Beauty and the Beast. Emma Watson was great in that, but she'll always be Hermione to me."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I know what you mean, I loved the Harry Potter movies, I was sad when they were over. There are some good movies coming out soon, too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I saw there is going to be a new Minions movie. Did you see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I love Chris Pratt and I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It had an excellent soundtrack too!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saved it on Spotify! I actually like the old classic movies too, The Sound of Music was one I watched every year when I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you mean when we didn't have the luxury of having every movie at our fingertips? Yes, I definitely remember that."
"__MOVIES__ There's going to be a new Cars movie this summer too, although I don't think it will come close to the first one."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I saw the preview and I wasn't impressed. Did you see any of the Oscar-nominated movies this year?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, just this week I saw LaLa Land. I was so uninformed I didn't even realize it was going to be a musical."
"__MOVIES__ Funny! Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were in that one, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I'm a huge fan of Emma Stone's. She has also been in The Help, the Spiderman movies, and more."
"__MOVIES__ What was The Help about?"
"__MOVIES__ It was based on a book, in it she is going to be a journalist. It takes place during the Civil Rights era in Missippi."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to put that one on my list. Was anyone else good in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it also had Viola Davis, and Allison Janney, and I think Jessica Chastain too. You should definitely see it!"
