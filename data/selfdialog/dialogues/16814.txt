"__MOVIES__ So what's your favorite musical?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.' It has this amazing dance sequence in the middle that's pretty mind-blowing."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I don't think I've ever seen it. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Howard Keel and Jane Powell, but my favorite is Russ Tamblyn."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't he in 'West Side Story?' '"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was, though he dies in that one. His daughter's an actress now. Amber Tamblyn."
"__MOVIES__ Has she been in anything I would have seen?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure.  I think she was in 'Django Unchained.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? Who did she play?"
"__MOVIES__ Daughter of a Son of a Gunfighter, is the official name of the character."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay, yeah I know who that is. That was an awesome movie."
"__MOVIES__ I never saw it, though I wanted to."
"__MOVIES__ You really should. It's one of Tarantino's better ones."
"__MOVIES__ That's good to hear. He's had some great hits and some terrible misses."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. What's your favorite Tarantino film?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. I really like 'Reservoir Dogs,' but I think he's a better writer than anything else."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't he write all his own movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Most, but not all I don't think. Some of his best writing was 'True Romance.'"
"__MOVIES__ That movie was awesome, but I don't ever remember it being in the theaters."
"__MOVIES__ It was, but only for about a week. It was a box office dud but is a cult classic now."
