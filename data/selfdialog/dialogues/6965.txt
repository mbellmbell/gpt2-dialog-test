"__STAR_WARS__ Being a force ghost returns you to your optimum age. That's why Anakin is younger than Darth Vader"
"__STAR_WARS__ Says who?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nobody said it is so. It's just assumed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well that doesn't make sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know what doesn't make sense? You trying to make sense of everything. Why can't you just enjoy the movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am an analytical individual. I like to analyze things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Star Wars is too complex to be analyzed. It's meant to be just enjoyed."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's more enjoyable when I analyze things, including Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ But the plot is too complex to be thoroughly analyzed without having to watch it a few times. And it evolved over the last 3 decades so much"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's the main reason. the movies themselves are not that complex. but all the follow up storylines that evolved over the years make the prequels confusing, and sequels even more so."
