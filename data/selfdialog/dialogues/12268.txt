"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for the NFL season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, I am not that into football to be honest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because everything about it just seems overrated. Kind of like Soccor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you figure?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the season is 16 weeks unless you make the playoffs correct?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 17 weeks, with 16 games. Teams get 1 week off during the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. Even worse. In that time, they play a total of 16 games? 1 game a week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and then they practice the rest of the week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And during a game they stand around while the clock is running, so in all they play like 20 minutes a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is a strategy to when the clock is running, and how the team is going to handle it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, sure. But in the NHL 20 minutes is actual game play. The clock stops when the teams are not playing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NHL and NFL are completely different. The NFL is harder hits and scrums."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh please! Players in the NHL are routinely going to the dressing room for stitches during the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Try lining up against a 250 pound guy and keeping him away from your quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about trying to pass the puck when the other team is planting you into the glass."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is why they practice daily though. So they can try and figure out every play the other team will use."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NHL usually plays 2 to 3 games a week. Try remembering which city you are in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guy, Football is a great sport with lots of excitement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am just saying that NHL is better. Football is too slow."
