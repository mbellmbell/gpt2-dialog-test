"__BASEBALL__ How did your brother do in his ball game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, it actually almost got rained out."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I forgot that the weather was a mess."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they ended up being able to play."
"__BASEBALL__ Yuck.  I bet the field was nasty as heck."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep.  Those boys didn't care though.  They got as filthy as could be."
"__BASEBALL__ I remember those days.  Just playing in the mud."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, we had to hose off the guys before they left.  No one wanted them in their vehicles."
"__BASEBALL__ No kidding.  So how did they do?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was a close game.  They got ahead and pulled it off though.  Score was 9-7."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, must have been a hitter's game, huh?"
"__BASEBALL__ Pretty much.  Mud made the defense hard."
"__BASEBALL__ I could understand that.  How'd your brother do?"
"__BASEBALL__ He went 2 for 3 and had a walk."
"__BASEBALL__ Not bad at all.  Where'd he play?"
"__BASEBALL__ He was third base last night.  Saw a good bit of hits, but like I said, the mud."
"__BASEBALL__ Eh, so he wasn't able to make all the plays."
"__BASEBALL__ Not all of them.  He actually lost his shoe in the mud once!"
"__BASEBALL__ That's funny!  I wish I had been there!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, you definately would have loved it."
