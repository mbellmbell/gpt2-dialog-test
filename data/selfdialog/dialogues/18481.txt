"__MOVIES__ Hey, I finally saw Guardians of the Galaxy!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, it wasn't my favorite of the Marvel movies,"
"__MOVIES__ Huh, I thought it was fun."
"__MOVIES__ It certainly had a lot of exciting chase scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the fight scene near the beginning, too, where everybody meets."
"__MOVIES__ And I enjoyed watching them plan the jail break."
"__MOVIES__ To the extent that you could call that a plan, yeah."
"__MOVIES__ That was my basic problem with the movie - I thought the characters weren't very competent."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they're kind of supposed to be a ragtag team."
"__MOVIES__ They definitely are. But I didn't feel like they ever made good plans."
"__MOVIES__ Gamora and Rocket were the smartest ones on the team."
"__MOVIES__ And neither of them was the team leader."
"__MOVIES__ Peter Quill always meant well, though."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not saying he's not a good guy. Just not really my type."
"__MOVIES__ You have to like Groot, though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Groot is adorable!"
"__MOVIES__ It was so sad when he died."
"__MOVIES__ But Baby Groot is incredibly cute."
"__MOVIES__ I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in the second movie!"
