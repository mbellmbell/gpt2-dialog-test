"__MUSIC__ Whenever I play games, I like to listen to my own music."
"__MUSIC__ It seems music might seem distracting for certain games."
"__MUSIC__ You might think so, but it personally helps me focus. I only listen to underground music."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if I just haven't found the right gaming music."
"__MUSIC__ Try Aphex Twin. There are not really words, but it might give you an energy boost while you play."
"__MUSIC__ I've never listened to them. I will look it up on Spotify."
"__MUSIC__ You should also add Squarepusher. It's a similar vibe."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a Spotify? Maybe I could view your playlists."
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't."
"__MUSIC__ Then how do you listen to music?"
"__MUSIC__ I own all my music. I have a terabyte hard drive designated specifically for my music."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, a full terabyte?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's even time to consider getting an additional hard drive. I don't want to wait until it's completely full."
"__MUSIC__ Did you purchase all that music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, some of it."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I have bought some CDs at thrift stores, but most of the music I own is torrented."
"__MUSIC__ Are you telling me that none of the artists you listen to actually receive your monetary support?"
"__MUSIC__ I never thought about it that way."
"__MUSIC__ No wonder all the music you listen to is underground. They just don't have paying listeners."
