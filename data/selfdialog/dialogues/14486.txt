"__HORROR__ We decided to watch all of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies this weekend."
"__HORROR__ Oh wow! Those are scary."
"__HORROR__ I know they had me scared to go to sleep."
"__HORROR__ Yeah because Freddy might get you."
"__HORROR__ Well I didn't want to have a nightmare."
"__HORROR__ Those movies really make your mind play games."
"__HORROR__ I saw them when I was younger but really never let them affect me."
"__HORROR__ I think as we get older we know that more dangerous things happen."
"__HORROR__ That could be it and our imaginations are more vivid."
"__HORROR__ Yes and with those movies it is all about imagination."
