"__MOVIES__ I saw Ted the other day, that was a pretty funny movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is. The sequel isn't as good though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well, Is A Million Ways to Die in the West any good? Seth MacFarlane also made that."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen it. I've heard mixed things about it."
"__MOVIES__ It's weird how MacFarlane jumped from cartoons to making big budget comedies."
"__MOVIES__ Humor is humor, I guess. It's sort of surprising Matt Groening has never made a film."
"__MOVIES__ He had The Simpsons Movie, and there were those direct to DVD Futurama films."
"__MOVIES__ I meant a real movie, unconnected to any of his previous work like Ted."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe he just doesn't want to. Not everyone wants the stress of making a movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. The South Park guys have made a couple films and from what they said it's a really stressful process."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely is. Not many people can make the jump from TV to film."
"__MOVIES__ J. J. Abrams did. He had Felicity, and Alias before he made it big."
"__MOVIES__ But he was always a filmmaker at heart. He jumped from movies into TV before jumping back."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I guess he is similar to MacFarlane in a way. When it comes to film and TV, I mean."
"__MOVIES__ How exactly do you figure? One has made several shows and a couple movies, the other made a couple shows and several movies."
"__MOVIES__ They're both really good at getting film or TV projects off the ground, then leaving the hard work to other people!"
"__MOVIES__ So you're saying they're good producers?"
"__MOVIES__ Producing is the most important part of film-making. I'm sure they'd say that anyway."
"__MOVIES__ To be fair, they're not bad directors either."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's why they're movies are so successful even when they're not good. They're just that talented."
