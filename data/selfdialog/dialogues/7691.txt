"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you know if Lady Gaga speaks french?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No. Why do you ask?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Because she sings some of the lyrics in french for Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, you're right. It's only a few lines though, so she probably only learned a little bit for that song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, you're right."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's still cool that she sang some of it in french, though."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know. I love that song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me too. Did you ever watch the music video for it?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No. Is it any good?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, it's amazing. I would totally recommend that you watch it."
