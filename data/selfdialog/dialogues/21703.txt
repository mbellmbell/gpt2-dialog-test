"__DISNEY__ I feel like everyone remembers their first Disney movie. Like the one that came out when they were just old enough to go to the theater."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah. I remember my first was Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Me too!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I went with my Dad and my brother, and when we left the theater my dad had to pop the hood for something. It was so windy the hood flew back and hit the windshield!"
"__DISNEY__ So that's your big memory of The Little Mermaid, huh?"
"__DISNEY__ Ha, yeah. I think I was about five years old."
"__DISNEY__ I was a bit older. Maybe six. I remember the songs the most."
"__DISNEY__ Look at this stuff. Isn't it neat!"
"__DISNEY__ I ran around the house with a fork for WEEKS."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure your parents loved that!"
