"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you think of the rapper 'Eminem'?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Personally not such a fan. You?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wouldn't call myself a super fan, but I do like some of his first hits."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yea, I'd have to say that even I thought the song 'The Real Slim Shady' was pretty catchy."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ For sure. I also feel like even though I'm not a huge fan of his, I think he's really talented."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yea. He probably had to try twice as hard to get respect and recognition in the hip hop community."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why's that?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well he is a white rapper in a predominately black ruled genre of music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yea, this is true. You can really see that play out in his movie '8 Mile'."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yea and that movie was pretty much an autobiography."
