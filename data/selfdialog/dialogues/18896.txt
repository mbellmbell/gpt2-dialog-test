"__MOVIES__ Which movie series have been the most successful?"
"__MOVIES__ Well that depends on how you mean successful. The Fast and the Furious is by far the series with the most movies."
"__MOVIES__ Unless you count the Avengers movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's debatable. The Avenger movies could be a series separate from the Captain America movies, and the Ironman movies."
"__MOVIES__ Or you could go the other way and count all of those as part of the Avengers franchise, and include the Guardians of the Galaxy movies."
"__MOVIES__ Just because they're Marvel movies and Stan Lee mad an appearance doesn't make them part of the same franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of Chris Pratt: there's the Jurassic Park/World movies. I can't wait for the next one."
"__MOVIES__ Chris Pratt's reboot was silly but fun. There was the Tomb Raider franchise."
"__MOVIES__ That was only two movies, wasn't it? Is it a franchise if there are only two movies."
"__MOVIES__ Point taken. There were the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe movies."
"__MOVIES__ And the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies. So do you count those as two franchises or one."
"__MOVIES__ Gandalf makes it a single franchise. And speaking of Hugo Weaving movies, there was the Matrix franchise."
"__MOVIES__ There was the Indiana Jones franchise."
"__MOVIES__ That was excellent. And if you mention Harrison Ford, you have to mention the Star Wars franchise."
"__MOVIES__ And if you mention the Star Wars franchise, you have to mention the Star Trek franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Confuse them you must not."
"__MOVIES__ There was the Jaws franchise."
"__MOVIES__ No, not really. There was Jaws, and there's been an endless stream of bad shark movies every since."
"__MOVIES__ So is the Fast and the Furious or Star Wars franchise the longest running?"
"__MOVIES__ Ponder this I must."
