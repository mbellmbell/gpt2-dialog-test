"__MUSIC__ What'cha listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I've got the music from the movie 'The Hours' on as I'm working."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've seen that movie..."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't either, but I really like Phillip Glass on when I'm working."
"__MUSIC__ His name rings a bell for me, but I can't place him."
"__MUSIC__ He's a minimalist composer and film score writer, he uses meditative and simplified themes."
"__MUSIC__ Sort of like Hans Zimmer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, anyway the hours is really relaxing to put on as he plays through some nice themes."
"__MUSIC__ What else has he done?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he wrote the music for Scorcese's 'Kundun' which has some really nice tracks as well as films like 'Koyaniquatsi"
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of either of those, seems pretty obscure."
"__MUSIC__ No, he's actually pretty big, he was even parodies on South Park in their first season when they put on that Christmas play!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I've seen that episode but don't remember his name coming up."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, if you've seen 'Candyman' that is his work."
"__MUSIC__ He did the music to Candyman? I've seen it, but don't really recall iit"
"__MUSIC__ Yes,his work doesn't have a hummable theme like others because he builds it up through other means."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds interesting, do you recommend anything in particular of his?"
"__MUSIC__ I really enjoy this score, but if you want a slow introduction I would get Koyaniquatsi and the last track of Kundun to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to try those out, thanks for the tip!"
"__MUSIC__ Anytime! Oh, and you may want to listen to his sequel to Koya with Naquiqatsi when you finish."
