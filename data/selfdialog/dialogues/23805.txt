"__SUPERHERO__ Hey, how ya doing?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Great I just saw the new Wonder Woman movie last week."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh how was it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ It was great. I liked the story line, it was definitely not as cheesy as the one I saw back in the 80s!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Bet Gal Gadot was pretty easy on the eyes too!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yep, but she is actually a pretty tough woman in real life. She used to train with the Israely military."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh wow! That's crazy."
"__SUPERHERO__ I like the whole plot too, from the island she was being brought up, how she met the guy, and how she became The Wonder Woman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Any cool fight scenes?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Definitely! When she was fighting the soldiers and when she was fighting the villain. It's pretty cool."
