"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the Star Wars prequel movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean like Phantom Menace and all those? Yeah I like them"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're not my favorite movies. What did you like about them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well a lot of the characters they introduced were really cool. I especially like Darth Maul, even though he was only in one movie briefly"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hear they might make an Obi-Wan movie and that Darth Maul will still be alive in it"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? That would be extremely cool, I'd watch it"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, even though I don't like the prequel movies, I think Ewan McGregor did a great job as Obi-Wan"
"__STAR_WARS__ So do I. And I hear he'd like to be in an Obi-Wan movie if they make it"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well now I think they absolutely have to make it! What if Liam Neeson came back as the ghost of Qui-Gon?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That would make it even better! Qui-Gon is such an underrated character in the series"
