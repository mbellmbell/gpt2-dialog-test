"__MOVIES__ One small change to make a good movie, great?"
"__MOVIES__ I would change Star Wars episode 1. No Jar-jar."
"__MOVIES__ I'd change Rambo back to where he shoots himself after the first one"
"__MOVIES__ I can't honestly say I've ever seen Rambo."
"__MOVIES__ Me either, but from what i know, it was a fitting ending"
"__MOVIES__ Wait, so how does Rambo end?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know... But he doesnt shoot himself obviosuly as there are four more movies."
"__MOVIES__ haha, so you would just end it so there were no more sequels?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a great stand alone story. Vietnam vet does what he needs to do and then kills himself."
"__MOVIES__ But doesnt that hit a little close to home?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, sheds light on an issue. Makes a statement."
"__MOVIES__ For Elf, I would make James Caan still hate christmas."
"__MOVIES__ Why would that make it a great movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Santa would crash his sleigh into a bunch of people and then the Central Park Rangers would catch him."
"__MOVIES__ So the cops catch Santa and ruin christmas for everyone?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. The first noble truth of Buddhism: life is suffering."
"__MOVIES__ I would make the aliens from Close Encounters of the Third Kind the same as the aliens from ET"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember what they looked like."
"__MOVIES__ The aliens from Close Encounters are just the stereotypical greys. Long limbs, large eyes, no nose."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that would be good. It would kind of connect the UN mission with the government control from ET"
