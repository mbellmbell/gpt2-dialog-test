"__MUSIC__ Hey man, I heard some throw back jams last night. Had me in my element."
"__MUSIC__ What did you hear?"
"__MUSIC__ This internet radio station was playing Run-DMC, 2Pac, Biggie, NWA, some old Dr. Dre, some 50-Cent."
"__MUSIC__ I like all them. Do you like Rakim?"
"__MUSIC__ The R? The 13th Letter? Hell yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Rakim got this song called When I be on Da Mic. You ever hear it?"
"__MUSIC__ I got the video stored on my computer. I like the lyrics and he be wearing that gear."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. I like the song he made for the Juice soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you talking about Know The Ledge."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. That one and the Big Daddy Kane song that was on there, both them songs are fire."
"__MUSIC__ I been listening to Kane ever since he did that song Raw."
"__MUSIC__ Man, I like the Raw Remix. Here it comes..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was like the late eighties. We were banging Kane and like NWA."
"__MUSIC__ NWA took it to another level. That Straight out of Compton put the west coast on the map."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but you know Dre took all that over. Before he hooked up with Suge and Death Row."
"__MUSIC__ Naw man, when Suge had Death Row with Dre and Pac? The game was crazy."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. They dropped California Love and everybody lost their minds."
"__MUSIC__ But what about the original Chronic album?"
"__MUSIC__ You already know. That whole album is a classic."
"__MUSIC__ I still be listening to that whole CD from start to finish. Stranded on Death row, so duck when I swing my ish? CLASSIC."
