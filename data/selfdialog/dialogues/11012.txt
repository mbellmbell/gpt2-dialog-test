"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honey, wake up!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? What's happening?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You were dreaming again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dreaming? And you woke me up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You were having another nightmare."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was obvious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, first you let out a horrific scream..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I screamed again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And then you started to perspire terribly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I uess my pajamas are a bit moist..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then you began to sob uncontrollably."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeas. Again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some day you will get over it. Some day you will recover and your nightmares will be a thing of the past."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes dear.  Now go back to sleep."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK. Thanks dear."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And stop crying over the retirement of Peyton Manning. The Denver Broncos will just have to live without him, and you will too."
