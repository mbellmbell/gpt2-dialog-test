"__MOVIES__ It definitely deserved the Oscar. What other movies with lots of stories have you seen?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I saw the one called Valentines Day."
"__MOVIES__ Oh me too, this one I did not like, I thought it was very cliche and not very real, very fake story."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ The main guy proposes to his girl friend, she says no and the same night he is kissing his best friend."
"__MOVIES__ You are right, but I´ll recommend you another good movie of this type one that it´s called Love actually."
