"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you catch the season opener?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I saw it. I wasn't going to miss Romo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Romo kicked off the season Hall of Fame style."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he'll get in the Hall of Fame this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might make him wait, but he definitely has earned his spot in the Hall of Fame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you're probably right. They made Manning wait too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point. I wonder why they wait so long to induct players in the Hall of fame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably wait to they have a more consistent record of wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they should also get Brees in the Hall of Fame as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, Brees has at least 3 seasons before they consider him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he also has to have some playoff wins as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he's already won in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, Brees only played twice. He has no wins in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right. He hit the playoffs his second year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but he only missed the playoffs his rookie year by 3 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but teams would kill for his trade."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Apparently they rotate. I'vee seen a new started for 3 games straight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He proably has a season on two left."
