"__BASEBALL__ Do you like baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ To be honest, not really. What about you?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's okay. I used to hate it but it's grown on me in recent years."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh? Do you prefer watching pro or college baseball more?"
"__BASEBALL__ Like with most sports I generally prefer watching college."
"__BASEBALL__ Men or women?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well technically women would be softball, but that's a whole different conversation. Usually men but I'll occasionally check out the women's."
"__BASEBALL__ What is your favorite team?"
"__BASEBALL__ OU Sooners of course! University of Oklahoma all the way!"
"__BASEBALL__ OSU is better... at least in basketball. So why'd you start getting into baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ I used to play as a kid, but one day there was literally nothing on television so I watched a little bit of a game and ended up getting really into it."
"__BASEBALL__ Didn't you used to play?"
"__BASEBALL__ Kinda, but not really seriously. It was more of a forced hobby as a child."
"__BASEBALL__ Ah yeah. Same thing happened to me - probably why I hate it to this day."
"__BASEBALL__ I can see what. Did you play long?"
"__BASEBALL__ My parents forced me to do it a couple of summers. I wasn't bad at it by any means but it just didn't click with me/my interests."
"__BASEBALL__ Same, but I guess there were a few good memories. Probably why I'm starting to get into it - little bit of nostalgia."
"__BASEBALL__ The closest I'll get to it is via the Wii and even then..."
"__BASEBALL__ You'd rather play tennis than baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Absolutely. It's great you're getting into it again, but I just don't think I'll ever be even a casual fan of baseball."
