"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Rey will turn to the dark side in the next Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I kind of think she might.  She has a lot of anger."
"__STAR_WARS__ But she seems to have a lot of control over the force so far, even without training."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe Luke will turn to the dark side this time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think maybe Luke wants to get rid of both the light and dark side.  He seems tired of it all."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard there is a new character called Rose that is going to be in the new movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard that too, but I am not sure what her role will be yet."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also heard that the next movie is going to be a little darker."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am a little anxious since the title is called The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is a very vague title, but it could mean a few things."
