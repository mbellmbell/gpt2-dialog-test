"__DISNEY__ I really think Disney waited too long when they made Cars 3."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's like they create a movie, and then a decade later they make a sequel!"
"__DISNEY__ I totally agree! Anyways, who do you hate the most in Hercules?"
"__DISNEY__ Honestly, I'll have to go with Meg, hands down. She was a stereotypical epitome of a damsel in distress, and she was as skinny as a twig!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree. She looked really fragile, i was kind of afraid her hair might weigh her down!"
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha ha! Well, who was your favorite character in Hercules?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Phil was my favorite character, he was really helpful to Hercules and he never gave up on him."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Phil was pretty cool."
"__DISNEY__ Pretty cool?! TOTALLY COOL, more like it!!"
"__DISNEY__ I guess so..."
