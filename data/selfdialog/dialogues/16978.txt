"__MOVIES__ You seen any good movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I watched a pretty cool documentary yesterday."
"__MOVIES__ Please, documentaries do not count as movies; anything cooler than that?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure they do! A lot of documentaries have a lot of thought and planning behind them, and the cinematography can be beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe the technical side's all right, but the movie itself is always super boring."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever watched a documentary?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like whenever my grandfather had the history channel on or something."
"__MOVIES__ No no, I mean like a documentary that's more than just made for tv and longer than an hour."
"__MOVIES__ Why would I want to be bored for even longer than an hour?"
"__MOVIES__ Trust me, some documentaries are really great and fascinating, you just have to find one that talks about something you're interested in."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, okay, I'll bite. What did you watch yesterday?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a YouTube Red documentary called Kedi, and it's about cats."
"__MOVIES__ ...You watched a documentary, over an hour long, about cats. You're not selling the idea here."
"__MOVIES__ No no, it was actually really cool. It's about the way people and cats interact with each other in Istanbul."
"__MOVIES__ Why is Turkey so special? Are they the ones that worship cats or something?"
"__MOVIES__ That was ancient Egypt, and no. The reason Istanbul is special is because no one owns cats, they just live alongside them."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ So, all the street cats just interact with the humans like they're people. They go in people's homes and stores and stuff any time they want."
"__MOVIES__ What? How does that work?"
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty cool and a neat perspective on our relationship with animals. Of course, to find out more, you'd have to watch the documentary. Not so boring now, huh?"
