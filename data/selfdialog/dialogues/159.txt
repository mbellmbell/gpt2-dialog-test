"__MUSIC__ Do you like classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually I do, I really like Chopin."
"__MUSIC__ Moonlight Sonata is my favorite classical song ever."
"__MUSIC__ That is such a beautiful song yet so simple."
"__MUSIC__ It's mesmerizing. I love The Phantom of the Opera."
"__MUSIC__ Did you hear Sara Brightman's version of that song?"
"__MUSIC__ No I've never heard it before. Is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ It's great, I love it. They put a little rock element into the song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's so cool, I'll take a listen."
"__MUSIC__ I also like Beethoven and his symphonies. What I would have given to be there while he was writing them."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been to any operas?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I saw Carmen live. It was okay but it was more boring than what I expected."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's surprising. I've never been to an opera but I've been to a symphony before."
"__MUSIC__ So have I, it's amazing hearing so many instruments live."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it is. I'd love to see The Color Purple the musical live."
"__MUSIC__ I had a chance to see it but my friend backed out at the last minute."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's a shame. They're still doing shows though so you have a chance."
"__MUSIC__ I'm gonna see it one day. That and the Lion King musical."
"__MUSIC__ That one is highly successful. But then again the songs are great."
"__MUSIC__ Yes just like Frozen it's hard to get the Lion King songs out of your head."
