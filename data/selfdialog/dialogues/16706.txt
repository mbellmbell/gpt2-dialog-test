"__MOVIES__ I just saw the new Transformers."
"__MOVIES__ They made a new Transformers?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It's called Transformers: The Last Knight."
"__MOVIES__ Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ I think you already know the answer to that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I heard it was pretty terrible. Michael Bay hasn't made a good movie since Bad Boys"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, I actually liked Pain & Gain too!"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see that one."
"__MOVIES__ It had The Rock and Mark Wahlberg in it. They were amazing"
"__MOVIES__ I love The Rock! I thought I'd seen all of his stuff."
"__MOVIES__ It only came out a few years ago, but it wasn't in theaters for very long I don't think. If you really like The Rock, give it a shot."
"__MOVIES__ So Bad Boys and Pain & Gain are Michael Bay's only good movies I guess."
"__MOVIES__ I think that old movie he did called The Rock was also pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, there was a movied called The Rock too? Let me guess, the main actor was Dwayne Johnson?"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, no, it was a Sean Connery film from the 90s. It was really cool, especially for its time."
"__MOVIES__ Woah, that was confusing! He has to do a sequel now, though, and hire The Rock."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely, I think with all the remakes Hollywood is doing it would be pretty good!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, glad to know the new Transformers isn't worth it. Was thinking about going to see a movie later and now I know one to avoid."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, I thought you didn't know it was playing?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't, but now I won't be tempted to go see it and can give in to my inner child and see Cars 3 instead."
