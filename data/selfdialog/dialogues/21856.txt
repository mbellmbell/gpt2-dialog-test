"__DISNEY__ I rewatched The Little Mermaid over the weekend."
"__DISNEY__ How was it."
"__DISNEY__ Good, actually, I wasn't sure it would hold up over time."
"__DISNEY__ Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ Some movies from oru childhood loose their touch as we get old, this was still really good."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like anything more then when you were a kid."
"__DISNEY__ I found i liked the music more, maybe I understood the lyrics better."
"__DISNEY__ I could see that.  The music for that movie was really good."
"__DISNEY__ It was, and I liked Sabastion even more, he was really funny."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, when he's trapped in the kitchen with the chef cooking all the seafood, thats a great scene."
