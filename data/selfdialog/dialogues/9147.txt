"__BASEBALL__ Who are the top Rookie of the Year candidates for this season?"
"__BASEBALL__ Benintendi and I dunno."
"__BASEBALL__ You a Sox fan or is that just your guess?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nah I'm a Rangers fan actually. Just think Benintendi is the front runner."
"__BASEBALL__ I like him, but wow, you're a Rangers fan and didn't say Gallo?"
"__BASEBALL__ Does Gallo have eligibility? He's played small parts in three seasons."
"__BASEBALL__ Hmmm good point."
"__BASEBALL__ I just checked he had 133 ab the last 2 years and the cutoff is 130 so nah he's ineligible."
"__BASEBALL__ Oooh so close, that stinks."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. Even though I'm a Rangers fan and like the longball, he's not exactly doing much else at the plate either."
"__BASEBALL__ What about Swanson for the NL?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah maybe, he's a popular pick but I can't call the National League. Thinking pitcher for some reason."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right there, I was thinking possibly Glasnow but no one is really head n shoulders."
"__BASEBALL__ Bell for the Pirates too...he's in the mix for NL ROY I'd think."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe Renfroe and Margot for the Padres, but Petco might dampen their stats in comparison to others."
"__BASEBALL__ Those are two other good choices. NL has a lot of young talent this year."
"__BASEBALL__ It'll probably be some guys we've never even heard of that come up and get hot that win and we'll all be wrong lol."
"__BASEBALL__ LOl yea. Speaking of hot, what about Aaron Judge?"
"__BASEBALL__ How could we forget that lol I think he's got a leg up on Benintendi at the moment."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I change my pick lol"
