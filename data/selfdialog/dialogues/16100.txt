"__ROCK__ Did you know that Tool is releasing a new album?"
"__ROCK__ Are you serious? No, I had no idea."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, apparently its coming out soon and they're also going to tour again."
"__ROCK__ Wow. I'd pretty much given up on Manyard ever doing anything with Tool again."
"__ROCK__ I know, when he started yet another side band, I figured Tool was done."
"__ROCK__ At least all of his side bands are really good."
"__ROCK__ True. I really do like A Perfect Circle and Puscifer."
"__ROCK__ I went and saw Puscifer last year."
"__ROCK__ How were they?"
"__ROCK__ Incredible, but unfortunately, Manyard made use all promise not to talk about it."
