"__DISNEY__ Why was Moana so bad?"
"__DISNEY__ What?  Bad, how do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ I just didn't like the film.  It was boring."
"__DISNEY__ I completely disagree, why do you say that?"
"__DISNEY__ It took forever to get to point."
"__DISNEY__ You mean that the island really wasn't bad, just misunderstood?"
"__DISNEY__ Right.  Spent way too much time on Maui dinking around."
"__DISNEY__ You're probably on your own island with this stance."
"__DISNEY__ Hey, just saying, sometimes Disney dropped the ball and they did on this one."
"__DISNEY__ You're entitled to your opinion I guess."
