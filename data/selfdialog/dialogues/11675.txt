"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, are you looking forward to football this fall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah for sure. It is definitely one of my favorite times of the year. Any picks for who is going to do well this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think the Steelers will be good. And probably the Patriots again. They just seem kind of unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know what you mean. Tom Brady is just amazingly good, even though he is getting older."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it just seems that you can put any players around him and he can produce big plays and wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're right, for sure. I don't know if I am sold on the Steelers though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How come? I thought you were a big Pittsburgh fan. Plus, they always seem to do pretty well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no, I still am. And I want them to do well. It's just that for the first time in awhile, I think their shortcomings are really starting to show."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Like where? It seems in some ways, all they can do is go up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not as sure about that as I once was. I think Big Ben isn't what he used to be, and is really starting to show his age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I guess I don't totally disagree with that. But, I mean he still produces pretty well, and the Steelers do have some younger talent that is pretty impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, no, you're right about that. It's just that they have always been a real 'leadership-needy' kind of team to me, and if a lot of that leadership comes from Ben, and he is starting to slow down, that could not be good news."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I see your point there. I guess we will have to just wait and see if it actually is a problem on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think you're right. But besides the Steelers, I am pretty excited about Texas football this season; I think the Cowboys and the Texans can both be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I wouldn't have pegged them as frontrunners."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think they are the kind of teams that can be surprising; you can never tell what they are going to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am with you there. They just seem to have either really good or bad seasons; nothing in the middle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. I just have a feeling that they could both be on the rise this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean. I guess we just have to wait and see. It looks like it is going to be a good season no matter what!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah! I can't wait!"
