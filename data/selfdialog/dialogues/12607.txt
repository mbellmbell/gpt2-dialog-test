"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You ready for the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure am, what do you think the Colts will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate to say it, but I think they'll be pretty bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, it all depends on Andrew Luck though. He needs to carry this team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carry this team is right, they're awful if he's not playing well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I agree, the Colts front office has really let Andrew down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that cupboard is bare."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No help in the offseason for Hilton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope none, plus they have a running back in Frank Gore who could be in AARP soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah very little planning ahead by them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate that Chuck Pagano is still coach too.  He is terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, remember that fake punt play last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, Pagano should have been fired right there on the spot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I couldn't believe that he wasn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is their tight end this year? Is it still the guy from Stanford?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it's a new guy, I think they got rid of him last year. Some guy named Swoope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I hope he's good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah me too. I think anyone will be better than Fleener."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right, Fleener."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well let's go Colts!"
