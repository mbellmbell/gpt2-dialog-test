"__STAR_WARS__ So do you think Rey is related to Luke Skywalker?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I doubt it. Wouldn't Luke remember her?"
"__STAR_WARS__ We only saw Luke for one scene. Maybe he did recognize her."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who would her mother be? We never heard word of Luke marrying or anything like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ In the books, he married Mara Jade."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's not in the movie, though. I doubt they're related."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess so. Luke Skywalker isn't the only Jedi in the world."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Luke might have trained her, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe she was hidden away when Kylo Ren massacred the Jedi trainees."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would explain why she was abandoned on Jakku."
