"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hi there, I am gettin really excited at for the upcoming season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! Go RAMS."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, man. I like the Rams but I am a Packer fan!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, nice. Rogers is one of the best Quarterbacks of all time so I watch the Packers too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I was not always a Packer fan but I have been since 1991."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did you like before that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was an Oakland fan. But it was because I was raised that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, got it! My dad raised me a Steelers fan and I switched when I was in highschool too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yep, exactly!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just love football season in general, man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed! I want to see the Patriots line up this year and see if we can see any change up in the solid program they have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I have not heard about much. I also wanna see where Tony Romo goes this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I heard he might be going to the Broncos actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What! Oh wow that would be crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I used to love the Broncos when they had Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ oh, yeah the good old days!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know it, the rules have changed so much and the regulations are such that it feels like a different game sometimes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, the game we grew up on has evolved so much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The best part is that the players are safer now days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with that! I like knowing less concussion on the field!!"
