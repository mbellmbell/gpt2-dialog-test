"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I listen to all kinds of music!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you like progressive rock?"
"__MUSIC__ What's progressive rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Think keyboards, odd-time signatures, stuff not usually played on top 40 radio."
"__MUSIC__ Oh.  Well, hmmm.  Not sure.  Can you provide any idea of what I might have heard before?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure!  Think Genesis before they got really popular."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so before Invisible Touch, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes - back when Phil Collins was just the drummer and not the singer."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I've heard that type of stuff."
"__MUSIC__ How about Rush?  Yes?"
"__MUSIC__ I know those!  Tom Sawyer, right? Owner Of A Lonely Heart?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, now we're getting somewhere. Rush is a progressive band.  So is Yes."
"__MUSIC__ But Owner Of A Lonely Heart and Tom sawyer - are they typical 'Progressive' songs?"
"__MUSIC__ No and Yes  Owner isn't, Tom Sawyer is."
"__MUSIC__ I don't follow."
"__MUSIC__ Tom Sawyer has odd-time signatures (it's not four on the floor) and tons going on for being a 4 and a half minute song."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, it's quite busy."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, progressive rock can be - in a word - busy."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting!  I'll need to check some more progressive rock out!"
