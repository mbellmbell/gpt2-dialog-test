"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been a Rolling Stones fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. I love the Rolling Stones."
"__MUSIC__ Really? How long have you been a fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Ever since I was age 9, so that makes it about 45 years. For some reason their music has always been cool to me."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! You're a die hard loyal fan I must say. What is your favorite song by them?"
"__MUSIC__ O it's hard to say, there are so many. I tend to still like their oldies the best but then there are some from the latter years I'm still loving a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Their album from 1981 Tattoo You is still great."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yea! I love Start Me Up!"
"__MUSIC__ I can dance to that one with a lot of nerdy moves."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, dancing is a good thing though no matter how you do it."
"__MUSIC__ I love how Mick changes the words from Start It Up to Start Me Up for some reason in this song."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I noticed that too, the transition is very creatively done."
"__MUSIC__ Mick Jagger and Keith Richards will always be the best, very creative and talented guys. Still watch their videos on Youtube now and then."
"__MUSIC__ Youtube is great for that. I agree, no one can come close to how they perform. Not even the Beatles in my opinion!"
"__MUSIC__ Now many people will probably disagree with you in that."
"__MUSIC__ Are you one of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh no! I still remain true to my favorite band in the whole world. Brian Jones was also a favorite but it was sad he died."
"__MUSIC__ You are very loyal, and yes it was a tragic about Brian Jones."
"__MUSIC__ Lots of bands go through things like that it seems."
"__MUSIC__ Yes they do and this band always seemed to know how to get through it the best. They keep going strong even at their ages."
