"__BASKETBALL__ I am sick of Isiah Thomas."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree."
"__BASKETBALL__ He gets superstar calls for no reason."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean his offense is fun so I am sure the NBA is slightly encouraging it."
"__BASKETBALL__ I really hope you are wrong but it does seem he is getting lots of calls lately."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I feel bad for him too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that stuff with his sister was terrible."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly, and he still is carrying his team all alone."
"__BASKETBALL__ What are you trying to say about Kelly Olynik?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That he is terrible at basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree.  Plus he is dirty as could be."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he clearly is out there injuring people."
"__BASKETBALL__ Or at least trying to."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I wonder why the league has not done anything about it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably since it is impossible to prove."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well they could watch what he is doing out there. It is definitely dangerous."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but all players do stuff like that and it just looks like basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ If you aren't paying attention I could see that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well maybe they have said something to the Celtics."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hopefully, also hopefully they tell him to fix his hair.  Its terrible."
