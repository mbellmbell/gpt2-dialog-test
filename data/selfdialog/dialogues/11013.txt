"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many more Superbowls do you think Brady can win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet he has one more in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Manning and Elway went out on top. I see Brady doing it too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he's the greatest ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better than Montana?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wonder what Drew Bledsoe thinks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, old Drew never got his job back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a really good QB too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but nothing like Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't argue with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe because his balls were deflated?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's just wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, that deflategate was a waste of money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had hoped the team would keep Mallett as a backup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy from Arkansas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ `Yea, I think he had a ton of potential."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't doubt the coach though."
