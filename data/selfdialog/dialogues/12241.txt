"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the greatest running back in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Since I've been watching, probably either Barry Sanders or Emmitt Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were both pretty great, had a different style."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always thought Emmitt Smith would run through tackles, but Barry Sanders was very elusive, and could run around defenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marshawn Lynch was a lot like both of them, but he seemed to have a ton of power."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear that Marshawn Lynch came out of retirement?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I heard that he's going to play for Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he still at the top of his game, the Raiders could win a lot of games next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, with Derek Carr and Amari Cooper they could score a lot of points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Amari Cooper is going to go down as one of the greatest receivers ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, if he can keep playing with good quarterbacks. I think it helped Jerry Rice that he played with Joe Montana and Steve Young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Jerry Rice was the best receiver ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the only one that comes close in my mind was Calvin Johnson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Randy Moss and Terrell Owens were two of the best ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they could've been, they just didn't seem to have the same work ethic as someone like Jerry Rice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Work ethic is always pretty important, that's why I like Larry Fitzgerald."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Larry Fitzgerald is one of my favorites as well. He's a great player, and seems to be a good guy all around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I imagine Larry Fitzgerald is going to retire soon. Hopefully he and Carson Palmer can have one more good season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carson Palmer has been playing NFL football for 15 seasons, he's running out of time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could have a few more good seasons if he can stay healthy. Just look at Tom Brady."
