"__BASEBALL__ Hey do you play any sports?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not recently. But I did play baseball in high school?"
"__BASEBALL__ No way! Me too!"
"__BASEBALL__ Sweet, did you go on in college."
"__BASEBALL__ I wasn't recruited at all, but I did play on a club team. It was more of an excuse to get together and drink."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I played for a while in college, but stopped after freshman year. It was too much!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I'd been playing since t-ball, so it was weird to stop, that's why I joined the club team."
"__BASEBALL__ I've thought about starting up an adult league around here."
"__BASEBALL__ That sounds sweet!"
"__BASEBALL__ Would you be interested?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, totally. I think I have a couple buddies that would be too."
"__BASEBALL__ I was shortstop in college."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah me too! My roommate was a pitcher. I haven't talked to him about uit, but he'd probably be down."
"__BASEBALL__ Sweet!"
"__BASEBALL__ Have you thought about where we would play?"
"__BASEBALL__ KInd of, I think maybe Oak Park. If we do it on a weekday I think there will be space."
"__BASEBALL__ That'd be sweet, not too far from my apartment."
"__BASEBALL__ Sweet! I'll ask my roommate and maybe put an ad on craigslist."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, keep me posted! My schedule's pretty open after work."
"__BASEBALL__ Nice. Play ball!"
