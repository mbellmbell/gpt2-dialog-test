"__MOVIES__ You like Peter Jackson movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Lord of the Rings is my fave."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen his earlier films?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ The Frighteners, for one. There's also a really twisted bizarre puppet film called Meet the Feebles. I don't recommend it."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't recommend it unless you are not at all easily offended and you want to see something that is beyond weird."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite film of his is called Heavenly Creatures."
"__MOVIES__ What is that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the true story of two girls from New Zealand. It's about their friendship."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds uneventful."
"__MOVIES__ No. It's eventful. I just don't want to spoil it for you."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I probably won't ever see it."
"__MOVIES__ It's about two girls who are both extremely creative and very much drawn together in a very intense way."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. So it's like a lesbian love movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Not really. It's an intense friendship. But an intense female friendship being perceived as being romantic love by others does play a part in the plot."
"__MOVIES__ So, I was kind of right."
"__MOVIES__ It was Kate Winslet's first film."
"__MOVIES__ I loved her in Titanic."
