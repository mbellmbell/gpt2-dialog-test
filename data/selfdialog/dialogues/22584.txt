"__DISNEY__ I can't believe they are making another Toy Story!"
"__DISNEY__ I am a little worried about it.  I thought the third one was perfect."
"__DISNEY__ The third one made me cry!  I thought it wrapped up the movies perfectly."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure how they are going to do the voices for all of the characters since some of the voice actors have passed away."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that.  Which characters have passed away?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm pretty sure the voice for slinky dog and maybe Hamm."
"__DISNEY__ Those are pretty big characters.  It will be interested to see what they do with them."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder what they plot line will be, since Andy gave the toys away."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe it will start with the little girl being older again."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe it will be some kind of flashback movie."
