"__MUSIC__ This album was created in late 2012."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, interesting. That year was a great year for cinema!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, which allowed for more music to be put out into the world!"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, you think there are any new music genres that may come up?"
"__MUSIC__ I heard about these two new genres, which everyone likes hearing in the midnight dusk."
"__MUSIC__ Which ones are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Ever heard of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and Trap?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, no."
"__MUSIC__ Well, those music genres are usually played in the nighttime, when everyone's drunk and partying til the early morning!"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, did these genres come out recently?"
"__MUSIC__ EDM actually existed back in the 70s and 80s in the UK, but it spread to the US later on"
"__MUSIC__ Why do these music genres always gotta come from the UK?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, not all of them originate from the UK, but a lot of our music is derived from it,"
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess we take things for granted with our ex-mother country."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ However, what do you think of any new music genres coming up?"
"__MUSIC__ Ummm, not sure. Anything else to talk about?"
"__MUSIC__ What's on your mind?"
"__MUSIC__ Thinking about what fur coat to buy my girlfriend!"
