"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I did. Have you seen it."
"__DISNEY__ No not yet, I don't think it will be as good as the original."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was so nice to see Belle's beautiful dress, and see the Mrs. Pots, Chip, Lumier and Cogsworth come to life."
"__DISNEY__ I just didn't like how they made Cogsworth, Lumier and the maid feather duster look. I don't think they look as good as the original. Also, the CGI effects for the beast are very unrealistic."
"__DISNEY__ I really liked how everyone came to life, and they even made the songs like 'Be Our Guest' look excellent!"
"__DISNEY__ I am also not very happy about the added story line at the beginning of the movie. I don't think they needed to add a scene about her mothers death in a children's movie. It wasn't in the original and it doesn't make the movie better at all."
"__DISNEY__ I think it is good to see the back story behind Belle and her father, but it is a little much for a children's movie."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe I will see it I really like the sound track of the movie. Belle, the beast and Gaston did such a good job singing and the song 'tale as old as time' when Belle and the beast are dancing sounds so romantic!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree the soundtrack is beautiful, I think you should see it so you can compare every part of it to the origional!"
