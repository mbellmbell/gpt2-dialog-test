"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to 'Portugal. The Man?'"
"__MUSIC__ Is that the actual name of the group?  I've never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  They're an American rock band from Alaska."
"__MUSIC__ What type of music are they best known for?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say psychedelic pop and indie rock."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's an interesting combo."
"__MUSIC__ I think you would like them a lot."
"__MUSIC__ What is a song of theirs that I might listen to and enjoy?"
"__MUSIC__ Try 'Feel it Still.'  Very good example of Psychedelic pop."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I am definitely intrigued."
"__MUSIC__ I saw them in Bonnarroo.  They were so good."
"__MUSIC__ I've never been to Bonnarroo either."
"__MUSIC__ These groups.  They're good recorded, but even better live."
"__MUSIC__ Music is a rather personal experience for me, so I really prefer to listen on my own at home."
"__MUSIC__ That is fair.  Though you do miss out on specific things you can't get on the recorded audio?"
"__MUSIC__ Such as?"
"__MUSIC__ The fact that these guys just have such great stage presence.  They really know how to put on a show."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose you're right about that aspect.  You go to live shows often?"
"__MUSIC__ Not as often as I'd like.  They are rather expensive."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose that means your going to 'Portugal. The Man's' concert was indicative of just how worth it they are."
