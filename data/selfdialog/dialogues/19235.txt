"__MOVIES__ You know there are coming out with the third Despicable Me movie."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the first and second one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think they are so funny. I pretend I am watching them for the kids but I enjoy them as much as the kids do."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there are some really funny lines in them."
"__MOVIES__ I think the minions are so cute. I get a real kick out of them laughing."
"__MOVIES__ Gru is funny too."
"__MOVIES__ Steve Carell does a great job playing him. In the previews it looks like Gru has a twin brother."
"__MOVIES__ When is the release date?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it said, June 30th this year."
"__MOVIES__ Are you taking the kids to the theater or going to wait until it is on the television."
"__MOVIES__ I will have to take the kids to the theater, they are so excited about seeing it."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we can all go together."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good to me. I guess Gru loses his job and he turns back into a villain."
"__MOVIES__ I did see a preview with the minions in prison striped clothes."
"__MOVIES__ I love those little girls. They are drawn so cutely."
"__MOVIES__ I know they are adorable. Have they made dolls of the girls?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure but I think they would be good sellers."
"__MOVIES__ I would buy them for my girls. They like the minions."
"__MOVIES__ I would like to have some minions to do my housework for me."
"__MOVIES__ When I was a kid my parents treated us like minions but I can't get my kids to make their own beds."
