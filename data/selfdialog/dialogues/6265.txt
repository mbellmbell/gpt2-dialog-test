"__STAR_WARS__ Have you heard about the latest leak that says Luke was on that deserted planet looking for lost jedi artifacts?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have heard that. And in the new trailer, he says something about the jedi coming to an end. I wonder what that means?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it's titled the last jedi. I assume he's the last jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ But why wouldn't he train Rey and have her become one as well? Maybe she's the last jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's really hard to say. Although I get the feeling that on Luke's journey, he's learned a lot of dark secrets about the jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ It really is amazing how far he's come since training on Dagobah with Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I guess all those piggy back rides really did him some wonders!"
"__STAR_WARS__ On another note, I really wish Yoda were still alive."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's still around as a force ghost! You know Qui Gon Jinn originally learned that technique right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well yeah, according to Clone Wars canon, he did, and that's how he passed it on to Yoda. I wonder if the sith have any comparable techniques."
