"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to win the superbowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, the patriots are always good so they're a good bet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the cowboys have a strong team with Dak and Elliot"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good point, but I do like my Packers! They have a great receiving core and a solid offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers is a beast, have you seen his TD to INT ratio? It's off the charts!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but he needs to stay healthy, remember when he was injured by the bears? Even last year he was injured a bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He can be legendary if he could only win more superbowls"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but Favre only won 1 and he's still legendary"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose, but look at Brady, he's probably going to be remembered as the best QB of all time"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe he's still playing at such a high level, if only Rodgers had such great teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this year it's fiinally the packers year don't you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibly, but there are so many more options"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you had the first pick in our fantasy draft who would you take"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rodgers no doubt"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See then clearly the Packers are one of the frontrunners!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Brady is a close second"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then again you can't discount injuries"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, whichever team weathers the injury storm the best will likely be in the best position"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Totally agree, you look at the past superbowl winning teams and they all were miraculously healthy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, only time will tell which team will avoid the injury bug, here's to a safe and competitive NFL season!"
