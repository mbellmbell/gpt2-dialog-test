"__MOVIES__ So what are you up to this evening?"
"__MOVIES__ Movie night at home. My choice!!"
"__MOVIES__ What  genre are you going to choose?"
"__MOVIES__ I have chosen for our fine viewing pleasure the  for a dramatic evening of suspense. TMNT!!"
"__MOVIES__ What are you talking about? I have no clue what TMNT is."
"__MOVIES__ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!! The movie with real people not animated. I love to watch those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding me! I totally forgot about those movies."
"__MOVIES__ The one where they go back in time is my favorite. TMNT 111"
"__MOVIES__ I used to watch the animated series."
"__MOVIES__ I like the animated stuff too but the movies are fun."
"__MOVIES__ Will you ever grow up?"
"__MOVIES__ No too late now. I'm stuck in this forever weirdness that is me."
"__MOVIES__ I have to say you keep me guessing what is going to come out of that eclectic bean of yours!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know why I like some of the things I do at my age. I guess it's because age is just a number. It always has been."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in that one that i might know?"
"__MOVIES__ No I don't think so. It is a time travel back to feudal Japan."
"__MOVIES__ Time travel of course it makes total sense that large turtles would go time traveling!!"
"__MOVIES__ Who would have it otherwise."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll just leave that whole class of movies for you to enjoy."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks I shall do that!"
