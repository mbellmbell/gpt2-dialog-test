"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright we discussed Julio Jones and Odell Beckham Jr. but where does Antonio Brown fall into this?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Antonio Brown I would have right there with Julio Jones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my opinion I think Antonio Brown is a better wide receiver. He's a lot more dynamic on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're tied in talents and ability and I don't think many will argue one is far better than the other they're both the top wide receivers today."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Pittsburgh Steelers are always so consistent year in and year out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really are except they can't seem to avoid the big injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the Big Ben injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Ben Roethlisberger is so tough but he always falls to unfortunate injuries that dampens their hopes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ben is a top quarterback in this league, he's a Superbowl champ. He has awesome weapons on the offense and the Steelers always seem to reload their offense for him every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the current word on Le'veon Bell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's still holding out and there's the contract situation going on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope they work that out because the Steelers can't afford to lose Le'veon Bell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I can't see the Steelers not making it work. Bell is too valuable for them to not go after."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Imagine if Bell went to the Ravens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be heartbreaking for all the Steeler fans. He would go to one of their most hated rivals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Steelers can challenge the Patriots this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they can if they get Bell back!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Big Ben needs to stay healthy too and Antonio Brown too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really enjoy Steeler games because of the action and offensive excitement. It wouldn't be the same if Bell left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping he stays! We'll see in time."
