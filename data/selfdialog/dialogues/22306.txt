"__DISNEY__ I heard your son dressed up as Woody from Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he looked adorable."
"__DISNEY__ He was missing his best pal though, Buzz Lightyear.  Don't they become friends at the end of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ They do, and we tried to get his friend to dress up as Buzz, but it didn't happen."
"__DISNEY__ That's too bad."
"__DISNEY__ He even had a fake snake in his boot."
"__DISNEY__ Why?"
"__DISNEY__ Because Woody would always say, 'There's a Snake in My Boot!'"
"__DISNEY__ I remember that now,  and 'Reach for the Skies.'"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Woody had a lot of great sayings."
