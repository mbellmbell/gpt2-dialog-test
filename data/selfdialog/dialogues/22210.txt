"__DISNEY__ I watched Beauty and the Beast for the first time last night."
"__DISNEY__ That movie is a classic! What did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Belle is great, but I think she is too good to be with the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I think that's the point of the movie though - the beast isn't really that bad when you get to know him."
"__DISNEY__ I guess so. I really like the fact that Belle loves to read."
"__DISNEY__ I love when the Beast shows her the library and she gets so excited."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I wish I could have a library like Belle."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like the soundtrack?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved the soundtrack. I can't stop singing 'This Provencial Life'"
"__DISNEY__ My favorite song is Be Our Guest."
