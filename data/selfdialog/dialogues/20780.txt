"__THRILLER__ Do you like Stephen Kings movies? He's my favorite author!"
"__THRILLER__ Yes. My favorite of his is The Shining"
"__THRILLER__ I love all of his movies but my all time favorite is The Stand"
"__THRILLER__ I don't think I've ever seen that"
"__THRILLER__ Really?! You need to watch it! It was a miniseries on tv. I also love Cujo and Carrie"
"__THRILLER__ Me too, I've seen both of those too."
"__THRILLER__ Carrie was really good! when I first saw it, I was like 13. Scared me back then lol"
"__THRILLER__ Lol..it is a creepy movie that's for sure"
