"__THRILLER__ So what's your favorite classic thriller?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I have so many favorites, don't ask me to choose. Touch of Evil is one of the greats, I guess"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I love that flick. The manly hero is Charlton Heston, and the lovely woman in jeopardy is Janet Leigh."
"__THRILLER__ Un-huh. Suspense provided by lustful bomb-wielding gangsters for a thrill a minute, directed by Orson Welles. What's your favorite?"
"__THRILLER__ Hmm--maybe Night of the Hunter, from 1955. This time it's children in jeopardy."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that evil sanctimonious preacher-man. He stalks the stolen loot, and goes after the innocent kids to get it."
"__THRILLER__ Plus, he has LOVE tattooed on one hand, and HATE on the other. Robert Mitchum at his most terrifying."
"__THRILLER__ Did you know Charles Laughton actually directed it? It's the only film he ever directed, and it's a suspense masterpiece."
"__THRILLER__ Mitchum sterred in another wonderful thriller, too. I mean the original version of Cape Fear."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, Robert De Niro is a great actor, and he tried, but he had nothing on Mitchum in the remake."
