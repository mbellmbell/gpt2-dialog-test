"__MOVIES__ Hey Martin, what are you doing?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, hey Doc, I'm about to plug my guitar into this giant amp!"
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't do that If I were you, there's a short in that one.  You should try this smaller one instead!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, thanks for the warning.  You know, this reminds me of the movie Back to the Future!"
"__MOVIES__ Right, at the begining of the movie Marty gets blown into some boxes by a bad amp."
"__MOVIES__ Right, I love that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  Did you know that someone else was going to play Marty, but he didn't work out?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I couldn't imagine anyone but Michael J Fox as Marty."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right?  You can see some of the scenes shot with the other guy on YouTube."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, what else do you know about Back to the Future?"
"__MOVIES__ Let me think, well Huey Lewis, the singer makes a cameo?"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  I didn't know that!  Didn't he do some songs for the movie too?"
"__MOVIES__ He sure did, Power of Love and Back in time are both featured in the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I love those songs."
"__MOVIES__ Same here.  Huey was nominated for an Academy Award for his music."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome!  What other facts do you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there are a lot of subtle jokes in the movie, like Star Wars and Star Trek references."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, do you enjoy the sequels as well?"
"__MOVIES__ I do, they aren't as good as the original, but they are still decent movies."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  We should have a Back to the Future marathon soon!"
