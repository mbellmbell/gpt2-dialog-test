"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's the kind of stuff I like, those Irish guys you sent me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Class A'z?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I like their flow. Kind of reminds me of Tupac."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really? I didn't think they were similar at all."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well to me they are."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What is it exactly you like?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Just how smooth and flowing and relaxed it is."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I gotcha. I find Tupac's aural components relaxing whereas Class A'z lyrical construction relaxes me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think that's what I mean."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah and like that music video of their I sent you I thought was a good example of that."
