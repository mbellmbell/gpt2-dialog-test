"__COMEDY__ Have you seen the old Airplane movies from the 70s?"
"__COMEDY__ I grew up on those movies! I love all the cute little puns."
"__COMEDY__ Those were great movies and a little risque for their time."
"__COMEDY__ I agree totally. Have you seen Bridesmaids?"
"__COMEDY__ That was hilarious. Melissa McCarthy is so funny it's ridiculous."
"__COMEDY__ I loved her in The Boss. She really played that part well."
"__COMEDY__ That's true. She took a little heat for her weight at the beginning but I think people see that her talent outweighs all that."
"__COMEDY__ Absolutely true. I loved her in Ghostbusters."
"__COMEDY__ Leslie Jones was really funny in that too. She's another one who's been criticized for her looks."
"__COMEDY__ That's a shame. They're both really great talented actresses and extremely funny."
