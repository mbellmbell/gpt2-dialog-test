"__STAR_WARS__ Is Rey related to Luke or not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hard to say.  I'm guessing we'll find out in the next movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ It almost seems like she shouldn't be at this point."
"__STAR_WARS__ So there's so much speculation she is that it might be a buzzkill to actually learn she is."
"__STAR_WARS__ Blame the internet for that.  People share thoughts too easily."
"__STAR_WARS__ I personally think we'll find that she isn't."
"__STAR_WARS__ You don't think so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The galaxy is a massive place.  Maybe she just has the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or maybe everyone has the force, they just don't know how to use it."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a great thought and would make for an interesting roundtable discussion."
