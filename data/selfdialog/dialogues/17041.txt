"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie ' A Dog's Purpose'?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think, isn't that the one with the contraversy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they had a lot of flack over the mistreatment of one of the dogs."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I thought, was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a pretty good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Did it seem like the dogs were mistreated?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was the german shepherd that was getting the attention for mistreatment."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, not all the dogs?"
"__MOVIES__ No, just the german shepherd and yeah the scene with the water the dog did look pretty scared."
"__MOVIES__ That stinks, how was it otherwise?"
"__MOVIES__ It was good, the german shepherd's part was pretty small, the majority of the movie is about a retriever."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it follows one dog's soul through several rebirths."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, if you believe it is possible."
"__MOVIES__ Well, whether you believe or not, it was a cute movie.  Puppies are always cute."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, can't go wrong with puppies."
"__MOVIES__ I did have some adult themes like alcoholism but was worked in a way that kids could see it."
"__MOVIES__ I see, many kids have to deal with that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it wasn't really beligerant with language or anything, just the father was an alcoholic and did have to leave the family."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it might be worth checking out."
