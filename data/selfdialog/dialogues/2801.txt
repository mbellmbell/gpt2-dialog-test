"__MUSIC__ Did you ever hear of Daughn Gibson?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so."
"__MUSIC__ He's kind of a weird country singer, songwriter, guitar-player."
"__MUSIC__ Does he have any albums?"
"__MUSIC__ He did one of the greatest songs I've ever heard, called 'Rain On A Highway'."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds kind of familiar. Was that the name of the album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, the song was on an album called, 'All Hell.' I heard it on Cartoon Network like 4am one morning."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, wait a minute. That sounds familiar. Was it on a weird video?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. It was some Claymation video showing cars getting washed away by a flood."
"__MUSIC__ I think I saw that!"
"__MUSIC__ The video showed rain falling, and a flood, and toy cars washing away."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that on some Cartoon Network show about short, weird animation videos."
"__MUSIC__ It's a real primitive song, with lots of echo and some electrical hum, but I think it's great."
"__MUSIC__ Is he on Soundcloud?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. They only have really short excerpts of his music on Soundcloud."
"__MUSIC__ I have to look that up."
"__MUSIC__ His first name is spelled 'D-A-U-G-H-N', not 'D-O-N'."
