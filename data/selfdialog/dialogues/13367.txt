"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best QB in football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has to be Brady right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean I don't think anyone is wrong for saying that, but man its hard not to take Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Brady has 5 rings?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if it wasn't for a terrible defensive collapses, Rodgers could easily have 3 or 4 himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on, you could say the same thing about Brady!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean I guess, but back to the topic - Rodgers or Brady for just this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ While if you're asking it that way, probably Rodgers then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. Totally. He's clearly on another level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess. I really hope the Packers can put together a respectable defense with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, how about this - wouldn't you love to see a Brady and Rodgers Super Bowl before Brady retires."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh my god yes. It would be legendary. It would probably be the best QB matchup in Super Bowl History."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm. What would even some comparable matchups be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Kurt Warner-Roethlisberger was good. Brady-Eli happened a few times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Favre-Elway back in 97 was pretty darn good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. That one will be tough to top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Trent Dilfer and Kerry Collins back in 2001?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bahhahhaa. Good one!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is probably the worst ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was probably one of the first super bowls I vividly remember."
