"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard the new country station?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what type of songs do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ It's mostly new country hits, like Blake Shelton, Jason Aldean, stuff like that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, that sounds pretty good!  I love Blake Shelton."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I especially like his videos, too."
"__MUSIC__ He just has a great voice overall, and his lyrics are always so catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  I can't help but like the older country hits, too, though."
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, Patsy Cline is hard to beat."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there aren't a lot of radio stations that play the old classic country."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it seems like it's not as popular as you would think.  A lot of people overlook it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and a lot of the newer country sounds more like rock music to me."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously!  What about Dierks Bentley?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he sounds like a rock musician.  I do like some of his tunes though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but I think the classic country artists would be insulted!"
"__MUSIC__ What, that they're calling that music country?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly!  It sounds like rock."
"__MUSIC__ True.  Well, things always change over time."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but country music should still be preserved with its integrity as country."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I do agree.  That's why the classic country stations are great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they don't play that type of new rock country nonsense."
