"__COMEDY__ Who was in it?"
"__COMEDY__ Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroid."
"__COMEDY__ I'm not sure.  What was it about?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, a stockbroker and a homeless guy trade places with each other.  I think there was a bet made somewhere."
"__COMEDY__ A bet?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, Murphy is the homeless guy and he has to do Akroid's job.  Likewise, Akroid has to make it on the streets."
"__COMEDY__ I might have to see that one."
