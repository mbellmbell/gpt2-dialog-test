"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read the other day that Zach Orr might be coming out of retirement and coming back to the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He used to play for Baltimore Ravens, didn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was a great linebacker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why did he retire? Wasn't he injured or something?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He retired in January because he had a spinal condition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did he have surgery or something that made it better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's had some new opinions from doctors that he might be okay to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't a spinal problem seem permanent?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a condition he's had since birth, where one of his vertebrae never fully formed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the doctors told him he had to retire for something he's always had?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They told him at first he was more likely to have an injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Back problems can be scary. Even normal people can end up sidelined from work from them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he had a lot more doctors examine him, and they are saying he's not at any more risk than anyone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he's thinking about coming back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He said when he first announced he was retiring, if there was anyway he could return that he would."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's still pretty young, isn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's only 24, so yeah he still had some years left to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would be tempted to come back too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At first they said he could be paralyzed or die. But now they said the main concern is not playing with herniated discs, and his have subsided."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think all NFL players risk injury, it's part of the game. I could see how he would be tempted to come back if he could."
