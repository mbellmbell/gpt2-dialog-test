"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like Lady Gaga's music?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like her music but have never like her stage name, sounds like a baby."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I loved her in this years Superbowl half-time show. I hated how some people wrote negative remarks about her weight and some of her outfits."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Some people a just bullies. She is tiny and I did not think that she had a big belly."
"__LADY_GAGA__ When she sang at the superbowl, I could not believe how many songs that I knew that she sang."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She has had alot of top hits, my favorite is Poker Face."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you know that her parents stilll have the same home and phone number, as when she grew up."
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, bet that phone rings off the hook. I heard she was bullied so much when she was in high school."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I heard that too! She was pushed in lockers and once they threw in a trash can."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Maybe that is why she is such an advacte against bullying. I wish more people in view of the public could be more like her."
