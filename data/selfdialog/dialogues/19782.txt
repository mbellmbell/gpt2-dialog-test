"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that movie 'Babette's Feast'?"
"__MOVIES__ No, who's in that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's actually a foreign movie so you probably won't know the actors."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about this lady who moves to a village as a refugee who feeds the entire town off of her lottery winnings without telling them she spent it all on them."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds weird."
"__MOVIES__ It's actually very touching and it has some very subtle humor laced all throughout that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is it going to make me cry?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably not, it's probably going to make you laugh, a lot, and feel endeared to the character."
"__MOVIES__ What language is it in?"
"__MOVIES__ It the movie they speak Dutch, I believe...but it's easy to find one with English subtitles."
"__MOVIES__ I hate subtitles."
"__MOVIES__ It is very worth it even with the subtitles."
"__MOVIES__ If it's foreign, how can we see it?"
"__MOVIES__ It actually did over 4 million in the US so it's not like no one has ever heard of it, you just rent it online."
"__MOVIES__ I'll check it out but what is your favorite part of the whole movie?"
"__MOVIES__ There are so many good parts in it...like I said, it really has a lot of subtle humor that makes the movie a true gem."
"__MOVIES__ Is it humor that anyone will get?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh sure, it's just not in your face telling you to laugh like most US movies, this one actually assumes you're already intelligent enough to know when something is funny."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, ok, actually, now I'm really intrigued."
