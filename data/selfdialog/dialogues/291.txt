"__MUSIC__ Are you still playing the piano?"
"__MUSIC__ I just started to study Bill Evans’ jazz style."
"__MUSIC__ I only know about a few jazz musicians. Is he still alive?"
"__MUSIC__ No, he died in 1980."
"__MUSIC__ Did he do anything I might have heard?"
"__MUSIC__ I’m not sure. You may have noticed one of his songs in the movie “Black Mass” about Whitey Bulger."
"__MUSIC__ The one starring Johnny Depp? Oh, that music sounds like lounge music, the kind of music my parents used to listen to when they were having drinks."
"__MUSIC__ You like some of Miles Davis’ work. Bill Evans worked with Davis."
"__MUSIC__ Miles had so many different styles. When did Evans work with Miles Davis?"
"__MUSIC__ Back in 1958 or 1959."
"__MUSIC__ So, it’s probably not Miles’ bebop work. I like bebop."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Bill Evans was more laid back."
"__MUSIC__ How do you go about studying his style?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm working on the song, The Two Lonely People' from that movie. I start by practicing the major chords, then I work on the melody."
"__MUSIC__ Did Evans have big bands?"
"__MUSIC__ No, he was known for his trios, with a bass and drums."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have any of his stuff I could borrow to give a listen?"
"__MUSIC__ I’ll lend you “Sunday at the Village Vanguard.”"
"__MUSIC__ Thanks. When can I hear you play?"
"__MUSIC__ Give me a while. I'm not very good."
