"__MOVIES__ Do you have a minute to talk about movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd rather tell you about this dream I seriously just had."
"__MOVIES__ Is it movie related?"
"__MOVIES__ I one-hundred percent is movie related."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a good jumping off point."
"__MOVIES__ Listen up, then, because it's also a trivia question. I dreamed I was talking to Edward Norton, and I asked him if he was ever in a Woody Allen movie. He said he was, but one of the early one's. Like his black and white one's after he started making comedies, but I know that's niot right."
"__MOVIES__ But he was in a Woody Allen movie."
"__MOVIES__ Which one was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Everyone Says I love You."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not a black-and-white one. He was the prisoner dude that was in love with... I want to say Drew Barrymore?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think so."
"__MOVIES__ That was a musical, right?"
"__MOVIES__ It was. I don't remeber any of the songs, though."
"__MOVIES__ Did Edward Norton sing in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It seems like he would have too, right, but I can't remember."
"__MOVIES__ It's weird to picture him singing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it is. But when we're done, I'm definitely going to see if he sings, on Youtube."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I'll do that too."
"__MOVIES__ Also, he was doing an impression of Woody Allen in Sausage Party. It was so good, I had to look up who was doing it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wow. I remember that, and I did not think it would be him. Wild stuff."
