"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite character from the prequal trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think my favorite character is Sebulba."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, that is a great one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he is Anakin's podracing 'nemesis' and he is one of the most unique looking aliens in the whole series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't disagree there, he is pretty freaky looking."
"__STAR_WARS__ I remember when I was young I thought it was so funny how he got around with his arms and used his feet as hands."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd be curious to know who came up with that character design."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, I know he was voiced by Lewis McLeod."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh now I remember that, he even had to learn some Huttese, the language Jaba speaks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it definitely wouldn't be the easiest language to learn."
