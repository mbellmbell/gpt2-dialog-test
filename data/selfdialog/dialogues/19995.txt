"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of X-Men movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they're okay. I haven't seen all of them."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones have you seen?"
"__MOVIES__ I know I saw Logan. I also saw one or two a few years back."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good. What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a terrific way for Hugh Jackman to part with the series."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if Patrick Stewart will be involved with the movies anymore."
"__MOVIES__ I think he might be done with the movies as well, but I'm not sure."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it sad to see him looking so frail?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I know he's an older actor, but they really made him look weak!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll always think of him as the might Captain Picard from Star Trek."
"__MOVIES__ I'm a fan of the Star Trek movies as well. Have you seen all of them?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I just remember seeing him in a couple of movies back around 2000."
"__MOVIES__ That was probably Nemesis or Insurrection."
"__MOVIES__ When did they come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Insurrection came out in 1998. Nemesis came out in 2002."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. I think I may have seen both of those."
"__MOVIES__ I thought they were okay. They weren't really as good as the original Star Trek movies in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Nobody can replace Captain Kirk!"
