"__DISNEY__ When does it release?"
"__DISNEY__ As per the initial reports around April 2018."
"__DISNEY__ That seems to far and a long wait."
"__DISNEY__ You haven't heard it all. It is a two-part movie."
"__DISNEY__ What?!! Do part 1 and 2 release together?"
"__DISNEY__ No, so far I know only about part 1 releasing in April 2018"
