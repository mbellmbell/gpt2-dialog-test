"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see Memento?"
"__THRILLER__ A few years ago.  Why do you ask?"
"__THRILLER__ I'm just a bit confused by it."
"__THRILLER__ I think everyone was confused by it.  What part in particular?"
"__THRILLER__ The ending.  So the whole movie was really in reverse?"
"__THRILLER__ Kind of.  It kind of progressed and went backwards all at once."
"__THRILLER__ I feel like I need some sort of graph or something showing what's happening and when."
"__THRILLER__ I think it did make the film more interesting though."
"__THRILLER__ True.  If it would have been chronological, wouldn't have had the same impact."
"__THRILLER__ Exactly.  Was definitely an interesting experience."
