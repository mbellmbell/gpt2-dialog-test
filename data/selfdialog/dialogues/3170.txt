"__MUSIC__ So, you're pressing me to define her specific contribution to the music scene?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I am."

"__MUSIC__ Yes, that fits."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, her main influences are Shaina Twain and Stevie Nicks."

"__MUSIC__ Yes, so it all makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ It's strange, though."
"__MUSIC__ How so? What is strange about Taylor's role in the global music industry?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just interesting to see someone start one place and end up another."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but it seems like it happens to everyone who makes it in the music industry."
"__MUSIC__ Can you give me another example?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, let's look at Nine Inch Nails."
"__MUSIC__ What's their genre?"
