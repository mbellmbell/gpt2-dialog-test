"__STAR_WARS__ Is George Lucas involved in the next Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean writing the script?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean anything at all.  Does he have say over what's going on?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really.  I'm sure they tell him what they're doing, but since he sold the property, he probably lacks some oversight."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which is probably okay since he kind of butchered the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ No kind of about it, he did butcher them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder how much he makes from these films."
"__STAR_WARS__ Enough to build a large bank vault that he can swim in."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like Scrooge McDuck, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly.  George Lucas doesn't strike me as a swimmer though."
