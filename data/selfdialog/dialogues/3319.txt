"__MUSIC__ Do you know much of Amy Winehouse's music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I know a song or two of hers, but not many. What are some of her popular songs?"
"__MUSIC__ She did that song that was really popular years ago called 'Rehab.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I remember that song. What are some others?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of her other more well known songs include 'Back to Black.'"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure if I know that song or not. How many albums does she have?"
"__MUSIC__ She unfortunately only has a couple of albums, since she passed away at a young age."
"__MUSIC__ That is sad. I definitely want to check them out though."
"__MUSIC__ You should. They're both really great, but also very different."
"__MUSIC__ How are they different?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the first one is like a jazz hip-hop mix, which is really cool. But it has a more jazzy feel to it."
"__MUSIC__ And what about the second album?"
"__MUSIC__ Her second album is a bit more experimental in my opinion. Her sound changes a bit but she plays around a lot with melodies."
"__MUSIC__ That is very cool. What is your favorite song of hers?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I can't choose just one. But some include Wake Up Alone, Me and Mr. Jones, and Some Unholy War."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to listen to those. I wonder what kinds of music she listened to."
"__MUSIC__ I think she was influenced a lot by the type of music she listened to, but I know she loved Frank Sinatra and Donny Hathaway."
"__MUSIC__ Are they jazz singers?"
"__MUSIC__ Frank Sinatra is, but I'm not sure what genre you'd classify Hathaway as."
"__MUSIC__ I want to check them out, too."
