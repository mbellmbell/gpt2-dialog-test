"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Princess Lea for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ As a person, she is hot, as a character, I'm not a fan."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well who is yours then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, you picked the most annoying character as your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, that's exactly why I like him."
"__STAR_WARS__ At least I chose a major character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who all she has going for her is her body!"
"__STAR_WARS__ And the fact she's been in the rebellion since she was born."
