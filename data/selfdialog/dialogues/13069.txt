"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the AZ Cardinals will do this season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If we can stay healthy and keep Carson upright, we should do OK as the division is pretty weak."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Rams are a dumpster fire and the 49'ers are pretty bad"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup - it'll come down to Seattle as it does every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Crazy news about Marshawn signing / playing with the Raiders huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Totally, I liked the Raiders and Carr before, but now think they should take that division down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I expect the Raiders to edge out the Chiefs and Broncos - Chargers are lost"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The stuff I read about Chargers and the move to LA was pretty confusing and dysfunctional"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know why that owner didn't do more to keep them in SD rather than play 2nd fiddle to the Rams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's like dumb and dumber"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, I don't pretend to know what it's like to have that much money, but seems that they could have stayed and paid about the same as the relocation fee?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ These owners are cheap billionaires that want the public to foot the bill for their stadiums."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is pretty ridiculous and I think the way this all used to work will no longer be viable"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Qualcom was a dump, but I wouldn't want to pay more taxes to build them a new stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the Chargers won 5 games last year - do you think they win less playing in SD for their final year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rivers will be Rivers for a few more years, and they do have a strong run game, but what are they playing for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, unlike the Raiders moving to Las Vegas, there are not a ton of Charger fans outside of SD"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, Raider fans seem like their are everywhere - like a plague"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited for the season to start and see how it unfolds"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, like every year, regardless of the drama - it will be a great season for most of us fans!"
