"__DISNEY__ Which Disney movie princess has the prettiest dress?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked Rapunzel from the movie Tangled."
"__DISNEY__ Are you sure that's a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it is - I liked her purple dress."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, yeah you're right.  I think my favorite is Belle's yellow dress."
"__DISNEY__ I wore that for Halloween once, it was really pretty."
"__DISNEY__ Merida's dress from Brave looked cool."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but I think it would be really hot to wear, it had a lot of layers."
"__DISNEY__ Then you could wear Ariel's dress, since the top is only a bikini."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she did get a different dress to wear on land though."
