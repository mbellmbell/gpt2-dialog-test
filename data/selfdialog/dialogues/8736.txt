"__BEATLES__ Hey are you a fan of the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ I hear a lot about them, but I don't know many of their songs. They're a rock band, right?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, but their music falls across a bunch of different genres. I think it would appeal to almost anyone."
"__BEATLES__ Really? What are your favorite songs that don't get talked about?"
"__BEATLES__ There are a lot of them, like Hey, Bulldog, which is a really fun song that even some fans haven't heard"
"__BEATLES__ That sounds interesting. Why isn't it more well known?"
"__BEATLES__ I think because it's on their Yellow Submarine album, which is more like a soundtrack than a studio album"
"__BEATLES__ What other songs do you like?"
"__BEATLES__ It's hard to narrow it down, but check out Oh! Darling and Helter Skelter, two of their more heavy sounding songs"
"__BEATLES__ Interesting, and here I thought it was all cheesy pop-rock songs. I'll check those out."
