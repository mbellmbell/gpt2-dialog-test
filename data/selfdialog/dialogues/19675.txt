"__MOVIES__ Do you like foreign films?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I hate movies with subtitles."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, you're such a typical American."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Americans are notorious for not watching foreign films for that very reason."
"__MOVIES__ Oh..."
"__MOVIES__ So that means you've never seen Let the right one in?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's an amazing Swedish vampire movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh...I don't like vampires movies anyways. Too scary."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but this one isn't even that scary, it's actually more of a love or friendship story."
"__MOVIES__ Like Twilight?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but no. Not at all."
"__MOVIES__ I don't like Twilight. I don't like teeny movies."
"__MOVIES__ It's not a teen movie."
"__MOVIES__ Then what is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Forget it."
"__MOVIES__ Alright.."
