"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nas or Jay-Z, who's the King of NY?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That was already settled man. They're friends no anyways."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It wasn't settled! People still disagree to this day."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Okay, well I think Nas is the best because he put out Illmatic."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You're wrong, Jay-Z is the best."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What has Jay-Z done better than Illmatic."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a good point, Illmatic is better than any of Jay's albums, but Jay's catalog has way more quality stuff in it than Nas."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I judge artists primarily by their master work. I don't see any of Jay-Z's master works (The Blueprint, Reasonable Doubt, et cetera) coming close to Illmatic."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So consistently great stuff counts for nothing?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not for nothing, but the peak is the most important to me."
