"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars technology is so weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, like, they have faster-than-light travel, yet all their graphics displays are frame wire, straight out of the '70s type stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's because Star Wars, the first one, back before it was called A New Hope was made in the '70s."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know that, but if you look in the later films, even in like Revenge of the Sith or The Force Awakens they keep that look."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that is weird, in a way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Another strange thing is that they have real, working cloning technology, but instead of growing new limbs anytime someone loses one, they just give them a robot one instead."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe robotic limbs are cheaper to make than growing real tissue?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, the real reason is because it's not a very serious sci-fi franchise. Doesn't mean it's not weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's more of a space fantasy, yeah."
