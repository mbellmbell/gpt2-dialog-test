"__STAR_WARS__ Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a hard question,  but I think it is Return of the Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh really?  Why did you like that one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked how they were able to redeem Darth Vader's character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha ha I thought you were going to say it was because of the Ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well they are adorable, but seeing Vader with Obi Wan and Yoda at the end was wonderful"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah especially after learning the backstory in the prequels it is nice to have him back on the light side."
"__STAR_WARS__ So do you agree that Return of the Jedi is best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No I think that the Empire Strikes Back is really the movie where we get to know the characters including Vader and that development is what made the story matter."
"__STAR_WARS__ At least we agree that the best movies are in the original trilogy."
