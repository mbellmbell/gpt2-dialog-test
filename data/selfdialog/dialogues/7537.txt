"__LADY_GAGA__ What is your favorite Lady Gaga song?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I would say Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That is a fun song, but I like something more for the club."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh I see. Like Poker Face?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly. It's got a great dance beat."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you think of Born this Way then?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like the message, but it's not very dance-y."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I would agree."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I also think it's a little too much like Madonna's music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Like Lady Gaga should get her own style and not steal hers? I get it."
