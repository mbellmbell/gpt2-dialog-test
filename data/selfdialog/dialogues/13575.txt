"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be the surprise team this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Houston a lot. Adding Deshaun Watson was big for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you really think they'll improve over last year with a rookie QB?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They finished 9-7 last year and first in their division with a terrible QB"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there's no telling if Watson will be any improvement over terrible"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you'l be surprised at how good he is. The guy wins ball games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he does have a good year, then they definitely have a team that can win a lot of games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year they were without JJ Watt for much of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So having Watt and Watson this year means they're due for an improvement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Having a winning QB, which I think Watson will be, along with a stellar defense is the key to making it to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they have to go through New England to get there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Watson will be able to win 2-3 games on his own. I can't wait to see him run through defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he'll be rookie of the year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. He'll put up very good stats for a rookie QB and I believe he'll lead the Texans to 13-14 wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll be shocked if he's able to put up good numbers. There's a reason he was taken number 12 with two other QBs ahead of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Scouts and GMs are obsessed with mechanics and potential to be a prototypical QB; Watson is not that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then what is he if he's not prototypical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a Cam Newton type QB who is capable of winning games without filling up the stat sheet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. Houston has been good for three years now, but they've finished 9-7 each time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is the year they either break out of that with the best record, or they falter with Watson."
