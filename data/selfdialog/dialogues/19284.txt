"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not really. I saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in theater."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was alright. I didn't find it to be as great as everyone makes it out to be."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was great. Why aren't you a fan?"
"__MOVIES__ I found it to be mediocre. I wasn't really into the humor. I don't find characters giving attitude as humor. It seems lazy to me."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know what you mean. What's an example?"
"__MOVIES__ When the Rocket Raccoon went on about Lazer Face. They made the same joke several times."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was hilarious. Doesn't seem like lazy writing to me."
"__MOVIES__ Now that I think about it they kept using the same jokes over and over throughout the entire movie."
"__MOVIES__ What's another one?"
"__MOVIES__ An example, is when Drax keeps laughing at things that aren't really funny and that's the joke."
"__MOVIES__ It's just good fun and laughter is contagious, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess. Another cheap joke is when Drax keeps insulting Mantis' physical appearance."
"__MOVIES__ Come on, you have to love Groot though!"
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't seem like there's much to him other than he's cute."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he's adorable. What's not to love about him?"
"__MOVIES__ He doesn't do anything besides dance and be cute. I want to see some sort of character development in a movie otherwise it's not a story."
"__MOVIES__ I think you're being harsh. You can find something positive in simplicity."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, I don't see why I'm being charged for a story when I'm only getting a picture. Honestly seems like a ripoff."
