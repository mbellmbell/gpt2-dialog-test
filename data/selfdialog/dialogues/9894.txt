"__COMEDY__ What is your favorite comedy movie?"
"__COMEDY__ I'm a fan of older comedies such as old Charlie Chaplin movies.  How about you?"
"__COMEDY__ I like some of the older stuff too, but one of my favorite newer comedies is 'Dumb and Dumber.'"
"__COMEDY__ Really?  That seems such an odd choice."
"__COMEDY__ Yes, it does, but the sheer ridiculousness of it is genius.  Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are brilliantly stupid."
"__COMEDY__ Yes, I guess they are.  What are your favorite parts?"
"__COMEDY__ I don't necessarily have a favorite part or theme; pretty much everything they do from the scenes in the doggy van to them riding on the moped are hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ I guess my favorite scenes are when they are skiing and at the ski lodge."
"__COMEDY__ And Lauren Holly is the perfect foil for Jim's and Jeff's foolish characters."
"__COMEDY__ I will have to watch it again just for kicks sometime when I need a laugh."
