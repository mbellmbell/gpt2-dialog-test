"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if the new Han Solo movie will be good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is difficult to say, although they did hire Ron Howard."
"__STAR_WARS__ A good director is essential."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if we will learn more about Wookies."
"__STAR_WARS__ If nothing else, we should see the origin of Han and Chewbacca."
"__STAR_WARS__ Has the home planet been shown before?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not believe so, unless you count the Christmas special on television."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would definitely be a mistake!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am also looking forward to learning more about Lando."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely!    Hope Donald Glover learned something from the coolest - Billy Dee Williams!"
