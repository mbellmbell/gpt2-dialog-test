"__MUSIC__ So did you see the latest Katy Perry video?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the one at the amusement park?"
"__MUSIC__ No it was after that one.  It's about food."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, wait.  You mean the one about cannibalism?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha Ha!  I guess it could be considered that way."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I did see it.  Some french name  - like eat up or enjoy"
"__MUSIC__ Bon Apetit?"
"__MUSIC__ Something like that - it was gross."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like the song?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not particularly but I was too busy trying to figure out the video.  That was Katy Perry?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, can you believe it?"
"__MUSIC__ What?  Has she lost her mind?  That was crap!"
"__MUSIC__ I did like Chained to the Rhythm - the one in the amusement park."
"__MUSIC__ I loved that song.  After I figured out the messages I sorta enjoyed it less."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Can't there be one place where we can just enjoy ourselves without all the politics?"
"__MUSIC__ Did you know she was heavily into the Clinton bid for election?"
"__MUSIC__ Figures, she seems so unhappy about everything."
"__MUSIC__ She did free concerts and announcements."
"__MUSIC__ Bet she didn't like losing.  Probably why she wanted to get a parting shots in her video - like it makes a difference"
