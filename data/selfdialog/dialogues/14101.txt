"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see that Warriors game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah Draymond was absolutely ridiculous."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well yeah but how about that fourth quarter by Durant?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That was so good.  I'm really glad he is over that leg injury."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. Hopefully he stays healthy all the way through the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ So you think they are a shoe in for the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean yeah, who is going to stop them?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I thought maybe the Rockets."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I could see that but it doesn't even look like they are going to get past the Spurs at this point."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah who would have thought that. I do not understand how the Spurs keep being good."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah especially with that bum Aldrige being one of their 'stars'"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think he is that bad.  I think he is just catching a lot of hate from everyone."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah maybe.  Some games it feels like he just does not show up at all though."
"__BASKETBALL__ I could see that.  He definitely is all over the place in terms of his performance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Either way the West has been so much more fun to watch than the East."
"__BASKETBALL__ Definitely.  I'm sick of Lebron just running through the East."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I wish someone would challenge him."
"__BASKETBALL__ No kidding.  I don't see the Wizards or Celtics having a real chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ No way the Cavs will crush either of those teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ So I guess we are headed for Warriors vs Cavs again."
