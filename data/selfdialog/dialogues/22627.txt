"__DISNEY__ What do you think of Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ I really like the movie in general but I saw a lot of behind the scenes clips that would have made the movie so good!"
"__DISNEY__ I saw them too, but they changed a lot last minute."
"__DISNEY__ I enjoyed it overall though. I'm glad we have another princess that is reasonable in her thinking about love."
"__DISNEY__ Like Merida!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!"
"__DISNEY__ Plus I mean she was only what, 14?"
"__DISNEY__ I believe so. You don't have to fall in love at first sight."
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely not."
"__DISNEY__ Love is there all along!"
