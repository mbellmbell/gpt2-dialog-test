"__MUSIC__ Did you watch America's Got Talent last year?  Specifically, Grace Vanderwall?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  I have no idea who that is."
"__MUSIC__ Dont blame you.  But she was astonishing to me."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ She's this 11-12 year old girl, cute as can be.  She walks out on the stage for her first performance carrying a yukele and says she'll be playing an original song."
"__MUSIC__ Thats usually the kiss of death."
"__MUSIC__ I know and I was expecting nothing from it.  And I was wrong."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  She was  good?"
"__MUSIC__ She was a revelation.  She was soooo good."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's amazing.  Was it just the one song?"
"__MUSIC__ On that night, but she went on and played 3 or 4 more songs, all original, all great.  And she won the competition."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to look her up."
"__MUSIC__ You should, she's a talented little girl.  Folk-pop kind of music."
"__MUSIC__ Thats right up my alley."
"__MUSIC__ I know, thats why I'm telling you."
"__MUSIC__ So did she put out an album?"
"__MUSIC__ She put out an EP late last year with 5 or so songs, one of which was new (not on the show)."
"__MUSIC__ Cool.  Ill listen to her stuff online and see if I want to buy it."
"__MUSIC__ She just put out another song too, which is really good.  I think a full length album is on the way."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, and she's only 11 or 12?  Amazing."
