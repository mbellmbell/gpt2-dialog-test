"__MUSIC__ One of my friends loves 21 Pilots, but I don't really like their stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I love them too! How can you not like them?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they're over rated. Everyone is obsessed with them."
"__MUSIC__ That's because they're awesome. Their songs are so unique."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think they're that great. I saw them open for Fallout Boy once and they were okay."
"__MUSIC__ You got to see 21 Pilots live?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I was there for Fallout Boy."
"__MUSIC__ Fallout Boy isn't that great. It's something high schoolers would listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, I still like their music!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, I'm just saying."
"__MUSIC__ What music do you like other than 21 Pilots?"
"__MUSIC__ I like a lot of smaller bands like the Strumbellas."
"__MUSIC__ I hear them a lot on Pandora."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're decent. I was looking into seeing them live sometime."
"__MUSIC__ I'd love to go with you if they're ever in town."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, as long as they're not opening for 21 Pilots."
"__MUSIC__ I doubt they would be. Those two bands are really different."
"__MUSIC__ I know, otherwise I wouldn't like the Strumbellas."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad we at least have one band we both like!"
