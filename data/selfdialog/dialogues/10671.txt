"__FASHION__ Wow, did you see what Jenna was wearing this morning?"
"__FASHION__ I did! I can't believe she would wear that! I think I was 2 the last time I put on overalls..."
"__FASHION__ I'm surprised you ever wore overalls at all, actually."
"__FASHION__ I did, my mom even has a picture of me wearing them.. ugh."
"__FASHION__ Haha, I've got to see that! But still, I bet you wore them better than Jenna did."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, my diaper really filled out the tush! Haha."
"__FASHION__ Better than no tush! I wish I had more of a back end, I don't look good in most jeans because I need to tone up."
"__FASHION__ Oh, I don't know, I think the jeans you're wearing now are fine."
"__FASHION__ Well, they're better than Jenna's overalls. Maybe we should say something to her?"
"__FASHION__ Like what? She's just going to get mad if we try to act like the hosts on 'What not to wear'..."
"__FASHION__ I don't know, she might be grateful. Who knows, maybe this is the begining of a career in fashon!"
"__FASHION__ No way, I have style, but I could never make it as a designer."
"__FASHION__ Honey, if you can pull off overalls, you can be a fashon guru. Just go talk to her! She needs your advice!"
"__FASHION__ Well, maybe after lunch I could grab some magazines and look through them with her. Point out some nice new trends..."
"__FASHION__ That's the spirit! I just hate to see fashon disasters walking around.. in overalls..."
"__FASHION__ Haha, yeah me too, I guess it would be doing the world a favor."
"__FASHION__ Totally, not to mention you would be doing Jenna a huge favor!"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I suppose you're right. I'll give it a try."
"__FASHION__ I can go with you too, I've been meaning to ask her if she wants to go shopping this weekend for some new tops."
"__FASHION__ Oh, that would be perfect, we can all go and help her out!"
