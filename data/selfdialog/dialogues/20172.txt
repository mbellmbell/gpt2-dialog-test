"__MOVIES__ Name a movie with a title that makes no sense"
"__MOVIES__ Just one?"
"__MOVIES__ If you can do more, go for it."
"__MOVIES__ Made In America with Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know that one."
"__MOVIES__ Whoopi Goldberg uses a sperm donor and then finds out 18 years later that the donor was a very white Ted Danson"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like it would be funny"
"__MOVIES__ It is.  But the title makes no sense."
"__MOVIES__ What do they claim the title means?"
"__MOVIES__ They don't say.  However, in the trailer the announcer says that a mistake like this could only be made in America."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess that works.  But if you don't see the trailer, you wouldn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ Guess they couldn't think of aything better.  Your turn."
"__MOVIES__ Well I was thinknig of the movie Oscar."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Sly Stallone??"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when I first heard of the movie, I thought he was Oscar but you only hear about Oscar and then he appears for 30 seconds at the end."
"__MOVIES__ True but at least it makes some sense."
"__MOVIES__ Not really.  They could have come up with a better title.  Something that wasn't just about the guy the daughter was dating but doesn't even end up with."
"__MOVIES__ Going Straight or Don't Call Me Boss would have been better"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I like Don't Call Me Boss.  It's something that Sly Stalone says a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he does or call it by his nickname Snapps."
