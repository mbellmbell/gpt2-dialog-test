"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite acoustic version of a pop song?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean a stripped down version sung by the original artist or a cover sung by a different artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's do stripped down version sung by the same artist first."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, then The Cherry Tree Sessions, it is an amazing deep cut acoustic album by Lady Gaga."
"__MUSIC__ I have that one. Poker Face from that album is absolutely amazing."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite stripped down version sung by the same artist?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite is the entire Lights Acoustic EP, it really brings out the content of the songs so much differently!"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard the acoustic version. I'll have to check that out. I like the original album a lot though."
"__MUSIC__ You'll like the acoustic version then. I love acoustic versions of not acoustic songs and albums because it can be like a whole new song or album."
"__MUSIC__ In my opinion it has to be a real acoustic version though, not just remixing a track."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, it sucks when artists don't do a separate recording for the acoustic versions."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. Just putting the same vocal over a different track kinda ruins it."
"__MUSIC__ Are there anymore stripped down versions that you really like?"
"__MUSIC__ Do Kesha's Deconstructed mixes count as stripped versions?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh most definitely!"
"__MUSIC__ I love how the Deconstructed mix of Blow adds a layer of darkness and eeriness."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, that whole album is off the charts."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like on that album, she shows her true singing talent."
"__MUSIC__ Right? A lot of people don't know how truly amazing her voice is."
"__MUSIC__ I hope she puts out a ballad album eventually. That would be amazing!"
