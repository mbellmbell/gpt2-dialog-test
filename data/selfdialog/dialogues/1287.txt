"__MUSIC__ Are you into Everclear at all?"
"__MUSIC__ They did 'Wonderful,' right? I thought that was a bit cheesy."
"__MUSIC__ It was a little, but most people don't realize how different their earlier stuff is. You'd love their first two albums."
"__MUSIC__ What are their first two albums?"
"__MUSIC__ World of Noise and Sparkle and Fade. It has that raw and heavy grunge sound."
"__MUSIC__ Really, Everclear? I just think of 'Everything to Everyone' when it comes to their earlier stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That was off of their third album, So Much for the Afterglow. There are good songs on that one, but also some poppier stuff, too."
"__MUSIC__ I've only heard some of their radio hits. I never checked out their albums."
"__MUSIC__ Sparkle and Fade was their first album that went more mainstream, so it was recorded with some funding, but it still sounded quite raw and emotional."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the singer must've come out of the gate swinging and then lost some of that edge."
"__MUSIC__ Some of it's natural, I'm sure but World of Noise, while it doesn't sound as refined as Sparkle and Fade, is an interesting story on its own."
"__MUSIC__ What's that album's story?"
"__MUSIC__ It was recorded in a friend's basement for $400."
"__MUSIC__ Really? So they really hadn't made it yet."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's popular now, but they were unheard of outside of the local scene, I would imagine."
"__MUSIC__ Where were they from?"
"__MUSIC__ Portland."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. Portland really had that grungey sound in the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ It was even grungier in World of Noise. The frontman was playing a guitar on a really used-up amp and they had to apply ice packs to it every time it'd start to overheat."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't think about that with Everclear, but it makes sense. All those bands have to start somewhere."
