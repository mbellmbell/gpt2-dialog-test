"__MOVIES__ I really want to see that new Despicable Me movie."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe that it will be the third installment."
"__MOVIES__ Me either. I love those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. It's so funny when Gru destroys the gamestand in the first movie to win Agnes a unicorn."
"__MOVIES__ I love when he reads the book to all the girls about the three little kittens."
"__MOVIES__ I know. It's so funny how he turns into a family man."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, he gives up being a villian and in Despicable Me 2 he's turned to selling jam."
"__MOVIES__ It's so comical, but I saw in the trailer for Despicable Me 3 that Gru and his wife go back to being villians."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I must not have seen the same trailer as you."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, it sounds like it will be very interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, those movies are always nice and lighthearted."
"__MOVIES__ They are great to watch with younger and older children."
"__MOVIES__ I know. My cousins love the minions."
"__MOVIES__ Mine too. My youngest cousin dressed up as a minion for Halloween."
"__MOVIES__ Aw, that's so cute. I only wish I knew what the minions were saying."
"__MOVIES__ Their voices and crazy outfits are what make them so hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ I love how the minion that does all the housework dresses up in a maid's costume."
"__MOVIES__ I know. It cracks me up."
"__MOVIES__ Even my dad loves those movies because of how ridiculous the minions are."
"__MOVIES__ The minions are so popular there's even a minions ride at the Universal Studios theme park."
