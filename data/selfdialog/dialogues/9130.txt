"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Yankees game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes I did. What a tough way to end a game!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. I don't think they should have sent Ellsbury home."
"__BASEBALL__ I think you have to send him there. I think he has a better chance of scoring than Holliday getting another hit."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess so. The 7th inning was frustrating when the Yankees had first and third with no outs."
"__BASEBALL__ Agreed. I can't believe they struck out 3 times in a row."
"__BASEBALL__ RIght? Oh well, Yankees are still only a half game out."
"__BASEBALL__ That's true, but we need to at least come out of this series with two wins."
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Yankees will be fine. Hopefully the Orioles cool down."
"__BASEBALL__ Their offense isn't that explosive and I don't think their pitching is that great,"
"__BASEBALL__ It's going to be a close race all season. Hopefully the Red Sox don't catch fire."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. They didn't start off as great as everyone was saying."
"__BASEBALL__ Anyways, how do you feel about Aaron Judge?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's a solid player, but he started off so good that his expectations became unrealistic."
"__BASEBALL__ Last night his at-bats were pretty bad and he struck out in a key at-bat."
"__BASEBALL__ When he was hitting home runs every game, I made sure I never missed an at-bat."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the picture of him next to Torreyes and Betances?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. Aaron Judge is huge. No wonder he hits so hard."
"__BASEBALL__ Are you watching the game tonight?"
"__BASEBALL__ Of course. I'll be tuning in at 7:05. Go Yankees!"
