"__DISNEY__ Am I the only person in the world who was not crazy about Aladdin?"
"__DISNEY__ Really?  I thought Robin Williams was great as Genie"
"__DISNEY__ He was.  I liked Aladdin too, but Jasmine really annoyed me."
"__DISNEY__ Was it her voice?  I like Linda Larkin in everything except Aladdin the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Her voice was a big part.  But I also thought she came on to Aladdin super strong."
"__DISNEY__ I think they were still using that group of artists that really sexualized everything."
"__DISNEY__ The ones who hid the naughty pictures in The Little Mermaid and The Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes.  Don't quote me on it, but I think it was them."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they did The Little Mermaid 2 too?  Did you notice Ariel was about to pop out of her top?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd forgotten that.  I never bothered to watch The Little Mermaid 3."
