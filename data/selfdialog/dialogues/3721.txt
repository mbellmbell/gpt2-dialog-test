"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Kidneythieves?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't. What kind of music are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a rock band, but not hard rock. More like industrial rock. They sound a little like Sneaker Pimps, back when they still had a female singer."
"__MUSIC__ Really? When were they founded?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was 1998. Their first song was 'S+M (A Love Song)' and their first album was 'Trickster'."
"__MUSIC__ Still doesn't ring a bell. I'll have to check them out sometime."
"__MUSIC__ If you do. you should definitely listen to the song 'K' first. It's a really great song."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I will. Is there anything else you can tell me about them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, one of their songs was featured in the movie 'Queen of the Damned' in 2002. It was called 'Before I'm dead'."
"__MUSIC__ Not sure if I remember that movie too well."
"__MUSIC__ They also had some other soundtrack contributions too, like the song 'Crazy' in 'Bride of Chucky' and the video game 'Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance' with the song 'A Stranger I Remain'."
"__MUSIC__ Oh ok I think I remember the song from Bride of Chucky! That was a great movie!"
"__MUSIC__ Let's not get off track here. Speaking of video games, they also had selected songs from one of their albums, Trickster, featured in 'Deus Ex: Invisible War'."
"__MUSIC__ That's really cool. Who is the lead singer?"
"__MUSIC__ Her name is Free Dominguez. She has a beautiful voice. She actually contributed vocals to the third Conjure One album, 'Exilarch' on the song 'Run for Cover' and her backing vocals are on Zeromancer's album 'Clone Your Lover'."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome. Can you compare their type of sound to any other bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Like I said, they sound a lot like Sneaker Pimps when Kelly Dayton was vocalist. They also sound kind of like In This Moment."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I've heard of them. They're a great band. I actually first heard them on the game Rock Band."
"__MUSIC__ I love Rock Band! I can play on Expert guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Well, aren't you special?"
