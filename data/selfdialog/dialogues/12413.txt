"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, do you watch the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, what's up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the worst team in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the Buffalo Bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have no quarterback, and no defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bills defense was good, they finished above .500 last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, true, maybe the Browns then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns are never competitive, their quarterback draft pick was a bust too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who Johnny Manziel?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he sucks, but Cody Kessler is way better and he isn't a bad guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, they have no superstars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns are probably the worst on a yearly basis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't get it, what do they do with all of their draft picks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They just don't assimilate and play as a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lions have been pretty bad since losing Calvin Johnson, and their quarterback is kind of weak too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lions are decent, but not a great team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else can you think of?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we have it settled, the Browns are the worst team in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed."
