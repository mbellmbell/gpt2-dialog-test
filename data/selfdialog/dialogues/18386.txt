"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Gone with the Wind?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I love that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is one of my favorites.  I recently saw it at the theater."
"__MOVIES__ At the theater?  How was that possible?"
"__MOVIES__ They had a 75th anniversary re-showing."
"__MOVIES__ That is so cool.  What was it like?"
"__MOVIES__ It was amazing.  It was so much better than seeing it on tv."
"__MOVIES__ I bet.  What did you like best?"
"__MOVIES__ There were so many great scenes.  The one with all of the confederate soldiers lying on the ground was really impactful."
"__MOVIES__ That is one of the most famous scenes in movie history.  The fact that they were able to acheive it in 1938 was impressive."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it really was.  But the scene with Scarlett and Rhett trying to escape during the burning of Atlanta, was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ If I remember correctly, they set a soundstage on fire to create that scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, there weren't computers around to generate things like that, so they actually had to create a huge fire.  I think they had one chance to get the scene right."
"__MOVIES__ I bet that was really cool on the big screen.  I really like the scene with Scarlett, Melanie, India, and Mrs. Meade waiting for the men to get back from the camp raid."
"__MOVIES__ I love that scene.  The tension is palpable, and Olivia de Havilland was brilliant as Melanie, reading David Copperfield to the ladies at the table."
"__MOVIES__ I think the casting was spot on for most of the characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Vivien Leigh was Scarlett.  No one else could have played her as well, in my opinon."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Clark Gable was the perfect Rhett Butler."
"__MOVIES__ I read that the two of them didn't necessarily get along very well in real life."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if that is true, it created the perfect chemistry between the two."
