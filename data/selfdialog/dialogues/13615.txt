"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember early in Russell Wilson's career when he used to go down field and lead block for Marshawn Lynch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He still tries to run down field and block for his guys. I love the attitude, but it's not exactly something I want to see my franchise QB doing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hasselbeck used to do it too. I kind of like the tradition. His most notable was the Beastquake run, but that wasn't nearly the only time he did it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the beast quake run? Never heard of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not a story Sean Payton would tell you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ unless it's in a big game like the sb. Cam newton didn't go for that ball when someone who wants to win like Wilson or Brady would have dived for it regardless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hundred percent, but I'd argue diving on a loose ball is significantly different from blocking much bigger defenders downfield when your block (as the quarterback) really isn't most likely gonna do much. Same sentiment tho so I get your point, I'll never understand cams reaction in the super bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell that to Drew Brees"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't exactly know what you're reffering to but I can pretty much guarantee Easy Breesy would dive on a loose ball in the big game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just saying I think they both take balls. Blocking and diving on a ball. Hats off to any QB that does either. Brees is the man"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't say Cam is scared to block or take a hit"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The broncos rocked him all day. Great day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was demoralized. I recall him not having a real challenge that entire year until that game. Every game before that was all smiles and dabs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what made their loss so great and I guess being division rivals"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are some great years for Football fans you can remember?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 2003 Cowboys have a special place in my heart being I missed the championship years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's the common predicted division winner that you don't see winning their division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Packers. The NFC north is weird right now. Rodgers will probably carry them tbh, but who knows."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be similar to last year in which 9-10 wins will win the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Packers are going to be a lot better, we had injuries early which destroyed us. I see us as a 12-13 win team."
