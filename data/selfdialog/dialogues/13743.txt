"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think the Celtics can beat the Lebron?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No chance. They can push them to six games though."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think any team is going to give the Cavs a game until Golden State."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and even then I don't think Lebron and the Cavs have much of a chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't underestimate Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ There's no way they can hang with the Warriors for 7 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably not. The Warriors have too much firepower."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and the Cavs don't have any if it's not Lebron or Kyrie."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think Lebron is the best player in the game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he still is, at least for one more year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Next year I think Kawhi overtakes him as the best."
"__BASKETBALL__ He keeps getting better every year."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know. I hope he shuts down Durant in the upcoming series."
"__BASKETBALL__ I do too. I think San Antonio can win 1 or 2 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ Even if Kawhi shuts down Durant, Steph and Klay will score at will."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's why nobody will beat Golden State."
"__BASKETBALL__ There are 4-5 guys on the team that could be number one options elsewhere."
"__BASKETBALL__ Most teams are lucky if they have two of those types of players. The Warriors have 4."
"__BASKETBALL__ And some teams don't even have one."
"__BASKETBALL__ But if your team has one, and he's the best player in the world, don't count them out yet."
