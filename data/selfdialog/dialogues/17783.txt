"__MOVIES__ You know what's weird? When everyone else looks forward to Christmas, they think about gifts etc. I think about Christmas movies!q"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I love watching certain Christmas movies. Especially the ones the show every year."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes! I know what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Christmas isn't Christmas without 'A Christmas Story'"
"__MOVIES__ What is that about again? Is that the one with Santa and all female elves?"
"__MOVIES__ No. A Christmas Story is the movie with a little boy who wants a BB Gun for Christmas but his parents are hesitant because they think he'll shoot his eye out"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen that one! It shows on TV"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, every single year!"
"__MOVIES__ My personal favorite is Miracle on 34th Street."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one is also a nice story. Timeless"
"__MOVIES__ Do you prefer the original or the remake?"
"__MOVIES__ I usually prefer the original of the movie, but in this case I prefer the remake. When I was younger I really liked the girl who had the lead role."
"__MOVIES__ What was her name? I can't remember her."
"__MOVIES__ I can't remember her name either! But she acted in another show in the 90's called Matilda"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes I have seen Matilda. A cute redhead girl?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's her. She was in a lot of movies in the 90's, but I haven't seen her in any big roles recently."
"__MOVIES__ Guess she was a 'child star'"
"__MOVIES__ Come to think about it she was also in Mrs. Doubtfire"
"__MOVIES__ Mrs Doubtfire is one of my favorite movies of all time!"
