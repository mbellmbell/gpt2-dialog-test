"__MOVIES__ What did you think about Joss Whedon ending Firefly with Serenity?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was the best he could with the cirucmstances, good film but I wish we could have gotten more."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah bittersweet for sure, but overall I thought it was a fitting ending."
"__MOVIES__ It's just a shame it had to close off some character arcs, making any kind of reunion a bit of a stretch."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah character deaths added some real finality to the series as a whole."
"__MOVIES__ Though I guess it could always come back with that universe."
"__MOVIES__ Can't imagine it capturing the same vibe without that original Serenity crew though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it would be kind of a husk of its former self."
"__MOVIES__ Though on the bright side I guess if anyone can do it it's Joss Whedon."
"__MOVIES__ True, I'd have complete faith in him if he ever chose to dive back in."
"__MOVIES__ It's crazy that in a world with reboots, remakes, and revivals we haven't gotten anything else."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah even a second movie, though I'm not sure how well Serenity did."
"__MOVIES__ I can't imagine it did very well at the Box Office, seems like it was made for fans and for fans only."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it relied heavily on knowledge of the show, was not good standalone."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah doomed to kind of fail in the money department, but succeeded in a lot of ways."
"__MOVIES__ Seeing the Serenity ship with a higher hollywood budget was moving."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely was, if anything it's almost delightful that the show was cancelled just for that alone."
"__MOVIES__ The tone of the movie was kind of jarring."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you can tell it didn't have some of the same vibes as the show, but that's due to the length."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah movies need to fit a lot of story into two hours."
