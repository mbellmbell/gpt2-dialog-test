"__FASHION__ Did you  see Kanye's new line of clothes?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, man it is something else, like very out there."
"__FASHION__ It is. Did you like any of his collection?"
"__FASHION__ I like a few pieces, he makes a sort of gauzy broken up shirt in cream and it is really attractive , did you?"

"__FASHION__ The off the shoulder really plain white gown?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, sort of light cotton, did you like it?"
"__FASHION__ I liked it if I wear to wear it to the beach. Did you think Blake Lively's gown was nice?"
"__FASHION__ I did! It was really pretty, with the form fitting gold and detail. Who did you think was the best dressed that night?"
"__FASHION__ That is hard, I would say Blake Lively."
"__FASHION__ I would agree, of course. Who was the worst dressed?"
"__FASHION__ The Girl form Girls, with the over-sized red and checkered  kilt dress. Ugh, did you see it?"
"__FASHION__ Lena Dunham? Yes, I thought it was an ugly material, reminded me of last year when everyone wore just crazy outfits."
"__FASHION__ Like Zayn, with his metallic arm, how was that fashion?"
"__FASHION__ His tuxedo was tailored wonderfully, that piece brings me back to this year, did you see Katy Perry at the met?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, that was so confusing. The red mourning gown and the weird face mask. Looked like a lady Gaga want to be."
"__FASHION__ I like LAdy Gaga fashion, when she wore the meat suit."
"__FASHION__ The meat suit was so weird, I liked her clothes at the super bowl though."
"__FASHION__ I think she looked like sponge-bob, her outfits at least."
"__FASHION__ She has really changed her fashion style, and I enjoy it more."
