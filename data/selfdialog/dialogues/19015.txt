"__MOVIES__ What do you think about 80s comedies?"
"__MOVIES__ Those are practically the only ones I can watch."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite has to be The Breakfast Club."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great one! Ally Sheedy is great as that goth girl."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have any favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ From the 1980s? Who's That Girl is probably my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton?"
"__MOVIES__ No, you're thinking of the First Wives Club."
"__MOVIES__ Which one was Who's That Girl then?"
"__MOVIES__ That was the one that stars Madonna as an ex-convict."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I think I've heard of that one. Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Griffin Dunne plays her uptight friend. It's kind of like a remake of Bringing Up Baby."
"__MOVIES__ They remade that one in the 1990s."
"__MOVIES__ I know, with Sandra Bullock. I much prefer Madonna in the role."
"__MOVIES__ But Madonna can't even act!"
"__MOVIES__ She's not bad in this one. She's over the top, as usual."
"__MOVIES__ Well, she was never that bad in comedies."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. But she does take herself a bit too seriously."
"__MOVIES__ Look, as long as I never have to sit through Dick Tracy again, I'll be happy."
"__MOVIES__ That was a mess, but it wasn't Madonna's fault! Blame Beatty!"
