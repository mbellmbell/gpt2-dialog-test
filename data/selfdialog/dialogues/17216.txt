"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Woody Allen film?"
"__MOVIES__ That's tough. I'd have to say there are at least three."
"__MOVIES__ Annie Hall."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much automatic."
"__MOVIES__ After that it gets harder."
"__MOVIES__ One that doesn't often make the 'Top 3' list is CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS."
"__MOVIES__ Agree. For me that was one of his best 'serious' films."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yes, it dealt with some pretty serious material, but in wasn't INTERIORS."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Also, at that point, his audience was primed for serious output."
"__MOVIES__ I remember how INTERIORS caught a lot of people off guard."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely wasn't absurdist slapstick like TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN."
"__MOVIES__ I heard  Paul Verhoeven and Joe Eszterhas wanted to use the name for SHOW GIRLS after less that enthusiastic previews."
"__MOVIES__ Now THAT was a funny movie!"
"__MOVIES__ For all the wrong reasons."
"__MOVIES__ Ruined Liz Berkeley's career."
"__MOVIES__ Not her fault!"
"__MOVIES__ She was only following orders..."
"__MOVIES__ Off a cliff."
"__MOVIES__ She coulda been somebody; she coulda been a contender."
"__MOVIES__ I'd cast her in an ON THE WATERFRONT remake in Eva Marie Saint's role."
