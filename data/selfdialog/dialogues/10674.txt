"__FASHION__ are you telling me that the fighters no longer have the ability to add sponsers logos on the fight kits ?"
"__FASHION__ yes , the sad part is that , through this new deal the fighter make less money because on average most of them would bottom out at around eighty thosand a fight for the sponsed gear."

"__FASHION__ what did the second generation look like ?"
"__FASHION__ it was based on the same concept , but now it was more bolder colors instead of the whie acents, entire kits were designed to be yellow or green for brazil and all blue for the nited states . It basically took more of the white highlights from the first generation and replaced them with black."
