"__MUSIC__ Alright, what is your personal favorite as far as comedic music goes?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, my favorite comedy music artist would have to be Ray Stevens."
"__MUSIC__ Ray Steven? What's his style of music."
"__MUSIC__ Outside some spiritual and serious style songs, he does funny Country music."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, give me a few examples."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's Erik the Awful, A Viking raider who chases a fleeing group of villagers all over the world."
"__MUSIC__ All right, sounds a little werid, but how about something else."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's Family Funeral Fight."
"__MUSIC__ Family Funeral Fight, what's that one about?"
"__MUSIC__ It's about a deeply divided dysfunctional extended family who turns a funeral for a deceased relative into a knock down drag out brawl."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, sounds like it could be funny. Any more?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there is the Ballad of the Blue Cyclone Parts 1 and 2."
"__MUSIC__ Blue Cyclone? Do I have to ask?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a wrestler the protangonist of the song keeps running afoul of and gets his butt kicked."
"__MUSIC__ All right, now we are getting somewhere, any more songs like this one?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Kitty Cat's Revenge is not too dissimilair."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, how does the cat get revenge?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's a fully clawed and fanged pet ocelot trapped in a drainage pipe, it attacks the volutneer sent in to get it and cause him to distrub a ground bee nest as well."
"__MUSIC__ Ouch, that has to hurt! Sounds like most of these songs a musical slapstick comedy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but there are some more high brow humor. I'll tell you about them later."
