"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Gifted yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I did! What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really great.  I thought it had a lot of heart and that made up for how straightforward it was."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree.  That little girl was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes she was! What was her name again?"
"__MOVIES__ The actress is McKenna Grace."
"__MOVIES__ Was she in other movies? I don't remember seeing her before."
"__MOVIES__ I think she was also in the new Independence Day movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I didn't see that so that would explain it. What did you think of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a good mix of comedy and drama, and it didn't make me cry too much."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I cried like a baby, but I always do."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think it addressed the moral dilemmas enough?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay, but I could have had a little more."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wanted there to be a little more sincerity in the troubles the characters faced."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. I can't complain though because Chris Evans was in it."
"__MOVIES__ I know! He's always great."
"__MOVIES__ Especially in Captain America!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I love those movies.  He's so good at playing different roles."
"__MOVIES__ Yes he is. I think I might watch Captain America now!"
"__MOVIES__ I might too!"
