"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, this band started up recently, around the mid 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, honestly, there are better bands than these amateurs."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I researched them on some of their collabs."
"__MUSIC__ What came up?"
"__MUSIC__ Not much. These guys are only small timers."
"__MUSIC__ I like rap and hip-hop so much more."
"__MUSIC__ You think Eminem, or Jay-Z could pull this off?"
"__MUSIC__ If they were skilled enough at any instrument, yeah!"
"__MUSIC__ What about Martin Garrix, or Bruno Mars?"
"__MUSIC__ Martin Garrix's remixes are dope, and Bruno Mars is nice like that!"
"__MUSIC__ That's so true, man."
"__MUSIC__ Yo, but I think it's good that we can listen to some other music for once."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's not like it's all 'bout the hip-pop, rap, and dance music."
"__MUSIC__ Unless it's about them girls, though!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeahhh!!"
"__MUSIC__ Meh, I could buy a album for my girl, though!"
"__MUSIC__ You think she'd be into this stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Not sure, depends."
"__MUSIC__ What does she like?"
"__MUSIC__ Strutting in all of her furs, always got this full fur outfit on, like she about to walk out of Antartica."
