"__DISNEY__ I have a confession."
"__DISNEY__ What's wrong?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm kind of a Disney princess fanatic."
"__DISNEY__ What's wrong with that?"
"__DISNEY__ Sometimes I feel weird admitting that as a guy."
"__DISNEY__ It's 2017, don't let social standards deter you."
"__DISNEY__ I'm kind of a SUPER fan though."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, Who's your favorite princess?"
"__DISNEY__ I gotta say Elsa from frozen, she's a newer character but already one of the most complex."
"__DISNEY__ That's an amazing choice!"
