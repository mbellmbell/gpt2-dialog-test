"__STAR_WARS__ What are all the novelizations they talk about?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're novels based on the movies. George lucas commissioned them to be written."
"__STAR_WARS__ And they're part of the whole Star Wars expanded universe?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, for those who are not too familiar with them, it's kinda hard to follow because of the gaps in the stories."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then there's the comics too"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, and tv series etc. They all contributed to the formation of the universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then what's the Star Wars canon?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like I said the Epxnded universe took 4 decades to evolve. And Lucas wanted to consolidate the whole thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, that's why he rebranded most of them as Star Wars Legend in 2014?"
"__STAR_WARS__ yes. And he declared them mostly non-canon. So now the canon is the original trilogy, prequels, and the clone war animation series. All storiy lines must align with that canon set."
