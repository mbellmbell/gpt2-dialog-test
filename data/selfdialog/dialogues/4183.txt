"__MUSIC__ Hey, did you ever listen to Vanilla Ice?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, yes!  Of course."
"__MUSIC__ He was one of my favorite rappers when I was a kid.  I actually read his autobiography."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny.  His name was Robby Van Winkle, wasn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was his real name.  He was from Texas and Florida."
"__MUSIC__ So his first album To the Extreme came out in 1989, right?  Isn't that the one with Ice Ice Baby?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be the one!  It's hard to believe it was so long ago."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, true.  Believe it or not, Ice Ice Baby was the first hip hop single to reach the top of the Billboard hits."
"__MUSIC__ Whoah, are you serious? That is hard to believe!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  He actually released an album in 2011."
"__MUSIC__ Oh he's still around?  What was the album?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called WTF - Wisdom, Tenacity, and Focus."
"__MUSIC__ I never even heard of that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he signed with Psychopathic Records.  He's apparently still around."
"__MUSIC__ He actually did a reality show on DIY network, I remember hearing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's called the Vanilla Ice Project.  He was also on Dancing with the Stars."
"__MUSIC__ That's crazy.  Well his latest endeavor is working with Insane Clown Posse."
"__MUSIC__ That's just hard to imagine.  They sound so different than he did in his early work."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's definitely changed a lot since Ice Ice Baby."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, totally different style now I'd say."
