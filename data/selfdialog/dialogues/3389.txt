"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite one-hit wonder song?"
"__MUSIC__ Easy: Come On Eileen."
"__MUSIC__ Why that one?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's fun, and you have no idea what the lyrics are."
"__MUSIC__ That's true - even with lyrics in the background I can't understand them at all."
"__MUSIC__ I also like playing them."
"__MUSIC__ You've performed their music?"
"__MUSIC__ My pep band in undergrad had that as our repertoire."
"__MUSIC__ Was the tuba part boring? I know you played tuba."
"__MUSIC__ I did! But no, it wasn't boring at all. It's actually a fast-moving part that's pretty fun."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to their other songs?"
"__MUSIC__ If I did, that would defeat the one-hit-wonder status, wouldn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that applies to radio play."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I'm kidding. I own their first CD."
"__MUSIC__ How is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Completely unremarkable."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not that I don't like it. It's just that there's a reason they're one-hit-wonders."
"__MUSIC__ Why would that be?"
"__MUSIC__ All their music sounds the same. Nothing about it distinguishes it from anything else they've produced."
