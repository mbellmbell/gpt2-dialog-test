"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how about those Cowboys, huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm looking forward to the upcoming season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I'm a Giants fan, but I gotta ask an honest question, do you think Dak Prescott's gonna have a sophmore slump?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope not! He's the future of the Cowboys! I kind of expect it though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm looking forward to the Giants shutting him down twice a season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about the Giants defense, though, can any of your defensive backs cover Dez Bryant?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like our chances. How about you guys and covering Odell Beckham?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You guys got a lot of great receivers now, but it's gonna be hard to take advantage when we knock Eli on his back!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh.. we'll see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You guys still got Ereck Flowers, and our pass rush is dangerous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, Eli's gonna have to get rid of the ball quickly, but our defensive line is good, too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah, but the Cowboys have a great offensive line. Why do you think Prescott and Elliott tore defenses to shreds last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We know what's coming, and we'll be ready!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I certainly hope so. It's still gonna be some great games, but you know I'm pulling for the Cowboys until the day I die."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants/Cowboys Sunday Night week 1 has become a tradition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too bad we don't play each other on Thanksgiving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's about time the Giants got to play on Thanksgiving, but they're playing the Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That team's a mess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it, their situation with Cousins is silly. Pay the man already."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they paid Albert Haynesworth a whole lot of money one time and look what happened!"
