"__SUPERHERO__ The drugs didn't make that much sense"
"__SUPERHERO__ They may have added quick reflexes to match up to spiderman"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, but his main weapons were that he could fly and had bombs"
"__SUPERHERO__ I guess Spiderman was a little better than both of the goblins"
"__SUPERHERO__ It made me sad that the bomb messed up Harry's face"
