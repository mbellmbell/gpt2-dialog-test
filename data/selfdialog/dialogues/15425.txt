"__HARRY_POTTER__ Are you going to see Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone with the Symphony?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes.  I'm looking forward to the first glimpse of Hogwarts with a live orchestra."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know.  I find the orchestra distracting."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I saw Back to the Future with live orchestra and it made it so much better."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I never did see any of the Harry Potter films at the theater.  That would be a similar experience."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The special effects are even better in the theater."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love it when they fly on brooms."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ My favorite part are the spells."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like in the first one when Hermoine corrects them on that levitation spell."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah!  That part cracks me up."
