"__MUSIC__ Hey , have you heard any new music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I've been listening to a lot of classics."
"__MUSIC__ Why classics? Don't you like new stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I do but new music just isn't as good."
"__MUSIC__ Could you explain what you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I just like the way that lyrics in classic music carried more emotion in them."
"__MUSIC__ That's your opinion but I can see how you might feel that way."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. I've been listening to a lot of classic rock and rap."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? Which artists have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like ACDC and Metallica when it comes to rock."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I really like those bands too."
"__MUSIC__ As far as rap I have been listening to Tupac and Biggies as well as DMX."
"__MUSIC__ Those are some classics for sure!"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I have liked them since I was a kid and the new rap just doesn't hold up."
"__MUSIC__ I can imagine it comes back to the lyrics again huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. This new stuff doesn't really have meaning to me. Just mindless words that are flashy and hyper."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good way to put it. I don't listen to much rap."
"__MUSIC__ You should check out some of the classics, you might change your mind."
"__MUSIC__ OK I will do that and let you know next time I see you."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Have a good day."
