"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see the new transformers movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I'm not a big fan of them."
"__MOVIES__ Really? You don't like transformers?"
"__MOVIES__ I do, I just don't really like the movies."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the first one was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, ok. The first one wasn't bad."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Shia Lebouff and Megan Foxx right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, that was was pretty decent. But they've really gone downhill since then."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I can see where you're coming from. The story isn't great."
"__MOVIES__ The story is bad, and the characters are dull."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe they replaced Megan Foxx."
"__MOVIES__ She probably quit, honestly."
"__MOVIES__ I doubt it, they still make a lot of money, people love robots."
"__MOVIES__ That's another thing. You can barely even tell what the robots are doing half the time."
"__MOVIES__ Yea that can be confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Pacific Rim is a way better movie if you like robots."
"__MOVIES__ I never watched that, it's really that good?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh it's fantastic. The story isn't great but the robot's are amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Ok then, maybe I'll watch Pacific Rim instead of Transformers."
"__MOVIES__ Watch them both and tell me which you think is better."
