"__MOVIES__ You know the genre of movies I can't stand watching? Musicals! How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I enjoy a musical from time to time. My least favorite are black and white movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they are pretty terrible."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. What movies are your favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ I like obscure movies like Welcome to the Dollhouse and Doom Generation. Ever heard of them?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but Welcome to the Dollhouse sounds scary, is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not a scary movie, it's about an unattractive 11 year old girl whose parents ignore her and her little sister gets everything."
"__MOVIES__ Oh goodness that sounds like real life! What else?"
"__MOVIES__ Dawn, the 11 year old girl, meets a boy after detention and he threatens to rape her."
"__MOVIES__ Yikes! Does he go to jail?"
"__MOVIES__ No, they end up being close and even dating. It is a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ I like Kevin Smith movies, that reminds me of a Smith flick. Ever see any?"
"__MOVIES__ Um, only Chasing Amy and Mallrats."
"__MOVIES__ I love Mallrats! Jason Lee is so good in that movie, also Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes are awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they play Jay and Silent Bob in that movie. They're a great pair."
"__MOVIES__ They are so funny in all the Jay and Silent Bob movies. I especially like when Bob can't see the 3D picture."
"__MOVIES__ That is very funny. Who else is in Mallrats?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe Jason London, Joey Lauren Adams, Shannen Doherty, Ben Affleck and Ethan Suplee if I remember correctly."
"__MOVIES__ Joey Lauren Adams was one of my favorite movie stars in the 1990s, she was great in Chasing Amy too."
"__MOVIES__ She was also great in Clerks."
