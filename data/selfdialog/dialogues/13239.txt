"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, I just got offered box seats for next seasons 49ers games"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow that's awesome! How much are they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy said he's not going to be using them and he won't charge us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well are you going to take them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. We don't really know too much about football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. I don't even know the name of any players on the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither. But if we had box seats for all season we would learn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. And it's nice to go to the park."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I do enjoy the excitement of the competition and the crowds"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. Let's do it. Maybe we'll become huge 49ers fans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose we could do some research before we go. Maybe read up on the team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. We could check their website and learn the players and coaches names so that we would look like we know a little."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. And maybe we could get some jerseys so we fit in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I like clothes shopping. Yeah, let's get into the SF 49ers fashion"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. But I don't want one of those jerseys with the players name on the back. Someone will inevitably ask me something about them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you won't know who that is! How hilarious"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I'm going to tell my friend that we'll take the tickets"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I'm on the 49ers website right now. Let's see, who is the quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least you know the names of the positions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. So, what's your favorite postion?"
