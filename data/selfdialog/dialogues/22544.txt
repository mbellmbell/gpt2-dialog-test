"__DISNEY__ I've just realised that despite there being dozens of Disney films, they're all set in London."
"__DISNEY__ Well that's just not true."
"__DISNEY__ OK then name one that isn't."
"__DISNEY__ Dumbo is set in Africa."
"__DISNEY__ That's just one exception."
"__DISNEY__ Tarzan is literally king of a jungle."
"__DISNEY__ OK so they made a couple."
"__DISNEY__ The Jungle Book literally has jungle in its title, there are bears and tigers. You don't get those in London."
"__DISNEY__ OK I may have been a bit wrong there."
"__DISNEY__ You were about as wrong as Dumbo was when he got drunk and thought he could see pink elephants."
