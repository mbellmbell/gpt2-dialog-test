"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite music to work out to at the gym?"
"__MUSIC__ I use a Japanese song during my fartleks."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry, your ... fartleks?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ it's the Swedish term for interval running. I go back and forth between 7.0, 8.0, 7.1, 8.1, every few minutes."
"__MUSIC__ So what's the song and why do you use it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the theme from Attack on Titan."
"__MUSIC__ Which? There are three."
"__MUSIC__ Right, I forgot they switched the music halfway through season 1."
"__MUSIC__ I prefer the original."
"__MUSIC__ I love the music to the original and season two the most."
"__MUSIC__ Why do they let you run that interval?"
"__MUSIC__ It's short and intense, so I only have to run a specific speed for a few minutes."
"__MUSIC__ Got it, sounds good."
"__MUSIC__ I also like pretending I'm fighting in the universe."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, you're ridiculous. But if it helps you run."
"__MUSIC__ I just wish I knew the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I've looked them up but can't remember them."
"__MUSIC__ The way they depict them falling off the cliff in Season 2 is beautifully-set. The music slows down as they fall."
