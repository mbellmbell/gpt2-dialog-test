"__DISNEY__ Have you read the story The Little Mermaid was based on?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't."
"__DISNEY__ Lucky, it's so sad! The Disney movie is way more upbeat."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, well it makes sense that they changed it for a kid's movie then."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, in the original story she dies."
"__DISNEY__ Who dies?"
"__DISNEY__ Ariel! She goes to heaven, though."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, thank goodness they changed it. That would never have worked."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and it worked out for the best. I love The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. Part Of Your World is a classic karaoke number."
