"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the new Arcade Fire song that was released today?"
"__MUSIC__ I love it, but the breakdown in the middle of the song with the flute comes off as pretentious to me."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I agree. However, it's still a great song and seems very vital considering the state of the world right now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I have no doubt the album will be fantastic. Did you hear that Radiohead are releasing the 20th Anniversary Edition of OK Computer soon?"
"__MUSIC__ I did hear that, yes. The super-deluxe edition vinyl is something I desperately want to purchase, but it is hard to justify the $130 price tag."
"__MUSIC__ I think it'll definitely be worth the money, considering how much bonus content comes with it. It's a wonderful collector's item, and it's only fitting to buy it since I think it's one of the best albums of all time."
"__MUSIC__ I'm tempted to agree with you, but I will always think In Rainbows is a tighter, more consistently perfect collection of songs. I think OK Computer has one or two filler tracks, like Climbing Up The Walls and Lucky."
"__MUSIC__ No way, Lucky is one of the hidden gems on OK Computer. You always hear praise about Paranoid Android and Subterranean Homesick Alien instead."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good point, but it still feels slightly bloated to me. It's also a very heavy listen and can be incredibly depressing depending on what mood you're in."
"__MUSIC__ That's what makes it a brilliant work of art, that paranoia, malaise and uneasiness seep into every second of the album."
"__MUSIC__ I think you should give In Rainbows another chance. It's a perfectly short 40-minute suite of seduction pop."
"__MUSIC__ Don't get me wrong, I love In Rainbows, it's easily one of Radiohead's best. But it's not as revolutionary as Kid A or OK Computer."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely agree with the Kid A part. You'd be hard-pressed to find a band completely reinventing themselves like that in a more dynamic way."
"__MUSIC__ Listening to it still gives me chills. How they could come up with a song as unsettling as Idioteque is beyond me."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. It's one of their most unique songs, and luckily they always play it live in their setlist. Did you know I saw their set at Lollapalooza last year?"
"__MUSIC__ Really? That's amazing, I've always wanted to see them live. They hardly ever tour though."
"__MUSIC__ I'm telling you, it was the most surreal, wonderful and amazing concert I've ever been to. It was almost a spiritual experience, it was that good."
"__MUSIC__ I don't doubt it, each one of the band members are consistently at the top of their game, and have the precision of classically trained musicians."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and they did not disappoint in the slightest. I hope I get to see them again in my lifetime before they call it quits."
"__MUSIC__ If you do, take me with you!"
