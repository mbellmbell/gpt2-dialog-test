"__ACTION__ Hey, are you excited for the new transformers movie?"
"__ACTION__ Not really, I don't like transformers."
"__ACTION__ Really? Why not?"
"__ACTION__ It's so commercialized. It's barely even a movie. I can't even understand what's happening on the screen most of the time."
"__ACTION__ Yea I agree, they've gotten a little crazy with the special effects."
"__ACTION__ It's dumb, they are just trying to sell cars and toys to people."
"__ACTION__ I guess so, but it's still pretty epic. The plot is pretty good too."
"__ACTION__ Not really, in the new one optimus prime turns rogue and they have to stop him. It's dumb."
"__ACTION__ No its not, that's the same plot they used for the new Fast and Furious."
"__ACTION__ Yea, exactly."
