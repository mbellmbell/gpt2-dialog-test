"__MUSIC__ Stefani Germanotta is such a weird singer."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, who?"
"__MUSIC__ Lady Gaga."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa, her real name is Stefani?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's like three names long too. One of them's Joanne."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I never would have guessed. I suppose that's why she shortened it."
"__MUSIC__ But why to Lady Gaga, that's so weird!"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, you can complain all you want, but her music is fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ I just find it weird that she was one of the first women to get four albums to number one."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I'm not surprised. Her voice is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly I never really knew she could sing until the Super Bowl."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that girl's got pipes! Plus her songs are super catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I think it was when she started singing Million Reasons that I was like, oh, you're not just all flash."
"__MUSIC__ I super want to listen to Bad Romance now. It makes you want to dance!"
"__MUSIC__ That and Poker Face. Those were her first breakout songs, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, along with Telephone."
"__MUSIC__ But why does she have to be so weird? Like, meat dresses?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but I don't think she does that as much any more."
"__MUSIC__ Be weird to get fame, then be you, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Now turn on Bad Romance! I want my 2009 dance groove on!"
