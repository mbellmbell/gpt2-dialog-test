"__MUSIC__ What kinds of music are you in to?"

"__MUSIC__ Oh cool. Were they good?"

"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I've heard of that. I've never been but I've had multiple friends go in the past."

"__MUSIC__ What bands/artists did you see there? Which were your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I think my two favorite shows by far were Pearl Jam and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. They were both awesome sets for different reasons."
