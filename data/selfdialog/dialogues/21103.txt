"__THRILLER__ What is the difference between a thriller movie and a horror movie?"
"__THRILLER__ In my opinion, the movie genres are very similar.  Sometimes the words can be used interchangeable to describe the same movie."
"__THRILLER__ At first, I thought that horror movies dealt more with the supernatural--like The Paranormal movies."
"__THRILLER__ You have movies that are called thrillers that also incorporate the supernatural like The Shining."
"__THRILLER__ True.  I have to admit that I have never really liked supernatural horror movies because I never get scared!"
"__THRILLER__ Have you seen Silence of the Lambs?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes.  Now, that movie is unnerving to me."
"__THRILLER__ I would classify that as a thriller movie."
"__THRILLER__ I think it is unnerving to me because it is closer to reality than a movie with the supernatural.  The actor who played the serial killer Buffalo Bill freaked me out."
"__THRILLER__ That is a good point.  Someone like Buffalo Bill has or probably does exist in our world right now."
