"__STAR_WARS__ What is the most memorable star wars movie for you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would say it is  the 1999 episode 1 because it was the first one I saw in theaters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see,that was an exciting time. I remember waiting in line for tickets. So much buzz."
"__STAR_WARS__ There really was a ton of hype. What was your most memorable?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to go old school original Star Wars movie 1977. It was so meaningful to me  and watched it so many times,"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is the classic Star Wars. I liked how you had no idea of luke's father in the first one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya it was so smart of george lucas to present them in the order he did."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed, it would not have had the same impact if the plot in the  episode 1, 2 and 3 in the 200's had already been known."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the reveal of luke's father was such a shocker. Probably had a lot to do with the popularity of the originals."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya I still think they would have been groundbreaking but much less of a plot twist surprise ending if the movies had come out in order."
