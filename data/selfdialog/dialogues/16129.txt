"__ROCK__ Did you hear about the hoax about Axl Rose from Guns and Roses?"
"__ROCK__ No, what happened?"
"__ROCK__ Somebody put up a Facebook page on June 20th saying RIP Axl Rose, with an obituary saying he had passed away, asking people to sign their condolences on the page."
"__ROCK__ He didn't really die?"
"__ROCK__ No, apparently fake death hoaxes has become quite the thing, but a bunch of people fell for it and were signing the page and upset by it."
"__ROCK__ What kind of sick person thinks it's funny pretending someone has died?"
"__ROCK__ Quite a few sickos I guess, since apparently a long list of celebrities have had this kind of hoax reported about them."
"__ROCK__ I don't think it's funny upsetting people who believed it was true."
"__ROCK__ A bunch of fans questioned it, because it wasn't being reported by major news sources, but hundreds of fans fell for it and were writing condolence messages on the page."
"__ROCK__ Guns and Roses had some really devoted fans, so I can imagine there were a lot of upset fans when they read that."
