"__MOVIES__ Seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I just watched Look Who's Back. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't even heard of it! Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's definitely really bizarre."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It's this German...comedy...about Adolf Hitler waking up in a park in 2014 and being totally confused about where he is."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, what? That sounds so weird!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and no one believes he's himself, obviously, but it actually takes a surprising turn at the end and has a really positive message."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's good, I was a little worried with the subject matter."
"__MOVIES__ Right? But I liked it overall. Have you seen anything lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I just watched Swiss Army Man on Amazon the other night."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, is that the weird one with Daniel Radcliffe?"
"__MOVIES__ The one where he plays a corpse? Yeah, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, yeah, I saw that movie recently too and thought it was super weird."
"__MOVIES__ Right? But again, also a really positive message at the end."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I thought it was a little corny at points with the friendship message, but I think it worked overall."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I didn't think it was corny at all."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we all see perceive films a little differently. Anyway, going to anything this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I was thinking of going to see Guardians of the Galaxy. You want to come?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! How does Friday night sound?"
