"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So will you be watching any NFL games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  I used to love the Patriots..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't anymore?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really.  That's why I don't think I'll follow the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The whole 'deflategate' thing turned me off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why so?  I don't think it was that big of a deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I lost faith in Tom Brady and he was my favorite player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't think he did anything wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he should have turned over his cell phone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not personally, no.  Do you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  It really bothered me at the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they cheated.  Even if they did, it wasn't that bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just not sure I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was so horrible about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just the fact that they might have cheated.  It made me feel like a fool for following them for so long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You felt duped?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, definitely.  I just don't think I'll ever have that passion for them again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I see your point of view but perhaps you can get past it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it but I appreciate your optimism!"
