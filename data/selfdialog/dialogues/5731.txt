"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not as much of a hater on the changes Lucas put into the remasters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whoa wait, you like the digital effects touch ups on the original trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't hate them, they're what he would have added if he could have at the time of filming."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not agree with that, it seemed to me like something he was doing just to put bullet points on the box."
"__STAR_WARS__ See but you can never really know that."
"__STAR_WARS__ What other logical reason is there to obsessively add stuff to films that are already perfect other than artificial value?"
"__STAR_WARS__ A man thinking he can do better, people give him a bad wrap for so many things I feel bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ While I don't think he is being malicious when he adds stuff, at the same time it's okay to not like them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess you're right, it's just kind of sad to watch people rag on the creator of Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh agreed, I will never stoop to that level because he gave us such a gift."
