"__BEATLES__ So, I've been listening The Beatles a lot lately...."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, yeah? I love them. Which albums?"
"__BEATLES__ Sgt. Pepper's -- very trippy album!"
"__BEATLES__ Haha, yes! The songs are really great though."
"__BEATLES__ What do you think Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is about?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, I've read some people think it's about drugs but John Lennon said it was about a drawing his son made."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, wow that's interesting. I didn't know that!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, John's son drew a picture of a woman flying and said her name was Lucy in the sky with diamonds."
"__BEATLES__ That's cool he got his songwriting inspiration from his son!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that's a good song! I also love A Day in the Life from that album."
