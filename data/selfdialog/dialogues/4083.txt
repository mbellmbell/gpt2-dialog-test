"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Low Down Dirty Blues?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I know about that, what is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well you know what blues music is right?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I do."
"__MUSIC__ Well the Low Down Dirty version is what you would find in New Orleans in the local clubs and saloons."
"__MUSIC__ I still don't understand, wasn't Blues music like that too?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of, but the Low Down artists would interact with the patrons."
"__MUSIC__ Oh like walk around?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yes, and it's a lot of fun!"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds okay, but not great."
"__MUSIC__ You have to go try a show out, they bring the audience in and make you laugh."
"__MUSIC__ What else do they do besides walk around?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes they call audience members on stage and try to embarrass them."
"__MUSIC__ Ooh now that sounds fun!"
"__MUSIC__ It is, unless you're the one being called onstage."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, yea, I could see that being a problem."
"__MUSIC__ It's not a problem, it's really fun still, but it can be embarrassing."
"__MUSIC__ Why would I want to go then?"
"__MUSIC__ Because they don't always pick you and even when they do it's still fun."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like I'll have to try it sometime!"
