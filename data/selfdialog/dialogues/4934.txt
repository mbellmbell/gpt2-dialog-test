"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How well do you think The Rock fits into the Fast & Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He is the only person I can see playing Hobbs in those movies."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He does bring a certain level of awesome to the film."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Totally, he's strong enough to be menacing but still able to make the jokes seem realistic."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He usually does play big goofy guys that still ends up kicking your teeth in."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What was your favorite Hobbs moment, any film?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It would have to be when he was in prison with Statham."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ When Jason was saying how easy it would be on to beat up The Rock?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, then Hobbs just ribs the bench out of the wall and starts lifting it like weights."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The look on Jason's face was priceless; of course, The Rocks face was just as good."
