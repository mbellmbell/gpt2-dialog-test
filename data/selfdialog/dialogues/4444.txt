"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of metal music?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely! My favorite band is Metallica."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, same here! Do you have a favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd definitely have to go with One. I just love how the song goes from being so mellow to a barrage of thrash metal."
"__MUSIC__ I really like that too, but it's not my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ So then which song is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd probably have to go with Sad But True. I like the more straightforward hard rock style."
"__MUSIC__ So you're a fan of 90s Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm willing to say yes. I know that most aren't though."
"__MUSIC__ I respect that. I'll admit that their 90s albums are a guilty pleasure of mine."
"__MUSIC__ Why a guilty pleasure?"
"__MUSIC__ Because the majority of the people a hang around with hate those albums."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see."
"__MUSIC__ St. Anger is also a guilty pleasure of mine."
"__MUSIC__ I hated St. Anger. The snare in that album makes it tough to get through."
"__MUSIC__ I get that, but I still really like it. I think it's more raw than most other Metallica albums."
"__MUSIC__ Since we're talking about Metallica, have you heard their last album?"
"__MUSIC__ Hardwired? Yeah, and I thought it was solid."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. My favorite track was Atlas, Rise."
"__MUSIC__ Mine was Spit Out the Bone."
