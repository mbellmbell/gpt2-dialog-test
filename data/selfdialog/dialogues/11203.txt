"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think the top NFL teams will be this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots will definitely be one of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.  I think so for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are coming off a big high in winning the superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes that is very true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you know what?  They have been one of the top teams for like the last 10 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.  They are either in the Superbowl or the conference final to go to the Superbowl most years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep the Brady and Belichick duo is pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are pretty much a dynasty team right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have most of the core players coming back for this season so I don't see their winning ways changing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only thing is they had a chip on their shoulder for the last few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, with the deflategate scandal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  I wonder if they will have a little less fire now that they silenced the critics with a Superbowl win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. I think Brady is so mad he will have a chip on his shoulder for the rest of his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you are right.  He probably will try to win ever year until he retires to prove a point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's like forty so he does not have that many years left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's in freakishly good shape but you are right.  40 is pushing the limit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am thinking 2 to 3 years max."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as he can play at a high level I think he should play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.  I agree he should play and win more championships as long as he can."
