"__MUSIC__ Do composers write love songs because their hearts are full, or are their hearts full because they stir themselves up with music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Music does go straight to the emotions."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. But maybe you'd have to be rather cold and detached to write an affecting love song?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean? Musicians compose because their hearts are full of song."
"__MUSIC__ No, they compose to fill our hearts with song. That takes judgment, which comes from cool detachment."
"__MUSIC__ So when a musician writes about his true love's light brown hair, he's thinking about tempo and counterpoint and such?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course he is. Music has to have form, or it's just noise."
"__MUSIC__ But it has to be inspired, or it's just flat."
"__MUSIC__ Flat. Now you're making sharp remarks."
"__MUSIC__ Funny, but really...not. The difference between trite popular music and the stuff that lasts is inspiration."
"__MUSIC__ Or perhaps it's skill, talent, and application."
"__MUSIC__ That too, maybe. But they have to feel it, or they're just pushing notes around."
"__MUSIC__ So you thnk the more intensely a composer or songwriter feels, the better his work. Or hers."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I do. While you think she just has to know her business, and then work at it industriously. Or he."
"__MUSIC__ Picture that composer, alone with his score, writing and rewriting, hearing it all in the silence. That person can't be high on love."
"__MUSIC__ But have you ever heard a group, late at night in some bar, playing to each other, comunicating like they're psychic?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and when I've felt that, I've been tired, and sleepy, and susceptible."
"__MUSIC__ Now you're just being contrary. You've felt it."
"__MUSIC__ But what I've felt isn't necessarily real. Music, you know, is mathematical. It's thought."
"__MUSIC__ Music, even if you don't know, is emotion."
