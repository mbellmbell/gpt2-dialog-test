"__MUSIC__ What kind of music genres do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly classic rock and 60s folk, what about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm an indie lover, but I also like modern country."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Those are really different. What's modern country like?"
"__MUSIC__ I think of it as a mix of pop and soft country."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. So like Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ More like The Band Perry and some of Brantley Gilbert's stuff. Taylor swift is more pop by now."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check that out. Personally, I don't like the twang and themes of a lot of old country, but this sounds like something I'd enjoy."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's pretty great. In some ways it's similar to folk."
"__MUSIC__ Really? So maybe we'd enjoy some of the same 60s folk music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so. I'm a big Pete Seeger fan."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love his music, so authentic. Ever heard of John Prine?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who's he?"
"__MUSIC__ He's definitely more 1970s, but he's an easygoing, sarcastic, anti-establishment folk singer."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check him out. Sometimes I really wish more modern folk/indie singers channeled 60s folk values."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, good point. Some, like Julien Baker, are really good, but they mainly sing about love."
"__MUSIC__ The Fleet Foxes and Neutral Milk Hotel are very mystical, but convey antiestablishment."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that in the Fleet Foxes. But I think you have to go to modern rap to get real antiestablishment values."
"__MUSIC__ But rappers don't live out those values, usually. They get caught up in wealth and fame, at least the big ones."
"__MUSIC__ Not Jay-Z. He does a lot of good."
