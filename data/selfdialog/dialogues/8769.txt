"__BEATLES__ what do you think is the most romantic beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ I would pick something, by George Harrison."
"__BEATLES__ That is a romantic one. Imagine if it was written about you.."
"__BEATLES__ ya then it turns into the ultimate love song."
"__BEATLES__ I think all their wives at that time were featured in the music video."
"__BEATLES__ I believe that is right. I slightly recall yoko in shorts and in a park with john."
"__BEATLES__ Something like that. Smart move on their part, Happy wife Happy Life."
"__BEATLES__ I don't think john lennon would agree. it seemed like the happier he and yoko were the less happy the band life got."
"__BEATLES__ I wonder if yoko really was a major reason they split or if it was bound to happen no matter what."
"__BEATLES__ Who can say. I am just glad we had them for as long as we did. The music is great!"
