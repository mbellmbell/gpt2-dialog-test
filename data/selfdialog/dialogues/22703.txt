"__DISNEY__ I've got a question for you.  It's about Disney."
"__DISNEY__ You have my undivided attention now.  What's your question?"
"__DISNEY__ What is the best Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ That is an extremely tough question, but I'll have to go with 'Beauty and the Beast.'"
"__DISNEY__ That's an excellent choice.  What aspect do you like the best?"
"__DISNEY__ Honestly, I like every aspect of it.  The writing was near flawless and the music is memorable."
"__DISNEY__ There is something just beautiful about that whole soundtrack.  Did you watch the live-action version?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw it on opening night."
"__DISNEY__ What was your opinion on it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I liked it a lot.  But it was pretty much, beat-for-beat, the exact same as the original."
