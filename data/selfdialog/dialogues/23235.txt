"__DISNEY__ My sister just got a copy of the Aristocats."
"__DISNEY__ I remember that movie, the cats with the accents."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that one. I used to love that movie."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! When I was young I'd sing all the cat songs."
"__DISNEY__ What's the name of the song where all the cats are singing together in the house?"
"__DISNEY__ When they're having their piano lessons?"
"__DISNEY__ No, it's kinda jazzy. They meet with other cats to sing."
"__DISNEY__ Is it towards the end of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think it is."
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm, Everybody wants to be a cat, right?"
