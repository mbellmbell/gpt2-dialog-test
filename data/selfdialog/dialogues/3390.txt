"__MUSIC__ Do you think there's a definitive end to possible new music?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course not, what do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, think about it - there are essentially only 12 notes right?"
"__MUSIC__ Well sure, across octaves. What's your point?"
"__MUSIC__ Those 12 notes can't be thrown together randomly - there are certain specific scales that sound universally good to everyone."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I suppose..."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you have 12 notes, you have certain scales - there's a finite number of bits to music that make it sound good."
"__MUSIC__ You're saying we could hit an upper limit on song structures?"
"__MUSIC__ Essentially, yes. There is an upper limit to the amount of unique songs that can be written."
"__MUSIC__ Assuming you're not just putting together random notes and calling it a new composition..."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, this assumes that the end product follows the established musical rules."
"__MUSIC__ But won't those rules change over time?"
"__MUSIC__ Eventually they most likely will, but our sense experiences would have to change."
"__MUSIC__ what do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ the way we hear music, how our ears react to specific tones - that all would have to change"
"__MUSIC__ for us to break through that upper limit of innovation?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I think - for music to sound good it must follow certain rules and those rules also create a finite amount of possible new music"
"__MUSIC__ Unless we see new genres that break those rules - like harsh noise. What if harsh noise as a protest to this became the new pop standard?"
"__MUSIC__ Then I suppose we'd all find the pop music of the future to be a lot worse, and a lot more interesting."
"__MUSIC__ well, then may we live in interesting times..."
