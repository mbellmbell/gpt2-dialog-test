"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What are you listening to?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, I'm listening to Public Enemy's discography again."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How long does that take?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well they have 13 studio albums, so..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nice. Where are you at right now?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ About halfway through It Takes A Nation. It's probably one of my least favourite of their albums but it gets good around that last 3 or so songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How so?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's just when it really seems to pick up and you can feel more energy in it. The rest of the album doesn't excite me and sounds basically the same."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I hear ya. I know some albums like that, from people like Ice Cube mainly."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm glad you can relate."
