"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hello! Long time no see!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey man, it's been awhile!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You done anything cool lately?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, I don't know how cool it is, but I saw a great movie last night."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Which one, maybe I've seen it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Um, Hidden Figures?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yes! That movie should have won the Oscars it was nominated for, it was fantastic."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wasn't it great? I thought it was super well done."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The scripting and the casting was fantastic."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That scene where Katherine chews out her coworkers for having to run across campus was so good."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. I know it was based on a true story, so I wonder if that was true."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Her running across town? Yeah, I know that part was."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, I meant that the coworkers actually listened and changed."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh. Yeah, I don't know about that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It just makes me so mad to think about the fact that they even made the coffee part different for 'coloreds.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Racism is messed up, man."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm glad that movie was made. It did a good job of recognizing those people."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ We've white washed a lot of history, unfortunately."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, hopefully the actors will get more roles after this, I enjoyed all of them."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Taraji especially was amazing."
