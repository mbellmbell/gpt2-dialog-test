"__MOVIES__ Then it is a perfect ending for John Wick to annihilate the High Table. It's a poetic justice."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but hard to make another sequel once Wick does that. Wick can destroy the High Table's most evil and sinister character who wants him dead."
"__MOVIES__ But keep the others around, just in case, he wants to go back to work..."
"__MOVIES__ No, not go back to work for the High Table, but leave room for simmering discontent between them."
"__MOVIES__ The type of discontent that can boil over with a slightest malcontent and misdeeds. From either side."
"__MOVIES__ Precisely. Now you can make a 4th sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Not sure if I want to see 4th sequel of John Wick."
"__MOVIES__ Why not? What if the 3rd sequel is as good as the 2nd?"
"__MOVIES__ Well. the premise has to change somewhat, but this is just one oorup of adversaries against the single assassin."
"__MOVIES__ Well, he did leave the Russian mob boss alive in the 2nd movie. So in the 4th one, who knows, maybe the High table and Russiam mob joins hands."
"__MOVIES__ And get destroyed by Wick again! That I will see!"
"__MOVIES__ And this time around, he leaves NO ONE alive. Not even their dogs, nor their cats."
"__MOVIES__ Kill 'em ALL!."
"__MOVIES__ Yep."
"__MOVIES__ Sigh, that will be so good."
"__MOVIES__ Yep."
"__MOVIES__ You know what will be better?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ If John Wick finds another love interest in the 4th movie, and then Russian Mob kills her in cooperation with the High Table,, and that becomes the reason for John Wick ultimate rage, and murderous rampage. he's going to kill them all this time. And this time he means it."
"__MOVIES__ Eh. Too typical. We would expect a rage for something like that. And it's not very believable that Russian Mob will do something so stupid, unless they have no choice. i don't know we'll see what happens in the 3rd movie. Let's go watch the chapter 2 again."
