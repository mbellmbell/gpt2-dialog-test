"__MUSIC__ Jake! How's it going bud, what are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Just going for a jog, I like to get some 50 cent in the bloodstream."
"__MUSIC__ 50 cent, you didn't strike me as the gangster rapper type."
"__MUSIC__ I get that a lot, but 50 is one of my favorite artists."
"__MUSIC__ To tell you the truth, I love the guy's style too!"
"__MUSIC__ Really, you got any favorite songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh for sure, I love his first album so much, the song Heat changed my life."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, Heat is an incredible track!"
"__MUSIC__ It is so vicious with the lyrics and drums, I love what Dr. Dre did on that one."
"__MUSIC__ The combination of Eminem and Dr. Dre everywhere on that album truly made it a classic."
"__MUSIC__ I completely agree, I love all those artists the same!"
"__MUSIC__ The early 2000s Aftermath production team was just off the wall!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe the best hip hop dynamic of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ I can see that, the East Coast, West Coast and even the Midwest were covered with the label."
"__MUSIC__ There was a lot of diversity with Aftermath and nobody slouched on their verses."
"__MUSIC__ You could tell Dr. Dre made those guys rehearse to perfection."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that is why we got perfect albums from them!"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know you knew so much about hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ I just got excited when you said you loved 50 Cent!"
"__MUSIC__ That is awesome, I'm gonna go jam now!"
