"__MUSIC__ Do you know about Trivium?"
"__MUSIC__ They released Ascendancy, didn't they?"
"__MUSIC__ That's the one."
"__MUSIC__ Then yeah, I've heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ I recently started checking them out and I really like them. That's why I'm asking."
"__MUSIC__ Which albums have you heard?"
"__MUSIC__ Ascendancy, like you said. I also listened to Shogun and In Waves."
"__MUSIC__ Those have to be their three best ones."
"__MUSIC__ I also saw that they have some more recent ones."
"__MUSIC__ I don't have a very high opinion of their stuff after In Waves."
"__MUSIC__ Why? What's wrong with it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not that. It's just that their sound is changing dramatically."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound like a bad thing."
"__MUSIC__ Again, it's not. It's just something that I'm not used to."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check them out to see what it sounds like."
"__MUSIC__ You do that, and then tell me what you think."
"__MUSIC__ Is it really that drastic?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. The Trivium that wrote Silence in the Snow is not the same one that wrote Ascendancy."
"__MUSIC__ Did they change members or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. They've had drummer changes, but that's about it."
