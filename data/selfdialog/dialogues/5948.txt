"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite part about The Revenge Of The Sith?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I really liked the Wookie Battle on Kashyyyk. I just thought it was way too short."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know one of the best parts about the original trilogy was that the fights lasted a good long time."
"__STAR_WARS__ They just used up all their screen time on an Anakin Padme romance."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really feel like that was a bit of a mistake."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, kind of made the movies less awesome. But the Anakin versus Obi Wan battle was very cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's true. They seemed very evenly matched, but I feel like Anakin had a bit of an edge."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Obi Wan seems to have the best luck in the galaxy! He always escapes sticky situations."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope that in upcoming movies if they have a battle, it's longer than 30 seconds. They definitely did really well with that in Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, Rogue One was freaking amazing! Disney hasn't let me down yet with any of their productions."
