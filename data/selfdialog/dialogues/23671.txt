"__DISNEY__ What do you think of Disney remaking Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Well, it's a tough question. The original came out in 1991, which doesn't seem like too long ago, but movie making has changed."
"__DISNEY__ That's for sure. I just think the original is so perfect."
"__DISNEY__ It might be, but we're watching with the eyes of adults, not the eyes of a young kid who has grown up on the current crop of movies."
"__DISNEY__ I'm definitely going to see it. I want to find out if the kids of today will get as magical of an experience as we did."
"__DISNEY__ Let's make a plan. I'll come with you."
"__DISNEY__ You're more than welcome to come, but you know there's no shame in seeing a Disney movie on your own as an adult."
"__DISNEY__ I would feel a little weird going in theaters all alone."
"__DISNEY__ Well, luckily you don't have to, but it wouldn't be so bad."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think most people are so taken in by the movie itself that they're not even paying attention to me."
