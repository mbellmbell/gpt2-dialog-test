"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HEy what do you think about the San Diego Chargers this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think anything about the San Diego Chargers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Charger franchise moved to L.A. The Raiders are moving too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders are moving? To where?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're gonna be going to Las Vegas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's too bad. Marshawn Lynch just signed that contract with them, and he loves Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he'll be long gone before they actually move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they won't be moving for a few years I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok. What was the name of the running back they had before Marshawn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Latavius Murray.  He was pretty good, I don't know why they didn't just keep him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he was solid, I think he ended up going to the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure did, then Adrian Peterson had to figure out somewhere to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's funny how these kinds of carousels just happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think ADrian was done anyway.  He looked way past his prime last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he looked slow. Still good, but slow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think these guys know when to call it quits, they think they'll be good forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah like Brett Favre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I still hear his name come up sometimes with interest of playing."
