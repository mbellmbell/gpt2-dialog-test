"__MOVIES__ Have you seen John Carter?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was awful."
"__MOVIES__ It was one of the most expensive movies ever made, and flopped hard."
"__MOVIES__ I had to turn it off after a half an hour."
"__MOVIES__ I never read the original novel, but Edgar Rice Borroughs must be spinning in his grave."
"__MOVIES__ There's a visual for you."
"__MOVIES__ Why does Hollywood make such awful blockbusters these days?"
"__MOVIES__ They try to go the safe route and appeal to everyone. Often they end up appealing to no one."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
"__MOVIES__ Films don't take risks anymore. That's what made the original Ghostbusters so great. It was a niche movie that hit it big."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the new one can't hold a candle to it."
"__MOVIES__ They turned it from a true comedy into an extended SNL skit."
"__MOVIES__ It was bad all around, and had the stink of people's political agendas surrounding it, including the director's."
"__MOVIES__ It's never a good idea to divide your audience along political lines. The movie made money, but not enough to recupe it's advertising costs."
"__MOVIES__ That movie deserved to die a slow death."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed."
"__MOVIES__ You seen any movies in the last year?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've pretty much stopped going to the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
"__MOVIES__ I think the last one I saw was the most recent X-Men."
