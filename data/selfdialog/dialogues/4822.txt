"__MUSIC__ Speaking of post rock, another group you might like is Mogwai."
"__MUSIC__ Who are they? I've never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ They're a fairly old Scottish band, but they have some amazing songs."
"__MUSIC__ Like which songs do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Mogwai fear Satan is great, but so is the entire Young Team album."
"__MUSIC__ Why did you like that song?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it has a beautiful flute solo, which is unique for a rock song. It's also fairly long and so to me is like a composition."
"__MUSIC__ What other songs do you like in that album?"
"__MUSIC__ I personally also like Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home although not as much as the Mogwai fear Satan."
"__MUSIC__ What about their other albums?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't say I like them as much, they're too experimental at some points."
"__MUSIC__ Really, I like experimental rock music."
"__MUSIC__ Well you might like it, but for me it gets too weird."
"__MUSIC__ Oh maybe I'll like their newer albums."
"__MUSIC__ If you like their experimental stuff, you might like their soundtrack album Atomic."
"__MUSIC__ Oh it's a soundtrack album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it's the most instrumental of their albums. It's also has a heavy drone influence."
"__MUSIC__ Cool I'll listen to it then."
"__MUSIC__ Well if you like a mix of post-rock and drone then you'll probably like it."
"__MUSIC__ I sort of like drone, but not that much."
