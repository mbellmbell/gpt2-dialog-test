"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think that Wu-Tang Clan are the best rap group of all time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I thought that title was reserved for NWA."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It would be if they would have lasted longer."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But they still left a bigger impact than Wu-Tang did."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's true. But Wu-Tang have been making consistently good music not just as a unit, but as solo members."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ NWA's members are still putting out music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess what I'm trying to say is that Wu are better because of their longevity."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can understand that, but I feel like impact and influence outweigh longevity by a lot."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can understand that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not to say I don't like Wu, though. They're still a great group."
