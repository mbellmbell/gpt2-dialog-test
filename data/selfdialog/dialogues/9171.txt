"__BASEBALL__ What is your favorite home run moment of all-time?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think Mark McGwire hitting a monster homer off of Randy Johnson, when they were on Seattle and Oakland, respectively."
"__BASEBALL__ Don't say 'respectively' in real life. That's for an academic paper. Also, the order is wrong. It should be 'Oakland and Seattle, respectively,' as you introduced McGwire first."
"__BASEBALL__ Don't be an idiot. What's your favorite?"
"__BASEBALL__ Probably when Ken Griffey Jr. was essentially calling his shots in Boston during the home run derby."
"__BASEBALL__ I remember that! Wasn't he intentionally hitting home runs into the harder parts of the ball park?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, maybe he was doing that to be more fair. Or he's a prick and was showing off."
"__BASEBALL__ A bit of both, I'd say. He could have easily hit 50 over the pitifully-short right field walls."
"__BASEBALL__ I remember I was really proud of myself for calling the derby winner."
"__BASEBALL__ How so? Don't be pretentious, though."
"__BASEBALL__ My whole family said Sammy Sosa would win, and I called McGwire."
"__BASEBALL__ How'd you know?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I remember seeing Sosa during the season and saw his home runs were more line drives, whereas Mark's were skyscrapers. Only one could tame the Big Monster."
"__BASEBALL__ That's what she said. Get it?"
"__BASEBALL__ Seems like you planned that too far ahead. It wasn't very good, sorry. Least favorite home run moment?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh that's easy. Jeffrey Maier giving Jeter a homerun over the Orioles. They needed an idiotic, corrupt umpire to miss that call."
"__BASEBALL__ I remember that, it was awful. He clearly reached over."
"__BASEBALL__ Yours?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm a Phillies fan. Joe Carter's World Series walk-off was devastating."
"__BASEBALL__ Hahahaha, you're a Phillies fan!!!"
