"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you know that Midnight Cowboy was the only X-rated film to ever win Best Picture?"
"__MOVIES__ I have heard that. But isn't it now rated-R instead?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they changed it. And then they got rid of the X-rating altogether."
"__MOVIES__ They replaced it with NC-17, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, basically, though NC-17 is basically a useless rating. It only exists to prevent films from being seen."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, for example, you know the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know of them. What's your point?"
"__MOVIES__ When they released Orgazmo in 1997, it received an NC-17 rating, so that basically no theaters would take it."
"__MOVIES__ Of course, no one wants to be associated with a rating like that."
"__MOVIES__ Well, two years later when they released their South Park movie, they got an R-rating despite that film being far more crude."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they did something different? Maybe it being a cartoon made all the difference?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the thing that made all the difference was by that time they had the backing of Paramount."
"__MOVIES__ Paramount forced the MPAA to give the film an R-rating?"
"__MOVIES__ It was more like a 'I scratch your back, you scratch mine' situation. They're one of the largest film companies in the world, and if the MPAA wanted to do business with them, they had to play by their rules."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty corrupt."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much, but that's business for you. The downside is that independent films get much harsher ratings for sillier things."
"__MOVIES__ At least with the internet indie films can reach a wider audience without the MPAA, though."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Sure, Midnight Cowboy got the recognition it deserved, but a lot of other films probably wouldn't have that chance nowadays without the 'net."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully someday we'll have a better, more fair rating system."
