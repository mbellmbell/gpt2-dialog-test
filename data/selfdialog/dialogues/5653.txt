"__STAR_WARS__ When was the first time you saw Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw Return of the Jedi at the drive-in when it was first released, and from there I was hooked."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's funny.  Me too!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I begged my parents to let me see all three movies and I tried to buy all things Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you like so much?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was the characters, the setting, the plot, the epic-ness of the whole thing.  I had never seen a movie like it in my life."
"__STAR_WARS__ I felt the same way.  I used to pretend I was Luke Skywalker coming to rescue everyone."
"__STAR_WARS__ I used to try to perform Jedi mind tricks on everyone."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hahaha.  Did it ever work."
"__STAR_WARS__ Unfortunately, no.  The force is not strong in me."
