"__THRILLER__ Are you interested in going to the movies this weekend?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah! I heard there's a good one called Annabelle."
"__THRILLER__ What's that about?"
"__THRILLER__ I think it's about a doll that comes to life and haunts some people."
"__THRILLER__ I'm not really interested in movies about dolls."
"__THRILLER__ Okay. Would you prefer to see Hostel?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I would go watch that one. Which one?"
"__THRILLER__ I didn't know there was more than one."
"__THRILLER__ Unfortunately. They should have stopped at the first movie."
"__THRILLER__ Some horror movies just keep making them, even when they shouldn't. Just like Final Destination."
