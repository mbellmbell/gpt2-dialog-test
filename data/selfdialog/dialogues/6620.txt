"__STAR_WARS__ You know what else is weird?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No i don't know. And I don't want to know."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know how in the end of Rogue One, they make a copy of the schematics?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. What about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The screen was intentionally made to look like the screen from the 70s."
"__STAR_WARS__ So what's wrong with that? it's good for the continuity of the films"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that's the whole point. Why is it necessary to have that continuity?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because watching the original will be ruined if they had more advanced screens and technologies in Roguie One"
"__STAR_WARS__ ok Fine, even then why would they still use a little diskette to store the info? It's so anachronistic."
"__STAR_WARS__ Again, continuity too the original films. These are important details that influence our enjoyment of the originals."
