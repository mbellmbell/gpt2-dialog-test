"__MUSIC__ I wish I could see Pink Floyd live some time."
"__MUSIC__ Are you ok with seeing a cover band?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, if they're good at all."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they sound just like them."
"__MUSIC__ What's their name?"
"__MUSIC__ They're called The Machine, after the song Welcome to the Machine."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know that one, cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they're not too expensive to see either."
"__MUSIC__ That's good news. How convincing are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they don't look like the regular band members of course, but their sound is spot on."
"__MUSIC__ Nice. Do they do all the popular stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they do the whole Animals and The Wall albums."
"__MUSIC__ Do they do anything off of Dark Side of the Moon?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course they do, that's one of the most popular albums."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right."
"__MUSIC__ They don't have any original stuff that I know of though."

"__MUSIC__ You would think so."
"__MUSIC__ What are their shows like?"
"__MUSIC__ Very good, lots of lights and sound effects just like the original band."
