"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see the NFL draft at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I follow it a little bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you check out the rosters at all afterwards?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't keep up with the draft but I always look over the rosters to see big changes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think has the best offense in the coming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Steelers are looking pretty scary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I'm very excited about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They play really hard, too. It'll be fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally agree. Ben Roethlisberger has a good team this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be good to see him finally having the support he needs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's had a rough go offensively in the past years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I felt their defense was even worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really remember much about their defense last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, offensively I think the Patriots are still going to be on top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's hard to deny Tom Brady at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also have to say the Falcons will probably do very well again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I honestly thought their offense was better than the Patriots last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I completely agree. They just were beaten when it mattered most."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's because the patriots held the ball for the entire game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. They forced them to play defense."
