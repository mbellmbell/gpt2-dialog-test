"__BEATLES__ My mom once thought that Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds was an Elton John song."
"__BEATLES__ Really?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, turns out he did a cover version that I hadn't known about. I had said it was a Beatles song. We were both right, in a way."
"__BEATLES__ That's funny!"
"__BEATLES__ So do you have any good stories about Beatles songs?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. I made a friend on this online game. He sent me Here Today. It was cool. We lost touch because he got busy with college."
"__BEATLES__ Do you miss him?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, he was going to teach me his native language."
"__BEATLES__ Sorry about that."
"__BEATLES__ It's okay, it was a long time ago."
