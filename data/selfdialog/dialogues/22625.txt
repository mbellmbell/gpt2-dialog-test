"__DISNEY__ How did you like The Incredibles?"
"__DISNEY__ I didn't like it that much when I first saw it, but it's really grown on me over time."
"__DISNEY__ I felt the same, actually. It didn't seem like something I would enjoy at first."
"__DISNEY__ Edna Mode was the character that got me interested in it, though."
"__DISNEY__ She was so funny! Especially when it came to her opinion on capes!"
"__DISNEY__ I hope she is in the sequel."
"__DISNEY__ I would love to see more of her, too. I haven't heard much about the sequel, have you?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I just know they announced they will have one."
"__DISNEY__ I hope it is even better than the original movie. Maybe with some more humor."
"__DISNEY__ I would like to see more scenes like when all of the family fights the villain together in the end of the first one!"
