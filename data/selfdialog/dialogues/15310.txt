"__HARRY_POTTER__ You've seen the Harry Potter movies, right? What did you think of the final one?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I loved it. I wish they would have been able to include every scene though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, me too. That would have made the film too long, though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ There is a scene I wished they'd left out; Harry breaking the Elder Wand."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh I wished they left that too! I'm just going to pretend that he repaired his wand first off screen."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That would make more sense than him keeping Draco's wand."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You think he would keep Draco's wand, or would he get a new one? If he didn't fix his wand, that is."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well he did win it from him. The wand changed its alliance to Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That does make sense. I'm still going to pretend that he fixed his wand first."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Whatever works for you."
