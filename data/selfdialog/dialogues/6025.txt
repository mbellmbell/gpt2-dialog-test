"__STAR_WARS__ do you like the clone troopers"
"__STAR_WARS__ yes they are like my favorite"
"__STAR_WARS__ do you ever wonder what their armor is for"
"__STAR_WARS__ i know right the armor looks cool but it does not seem to protect them from much"
"__STAR_WARS__ its kind of sad that they seemed to be nothing more then slaves"
"__STAR_WARS__ i dont know if you could call them slaves more like a product"
"__STAR_WARS__ but since they are living thinking bieings how can we just say they are a product"
"__STAR_WARS__ well since they was created in a lab its not much different then producing alot of other products"
"__STAR_WARS__ i wonder what happen to them after the clone wars"
"__STAR_WARS__ ive been wondering about that as well because in the force awakens they are no longer any clones around"
