"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite part of Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved the very ending when Darth Vader turned on his lightsaber."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! When the room was dark and then all of a sudden a red lightsaber slowly appears."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was the Darth Vader that we deserve!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That scene was perfect. You could hear his breathing while the scene was dark, and you just knew that something bad was going to happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the music accompanied that scene so well."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if we will ever see another Darth Vader scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ If we do, it will not be for a long time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they will have a flashback scene in the next Star Wars movie that's coming out this year."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be one of so many reasons to be excited for Star Wars XIII!"
