"__MOVIES__ Have you been keeping up with the Marvel movies and the time line?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have, they are sure putting out a lot of movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, with Thor:Ragnarok, Black Panther, and The Avenger:Infinity War Part One coming out soon, I have a lot of movies to see."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed the first Avengers movies, they were really well done I thought."
"__MOVIES__ I actually preferred the Captain American movies. Civil War being my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ The Spiderman and Ant-man cameos in that movie were great."
"__MOVIES__ Paul Rudd is a amazing Ant-man."
"__MOVIES__ Yes he is, and the new kid they have playing Spiderman has taken well to the roll."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, and the new Spiderman movie is also coming soon."
"__MOVIES__ That is a lot of movies in the Marvel universe. Disney is making so much money from all of these movies."
"__MOVIES__ It is sad there are no more stand alone Iron Man movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I can't say I am too sad about that. The last Iron Man movie was pretty terrible."
"__MOVIES__ I have to agree with you there. It was like they were not sure exactly what they wanted to do with that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is so funny that Stan Lee still makes an appearance in every movie."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see him in Guardians of the Galaxy 2? That was so funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was pretty good. Just sitting there in space, it was great."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how they are going to wrap up all of these different threads into one movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well the Infinity Wars is suppose to literally have everyone in them right?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought that was what I read. That will be a huge cast of top names."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can't wait to see both parts of that movie. It is going to be great."
