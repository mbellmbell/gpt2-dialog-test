"__DISNEY__ Have you ever seen Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame?"
"__DISNEY__ No I must have missed that one"
"__DISNEY__ You should watch it. It's one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yea? Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ It's not your typical movie about a princess in love and distress."
"__DISNEY__ So it's about a hunchback in love and distress."
"__DISNEY__ Well, yes but it's much darker."
"__DISNEY__ Darker than..LION KING?! BAMBI?!"
"__DISNEY__ Different kind of dark. Lust from a priest, corruption of the church..."
"__DISNEY__ Well that does sound different, I'll check it out!"
