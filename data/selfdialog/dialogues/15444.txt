"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think of the final Harry Potter movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The fight scenes and special effects were crazy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Plus Dumpedore and his master plot the whole time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked the scene with Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, he wasn't such a bad guy after all."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And maybe Tim Riddle wasn't as smart as he thought he was."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No he was, just so arrogant he couldn't see the forests through the trees."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I see, he thought Snape would abandon his love for more power."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And not everyone is like that.  And Voldy never understood love."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ At the end I guess that was his undoing."
