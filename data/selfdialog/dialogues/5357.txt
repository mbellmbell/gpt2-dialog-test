"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think that the new main three of the Star Wars sequel trilogy fits into the main three of the Star Wars original trilogies roles?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes and no."
"__STAR_WARS__ Please explain!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rey is obviously fitting into Luke Skywalker's roll, since she is going to be a jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's true!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Poe Dameron will fit into Han Solo's roll since they both pilot aircrafts."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Finn?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well the only person left is Princess Leia's role."
"__STAR_WARS__ They don't seem similar at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, but I think Finn is also going to use the force."
