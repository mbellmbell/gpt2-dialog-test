"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know who won the most recent Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, do you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I do! It was the Patriots. They came back from 25 down over Atlanta."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's right. It was all over the news at the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. How could you not remember?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't follow the NFL that closely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I do. I'm a huge fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of any particular team or in general?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm actually a fan of the Patriots, but I like the game in general."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No wonder you remember the Super Bowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being a Patriots fan helps, sure, but it was also a historic game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because in the Super Bowl no other team had been down more than ten points and won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow, and they were down 25?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and in the third quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I guess that is impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was quite the game to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I usually only watch for the half time show and commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As a football fan, and a Patriots fan, that just hurts!"
