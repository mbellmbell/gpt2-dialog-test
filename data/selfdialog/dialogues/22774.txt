"__DISNEY__ What are your top disney films?"
"__DISNEY__ I think there anImated Peter Pan was really great!"
"__DISNEY__ For me the later Hook film surpassed this film."
"__DISNEY__ Not really comparable. One was Animated and the original story more or less. Hook was totally original plot."
"__DISNEY__ I still think it was better than the animated film version."
"__DISNEY__ Was it even a disney film though?"
"__DISNEY__ Spielberg began developing the film in 1980s with Walt Disney Productions. But stopped work then later brought it out on his own I think."
"__DISNEY__ So to my point not really the same world. I want to know your disney pic?"
"__DISNEY__ I always thought The Lion King was a disney masterpiece. Original story for them too."
"__DISNEY__ It was great. You seem to appreciate an original story more than a rendition of an existing fairytale."
