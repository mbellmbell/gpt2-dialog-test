"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the position of running back is a dying breed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah for the most part."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean you have your Ezekiel Elliots in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I think he is one of a kind"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure but I meant like there are probably a handful of every down back"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think is the reason for that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure maybe the league has gone to a passing league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that could be the culprit"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And I dont think teams see value in a bruising guy holding the ball"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did it for plenty of years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So would you ever draft one high?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I think you need to get your RB in the 3rd round of the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how do you justify taking one in the top 5."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess if he is generational"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But thats all based on conjecture isnt it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The entire draft is predicated on that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So Elliot was worth the investment, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but theres always the 2nd year slump"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could you see that happening to him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With his line in front of him it would be hard"
