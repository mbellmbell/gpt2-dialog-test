"__THRILLER__ What was it about?"
"__THRILLER__ There was a spaceship and they were having trouble reaching it.  So they sent out a crew."
"__THRILLER__ Did they make it there?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, but when they did, no one was on the ship."
"__THRILLER__ Okay, but where did they go?"
"__THRILLER__ That's what the movie is about.  There is evil or something on the ship."
"__THRILLER__ Wow, this sounds good.  When did it come out?"
"__THRILLER__ Probably about fifteen years ago."
"__THRILLER__ Cool, I'll have to look into that."
