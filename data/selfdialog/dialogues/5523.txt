"__STAR_WARS__ Are you getting pumped for that New Star Wars movie this winter?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I'll definitely go see it."
"__STAR_WARS__ You don't sound super pumped."
"__STAR_WARS__ The last two movies they've made were definite improvements over the prequels, but they were both movies that I found myself liking less the more I thought about them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, so you're a Star Wars hater."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I definitely have a soft spot in my heart for Star Wars!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, OK. What's your favorite prequel?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably the third one. Revenge of the Sith or something?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I think that was it."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was the only one of the three that wasn't objectively bad, in my opinion."
