"__MUSIC__ Who is your least-favorite classical composer."
"__MUSIC__ I get A LOT of crap for this, but Wolfie."
"__MUSIC__ Wolfie?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's my nickname for Mozart."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, nice one."
"__MUSIC__ Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and he has like six other middle names."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you like him?"
"__MUSIC__ His music is almost a parody of classical music: incredibly predictable, boring, in-a-box."
"__MUSIC__ Does he have anything you like?"
"__MUSIC__ His late music can be tolerable, like his Requiem or his 'Dissonance' quartet."
"__MUSIC__ 'Dissonance quartet?'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he wrote a quartet that was super dissonant, at least for its time. At one point, there's a few measures with almost no consonances."
"__MUSIC__ Nice! Does it work?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it sounds alright. But most of his music just bores me to death."
"__MUSIC__ It's probably because you've only heard a small output of his oeuvre and had to re-teach it hundreds of times."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, his sonata k. 331 in A major drives me crazy. I hate it."
"__MUSIC__ I like his variances on sonata form."
"__MUSIC__ Know what I love most about music?"
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ People NOT saying oeuvre. I hate that word. It's so snobby."
