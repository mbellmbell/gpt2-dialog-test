"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you be a Patriot fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on, they have created a dynasty!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but at what cost?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't be a hater"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well then don't support cheaters"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cheaters?! They just have a lot of great players, that's why they beat your team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bill Belichick literally said, ' if you're not cheating you're not really trying' so don't pretend they don't cheat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, the get rings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but we'll never know if they would have won them without cheating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady, Gronk, stats don't lie, they are stacked with phenomenal players"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I'll never doubt that, but we can't know just how good because of the cheating that they were caught doing and confessed to. There is probably more we'll never even know about"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably would have still won all of those Super Bowls"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too. But we'll never KNOW. worse yet is that Brady, Belichick, the whole Patriots team will never know,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you're right, that would drive me crazy to not know without a shadow of a doubt that I was the best team, player of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, people will always dispute that and with just cause."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man that's got to stink, because they are all so good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but you know what? It's not just a stain on the patriots organization"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No one else was implicated in the cheating"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but the NFL didn't really punish them justly so a lot of people have lost interest and respect for the game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have a point. It's the fight among America"
