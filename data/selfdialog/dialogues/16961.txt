"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the new Fast and Furious movie in theaters last week."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, The Fate of the Furious? How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good! But have you seen the others?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think I have seen most of the previous ones."
"__MOVIES__ Then you would like it. It references a lot of the other movies."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to give it a try."
"__MOVIES__ How about you? Have you seen anything good lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2! It was awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I have been dying to see that!"
"__MOVIES__ You need to see it in theaters! Make sure you stay through to the end. There are a lot of scenes during the credits."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks for the tip!"
"__MOVIES__ Let me know after you've seen it and we can talk more about it. I don't want to spoil anything."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! I can't wait to see if all of the characters from the last movie are still in it."
"__MOVIES__ I think most of them are! At least all of the ones I care about."
"__MOVIES__ What about Groot?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he is definitely there but as a baby."
"__MOVIES__ Aww, baby Groot! Must be cute!"
"__MOVIES__ You'll have to see for yourself!"
"__MOVIES__ I totally will."
