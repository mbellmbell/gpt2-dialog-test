"__MOVIES__ I'm so excited for the Despicable Me 3 movie to come out!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too!"
"__MOVIES__ I can watch the minions all day every day, they're so hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Me too!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know why people hate them so much."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither!"
"__MOVIES__ Are you patronizing me?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I can see why it comes off like that. I actually agree with you."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of their solo movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The time frame doesn't work out, but it's cute and fun."
"__MOVIES__ Time frame?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, when they left the north pole, they kind of took 500 years or so to get to New York."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought of that. But yeah, that took a while."
"__MOVIES__ How do they go to the bathroom?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. For all the bananas they eat, it's crazy."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they naturally burn everything off. They can survive in space, so they can do other things."
"__MOVIES__ What an odd evolution: they evolved into males only so there's no reproduction."
"__MOVIES__ Good thing. Can you imagine them taking over the earth or procreating?"
"__MOVIES__ We'd be overrun."
"__MOVIES__ At least we can shoot them into space and they'd survive!"
