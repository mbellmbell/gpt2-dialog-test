"__STAR_WARS__ What did you like about Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked that it was a different tone. Everything was really consequential."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, everyone died."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was one of the few times Star Wars felt like an actual war."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean that scene on the mining planet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. That ambush wouldn't have looked out of place in a World War II movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ The end was reminicent of the D-Day landing."
"__STAR_WARS__ In a way. It definitely felt like a do-or-die situation."
"__STAR_WARS__ It had tension even though we knew how it was going to end."
"__STAR_WARS__ And I thought it dovetailed into A New Hope nicely."
