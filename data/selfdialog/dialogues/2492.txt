"__MUSIC__ What did you think about Beyonce's halftime show?"
"__MUSIC__ Look, I like Beyonce, but I hated the halftime show."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ It was like she was trying to be edgy and political, an intellectual."
"__MUSIC__ And that's bad?"
"__MUSIC__ No! It's not bad. I just really like the Single Ladies version of Beyonce."
"__MUSIC__ That song is just fun."
"__MUSIC__ I know! It became a Saturday Night Live skit!"
"__MUSIC__ And everybody had a video on YouTube of their adorable daughter or niece singing and dancing to it."
"__MUSIC__ Right! It was fun!"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I haven't seen any videos of anybody's daughter or niece recreating Beyonce's halftime show."
"__MUSIC__ I do not want to see that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but you know somebody has done it and put it on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ True. Everything's on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ Gangam Style was another fun song that everybody made a YouTube video of."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that! There were some great videos. And it's not that I have anything against political statements, I just really enjoy the bouncy fun songs."
"__MUSIC__ The stupid songs."
"__MUSIC__ You call them stupid but you know you loved them. They were stupid fun songs."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not admitting that I ever liked Gangam Style."
"__MUSIC__ Fine, but I bet there's a YouTube video of you out there somewhere, dancing right along with it."
