"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to win this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I think the Patriots are the top of the list. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ehhh, I think that's an easy pick, but I'm going with a darkhorse, the Dolphins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at what they did last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like what? Lose in the first round of the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After getting there for the first time in 7 years or so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, so what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did that with a rookie head coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not that impressive, that happens a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea but then they signed all the core players that got them there and added on in the off season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still don;t see why you're putting them in Superbowl contention."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I said they were my dark horse pick, I think they will surprise everyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're crazy and they won't even make the playoffs this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're underestimating a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are not a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So making the playoffs means you're not a good team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, losing in the first round after a wildcard berth does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well not every team cheats like the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cheat or not, they still win."
