"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, how do you think the Green Bay Packers will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did lose Eddie Lacey, but I think the rookie will fill in his shoes nicely,  I like them to get back to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You sound very confident about that. What makes you think so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Aaron Rodgers will want to put another ring on his finger before he calls is quits."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers still has a lot of years left. Why do you think this is his year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the additions they've made to the offense, especially Martellus Bennett from the Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they really need a playmaker at that position, I'm with you on that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also really like the rookie running back they picked up in the draft"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We need to have to have a good running back to make the passing game work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes!  We have so many good receivers and if we can have any success in the running game, watch out!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also think Aaron Rodgers is so good.  He gets frustrated not being in the big game.  He really should have been there more than once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  I felt bad for him the year he played injured for the whole playoffs only to be let down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember it like yesterday!  Up by 15 points with less than five minutes to play in the 4th quarter.  How do you lose that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everything that could have gone wrong did.  A botched onside kick, a blown coverage 50 yards downfield.  It makes me sick!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too!  Forget I brought it up.  This year we will make up for it and get back to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am with you.  Do you have tickets to any of the games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can buy some from my friend who has season tickest, but they're expensive this year.  over $100 a seat I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will pitch in and we should go to at least one game this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds great.  I will talk to my friend and see what games I can get!  Talk to you later!"
