"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you see the new Guardians of the Galaxy yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I did! It was better than I expected from a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ That's good to hear! Usually sequels let me down after making me wait for them to be released."
"__MOVIES__ I totally get what you're saying, but this one was definitely good. It might even be funnier than the first one."
"__MOVIES__ I love that! I always thought one of the best aspects of the first Guardians movie was how much I was laughing when I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, if you thought that one was funny, you HAVE to see Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Ryan Reynolds? I remember seeing trailers for it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, and it's literally the most hilarious superhero movie to come out yet, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I'll definitely have to add that to my list of movies to check out."
"__MOVIES__ While you're at it, I would add Neighbors 2. I'm not sure if you saw the first one, but it's another example of a killer sequel, and so hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ I'm gonna have to check that one out, I love Seth Rogen! Did you see Sausage Party, where he voiced the main character?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet, I was planning to rent and watch it next time we stay in for the night."
"__MOVIES__ It's absolutely hilarious. Comedies are some of my favorite movies, but I've been getting into dramas more and more lately."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I could see that, they are definitely making some really intense films lately, it's easy to see why you would be drawn to interesting story lines!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I love those thought-provoking movies. If you're looking for a good drama, I suggest Moonlight."
"__MOVIES__ I've definitely heard of Moonlight, didn't they just win a ton of Oscars or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they won three and I'm pretty sure they were nominated for even more. It was absolutely amazing, I can't recommend it enough."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely want to watch it. I don't think the kids would be able to sit through it or appreciate it so that'll have to be a long term plan."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely recommend it. But if you're looking for something more family friendly, I heard Moana was really good!"
"__MOVIES__ I took the kids to go see it, they loved it! The Rock voices one of the main characters, and he was a hoot to listen to!"
