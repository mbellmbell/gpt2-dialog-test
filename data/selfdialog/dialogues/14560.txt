"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey there!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi, how are you today?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Doin' just fine, super ready for the weekend."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah? You doing anything special?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hoping to go to the theater with my BF, haven't decided what I'm going to go see though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I love movies, maybe I can help!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sure, that'd be great!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What kind of films do you guys like?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, we're always up for fantasy and such."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What about the newest Pirates film? That one came out just last week so she probably hasn't seen it yet."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ew, no. I'm so bored with those films, they should have stopped after the first."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hm, okay. What about Wonder Woman?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Isn't that DC? Their last movies weren't that great."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It is, but all the reviews have been really positive about this one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't know that!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, and honestly judging by the trailer alone it looks really good."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman in this one, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Mmhm, she's an Israeli actress and she's quite talented."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Cool, I'll check it out--it is out now, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It premieres in theaters this weekend."
