"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, what do you think of the Colts?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, are they any good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course! They keep taking the division every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So have they won a Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Once. We're going to get it again this year, I just know it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has their performance been good this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they were good last season, but with the new players, they're unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they have a new runningback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they just got a new guy from Miami that's looking really promising."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I forgot his name, but wasn't he the starring player at his college?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he killed the trials too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it looks like it's going to be a running year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but not just that, our quarterback can pass too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can he fill Peyton's shoes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better than that, he had no interceptions last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about fumbles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but just the one though, against Jacksonville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well yeah, their tightend is really something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but our center is going to shut them down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see about that. Go Colts!"
