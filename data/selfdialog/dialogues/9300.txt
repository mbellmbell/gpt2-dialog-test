"__BASEBALL__ Those Orioles pulled off another one"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I saw that, in extra innings on top of that"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it was a great ball game last night!"
"__BASEBALL__ That Castillo home run was a thing of beauty"
"__BASEBALL__ The great thing about that was he had just come off of the disable list"
"__BASEBALL__ Talk about being ready to play!"
"__BASEBALL__ Not only did he hit the game winning home run, he had hit another one earlier"
"__BASEBALL__ That's a game you tell your kids about one day! Great performance!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they needed all of his offense last night"
"__BASEBALL__ For sure and they best thing is that they are only 1/2 game behind the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ Did the Yankees play last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I believe they had the day off"
"__BASEBALL__ Okay. Well that Castillo has been on fire since coming off of the DL."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I read on ESPN that he has been hitting .600 since coming off of the DL"
"__BASEBALL__ Those are crazy numbers!"
"__BASEBALL__ Hopefully he can keep that type of production up throughout the year"

"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they were coming off of a 1-6 road trip."
"__BASEBALL__ They are fortunate to be only behind the Yankees by that 1/2 game."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they are. Now they need to pad some wins."
