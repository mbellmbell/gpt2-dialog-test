"__DISNEY__ What Disney movie would you say is the saddest?"
"__DISNEY__ The one that has made me cry the most is Fox and the Hound"
"__DISNEY__ Really? Isn't that just a cute animal movie"
"__DISNEY__ Well yeah, but there are some really sad scenes in it"
"__DISNEY__ Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ When the main woman character has to drop off Todd the fox in the forest, I always tear up"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but I can think of a sadder movie, like Dumbo or Bambi"
"__DISNEY__ I can understand Bambi being sad...but Dumbo?"
"__DISNEY__ That scene where the mother elephant  gets separated from her baby always gets me"
"__DISNEY__ I'v heard that a lot of mothers find that scene touching as well"
