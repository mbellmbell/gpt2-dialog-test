"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite part of The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ For me, it was the cinematography. Every shot in the movie felt like it was a work of art."
"__STAR_WARS__ The effects were beautiful, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about the plot?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked that the early scenes with Rey took their time."
"__STAR_WARS__ That felt like showing Luke on Tatooine in A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ They were wise not to make it purely an action movie without that kind of scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ It did make The Force Awakens pretty long, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ But that kind of development will pay off later."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed. Without it, we won't be able to appreciate where the characters go in the future."
