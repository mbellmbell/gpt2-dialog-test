"__MOVIES__ Would you rather go to a movie at the theater or rent a movie and watch it at home?"
"__MOVIES__ Nowadays, I prefer to rent a movie and watch it at home."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for one, I can skip the twenty minutes of previews and insane ticket prices."
"__MOVIES__ Those are good reasons, but what are your others?"
"__MOVIES__ I have a clearplay dvd player at home and it will filter out all the raunchy stuff, making it a much better experience."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, aren't movies just crammed full of sexuality these days?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and I'm continuously confused as to why the movie makers feel they must include sex scenes."
"__MOVIES__ You would think they would figure out that they are cutting out a huge portion of their audience by including stuff like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is disappointing that the industry leaders have not figured that out."
"__MOVIES__ I know that my husband is recovering from a sexual addiction and he has flat out told me he can't watch most of the movies out these days."
"__MOVIES__ And then there's the language that I hate my teenagers hearing and becoming desensitized to."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it's almost like our culture wants to force us to become cursing, violent sex addicts."
"__MOVIES__ Thank goodness for the few who do create movies that are wholesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but they tend to be pretty cheesy."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, but they definitely have gotten better."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like Facing the Giants?"
"__MOVIES__ That was a great one, and so was Friday Night Lights."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love that one and love Jim Caviezel."
"__MOVIES__ He is a superb actor."
