"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you watched the Lions lately?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have.  They honestly aren't that good.  I miss the days when Barry Sanders played."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a football legend!  What players do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really like any of the Lions players, though Johnson did okay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's pretty good.  I like some of the guys on the other teams.  Tom Brady is pretty amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is excellent. Didn't he play for University of Michigan before he went pro?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he did.  How do you feel about the Manning brothers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Eli is obviously better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team is your favorite?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the cowboys!  You?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to support the Lions because I'm from Michigan, but I also love the Patriots....Brady is the man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you like to see in the superbowl?  Like what would be your dream match?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm..I'd love to see the Lions finally make the superbowl for once!  I don't care who they play!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lions have never played in a superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know!  I wish they could just get it together and play well enough to have the chance at a superbowl title."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt that will ever happen.  Lions are too inconsistent!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you want to see?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to have my cowboys.  I'd like to see them beat the Lions!  It would be  a sure bet that the Cowboys would beat Detroit Lions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you say so!  Lions sometimes surprise me and they have beat the Cowboys in the past!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True."
