"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think they will make another iron man sequel?"
"__SUPERHERO__ How many have there been 2 or 3?"
"__SUPERHERO__ 3, did you not see them all?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think i just forgot, I know I saw 1 and 2 not 100% on the third installment."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh man ,you are missing out if you haven't, it was really good."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well I am guessing he doesn't die off if you think they could make yes another sequel."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ha sorry if that was  a spoiler for you, you should still watch it.Don Cheadle is great and gwyneth paltrow as well."
"__SUPERHERO__ I always did like pepper potts, paltrow's character. I think Cheadle is always an entertaining actor on screen."
"__SUPERHERO__ I hope they are both in the next sequel if there really is one to be made."
"__SUPERHERO__ I wonder if Downey will do it again, he must be getting tired of this role a little with all the iron mans and aveneger's films."
