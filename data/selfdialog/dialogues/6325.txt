"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of 'Revenge of The Jedi'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, I was soured once mark Hamill 'made a hamburger of his face'."
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh? What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hamill was in a car accident in California, and had to have plastic surgery to get his face back together. After that, he seemed to have a lisp."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really??? I never knew that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I noticed, but he was really great playing Luke to Jim Henson's Yoda. I also like the fun in Jabba The Hut's hideaway."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked the battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. How could you not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, you're right. It's so exciting!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't wait for the new film. It's supposed to have lots more of Luke in it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! It's supposed to be called 'The Last Jedi', and  I can't wait!"
