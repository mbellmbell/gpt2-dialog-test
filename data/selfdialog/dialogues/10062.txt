"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm debating whether or not I should give Lecrae a listen. I've heard conflicting reports about whether he's just a Christian who happens to rap or someone who does Christian rap and I don't want anything preachy."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's no more preachy than any other artist. Everybody's art will be from their own perspectives and experiences and lifestyles and faith just happens to be a big part of his life."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So you're familiar with him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I've listened to his music but not lately."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So you won't even listen to him but you're defending him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I do like him as a person and as an artist, and though it seems like that should mean I like his music, it just doesn't appeal to me aurally."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The style, or..?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The style I guess, his voice seems a lot higher pitched than anybody else I like, and I just lean towards a more old school sound."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Doesn't sound like anything bad."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No not at all, give him a listen. There's bound to be content you disagree with but you'll find that with every artist."
