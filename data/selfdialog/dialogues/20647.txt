"__THRILLER__ Do you consider The Sixth Sense to be a thriller or horror? I see it listed as both."
"__THRILLER__ It's a thriller, no doubt."
"__THRILLER__ Why not horror?"
"__THRILLER__ Just because it has ghosts and dead people doesn't make it a thriller. They're not interacting or causing anything."
"__THRILLER__ So it's the mystery and suspense?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, you never feel scared in the movie. You just want to hear and see what's happening."
"__THRILLER__ Did you enjoy the twist?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, but I can't watch it again."
"__THRILLER__ Why not?"
"__THRILLER__ The problem with a thriller that has a twist is you can only see it once or twice, because you know exactly what's going to happen."
