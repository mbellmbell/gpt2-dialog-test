"__MOVIES__ Is it me or are movies getting more and more stupid?"
"__MOVIES__ It isn't you. What movie has upset your stomach now?"
"__MOVIES__ That Snatched movie."
"__MOVIES__ Snatched? I don't think I have heard of that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes you have. You know that movie with Amy Schumer."
"__MOVIES__ Who's Amy Schumer?"
"__MOVIES__ You know. The movie where some blonde is dumped by her boyfriend on the eve of their vacation,"
"__MOVIES__ Go on."
"__MOVIES__ She  persuades her cautious mother, Linda, to accompany her on an exotic getaway to South America."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I think I saw the trailer for that or at least part of the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean part of the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if we are talking about the same movie, I changed the station when I saw it. That movie is beyond stupid."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ Movies have no substance anymore. Who's the actress playing her mom?"
"__MOVIES__ Goldie Hawn."
"__MOVIES__ Goldie Hawn? That was Goldie?"
"__MOVIES__ You didn't recognize her?"
"__MOVIES__ No. You'd think she wouldn't accept a role such as that."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe she needed the money."
"__MOVIES__ There isn't enough money in the world to make myself look that desperate."
