"__MOVIES__ Did you ever get a chance to see the new Fast and Furious movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I have never seen any of the other ones either. How many are there?"
"__MOVIES__ They just came out with the 8th one. They are all really good!"
"__MOVIES__ Do I have to watch the first 7 to understand the 8th movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. There's some story lines to it but for the most part its another action packed movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is it over the top action packed or just a normal action packed movie?"
"__MOVIES__ As the series has gone on, the action in the movies have gotten more ridiculous and unrealistic, but still so entertaining!"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like my kind of movie. Who's in those movies again?"
"__MOVIES__ Vin Diesel, Ludacris, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, and Paul Walker used to be part of them too."
"__MOVIES__ Is Paul Walker that actor that died in that car accident?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was so sad! The whole cast had a tough time during the incident."
"__MOVIES__ Is he in the newest movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he died while they were filming the 7th one. The used CGI and his brothers to put him in some of the scenes in the 7th one."
"__MOVIES__ So he was able to film some of his scenes but his brothers and CGI took care of other scenes? Could you tell it wasn't actually him in certain scenes?"
"__MOVIES__ Ya but it still looked very much like him! You should watch the movie and see for yourself..better yet watch the whole movie series!"
"__MOVIES__ I think I may have to, everyone always says how great the movies are."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not the biggest fan of the 3rd one. There are some different actors in it and it doesn't really fit with the rest of the franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Any good actors in the 3rd one or should I not even bother watching it?"
"__MOVIES__ Let me put it this way, Lil Bow Wow is the best actor in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess I will be watching all of them besides the 3rd one!"
