"__COMEDY__ Do you remember Clueless?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes! That movie was hilarious!"
"__COMEDY__ I agree. Alicia Silverstone was great as a snotty teenager. As was Stacey Dash."
"__COMEDY__ But it's so funny how stuck in the 1990s it is."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, but the Breakfast Club has the same issue I guess."
"__COMEDY__ So will Mean Girls in a decade or two."
"__COMEDY__ But a good teen comedy is timeless in its own way."
"__COMEDY__ Agreed. I still bust a gut when I watch Clueless."
"__COMEDY__ That said, the ending was a little icky."
"__COMEDY__ I know! She starts dating her former step-brother!"
