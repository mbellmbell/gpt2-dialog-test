"__STAR_WARS__ Who would win a fight, Darth Maul or Yoda?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Yoda would win"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He is 100 times more powerful than Darth Maul"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well Darth Maul has two lightsabers pretty much"
"__STAR_WARS__ But Yoda is the strongest Jedi to ever live and is very agile!"
"__STAR_WARS__ But Darth Maul is younger than Yoda"
"__STAR_WARS__ That doesn't matter, Yoda has enough of the Force to take down any evil thing"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd like to see him try! Yoda is way too old!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda will do flips all around Darth Maul and then cut him in half!"
