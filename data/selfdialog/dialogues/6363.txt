"__STAR_WARS__ Do you remember that scene in 'Return of the Jedi' when Leia tells Luke she remembers her mom's face?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I do."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, how does Leia remember?  Didn't Padm√© die during childbirth?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That brings up a very interesting dilemma.  You're right."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Leia was referring to her adoptive mother?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Or maybe it's possible because Leia is force sensitive, like Anakin and Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the Force answer makes more sense narratively than the adoptive mother theory."
"__STAR_WARS__ Though, perhaps we're giving too much credit.  Maybe it was just a plot hole between the prequel and main series."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is probably the most likely scenario."
"__STAR_WARS__ This kind of thing just reminds me why I didn't like the prequel movies."
