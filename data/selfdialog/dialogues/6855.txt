"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see the news about the Han Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There's a Han Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I... well, uh. Not yet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh Lord. Disney is really milking this, huh."
"__STAR_WARS__ I dunno, maybe. But it looks like it's... in trouble, anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh no. A spin-off movie nobody asked for is in trouble."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean. It... could be kind of cool. We don't know anything about his early life."
"__STAR_WARS__ Isn't that kind of the point of him? Why do we need to know any of that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because... he's Han Solo. I mean, he's the best one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm assuming Harrison Ford isn't in this, right?"
