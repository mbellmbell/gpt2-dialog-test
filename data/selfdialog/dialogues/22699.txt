"__DISNEY__ Hey! Do you wanna build a snowman?"
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely not. I'm too busy trying to make a man out of you."
"__DISNEY__ Then why don't you go on and kiss the girl?"
"__DISNEY__ Because hakuna matata?"
"__DISNEY__ What's that mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Hakuna matata? It means no worries... for the rest of our days."
"__DISNEY__ Such a wonderful phrase."
"__DISNEY__ All day and all night, 24/7, on land, in the air, or... under the sea."
"__DISNEY__ I love how we can just randomly quote Disney movies and songs all day. You really get me."
"__DISNEY__ Duh! That's why we're best friends, silly!"
