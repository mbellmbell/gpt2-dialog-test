"__HORROR__ What's your favorite horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ Of all time? Probably 'The Shining'."
"__HORROR__ Oh, good one. That's scary because it's kind of 'real life' terror."
"__HORROR__ Exactly - I'm not scared by monsters and zombies and stuff."
"__HORROR__ 'The Exorcist' is another great one like that."
"__HORROR__ Exactly! I like when scary stuff just happens to normal people."
"__HORROR__ I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' in cinemas and that freaked me out so bad."
"__HORROR__ Before anyone knew it wasn't real? Oh, me too. I was so scared."
"__HORROR__ I saw the original 'Jaws' in a cinema too, and that is so much scarier on a big screen."
"__HORROR__ People don't think of 'Jaws' as a horror movie but it's terrifying!"
