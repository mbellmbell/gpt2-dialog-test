"__MUSIC__ Hey man, I have an extra ticket to the Dave Matthews Band concert tonight, do you want to go?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be great, I love them. The first CD I ever bought was 'Before these crowded streets.'"
"__MUSIC__ That is a great album. 'Halloween' is one of their best songs ever."
"__MUSIC__ How much do you want for the ticket?"
"__MUSIC__ Don't worry about it, I just want someone to go with so I am not by myself. When was the last time you saw them in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw them probably six years ago or more in Cincinnati, it was a great show."
"__MUSIC__ Was Leroi still alive when you saw them last?"
"__MUSIC__ No, he had already passed away.I remember Dave talking about it."
"__MUSIC__ How did you first get into Dave Matthews band?"
"__MUSIC__ My Brother went to school in Virginia, and he saw them a few times at a bar close to school, he and his friend traded tapes of their shows."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that was a big way how they garnered new fans."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. That is why today they let people record their shows In fact, you can find live versions of their shows on Dave Matthews Band message board sites."
"__MUSIC__ I am amazed that the band allows that. Doesn't that take away from their profits?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess it might a little, but the thought is that people will hear a song or two, and then buy the album."
"__MUSIC__ The show starts at 8:30, do you want to drive together?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, come over to my apartment and I will drive us. Is there an opening band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there is. OAR is the opening act."
"__MUSIC__ I really like them too, I have seen them a few times."
"__MUSIC__ It should be a lot of fun, I am glad you can come."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you for asking me."
