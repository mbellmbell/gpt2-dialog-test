"__POP__ What pop band is your all time favorite?"
"__POP__ You know pop is such a loose term. There are so many genres. I would consider REM to be part of that especially in the later years."
"__POP__ Yeah, I agree. Their sound changed a lot over the years."
"__POP__ I know in the beginning there was grit and tooth to it. As the more recent albums were released it seemed more pop to me."
"__POP__ Loosing My Religion is such a huge song for me personally."
"__POP__ I know what you mean. I was going through a lot at the time and that song was mine."
"__POP__ It's almost this kind of struggle and angst that I just don't feel in the music of today."
"__POP__ No it is definitely a different vibe."
"__POP__ Yeah, I think it actually was the precursor to grunge which I think some songs could be pop rock."
"__POP__ I agree. The labels get confusing and pigeon holing bands doesn't help. I think bands cross genres with their music otherwise it would be so boring for them."
