"__ROCK__ Do you like rock music from around the world?"
"__ROCK__ I'm not that familiar with bands outside of the US. Do you recommend anything?"
"__ROCK__ I love rock music from Japan, there are so many great guitar players like Tak Matsumoto from B'z and Syu from Galneryus."
"__ROCK__ Wow! You sound pretty knowledgeable. What do B'z sound like?"
"__ROCK__ Well, they're one of Japan's biggest rock band, they've been around since the '80s. They're kind of like a Japanese Aerosmith with more hard elements."
"__ROCK__ That sounds fun! I have heard of Babymetal, are they similar?"
"__ROCK__ Not really, but Babymetal is still fun. They're almost like a typical JPop band that uses metal as the set dressing."
"__ROCK__ Interesting! I didn't know that. Haven't they been on tour in the US?"
"__ROCK__ Yes, they went on tour with Rob Zombie. Actually, B'z have toured the US too."
"__ROCK__ Wow, I didn't know that. I have to look into more Japanese bands."
