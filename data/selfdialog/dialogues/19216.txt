"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the new Ghost in the Shell movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I just watched it last night."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely different from the anime version. I'm still not sure whether Scarlett Johanson was the best choice for the leading role."
"__MOVIES__ That's sparked up some controversy."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely has. I guess since she's Hollywood she might attract more people to watch the movie."
"__MOVIES__ True but I think that could compromise the integrity of Ghost in the Shell."
"__MOVIES__ I don't have as much to say because I'm not a super fan of Ghost in the Shell but I can say that Scarlett's performance changed the vibe of the original anime."
"__MOVIES__ So do you think the film is worth watching?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it is. It still looks visually pleasing and the story is decent."
"__MOVIES__ But just don't go in thinking it's going to be like the original?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say that. It would probably fair well with people who have never seen the original."
"__MOVIES__ People who come in with no expectations right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think even for people that are a fan of the original, it would be better to watch it with no expectations."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'll probably watch it then."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think you should. I really did like the look of the film."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen pictures and the setting looks incredible."
"__MOVIES__ It looks like a real world that exists somewhere."
"__MOVIES__ I'm a sucker for science fiction settings."
