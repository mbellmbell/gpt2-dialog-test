"__DISNEY__ Don't you just love the music in all of the Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I do. It is very well done."
"__DISNEY__ I usually purchase the soundtrack when it becomes available for the majority of the films."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, really?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes.  I just also love that they have well known actors and musicians singing in the films."
"__DISNEY__ I do too.  That's what makes them so addicting I think."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, because you know the voices.  It's not just some unknown."
"__DISNEY__ Although, sometimes they have cast unknowns that have been wonderful."
"__DISNEY__ Yep, and they have been skyrocketed to fame."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, you are very right."
