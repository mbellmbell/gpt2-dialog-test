"__DISNEY__ What do you think is the scariest Disney moment?"
"__DISNEY__ When Simba's dad died was more sad than scary."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's a memorable moment though."
"__DISNEY__ I'm tempted to mention The Jungle Book. I was so terrified of that tiger."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah! Shere Khan."
"__DISNEY__ He was even scarier in the 'live-action' remake."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I think the torch mob in Beauty and the Beast is scary too."
"__DISNEY__ And the mob in the Hunchback of Notre Dame is terrifying."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, Disney loves a mob carrying torches."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, true. I've never noticed that before."
