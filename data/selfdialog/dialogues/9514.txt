"__BASEBALL__ What do you think of the American League so far this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Hard to talk about the AL without mentioning the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, right? What's going on there?"
"__BASEBALL__ Somehow they're cranking out wins left and right."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think it could be because they've been playing a lot of interleague games."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe. But they're doing pretty well otherwise."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that's for sure. I can't believe it myself."
"__BASEBALL__ Who do you like on the team?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, Betances is playing well as usual. But Judge is really knocking balls out of the park."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I think he has strong Rookie of the Year potential."
"__BASEBALL__ Okay, so that's the Yankees. What else?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, the East is stacked! How about the Orioles?"
"__BASEBALL__ Okay, they're fine. The Red Sox aren't bad either."
"__BASEBALL__ I suppose there's the Twins, but they won't last. We all know there's one other team looming large."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, Houston. Best record in the AL. Can it last?"
"__BASEBALL__ It can, it can. They have a great rotation."
"__BASEBALL__ They're playing in the weakest division."
"__BASEBALL__ By far. It'll help them win games, but it'll mean their competition isn't as strong."
"__BASEBALL__ Could it be a disadvantage in the postseason?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, it could. It definitely could."
