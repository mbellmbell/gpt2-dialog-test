"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ We haven't talked in forever."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What have you been up to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Listening to music, watching movies, housework, video games, keeping my son from getting into trouble."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What have you been watching?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well... I saw Moana at the cheap theater."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, did you like it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I liked it better after renting it from the library."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I couldn't catch most of the words in the 'You're Welcome' or 'Shiny' songs because of the way they were performed."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ah yes, you watch movies with subititles on."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yep, I actually do like both of those songs now, but really couldn't follow them in the theater."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Kind of wrecks the experience when you can understand the words."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I wish there was a subtitles option at theaters."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, I went to a theater in Nebraska that had that option."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, it wasn't a main line theater though, just a community one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, well there goes hoping that a chain was starting a trend."
