"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think another Batman v. Superman film will be produced?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No way. The first one was horrible."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know. I wonder how they messed up such great potential."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, it was tough to watch."
"__SUPERHERO__ Suicide Squad was similar if you ask me."
"__SUPERHERO__ I haven't seen that film but I know people were not pleased with it."
"__SUPERHERO__ It was just too predictable. Nothing will top The Dark Knight."
"__SUPERHERO__ I doubt it. That is one of the best films ever."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe if Christopher Nolan made another film, but he's the only one who can top it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Agreed. He is a great superhero film director."
