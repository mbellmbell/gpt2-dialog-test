"__MUSIC__ You like music, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I like music."
"__MUSIC__ I always hear you talk about music, and what you like."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've got some pretty strong opinions."
"__MUSIC__ Right. But you always talk about that macho, heavy metal stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know how macho it is, I guess, but I like heavy music. A lot of it is about death and dark stuff, but some more is about elves and wizards, too."
"__MUSIC__ But is that all you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I like other stuff. Mozart. And Indie rock."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite indie rock band?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely the Decemberists."
"__MUSIC__ I would never have guessed that."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they have some great tunes."
"__MUSIC__ I like their older stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Andy of their stuff is good. I think they have the best lyrics of any band I've ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ I never noticed."
"__MUSIC__ Pay attention. It's not just vocabulary. The rhymes are very clever and there's some incredibly intelligent phrasing."
"__MUSIC__ What's a good album?"
"__MUSIC__ If you like their older stuff, listen to Picaresque"
"__MUSIC__ What about the Crane Wife?"
"__MUSIC__ It's good too, but a departure from their earlier, folkier sound. Still sounds unquestionably like Decemberists album, though."
