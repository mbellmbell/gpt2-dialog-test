"__MOVIES__ I totally love movies from the 80s and 90s! How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely - the period from the mid 80s to mid 90s defines the best movie era to me!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, No Way Out...."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! Don't forget Weird Science!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah right! 'Ice is nice!'"
"__MOVIES__ Heck, I even loved Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure."
"__MOVIES__ Haha - 'You're too tall, Abe!'"
"__MOVIES__ 'It's just the way I'm built!'"
"__MOVIES__ It's amazing how many of the movie quotes we remember."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, something about being in high school and college at that time, watching the same movies over and over."
"__MOVIES__ And no Internet back then! I'd watch Saint Elmo's Fire or Breakfast Club when I was down in the dumps."
"__MOVIES__ On VHS tape! Seems like so long ago but great memories."
"__MOVIES__ And with some of the actors and actresses in multiple movies it was fun to see where they'd appear next."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? Who do you remember liking?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely Molly Ringwald in Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles! And Anthony Michael Hall of course."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he was in all those movies and Weird Science too.  Always cracked me up."
"__MOVIES__ Remember him in Johnny Be Good?"
"__MOVIES__ I had totally forgotten that he was in it! Another classic."
"__MOVIES__ We should check out some of these oldies but goodies again!"
"__MOVIES__ Let's do it. A good dose of Molly Ringwald in Pretty In Pink would be awesome!"
