"__THRILLER__ Have you watched Take Shelter? It's a psychological thriller."
"__THRILLER__ Is that the one with Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah that's the movie. It was really good. Michael Shannon plays a borderline bi polar husband and father who thinks the apocalypse is coming so the takes action to build a bomb shelter while trying to warn his small town of the impending doom."
"__THRILLER__ I haven't seen it yet but I remember people were chatting about how the ending to that movie was such a mind bender."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah the movie is really good. It has you guessing just if he's truly going crazy of it this doom is real. Jessica does a great job playing his caring and nurturing wife."
"__THRILLER__ Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain are both such great actors. I watched Michael in this other small movie recently called Frank and Lola and he was terrific in that as the possessive boyfriend and star chef."
"__THRILLER__ I know. I totally agree with you. I watched Jessica Chastain in Miss Sloane just a short while ago and she played such a strong role as the political lobbyist in that political thriller."
"__THRILLER__ I need to see Miss Sloane, I heard it was really good. What was your final verdict for Take Shelter?"
"__THRILLER__ I really enjoyed Take Shelter. It had me in suspense the whole time. It set a really unsettling and uncomfortable feeling throughout and by the end I was in awe at what was revealed."
"__THRILLER__ Okay, no spoilers please. I think I'll have to see if it's available to watch!"
