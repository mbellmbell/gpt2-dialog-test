"__LADY_GAGA__ Wasn't she wearing her meat outfit in video for Poker Face?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't think so."
"__LADY_GAGA__ So when did she wear that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It was at some awards show, probably the Emmy awards."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh.  Poker Face would have been an appropriate song to wear it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm afraid to ask, but why do you think that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, in poker, you need to act confident and defiant."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm not following."
"__LADY_GAGA__ If you were wearing meat, everybody would know you're not afraid to bluff, right?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's some twisted logic if you ask me."
