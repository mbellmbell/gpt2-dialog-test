"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You're wrong. Guys like Chance the Rapper, Tyler the Creator, and so much others are really good."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Okay, then. Go on."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not to mention that legends like Nas, Eminem, and Ice Cube are still making music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I didn't know they were still around."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You see? Don't get so stuck in the past, or you'll miss out on what's happening right now."
