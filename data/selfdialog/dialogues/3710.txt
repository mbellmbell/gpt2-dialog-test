"__MUSIC__ May I ask a question, Professor?"
"__MUSIC__ You just did."
"__MUSIC__ I'll take that as a yes. I wanted to study all music as a music major."
"__MUSIC__ You're not?"
"__MUSIC__ No, in theory we only study German composers. Rarely will we look at French, Russian, South American, musicals, or things outside of piano music."
"__MUSIC__ I am aware."
"__MUSIC__ Why do we limit ourselves?"
"__MUSIC__ A couple reasons: money and racism."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup. So, back in the mid-20th century, a ton of German immigrants came to America to flee the war and its effects."
"__MUSIC__ So they brought their music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not just that, but they're the composers who wrote our first textbooks and taught our first generation of true professional music researchers."
"__MUSIC__ So why racist?"
"__MUSIC__ The main Germans of the day were very patriotic about their own music, and hated the French. Most weren't worth of study."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! What about the small scores?"
"__MUSIC__ That's just publication issues."
"__MUSIC__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you want to pay $1,000 for a textbook?"
"__MUSIC__ No, this $200 over four semesters is already too much."
"__MUSIC__ Well, imagine studying a band piece. It would take up the entire page, and they're recent. So they'd take up a lot of space and aren't in the public domain yet. It would be crazy expensive."
