"__MOVIES__ I'm in the mood for a horror movie. Do you have any recommendations?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorites are Halloween, The Shining and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It depends on what you're in the mood for."
"__MOVIES__ I'm really in the mood for a slasher type movie. I haven't seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
"__MOVIES__ That's definitely a slasher movie, it's really gruesome and scary."
"__MOVIES__ From what I've heard about it, the really scary thing is that it could actually happen."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that's true. People could get stranded in the backwoods somewhere and stumble upon some maniacs."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds good but is it very dated considering that it was made in the early 1970s?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think it absolutely holds up. There was a remake about a decade ago, but the original is better."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, some friends wanted to go see that in the theater but we saw something else. Who was in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Jessica Biel and a bunch of unknowns. R. Lee Ermey also is in it."
"__MOVIES__ I think I would rather see the original."
"__MOVIES__ Good choice. You won't be disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ I want to make it a double feature, do you have another recommendation? Something more recent that's good?"
"__MOVIES__ A movie I saw in the theaters and would watch again was made a few years ago called The Strangers."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it and what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It stars Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. They're a couple in a remote house who get terrorized one night by mask-wearing psychos."
"__MOVIES__ Are there a lot of good scares in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I'm thinking of a couple right now and just got the chills. It's not as gruesome, it has more build up and suspenseful scares."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks for the recommendations. This sounds like a good combination of movies for a double feature."
"__MOVIES__ I think you'll enjoy it. A classic slasher film and a more tense psychological thriller."
