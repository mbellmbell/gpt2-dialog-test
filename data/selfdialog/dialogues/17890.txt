"__MOVIES__ Hey, I'm going to the movies this Saturday, did you want to go?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure!  What are you thinking about seeing?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure yet, any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, what kind of movie were you thinking about?"
"__MOVIES__ I wanted to see a action movie, but I don't know if there's any good ones out right now."
"__MOVIES__ How about the new Fast and the Furious?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I completely forgot about that one."
"__MOVIES__ I've already watched it, but I'll definitely see it again."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, do you think it's as good as the other ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, this one is probably my favorite so far."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I've heard some spoilers about it, so hopefully they aren't true."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm not going to ruin the movie for you, but I'll tell you the spoilers I heard before I went weren't true."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not telling you, it'll ruin it for you."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, too bad Paul Walker passed away, he was great in the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, but I think the rest of the cast is great too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Vin Diesel is probably one of my favorite actors."
"__MOVIES__ Mine too, what time did you want to go?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably around 8 on Saturday, does that work?"
"__MOVIES__ That's perfect, I'll see you then."
