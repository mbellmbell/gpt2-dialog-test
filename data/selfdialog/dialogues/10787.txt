"__FASHION__ Why are all these guys wearing denim shorts all the sudden?"
"__FASHION__ Who knows probably some hipster trend."
"__FASHION__ Yeah I think its definitely a trend too but why"
"__FASHION__ Someone in Hollywood did it first."
"__FASHION__ Who?"
"__FASHION__ No idea but where do all trends emanate from?"
"__FASHION__ The internet I would say"
"__FASHION__ That may be true but mostly from TV"
"__FASHION__ Well it looks terrible"
"__FASHION__ Its not just that they are cutting their jeans apart"
"__FASHION__ So then instead of buying shorts they are buying jeans"
"__FASHION__ Which are more expensive"
"__FASHION__ No one said guys know fashion"
"__FASHION__ Its not just that, they dont know how to dress nor save a dime."
"__FASHION__ Well money has nothing to do with it"
"__FASHION__ Sure it does, a look for less?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah that sort of makes sense"
"__FASHION__ So the jeans have to have a distressed look"
"__FASHION__ You know someones going to attack that style soon"
"__FASHION__ I think Abercrombie is already profiting off of it"
