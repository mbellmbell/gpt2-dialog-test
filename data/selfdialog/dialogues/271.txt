"__MUSIC__ Did you hear DJ Khaled just put out an album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't. What is it called?"
"__MUSIC__ The album is called 'Grateful.'"
"__MUSIC__ Is it any good? I didn't even realize he made albums."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's mostly just a bunch of tracks of featured guests. It's not really like he writes his own music or anything."
"__MUSIC__ Who are the other artists on it?"
"__MUSIC__ He has songs featuring Rihanna, Chance the Rapper, Nicki Minaj, Justin Bieber, and Future, among others."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. That's quite an impressive list of artists."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. The album isn't getting very good reviews though."
"__MUSIC__ Well that doesn't really surprise me either."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not even sure how I would classify DJ Khaled as an artist."
"__MUSIC__ He's certainly carved out a very interesting niche for himself."

"__MUSIC__ He's sort of like Lil Jon for a new generation."
"__MUSIC__ That's so funny! He really is."
"__MUSIC__ His snapchat is hilarious too."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. He may not be a talented musician but he's definitely an entertainer."
"__MUSIC__ Is this his first album?"
