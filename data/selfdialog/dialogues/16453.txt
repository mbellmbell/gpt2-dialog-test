"__ROCK__ What's your favorite rock band of all time?"
"__ROCK__ Like if I only had to listen to one rock band for the rest of my life?"
"__ROCK__ Yea."
"__ROCK__ Probably Weezer."
"__ROCK__ Ahh, good choice."
"__ROCK__ Yea. I mean I've been listening to their music for like the past 15 years at least, and I still don't get tired of them."
"__ROCK__ Their songs are so good. Especially the early stuff from their Blue album."
"__ROCK__ I know right?! Say It Ain't So and Buddy Holly are my favorites from that album."
"__ROCK__ They're so catchy. I only wish that their later albums were as good."
"__ROCK__ Yea, the other albums were kind of hit or miss. There were a few good songs from every album, but I loved every single song from the Blue Album."
