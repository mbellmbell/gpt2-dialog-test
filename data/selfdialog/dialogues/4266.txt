"__MUSIC__ I didn't get a wink of sleep last night."
"__MUSIC__ What happened?"
"__MUSIC__ The loser in the apartment above mine was blairing his radio all night."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, no!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  And it gets worse."
"__MUSIC__ It get's worse?"
"__MUSIC__ Why do have to repeat everything I say? Yes, it gets worse."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. How?"
"__MUSIC__ They guy has a dog, too!"
"__MUSIC__ And?"
"__MUSIC__ The dog appears to be a music lover."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Fido, or whatever you call the mutt, kept singning with the radio...all night long."
"__MUSIC__ All night long...sorry.  It did?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. And that is not the worst part."
"__MUSIC__ Not the worst part? What was?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not bad enough the dog sang along to the music of Death Leopard, The Scorpions, and Marilyn Manson..."
"__MUSIC__ How can it be any worse?"
"__MUSIC__ The dog sang better than any of the original singers. I could stop listening!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the bar was set pretty low. I would like to hear that dog sing opera!"
