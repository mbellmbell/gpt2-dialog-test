"__MOVIES__ What's your opinion on scary movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They're some of my favourite kinds of movies, but I have to watch them in a certain setting."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ At night, but with a decent light on and with somebody else in the room even if it's my puppy."
"__MOVIES__ Ahh, sounds like the perfect atmosphere."
"__MOVIES__ It really is. I get scared easily and am prone to having nightmares ironically."
"__MOVIES__ What are some of your favourites?"
"__MOVIES__ I love everything Wes Craven does. Anything based off of Stephen King's books, too, and most paranormal stuff."
"__MOVIES__ So Like The Exorcist, American Haunting, Carrie, that kind of stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah exactly. Those are all great examples."
"__MOVIES__ I like how creative horror/thriller movies are getting lately."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I thought The Babadook was really interesting in the sounds used and the surprise ending... I'm still not sure how to feel about it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you mean how she ends up keeping The Babadook as some sort of pet almost?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've never seen anything like that in a scary movie. It kind of helped me be spooked less by making me almost feel sorry for him."
"__MOVIES__ I felt that way too. Isn't it unfair how they can manipulate our feelings towards a character like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like the whole time you're hiding behind your blanket from him and then at the end you feel kind of endeared towards him."
"__MOVIES__ I know, makes me want a babadook as my own pet!"
"__MOVIES__ But everything about that movie I thought was spot on, from the photography to the acting to the book itself. I mean you have to be relly artistic to come up with that."
"__MOVIES__ The book was probably my favourite part. The way it was constructed and the whole concept of it really made the movie for me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I would definitely recommend it to anybody who's even slightly willing to give scary movies a chance."
