"__STAR_WARS__ I just binge watched the original three Star Wars movies yesterday."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I think the best of the original three is Empire Strikes back."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way! Return of the Jedi is the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like parts of Jedi but I think the Ewoks are just dumb."
"__STAR_WARS__ But they're so cute, I had the whole Ewok village playset when I was a kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's just it, if you saw the movie for the first time when you were an adult the Ewoks just seem so lame.  Suddenly they're on a planet hanging out with teddy bears, it just doesn't make sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh OK, a giant Wookie is totally fine with you but smaller, cuter ones are stupid?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, you are able to get past the weirdness of Chewbacca because he's huge and really tough."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Ewoks have a complete culture and language, Chewie only ever howls like a dog with his foot caught in a trap."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but the bowcaster and the fact that he can rip your arms off if he gets mad totally make up for all that."
