"__STAR_WARS__ It's crazy to think about the fact that Star Wars has been in theaters for pretty much every generation alive now."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, I'd never thought of it that way. They really do have a long run."
"__STAR_WARS__ And now they've got three whole trilogies underway, that's crazy!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which trilogy is your favourite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, I can't really put the most recent one into account since they've only had one episode so far."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, it's hard to compare one out of three to a full set."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the most recent trilogy could go somewhere, but for now the original trilogy is my favourite."
"__STAR_WARS__ No surprise there, honestly. No one likes the prequel trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Honestly the idea behind the prequel trilogies is great, it's just that the dialogue is so poor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus Anakin's so whiny. I never knew someone complaining about sand could be so annoying."
