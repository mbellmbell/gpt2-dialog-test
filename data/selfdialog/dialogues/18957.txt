"__MOVIES__ Do you like Jurassic Park?"
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ You've never seen Jurassic Park?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is that the one with the aliens?"
"__MOVIES__ You've got to be kidding me. Jurassic Park has the dinosaurs in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! The Steven Spielberg one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, only one of the greatest movies of the past 30 years."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've never seen it. I prefer romance movies."
"__MOVIES__ So you really wouldn't watch Jurassic Park?"
"__MOVIES__ Too scary. I don't like to watch people get eaten."
"__MOVIES__ But it's a movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't matter. It'll give me nightmares."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't you just watch the movie Saw?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was great."
"__MOVIES__ And that didn't give you nightmares?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, I laughed through the whole thing."
"__MOVIES__ That seems a little odd."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah everyone I was watching with thought so too."
"__MOVIES__ You might be insane."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
