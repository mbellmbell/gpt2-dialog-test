"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What did you think of Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought it was alright, it was not going to be the same without Paul."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, he was such a major part of the franchise."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It just feels off without him."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The rest of the cast were pretty good though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, definitely.  Charlize Theron was great."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I did also kind of miss Brewster though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, it seems strange that they wrote her out of the series."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I wonder if she wanted out or if the writers just felt it needed to be done."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I would guess she did not want to do any more."
