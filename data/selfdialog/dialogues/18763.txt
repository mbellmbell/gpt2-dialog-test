"__MOVIES__ So what do you think of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far?"
"__MOVIES__ I've been really impressed. Their movies have been all so good so far."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it. My favorite one so far is Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good choice, but mine's a bit different."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really? What is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's actually Ant-Man."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I won't argue, but just tell me why."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a lot more relatable as far as the characters are concerned."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, I guess that makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ I just thought it was nice that the stakes were a bit smaller this time around."
"__MOVIES__ True. Normally the heroes have to save entire cities from being destroyed."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. It was nice that for once, it focused on one guy trying to save his family rather than an entire city."
"__MOVIES__ True. And for what it was, Paul Rudd fit perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ He did! It felt like such a natural role for him."
"__MOVIES__ I also thought that Michael Pena's character was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Easily one of the most entertaining parts of the whole film."
"__MOVIES__ Also, the movie's visuals were on a whole other level."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed! Seeing everything upscaled was such a treat for the eyes."
"__MOVIES__ I take back my doubts. Ant-Man was a pretty solid movie."
"__MOVIES__ See, just because a movie doesn't have the Avengers in it doesn't make it any less good!"
