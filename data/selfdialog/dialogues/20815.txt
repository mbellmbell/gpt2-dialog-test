"__THRILLER__ So what did you think of that 'Primal Fear' movie we saw last night?"
"__THRILLER__ I thought it was creepy and depressing."
"__THRILLER__ You didn't enjoy it at all?"
"__THRILLER__ No, I enjoyed it, but I saw it ending differently in my head."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, Edward Norton really played a deranged character."
"__THRILLER__ It just made me feel bad to know that I pulled for him the whole movie, and then he let me down."
"__THRILLER__ I think Richard Gere was kind of boring in it too."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, he didn't have a lot of excitement, but I think it was just because Edward Norton stole the show."
"__THRILLER__ It definitely was a good movie though."
"__THRILLER__ I agree with you, but I just wish it had a happier resolution."
