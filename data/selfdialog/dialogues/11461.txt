"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I used to love the Minnesota Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't anymore?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still do. But I did more as a kid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's changed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't live in Minnesota anymore. So there's that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. It's harder to see games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a couple bars that play them, but not many people to watch with."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's too bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then I feel like I should root for the Giants, since I live here in New York now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It might be more fun, but I don't see any reason you'd need to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I can't just secretly root for the Vikings. I like to go all out when I'm cheering."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What sorts of things do you do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I like to wear a jersey."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a purple one would really stand out when everyone else is wearing blue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. And I like to get loud and cheer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So does everyone!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Have more confidence, come in a jersey and root for the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe I will."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should!"
