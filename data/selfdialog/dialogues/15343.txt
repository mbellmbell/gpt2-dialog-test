"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why can't I find a badly scribbled over textbook that contains all the answers I need for school like in Harry Potter."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly! I think we'd end up squabbling quickly over it just like Harry and Ron do in Half-Blood Prince."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Nah, we'd end up sharing it. What I love is how much Hermione fumes over the scribbles being more spot on compared to the instructions in the book."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, totally, Emma Watson did that so well. I think most people that love Hermione's character had to love how that played out in the movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True, I burst out laughing when the students are working on their potions and Hermione's hair has gone from curly to crazy thanks to the fumes."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was perfect! Also, her scene in Potions where she lets it slip what she smells when she smells the love potion Amortentia."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes! Awkward teen moment there; some of it is just loving Hermione's character throughout the movies but some of it is that I think Slughorn's Potions class would have actually been fun."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Dangerous but fun, it seemed like everything was free to explode or catch fire. The movie is pretty intense for the series so it was like a bit of relief from all the tension."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yep, until Harry gets his assignment from Dumbledore to ask about the Horcruxes. Not to mention Ron accidentally overdosing on a badly mixed love potion which was fairly funny and then turning around and getting accidentally poisoned."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, poor Ron! He's definitely put through the ringer in Half-Blood Prince with the poisoning, Quidditch, and all the drama between him and Hermione."
