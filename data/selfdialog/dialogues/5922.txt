"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Rogue one is a good film?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Rogue one is the best film Since Empire Strikes Back. I loved K2SO."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was a fun, intelligent robot. I cared about him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I did too. I cried when he died."
"__STAR_WARS__ I cried when everyone died."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. I don't know how they could possibly make a sequel."
"__STAR_WARS__ If they did one, it would have to be with a completely different group"
"__STAR_WARS__ When would it be set, do you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My guess it would be between Empire and Return of the Jedi, when the Rebellion is in shambles."
"__STAR_WARS__ That could be very interesting."
