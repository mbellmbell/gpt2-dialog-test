"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Justin Beiber's new song Despacito?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Isn't it so good?"
"__MUSIC__ It really is. I feel like he's slowly started releasing songs again."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's been kinda absent for a while, hasn't he?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. At least i haven't seen many in the top charts. But Despacito is fire right now. It's so catchy."
"__MUSIC__ DO you even understand the words?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, but I still like to sing along. I just mumble the parts I don't know."
"__MUSIC__ He also released I'm The One recently. That song has a lot of famous people on it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! It's so good and I love Chance the Rapper who is on that song too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Chance has slowly started getting really popular. I heard he doesn't even charge for his music right now so he lives off of donations and merchandise purchases."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I wonder if he took any money for making that song?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, if JB and DJ Khaled and Lil Wayne did, it would be weird if he didn't."
"__MUSIC__ Still, I kind of want to purchase some of his merchandise now. I've never heard of an artist not charging for his music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it makes it less about money and more about the heart of the music. I really respect that."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Plus, it's really good music! His songs are really catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't him and Justin Bieber do another song together?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it was called Juke Jam."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the one! It's really catchy for a slow song."
"__MUSIC__ It's so good though. They make a good due. I hope they release more songs together."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!"
