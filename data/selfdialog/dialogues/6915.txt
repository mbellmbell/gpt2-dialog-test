"__STAR_WARS__ Was General Grievous a Sith warrior?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not quite.  He was just trained in certain Sith aspects, but he wasn't a Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ But he was trained by Count Dooku, wasn't he?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was, but as mentioned in the previous movie, there can only be two Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, a master and apprentice, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's correct."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even if he wasn't Sith, I think Grievous was pretty interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ He had biologic parts, which is probably why he was Force sensitive."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think he was a better villain than Count Dooku?"
"__STAR_WARS__ With that, I'd disagree.  Christopher Lee did such a terrific job portraying the Count."
