"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm looking forward to Sunday. It's time to renew the rivalry with Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure is time. It's good to have tom Brady back!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's very true now that the NFL's two best quarterbacks get to go head to head."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are not the two best quaterbacks this year. Maybe in 2006 they were hot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny being that your team couldn't even beat Seattle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, says the guy who's team got screwed by replacement referees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's classic coming from a guy who's team is twelth in the league with quarterback ratings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My guy at least won a Super Bowl in the past five years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had to do something to make up for getting discount double slammed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your jealousy and your teams inadequacy is so obvoius."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's jealousy? You can't keep up with a conversation about elite quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't honestly consider Flacco elite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How on earth is he not an eilte quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Manning, Brady, and Rodgers, those are the elite three."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe if your head they are the top three. Regardless, Joe Flacco is still top tier."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, believe what you want."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, why don't you think Joe Flacco's top tier?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Joe Flacco sucks. There's no way he has earned a place in quarterback history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The same can be said about Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now there is a biasis opinion."
