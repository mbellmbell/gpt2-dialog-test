"__MOVIES__ You know, I was thinking about prequel films the other day."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, what about prequels?"
"__MOVIES__ I was just thinking that they fill in unnecessary information that the audience doesn't need."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes people want to see what happened in the past to a character though?"
"__MOVIES__ But most of the time it's better left to the imagination."
"__MOVIES__ I don't agree. I'd rather see what happens in a movie than have to picture it myself."
"__MOVIES__ But what if what happens in a prequel isn't like what you picture in your head? Won't you be disappointed?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I'd much rather see the original creator's vision than anything I'd come up with."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, but what about when a prequel contradicts things that happened in a prior film?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't care about that. I'm just along for the ride."
"__MOVIES__ Not much of a stickler for continuity, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd rather look at the big picture. If a prequel is enjoyable, who cares if a few little details are wrong in the grand scheme?"
"__MOVIES__ I care. I think prequels are a bad idea."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes they are. Hannibal Rising for example, was completely unnecessary."
"__MOVIES__ I'll agree with you there."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but, that doesn't mean all prequels are bad. Some like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are great."
"__MOVIES__ That barely even counts, it was only set before the first film because of convenience."
"__MOVIES__ No matter the reason why, it' still a prequel, and that proves that some are good."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, I'll give you that. I guess Monsters University wasn't all bad either."
"__MOVIES__ Finally, something we can agree on!"
