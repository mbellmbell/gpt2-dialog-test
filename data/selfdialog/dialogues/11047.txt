"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL season is in two months."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Technically a month if you include preseason"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I'm even more excited then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It usually isn't that fun to watch, but I'll take anything"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'll watch all of the games for my team regardless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's cool to see who makes it and doesn't after all the cuts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your team by the way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Browns fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel your pain as I am a Jets fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We can yell at our televisions together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are you feeling about the Browns this season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not really expecting too much, but our draft was pretty solid and we didn't reach this time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I saw they took an entirely different approach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We got a long way to go, but that is the right way to build a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets definitely are going to be a bottom three team this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a shame, because they were just in the AFC Title game two consecutive years in a row with Sanchez at the helm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We had such a good looking team, despite a mediocre quarterback and the wheels just fell off suddenly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Our wheels have seemed to have been off for some time now in regard to the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am getting stoked just thinking about the season, despite the likely outcome"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So am I! Is it opening season yet?"
