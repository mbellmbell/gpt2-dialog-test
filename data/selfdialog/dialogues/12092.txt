"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you have winning the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's still too early to tell. Obviously the Pats are favorites to win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I put money down on the Bengals. Vegas is giving them 66-to-1 odds to win it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way do the Bengals win the Super Bowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, it's a long shot, but I like they're team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did they get in the draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ they got John Ross out of Washington with the 9th pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh he's really dynamic. Fastest guy in the draft I heard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He'll open thinks up for that offense. With AJ Green and Tyler Eiffert on the other ends Dalton should be able to throw at will."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have a really good receiving corps and Dalton has proven to be a good QB and leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus their running game is among the best in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But their defense isn't strong enough, and defense is what wins championships."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you need a good defense nowadays but an elite QB if you want to win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Dalton isn't elite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's been borderline elite for a season or two. He's capable of putting up an elite season this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can name 10 other quarterbacks I'd rather have over Andy Dalton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The point of the bet was that Dalton could potentially have an elite season, and if he does the Bengals win it all"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have rather put my money on a safer pick like the Packers or Steelers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if the Bengals win, I look like a genius and I win a lot of money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they've made improvements and should be better, but nobody from the AFC is beating the Patriots to get to the Super Bowl."
