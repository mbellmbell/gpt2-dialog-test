"__MOVIES__ Do you remember ET?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I swear I remember when ET came out."
"__MOVIES__ But didn't it come out in 82?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, but I remember my mom taking my cousin to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Why didn't she take you if you were a year old?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  Babies don't really watch movies."
"__MOVIES__ You were old enough to remember it."
"__MOVIES__ I remember them going and thinking it was a monster."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when I was a little older, my mom bought it on VHS."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was okay.  I never liked the part when the science people were coming in."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it gets all sad then."
"__MOVIES__ Did you have any of the toys that they came out with?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember having an ET figurine.  It was a little plastic toy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a lot of places gave out glasses and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ It was one of the most popular movies of the time."
"__MOVIES__ It's surprising a lot of today's kids have never seen it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's crazy to think that."
"__MOVIES__ Scenes like the one where he is on the bike were so iconic."
