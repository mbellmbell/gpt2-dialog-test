"__DISNEY__ I don't get all the hype for Frozen when it came out."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ It was a good movie no doubt, but a bit overrated."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't think so.  Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ The actual story itself wasn't much different from most Disney stories."
"__DISNEY__ But the ending showing family love was."
"__DISNEY__ I guess so, but it wasn't that hard to see from my vantage point."
"__DISNEY__ I guess you just have a bit of a cold heart like Anna, eh?"
"__DISNEY__ Hey, that's pretty creative.  Maybe you should make films."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe I should!"
