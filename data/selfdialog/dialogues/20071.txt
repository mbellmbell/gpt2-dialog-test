"__MOVIES__ So what is your all time favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Gosh that's a really tough choice, there are so many good ones out there!"
"__MOVIES__ Mine is Gremlins, have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course!  That's an old classic."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's great.  It came out in 1984!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow.  And it had Phoebe Cates in it, didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep!  Her and Zach Galligan."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the little creatures in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know!  They were so cute."
"__MOVIES__ It had amazing special effects for being made so long ago too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it really did.  I thought it was truly unique for its time period."
"__MOVIES__ It's funny and scary too, which is a neat combination."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's hard to come up with funny and scary.  Kinda like Beetlejuice."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it was much better than Beetlejuice."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see any of the sequels?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I didn't think they were as good as the original though."
"__MOVIES__ No, but they were still good movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah no doubt!  All the Gremlins movies have been great."
"__MOVIES__ It'd be neat if they made another one wouldn't it!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like a fortieth reunion Gremlins or something like that.  The timing would be right."
