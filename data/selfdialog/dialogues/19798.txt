"__MOVIES__ We should have a Harry Potter movie marathon!"
"__MOVIES__ That would be awesome.  I've heard you can watch them in about 20 hours."
"__MOVIES__ Twenty hours if you didn't take any breaks."
"__MOVIES__ No I think that includes some limited time in between."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ That's hard.  I think most people like the later ones but I kind of enjoy the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ They are definitely more feel good and light-hearted."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that.  Chamber of Secrets isn't very lighthearted."
"__MOVIES__ I guess not and Prisoner of Azkaban is pretty dark."
"__MOVIES__ They wanted it to be darker to show that things were becoming more serious.  But I agree the first one really is more feel good."
"__MOVIES__ I wish the later movies has more Quidditch in them."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  But I suppose there is only so many subjects you can pack into one movie."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is Half Blood Prince.  I really like the story line with Snape and Malfoy."
"__MOVIES__ Malfoy's character certainly gets some more depth to it in Half Blood Prince."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that the new movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, is going to have a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ I think they are planning four more movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's awesome.  I love Eddie Redmayne."
"__MOVIES__ I'm just glad that the Harry Potter universe is continuing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  I was pretty bummed at the end of Deathly Hallows."
"__MOVIES__ I was in a definite funk but this will keep them going for me."
