"__MUSIC__ OK, almost party time, let's pick out some music to play!"
"__MUSIC__ Alright, this should be fun. What kind of vibe are you thinking?"
"__MUSIC__ Just kind of laid back and pleasant. Not like dance music."
"__MUSIC__ This should be easy."
"__MUSIC__ Let's put some Spoon on the playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Good call, Spoon is a lot of fun. Most of the stuff on Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga would work."
"__MUSIC__ Done. What else?"
"__MUSIC__ Phoenix has some good stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, they're a good choice too. They've got that new album out; I know the first three tracks on it would all be good."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. Let's get something a little less current next."
"__MUSIC__ Good idea. Have you heard of The Meters?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what are they like?"
"__MUSIC__ They're an instrumental funk band that's been around since the 70's."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like good party music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're not like George Clinton or anything; I think they'll suit the mood."
"__MUSIC__ Here's an idea: what about some of Elliott Smith's more upbeat songs?"
"__MUSIC__ That's an idea. His later stuff then, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that should do it."
"__MUSIC__ I think we've got a solid playlist now!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too; should be good party music for mixing!"
