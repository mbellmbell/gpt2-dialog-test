"__MUSIC__ I enjoy them, too.  Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment."
"__MUSIC__ Nah, I think people just don't like that the lead singer is an activist."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that sounds about right.  People are so picky."
"__MUSIC__ I know, heaven forbid he wants to do something to make a change."
"__MUSIC__ Meanwhile you're sitting on the couch eating cheetohs."
