"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the Clone Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was episode two, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked the romance aspect of it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Between Anakin and Padme?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I liked the way he always loved her."
"__STAR_WARS__ You did not think it was gross Padme was so much older than him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She was not that much older than him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think four years, but she knew him as a kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, she was young then too. They had always loved each other, just not in the same sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish they would have let her live."
