"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like Yoda as a character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't, not as much as some do."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was irritating and took up a lot of time."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was irritating on purpose, though, in order to train Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why couldn't he have just introduced himself?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He didn't introduce himself so he could judge Luke's reaction."
"__STAR_WARS__ He acted foolish."
"__STAR_WARS__ But it was an act. He had great wisdom, like rejecting the title of a 'great warrior.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ I spuppose he did come off as wise."
