"__MUSIC__ What groups do you think began the heavy metal genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a matter of great dispute!"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ No one really knows. It kind of just happened."
"__MUSIC__ Still, there are pioneers for every genre of music."
"__MUSIC__ True. Steppenwolf is probably responsible for the genre."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics to 'Born To Be Wild' include the phrase 'heavy metal'."
"__MUSIC__ I see. But, I'm more interested in the groups responsible."
"__MUSIC__ The Yardbirds would be a good place to start."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ At one point, several of the early heavy metal guitarists were in the group."
"__MUSIC__ Who's that?"
"__MUSIC__ There was Eric Clapton, Jimmie Page, and Jeff Beck at different points."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. But the group most responsible is probably Black Sabbath."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. Ozzie is certainly a pioneer."
"__MUSIC__ And, we can't forget Jimmie Page's next band -- Led Zeppelin."
"__MUSIC__ For sure! What about the heavy metal look. I mean the fashion."
"__MUSIC__ That's an easy one. It's all Judas Priest. Although, Kiss and their makeup also played a big role in music fashion."
