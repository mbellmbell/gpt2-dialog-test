"__MUSIC__ That sounds cool. Is she cute?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she is what you expect of an attractive Japanese girl. She has a petite build and pleasant features with a soft, fair complexion."
"__MUSIC__ I find Asian girls attractive. That coupled with the musical talent is intriguing."

"__MUSIC__ Does she play with any jazz musicians I've heard of?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. She has recorded albums with Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke to name a couple."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty impressive."
