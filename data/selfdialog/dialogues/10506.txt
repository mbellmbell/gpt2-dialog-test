"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Would you consider more of a fan of retro rap, such as back in the '90's, or today?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Honestly, somewhere in between. I am a bit more of a '90's person when it comes to rap, but I do like some of stuff from the 2000's."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are particular favorite rapper you enjoy?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Actually, growing up, I was a big fan of Eminem. His music was always quite good, in my opinion."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He was definitely at his peak, I think in the early 2000's with the Marshal Mathers LP album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ To this day, I think that was his best album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh definitely. What's your favorite song by Eminem?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a tough one. I am going to go a little outside the box and go with 'Stan.' I just really love the story the song told."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Could you refresh my memory on that song or better yet, the story?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Essentially, the verses are a crazed fan writing to Eminem, and as the song goes on, and we go into his second, and then third letter, he begins to lose it due to not getting a response."
