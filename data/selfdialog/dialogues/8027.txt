"__POP__ Britney Spears might be the world's oldest teen."
"__POP__ Uhm, I see what you mean, but I saw her perform, and she put on the ideal act for Las Vegas."
"__POP__ You mean she was vulgar and over the top, unbelievable and trashy. Like Vegas."
"__POP__ No, I mean she slayed. Her act mixes naive and sophisticated like a gambler who's been losing in that town for 20 years."
"__POP__ Oh. Naive and knowing. She knows all the ways to lose."
"__POP__ Yeah. But not how to stop playing."
"__POP__ But really she's a hard-working highly-trained Southern girl who as brought up in show business. She's a professional."
"__POP__ Right. It's an act. I'm sure she's somone else when she's not working."
"__POP__ I'll tell you though, when she's working, she's the queen of pop. You should go see her. Just climb over all those screaming fans."
"__POP__ Right, and dirty old men like you."
