"__LADY_GAGA__ What is your favorite Lady Gaga album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know it's new, but I love Joanne."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Why is that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She still maintains her awesome vocal prowess, but has stepped back a bit with the crazy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, she's an actual person now."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you mean? That's not nice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Before she was an image, or an act. Now she's a person."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Sort of. But yeah, this album is very personal, very stripped-down."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Is 'The cure' on it?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, that's an independent song."
