"__LADY_GAGA__ Is it just me or was Artpop an underrated album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I believe that it was underrated. I think that Gypsy is a top 5 Lady Gaga song that no one talks about."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. I just think that it gets a bad reputation because it under performed commercially."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I would probably attribute that to the weakness of the lead single, Applause."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, and Do What U Want didn't get the promotion it deserved."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Agreed. I like it when Lady Gaga collaborates with other artists on songs and wish she did it more."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think that her collaborations are hit or miss. While I liked Do What U Want, I found Telephone very overrated."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Aside from the music video being too long, I loved that song when it came out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ The length wasn't the issue for me. I just thought that Lady Gaga and Beyonce made a weird mix."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really, I thought the fact that the two perfectly complemented each other in the song."
