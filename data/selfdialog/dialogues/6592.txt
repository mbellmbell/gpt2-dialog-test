"__STAR_WARS__ hey what do you think about star wars boot up?"
"__STAR_WARS__ what do you mean by star wars boot up?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean they have sort of rebooted star wars series with new movies like rogue one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought rogue one was individual solo star wars movie rather than series reboot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was suppose to be solo but then there is already new star wars movie in production"
"__STAR_WARS__ But I am sure that upcoming movie is not going to be sequel of rogue one."
"__STAR_WARS__ are you sure about that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ yes I am pretty sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh okay I guess I trust you on that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am glad to hear that."
