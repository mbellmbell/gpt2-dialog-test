"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey who is your team this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh you know I got the Panthers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They almost went perfect two years ago, had a slight hiccup last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say more than a hiccup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a bad year, but Benjamin will be back, and Mccaffery could be what the team needs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I admit Christian could be a stud."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He'll fill that slot WR or RB position, and no Linebacker will be able to cover him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he is going to seriously create some matchup problems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus with Greg Olsen still in his prime. The offense will be unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it all depends on Cam."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah you got to hope that he has a good attitude, and stays that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I just didn't like what I saw from him in the Super Bowl two years ago when the Broncos beat them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that play where he didn't really go after the ball I think was a real bad look for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you just gotta hope that Ron Rivera keeps them playing well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he's a really good coach that doesn't get enough credit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's done so much for that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, with guys like Kuechly and Cam running the team, he should be doing better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess i can agree with that. we've got some players in their prime that aren't gonna be great forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and guys like Kuechly, you never know if he's played his last snap due to injury."
