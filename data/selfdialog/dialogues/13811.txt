"__BASKETBALL__ The Bulls organization seems really lost"
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. The Dwayne Wade signing was a bad decision."
"__BASKETBALL__ He didn't fit with this offense"
"__BASKETBALL__ No he didn't. Matter of fact this whole roster didn't fit"
"__BASKETBALL__ I have no idea what this organization is trying to do"
"__BASKETBALL__ And what do they do with Rajon Rondo."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean he played like garbage the majority of the year, but look good in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is until he got hurt."
"__BASKETBALL__ Bingo. Can they build this team around Jimmy Butler"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know if Jimmy Butler is a bonafied superstar. I mean he is a good player"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes good, but not great"
"__BASKETBALL__ And that's the dilemma. They went from thinking Derrick Rose was their franchise player to now Jimmy"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he needs a superstar to play with for this to work out"
"__BASKETBALL__ He is not the type of guy that can lead a team to the promise land"
"__BASKETBALL__ But you have to pay him max money because you can't lose him."
"__BASKETBALL__ I see what you are saying. Can they get big name free agents to go there?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they could especially if Wade decides to opt out"
"__BASKETBALL__ He would be leaving a lot of money on the table though"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he would, but you would think it's not about the money for him at this point"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but it's always about the money"
