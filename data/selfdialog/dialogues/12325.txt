"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your opinion on deflategate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's deflategate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The whole cheating scandal with the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've never heard about this."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, it's an interesting story though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, I guess during a championship game against the Colts, the Patriots were using deflated balls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Deflated how?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, normally balls have to be inflated to a particular pressure, to be used in an NFL game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So they, or someone on the Patriots, was deflating the balls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does that do, game-wise?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's softer. So it's easier to both throw and catch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like a huge advantage!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a big deal. The Ravens claimed that the same thing happened to them in a game with the patriots, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what ended up happening?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The patriots were given a million dollar fine and Tom Brady had to sit out four games as a penalty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that doesn't seem like enough for cheating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so either!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should be careful down the road."
