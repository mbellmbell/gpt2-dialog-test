"__MUSIC__ I know you like heavy metal music, and you like science fiction, have you ever heard of Ayreon?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't actually what kind of music are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Well Aryeon is a musical project headed up by one guy who creates all the music and tells a story with each album."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so it's like a concept album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there's different vocalists playing different characters and each album plays out like a rock opera or a musical."
"__MUSIC__ And I assume the storyline has to do with science fiction?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes it does.  The creator of the project has created a vast storyline which spans mutliple albums."
"__MUSIC__ This is really interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it is, the stories encompass almost anything you can imagine, from time travel, to time dilation, and even suspended animation."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, this is almost like everything I love all wrapped up in a single package."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly.  Each album plays out like a movie.  All you have to do is sit down, play the album on and let the whole story line surround you."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds really interesting."
"__MUSIC__ It is actually.  The interesting thing is it's almost like a book in that the story is being told and you're the one who imagines the scenario."
"__MUSIC__ Unlike watching a movie where everything is right there in front of you."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly.  You can create your own version of the story apart from everyone else's."
"__MUSIC__ I really like that.  To me it seems as if doing that can stir up really interesting conversations within a group of fans."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I've had interesting conversations already with a few people, you should check out the albums, who knows, you and I could have some interesting conversations as well."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I actually look forward to doing that."
"__MUSIC__ Is there an album you recommend I try out first?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually yes, since the Ayreon records weren't released chronologically, like the Star Wars movies, I recommend you check out the 8th album first as it's the prequel to the entire story."
