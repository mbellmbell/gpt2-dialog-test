"__MUSIC__ What type of music do you listen to?"

"__MUSIC__ Not yet, but I would love to some time soon."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite album by them?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like their self-titled album the most."

"__MUSIC__ Really? I didn't even realize its been out since 2008."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite song off of the album?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say Oxford Comma, but Bryn is a close second."

"__MUSIC__ They are such a great band to just relax and listen to, aren't they?"
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree. I wonder when their next album is going to come out."

"__MUSIC__ I believe that album came out in 2013, so you're totally right on that."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite song on that album?"
"__MUSIC__ Ya Hey. I find that song to be so fun, and the choruses are so different."
"__MUSIC__ That's my favorite too! I think I need to listen to some Vampire Weekend now."
