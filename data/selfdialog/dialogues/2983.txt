"__MUSIC__ just saw a video interview of adraina comparing herself and her music with the late whitney houston"
"__MUSIC__ whitney what?"
"__MUSIC__ hahaha oh yes"
"__MUSIC__ adraina should take a chill pill please"
"__MUSIC__ so i thought,all her song put together can be compared to one of whitney's greatest hits."
"__MUSIC__ it's just not comparable and to think she actually say that."
"__MUSIC__ of course she did...let me send you  the youtube link."
"__MUSIC__ please do"
"__MUSIC__ here you go yajsshddhdn"
"__MUSIC__ wow,seen it,adraina's confused, she sound nothing like whitney"
"__MUSIC__ like nothing at all"
"__MUSIC__ can you imagine,she's even saying she is a pop artist, was whitney a pop artist."
"__MUSIC__ no way she didn't say that"
"__MUSIC__ oh i thought you seen the full video before sending me the link"
"__MUSIC__ no i haven't, was so stunned by her first comment i had to purse and text you what she said hahaha"
"__MUSIC__ hahaha oh i see"
"__MUSIC__ so she claims to model whitney yet she never knew whitney wasn't doing pop music rather soul and rnb."
"__MUSIC__ i had wonder what she's on during the interview."
"__MUSIC__ she does pop music that i give to her because she is good at it,but saying whitney does pop music and she sounded and sing like whitney is quite absorbed"
"__MUSIC__ you can say that again."
