"__MUSIC__ Ugh, I can tell my friend used my pandora last."
"__MUSIC__ How?"
"__MUSIC__ It's still on the Steven Universe soundtrack station."
"__MUSIC__ Is that so bad?"
"__MUSIC__ I just never really got into it, despite her efforts to get me interested. Except for one song."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ The cookie cat song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I remember that. Still gets stuck in my head."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, mine too and not in a great way."
"__MUSIC__ I like the theme song more than anything."
"__MUSIC__ I don't mind it except for Steven's voice."
"__MUSIC__ Not a fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Not especially."
"__MUSIC__ How come?"
"__MUSIC__ I just can't stand the qualities of his voice, it's so aggravating. Especially when he was going through his voice change."
"__MUSIC__ Really? He's one of my favourites."
"__MUSIC__ Garnet is my favourite. her personality, her singing, everything."
"__MUSIC__ Makes sense, you know her voice actor is a professional singer right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Never heard any of her stuff apart from that series though."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither, I just know she's supposed to be good."
