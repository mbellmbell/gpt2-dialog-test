"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think Luke's been doing on a deserted island for all those years?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would think trying to find something to eat."
"__STAR_WARS__ He had to have learned from Yoda how to keep his mind busy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet he spent time standing by the shore seeing how far he could skip rocks with his mind."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you keep coming up with weird thoughts?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, he was on an island with nobody and nothing around, there's only so much he can do."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet he thought a lot about his dad."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean Darth?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luuuuuke, I am your father."
"__STAR_WARS__ He doesn't even say that line!"
