"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That last run for the TD seemed sketchy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh, what? Which last run?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The one from the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh White's run? yeah His knee seemed down before the ball crossed it seemed"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sketchy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, even if it was true that White didn't make it, what were they supposed to do? They had already shot off the confetti, fans were on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fan are not a reason to not overturn a call."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well logistically it was impossible. Might as well just give it to them. And Falcons agreed"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ because if it was that important to them which it was, they would've asked for a challenge"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they didn't so they must have went with it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. besides, it was a difficult call, there were hardly any angles from which you could see the ball clearly as his knees went down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sucks that we can send people to the moon, but still haven't figured out a way to view a TD unblocked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, a blocked view is a blocked view regardless of the technology we have. It says nothing of our abilities. We can't physically see through people"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or can we? We do have the x ray technology"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um, yes, bombard our athlete with x rays so we can view the ball, That's the dumbest idea ever"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or is there any other technologies to see through people?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. infrared will light up the people, but not the ball. X rays will kill peple"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about radar?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. There is no way. A blocked view is just that. It's blocked."
