"__MOVIES__ Are you into action movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it depends. I don't like cliche action movies."
"__MOVIES__ What about mafia action movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, most of them are really interesting and based on true stories."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Goodfellas?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! That is one of my favorite movies of all time."
"__MOVIES__ That movie is awesome, I watch it every week."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the part where they rob the airport for like 2 million dollars?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the Lufthansa Heist. That actually happened in real life too."
"__MOVIES__ That's so crazy that the mafia really did stuff like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Billy Batts was actually killed in real life, and was not sanctioned by the mafia."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's pretty rough. Why was he killed in real life?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think it was similar to the scene in the movie, but the guys name was Tommy DeSimone."
"__MOVIES__ Was he just like the short guy in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well he was a loose cannon yes, but he was actually really tall."
"__MOVIES__ Well I still feel like Joe Pesci was a good pick for that role."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, he just had to be in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ What about Jimmy the Gent, was he based on a real guy from the mafia?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he was affiliated with the mafia and later killed by them."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy, I'm gonna watch that movie again soon."
