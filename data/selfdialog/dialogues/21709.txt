"__DISNEY__ Did you know they are making a Toy Story 4?"
"__DISNEY__ Really? I thought they were finished with just only three movies for a trilogy."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah it comes out in 2019."
"__DISNEY__ Wow. I can't believe they are."
"__DISNEY__ I am a little excited to see it cause they are gonna try to find Bo Peep."
"__DISNEY__ That is kind of cool but I just don't know if I want to see it."
"__DISNEY__ How come?"
"__DISNEY__ Well I feel like the series ended on a good note and there is nothing more needing to be said."
"__DISNEY__ Well yeah it is cool Andy gave them a good home and all but that doesn't mean their adventures have to end."
"__DISNEY__ True I suppose you are right."
