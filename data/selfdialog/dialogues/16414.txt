"__ROCK__ Do rock bands always get kind of lame when they have been together for decades?"
"__ROCK__ Not always, haven't you been following Swans?"
"__ROCK__ Not since The Seer. Are they an old band?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, Swans has been around since the 80s and their style keeps evolving."
"__ROCK__ Have you heard their most recent albums?"
"__ROCK__ I actually have not heard their most recent one, The Glowing Man, but To Be Kind was good."
"__ROCK__ They remind me of Tool, if Tool actually released new music on a regular basis."
"__ROCK__ Well, Tool is a different kind of band. Their songwriting is more methodical."
"__ROCK__ How methodical?"
"__ROCK__ Compared to Swans, what Tool does is precise, deliberate, and mathematical."
