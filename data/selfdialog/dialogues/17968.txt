"__MOVIES__ I heard that new Aliens moving is coming out."
"__MOVIES__ It's already out actually. It's called Alien Covenant."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No. I haven't seen it. I just saw a trailer that said it was playing in theatres now."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if it's any good. I like the previous movies in that franchise."
"__MOVIES__ I hope it's good. The original Alien movie was really good."
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie. Sigourney Weaver is great in that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I find it to be the most memorable one in the franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Remember Alien vs. Predator? Did you ever see that?"
"__MOVIES__ I did see it. It was good, I suppose."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree. It's not like you can really expect a movie of great profundity with a topic like that."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes movies are just fun. They don't always have to be profound."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Some people feel that way about car-chase style movies."
"__MOVIES__ Sure. Fast and Furious is a franchise that keeps producing."
"__MOVIES__ I'm more of a Smokie and the Bandit type of person myself."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. That was an original classic, starring Burt Reynolds."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Sally Field in that also?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I think she was, as well as Dom Delouise possibly, if I'm not mistaken."
"__MOVIES__ That's a movie with a great song that goes with it, too."
"__MOVIES__ It sure is. 'East bound and down. Loaded up and truckin'...'"
