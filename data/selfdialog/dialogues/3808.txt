"__MUSIC__ Did you know that Chris Thile married Adalind from Grimm?"
"__MUSIC__ Really? Who's Chris Thile?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, he's the mandolinist for the Punch Brothers."
"__MUSIC__ The Punch Brothers?  Never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! They're this awesome bluegrass group.  Well, kinda bluegrass, but also different and way cool."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of different?  I never thought you'd be into bluegrass music."
"__MUSIC__ I used to think that, then I heard this new wave of bluegrass that's fun, edgy, and even a little jazzy."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me more about it.  I'm a little curious."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's this one group called Yonder Mountain String Band.  They're pretty progressive, and I heard them break into a metal version of one of their songs with a banjo!"
"__MUSIC__ That's wild!  I always thought bluegrass was full of old-timey folks and hillbillies."
"__MUSIC__ You'd be surprised.  You should give some of these newer progressive groups a try.  I bet you'd like them!"
"__MUSIC__ Can you recommend anything to me?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course!  Yonder Mountain just came out with a new album this month called 'Love. Ain't Love.'  I heard it's good."
"__MUSIC__ You haven't listened to it yet?"
"__MUSIC__ Eh, not yet, but I love their album 'Black Sheep'.  It came out a few years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Huh.  Interesting.  I'd want to hear something before I bought it though.  I am still surprised you like this banjo stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Dude, it's not just about the banjos.  Yes, there are banjos, but it's really cool.  You-tube it, you'll see."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I will!  Oh wow.  I see they blacked at the Red Rocks Amphitheater.  That's such an awesome venue!"
"__MUSIC__ No kidding.  And these cool bluegrass groups play there all the time!  I think String Cheese Incident is playing there in a month or two."
"__MUSIC__ There's a band called String Cheese Incident?  Now you're just making stuff up."
