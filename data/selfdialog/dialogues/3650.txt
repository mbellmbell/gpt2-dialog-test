"__MUSIC__ You know what totally trips me out?"
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ That I really can't stand Neil Diamond, but he wrote some of the Monkee's best songs!"
"__MUSIC__ I totoally agree!  I really like his songs, but his performance style is too bombastic for me."
"__MUSIC__ Bombastic is perfect!  But holy cow -- songs like 'I'm a Believer' and 'Here Comes Tomorrow' are just incredible!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! I love 'Here Comes Tomorrow.' It's one of my favorite songs of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, when I was first introduced to the Monkees, I couldn't understand all the lyrics because of Davy's accent -- 'Bode-eye' and such!"
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree! I had to ask someone who said it was 'But I' -- that kills me."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song. I love the Lovin' Spoonfull's 'Did you Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind,' which is  kind of on the same theme."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, that song is fabulous.  I really like Lovin' Spoonful."
"__MUSIC__ So do I. I love Jug Band Music!"
"__MUSIC__ Me, too!  I really like how happy so much of their songs are."
"__MUSIC__ You know what song I used to hate and really like now?"
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ That one 'If  you're going to San Fran Cisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair..'"
"__MUSIC__ That song is too corny!"
"__MUSIC__ I used to think so, too, but I've watched Monterey Pop so many times now, I love it!"
"__MUSIC__ That cracks me up -- that's happened to me before."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that happened to me with the Bay City Rollers when I was little -- I didn't like them, but my neice played them all the time, and I ended up loving them."
"__MUSIC__ Worn down, eh! That's funny!!"
