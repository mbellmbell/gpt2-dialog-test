"__BASEBALL__ Boy the Mets are really spiraling out of control."
"__BASEBALL__ They have looked horrible lately."
"__BASEBALL__ yeah everything seems to have fell apart for this team"
"__BASEBALL__ These guys have lost 7 in a row."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah and 8 out of their last 10"
"__BASEBALL__ It doesn't get any easier because they have to face an Angels team with Mike Trout"
"__BASEBALL__ Well they have DeGrom on the mound tonight, maybe they can get a win."
"__BASEBALL__ They desperately need it. Right now they are 8 1/2 games behind the Nationals"
"__BASEBALL__ They can't worry about the Nationals right now. They have to worry about not dropping to last place"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, things had started out so well for this team this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they were 0-6 this last road trip. Abysmal."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah and they are going up against Trout who has hit 5 home runs in 6 games"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah this couldn't be worse for the Mets"
"__BASEBALL__ I smell another loss coming to this team."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe they can right the ship. It is still early in the season and anything can happen."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe you are correct, but they better start turning this thing around fast."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they have definitely looked like a underachieving ball club."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly and their pitching has left a lot to be desired."
"__BASEBALL__ Their startes are not giving them quality innings right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Nope. And I fear more of the same tonight."
