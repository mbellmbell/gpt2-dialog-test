"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that kids movie Sing?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't yet, but it looked cute. Did you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did, I watched it with my son the other night."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really cute. There's a ton of music and singing."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think Annie would like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's perfect for young kids."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, I'll have to rent that this weekend"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely, you won't be disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, thanks for letting me know."
"__MOVIES__ No problem, you'll have to let me know how much she likes it."
"__MOVIES__ Will do. We might also rent Secret Life of Pets"
"__MOVIES__ Don't bother with that movie, it starts off really cute, but it's turns really dark."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really, how so?"
"__MOVIES__ In the middle of the movie when two of the pets get lost in the city they get captured by pets who take about killing humans."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously? That's a children's movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, we were shocked, we ended up turning it off because we didn't want Johnny watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah no doubt, well I guess we'll skip that. That's not appropriate at all."
"__MOVIES__ No definitely not. Just stick with Sing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's the going to be the plan, thanks!"
