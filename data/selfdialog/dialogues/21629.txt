"__DISNEY__ Yeah.  It's just kind of a bad franchise to be honest."
"__DISNEY__ It just lacks the emotion of normal Pixar movies."

"__DISNEY__ Without Paul Newman, it also feels a bit incomplete."
"__DISNEY__ Not to mention that the race car driving angle is played out."
"__DISNEY__ At least the ride at Disneyland is cool."
"__DISNEY__ I hope I can go someday!"
