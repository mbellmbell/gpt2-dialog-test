"__THRILLER__ So, how was that western thriller starring Clint Eastwood's son? Have you seen it yet?"
"__THRILLER__ I have actually. It wasn't as good as I expected."
"__THRILLER__ That's what I've been hearing. What's the problem, though?"
"__THRILLER__ The story is a bit confusing and just plain under-developed,"
"__THRILLER__ Well, was Scott Eastwood as good as his father then?"
"__THRILLER__ He's a decent actor. I don't know if he's as good as Clint."
"__THRILLER__ I guess I'll wait to watch in when it comes on cable."
"__THRILLER__ That's a good idea."
"__THRILLER__ I was looking forward to seeing a decent western."
"__THRILLER__ Go re-watch Unforgiven."
