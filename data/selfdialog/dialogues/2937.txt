"__MUSIC__ Hey dude, have you heard of Prong?"
"__MUSIC__ Prong? No, not really."
"__MUSIC__ You might like them, they're not really well known though."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do they do?"
"__MUSIC__ It's like progressive metal I would say, but it's only three guys who do it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, that's impressive."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and they've got a real full and nice sound too for just the three of them."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know any of the band members?"
"__MUSIC__ No I don't. I know one guy does the guitar and singing, but that's about it."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, that's ok. What's some of their good stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I like a lot of stuff off of Power of the Damager."
"__MUSIC__ That's a fun name."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it's got pretty gruesome artwork, too. Some really good songs off of there."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Looking for Them a lot, I wish I could play it myself."
"__MUSIC__ What else is good?"
"__MUSIC__ I Beg to Differ is good, but I think that's a different album."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds really aggressive with those titles."
"__MUSIC__ It's very aggressive, it's very angry and it sounds like he sings through a mask."
"__MUSIC__ Ooh, scary. I might like it though."
