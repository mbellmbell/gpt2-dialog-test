"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, looking forward to the NFL season starting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, last year was really good. I'm hoping for more good games this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough though, I'm a 49ers fan and it's painful to watch them lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch, yeah. They'll pull it together eventually, they always come back around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Meanwhile I've been enjoying the Patriots a lot. I jumped right on that bandwagon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right at the Super Bowl? Man, you couldn't have picked a less likely time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, I've actually been following them for a couple of seasons, since the 49ers have been sucking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've been putting on some great football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I couldn't believe they pulled out that win at the super bowl though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, history making plays right there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What an upset."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not as upsetting as the halftime show maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, yeah, but some of it was alright."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had kind of given up on the game by that point. If it isn't close, I just lose interest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was still interested, but it was hurting. After all I've been through with the 49ers the past few years, I didn't want to get crushed so hard again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It had to be rough for the Falcons and their fans though man, I tell you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it would have been cool to see them win a super bowl there. But I was Patriots all the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't have a dog in the fight, so I just wanted a good game. The first half didn't deliver, but that second half had me on the edge of my seat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, we probably won't get anything like that this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there could be some really good games regardless. Here's to your 49ers finding their way back to the path of champions."
