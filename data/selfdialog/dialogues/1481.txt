"__MUSIC__ Do you remember Jason Mraz?"
"__MUSIC__ I love him man. I have almost all of his records."
"__MUSIC__ Well I think he is going to launch some new stuff soon. He is posting a bunch of new videos on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome I have to see them!"
"__MUSIC__ Wait, but they're not videos of new songs; it is just him talking and making jokes."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so you are just guessing that he will came with something new soom?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Because I follow him on YouTube and he hadn't posted anything in a while and now he is trying to get viewers all of a sudden."
"__MUSIC__ Well I do hope you are right."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I want to hear some new things by him."
"__MUSIC__ He is a one of a kind musician. His style is so fresh."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Few can do it like him."
"__MUSIC__ But you know, I think I liked him better in his older albums."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Meaning until 'We sing. We Dance. We Steal Things'."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Even the next album, 'Love Is A Four Letter Word' had a couple of very good songs, but the best were in the previous ones."
"__MUSIC__ He was a bit more loose and upbeat."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I loved when he put tons of words into a single verse and just gave the whole thing an awesome style."
"__MUSIC__ I loved that too. Now a days he is a bit more mellow."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Still an unbelievable artist though."
"__MUSIC__ No doubt about it. We'll have to keep our eyes open for any bit of new music from him."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Let me know as soon as you hear something."
