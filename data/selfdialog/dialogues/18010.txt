"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you see the new Robert Langdon movie? I rented it On Demand last night."
"__MOVIES__ Inferno? Yes I saw it when it first came out in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think it was as great as the others. So much was left out of the book or changed."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's Hollywood for you. The book is really thick, they can't fit all of that in a two hour movie."
"__MOVIES__ It isn't just that. The ending was changed, and it completely transformed the meaning of the movie as well as the book."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't read the book, what was the different ending about?"
"__MOVIES__ I'll tell you but I don't want to spoil it for you, if you're going to read the book later."
"__MOVIES__ I just saw the movie. Why would I bother reading the book when I know all the essential details?"
"__MOVIES__ Like I just said, the book is an entirely different beast with a completely different ending."
"__MOVIES__ So tell me about it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you asked for it. For one thing, you know how at the end of the movie they stop the virus from being released on humanity?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I remember that."
"__MOVIES__ Well in the book, they don't actually stop the virus. The plague is unleashed on mankind."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, so you mean the world ends?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not at all. That's another thing. In the movie, the plague is a deadly virus that destroys the world as we know it."
"__MOVIES__ So in the book it's not deadly?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all. Nobody dies, and in fact only a small percentage of humanity contracts the virus."
"__MOVIES__ What is the virus then?"
"__MOVIES__ Infertility. It renders just enough of the population unable to reproduce, enough to solve the world's population problem.."
