"__MUSIC__ Do you consider U2 Classic Rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Depends on their catalogue."
"__MUSIC__ Well since they are still performing can their music be played as such?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure but I dont know if I would play all U2 songs."
"__MUSIC__ So would you say the Joshua Tree is now on play at classic rock stations?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely though its hard to believe."
"__MUSIC__ I remember when they first burst onto the scene."
"__MUSIC__ I belive they can be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame soon if not already."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think you have to wait 25 years from a first record release."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely satisfy that requirement."
"__MUSIC__ Alot of bands can be inducted into that hall of fame nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy to think."
"__MUSIC__ Well as we get older, theres nothing you can do."
"__MUSIC__ I dont see their music as classic rock though."
"__MUSIC__ Sure you dont, I actually do though."
"__MUSIC__ I think classic rock has a certain sound."
"__MUSIC__ No one sets out to play that kind of music."
"__MUSIC__ So you think it evolves?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think you just get it from having longevity."
