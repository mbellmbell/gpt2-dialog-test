"__THRILLER__ Do you like scary movies or thrillers more?"
"__THRILLER__ Honestly? Thrillers, because I'm a huge baby about scary stuff. Why?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I'm just looking for recommendations for good thrillers from, like, the past 10-20 years."
"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see any of the Jason Bourne movies?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I didn't like them too much though. They all feel like the same movie: generic dude being chased by spies..."
"__THRILLER__ I guess so. I still think they're fun, though. What about Fast and Furious?"
"__THRILLER__ Totally, love 'em!"
"__THRILLER__ No offense, but that seems a little ironic. Those movies are the definition of generic, aren't they?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, but they're so-bad-they're-good status, you know? And still exciting the way thrillers should be."
"__THRILLER__ I guess that's fair."
