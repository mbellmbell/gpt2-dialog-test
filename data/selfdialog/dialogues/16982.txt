"__MOVIES__ I don't understand the hate for Iron Man 3."
"__MOVIES__ You must have never read the comic books."
"__MOVIES__ I've read them. I know all about The Mandarin guy."
"__MOVIES__ Then you know how they screwed up the story."
"__MOVIES__ I don't agree with that. I think they made it more interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I don't see how."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, you're missing the broader point the director made."
"__MOVIES__ And what's that?"
"__MOVIES__ The whole story is an example of the war on terror today."
"__MOVIES__ What gives you that idea?"
"__MOVIES__ The fake Mandarin was an actor; someone used to push an agenda."
"__MOVIES__ You're talking about conspiracies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it makes perfect sense and it fits right in to what I've heard over the years."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well. They should have used another villain to make their point about world politics."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. Is there going to be another Iron Man movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. He's in the next Spider-Man movie and Avengers."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I was hoping the writers would introduce a proper Mandarin villain for the fans."
"__MOVIES__ I think they should quit while they're ahead."
"__MOVIES__ Can't please everyone, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ They could if they actually read the comics."
