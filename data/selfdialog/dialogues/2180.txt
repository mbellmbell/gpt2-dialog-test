"__MUSIC__ Do you like AC/DC?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, but I think they're a bit cliche by now."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, they've definitely been used to death in movies."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're still using Back in Black in like all of the family movies coming out."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, that one or Highway to Hell."
"__MUSIC__ I'm very tired of hearing those two songs."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. They should play some of the other ones."
"__MUSIC__ Like which ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Hell's Bells would be good, or Dirty Deeds."
"__MUSIC__ I like Dirty Deeds a lot."
"__MUSIC__ That one is one of my favorites, the singer gets very silly here and there."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I liked how he seemed to have fun with it."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely had a huge influence on the music community though."
"__MUSIC__ That's for sure, they proved a lot of things."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they proved that you don't have to have a lot of technical skill as a musician to write good music."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's true, their guitarist tends to play simpler stuff or at least writes simpler stuff."
"__MUSIC__ They do say that less is more."
"__MUSIC__ True, though sometimes it is nice to have a very complicated guitar riff in rock music."
"__MUSIC__ As long as it's musically tasteful I don't care what they write."
