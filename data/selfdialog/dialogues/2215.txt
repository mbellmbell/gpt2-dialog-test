"__MUSIC__ So who do you think is going to dominate the Grammy's this year?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a good question. There are a lot of people to choose from."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, we've had some good songs by Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Lorde..."
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift might still be happening this year too."
"__MUSIC__ Very true. It's been a few years since she last had an album out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and she put the duet with Zayn out this year. Maybe to test the waters?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. I think it was to see how people responded to her still."
"__MUSIC__ True. I would love to see how Justin Bieber does with all of the big hits he's had this year,"
"__MUSIC__ Despacito... I'm the One... He's definitely had some good ones to choose from."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and without Adele this year, it could be his time."
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget about Ed Sheeran. I think he has a very good shot to dominate."
"__MUSIC__ Agree with that too. Shape of You was massive, and he has some good hits from his album."
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't too crazy for the album, there was about five songs I really liked but the rest I couldn't get into."
"__MUSIC__ Which ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Happier, Perfect, Supermarket Flowers, Save Myself, and Shape of You."
"__MUSIC__ What about Castle on the Hill?"
"__MUSIC__ It's alright. I liked it at first but I'm not as crazy now."
"__MUSIC__ I see."
"__MUSIC__ I'm just excited to see what all goes down."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!"
