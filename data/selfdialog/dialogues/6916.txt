"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, do you think that Jar Jar is a Sith?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why would you think he's a Sith?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There's a theory going around that he is."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do the theory's say?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, if you look at his eyes, they look just like a Sith's?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean because they're yellow?  Go on."
"__STAR_WARS__ And in one of the films he uses a force jump, even though he doesn't use the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ People may be onto something."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, just imagine if when the new films come out he's a Sith lord!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't imagine peoples' reactions!  What if the annoying voice was just an act?"
