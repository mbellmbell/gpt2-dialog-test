"__MOVIES__ What would you say is the best live-action musical movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Ahh, live action. So you're disqualifying all the Disney movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, got to get rid of those. I know how much you like them."
"__MOVIES__ OK, if you take those off the table, it's harder. Maybe the new Les Miserables?"
"__MOVIES__ You liked it that much, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good! I had only a few complaints."
"__MOVIES__ Such as?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the biggest one was casting Russell Crowe as Javert. Russell Crowe is a great actor, but the man can't sing well!"
"__MOVIES__ I remember that. His voice was distractingly weak."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not saying every other character had the voice of an opera singer, but at least their voices were clearly above average."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm kind of surprised you picked that movie, given that some of the musical numbers were a little shaky."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely helps that I love the stories and songs to begin with, from the stage productions."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting, because it could go two ways. You could like it for that reason, or you could dislike the movie because it doesn't hold up to the previous stage productions."
"__MOVIES__ In this case, I think the movie format brought a lot of good stuff to the table."
"__MOVIES__ You mean, in terms of the costumes and sets?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was heightened realism vs. the play experience."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention, singing aside, those were some mighty fine actors!"
"__MOVIES__ No argument, they were all top notch. I can't disagree too much with your pick."
"__MOVIES__ But I'd still pick a bunch of Disney movies over it!"
