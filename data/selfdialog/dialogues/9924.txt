"__COMEDY__ Yeah. I saw it.  I didn't know he directed that one."

"__COMEDY__ What did he make after that?"
"__COMEDY__ Life Stinks, about a guy who becomes homeless, and then Robin Hood: Men in Tights."
"__COMEDY__ You didn't like Men in Tights?"
"__COMEDY__ I thought it stunk!  I couldn't even finish it the first time."
"__COMEDY__ I thought it was hilarious!  All the guys in the musical number?"
"__COMEDY__ I wanted to like it but it was just so dull."
"__COMEDY__ You don't know what you're missing."
