"__MUSIC__ What do you think of pop music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really like it that much, but some songs are good."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you like it that much?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of pop just feels stale to me, like it's been done before."
"__MUSIC__ I think some songs are definitely like that."
"__MUSIC__ I think almost all pop is like that really, it just feels so cheap and manufactured."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes. What are some of the good songs that you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like some Taylor Swift stuff, she has written some good melodies that are really catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Most people like her I think."
"__MUSIC__ I would say so, she's very popular."
"__MUSIC__ Are there any other pop songs you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Not that I can think of, at least not from what they regularly play on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that. The radio tends to play about the same 50 pop songs all day long."
"__MUSIC__ You just get tired of hearing the same ones over and over again."
"__MUSIC__ I get tired of some of them, but I don't mind hearing the good ones again and again."
"__MUSIC__ Do you feel like good pop is rare?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think a lot of it is good. I think it's more of us being exposed to so much good pop that we expect everything to follow the same trends."
"__MUSIC__ You might be on to something there."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's probably what the problem is with people getting bored of it."
"__MUSIC__ I think a lot of pop artists don't have much experience writing good songs."
