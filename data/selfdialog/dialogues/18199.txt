"__MOVIES__ Have you watched any of the Harry Potter movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't, but I read the books.  Did they live up to the hype?"
"__MOVIES__ Definately, of course the books were better."
"__MOVIES__ I really like waiting until after I read all of the books to watch a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ I like to envision my own characters and who would play each part before I watch the movie so I don't have the movie character in my head the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you mean; who were your favorite characters?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite characters were the Weasley's.  How did they portray them in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think they did a great job and picking out characters for them. Although the movie didn't give them as much of a story line as the books."
"__MOVIES__ That's a little disappointing.  Who played Harry Potter?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe you didn't know that Daniel Radcliffe played Harry Potter."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I've really had my head in the sand when it comes to the movie."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite character was Hagrid."
"__MOVIES__ Did he have his dog in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but he was only in a few scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I bet Hagrid was impressive on screen."
"__MOVIES__ Yes he was, big and burly, but so sweet."
"__MOVIES__ What about the bad guys?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Malfoy was my least favorite actor in the series, and Professor Snape was my favorite.  Even though he wasn't evil, I wondered until the very end if he really was.  And of course Lord Voltemort had everyone on edge."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like I need to catch up with the times.  Maybe I'll see if I can have a netflix marathon this weekend and see what all of the fuss is about."
