"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. The Spurs had a strong lead but lost it after Kawhi Leonard got injured in the third quarter."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yikes. What kind of injury?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He hurt his ankle and had to sit out the rest of the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's too bad. How did Steph Curry do in this game?"
