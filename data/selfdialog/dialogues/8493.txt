"__BEATLES__ It's interesting how the Beatle's music changed after Yoko got involved with Lennon."
"__BEATLES__ Interesting and sad."
"__BEATLES__ To me, the music got less about talent and performance and more feeling driving."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it seemed to wander quite a bit."
"__BEATLES__ And then McCartney seemed to go his own way - he kept his talent up."
"__BEATLES__ I was listening to some of his post Beatles music and it was just as good, it seemed, as the classic Beatle hits."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it's hard to know. At their peak they were insanely popular."
"__BEATLES__ I heard when they came to the States, they had tours with hardly any breaks between showings."
"__BEATLES__ That's crazy! How did they manage?"
"__BEATLES__ Drugs, would be my guess. That and youth!"
