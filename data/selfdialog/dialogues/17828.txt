"__MOVIES__ O.K. last week at our movie discussion lunch, we decided to forget The Circle and discuss good Tom Hanks films."
"__MOVIES__ I'm in."
"__MOVIES__ So what's your favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Forrest Gump."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess he's really associated with that part, but what about Philadelphia; he won an oscar for that."
"__MOVIES__ He won for Forrest Gump, too."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I don't remember that.  He was nominated for Cast Away."
"__MOVIES__ Really, did the volleyball get any recognition?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha, ha--I think he was also nominated for Saving Private Ryan."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see that; I tend to stay away from violent movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what did you think about Sully."
"__MOVIES__ Missed that, too."
"__MOVIES__ What have you seen lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Captain Phillips and  Bridge of Spies--both pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, not classics, but solid."
"__MOVIES__ You know one I really enjoyed was the Da Vinci Code."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was good, but I don't know if it was because of him."
"__MOVIES__ I agree--the material was so compelling that a lot of actors might have done well with it."
"__MOVIES__ Hanks is an icon, though."
"__MOVIES__ I know some ladies that have loved him since Bosom Buddies."
