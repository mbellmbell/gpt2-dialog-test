"__MUSIC__ Is it just me, or has it been a while since Taylor Swift released a new song?"
"__MUSIC__ I hadn't really thought about it. She's done a few singles with people but when is the last time she released an album?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was in 2014. That's when 1989 was released, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow! Was it really that long ago! It feels like that album was just released a few months ago."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it had so many awesome songs on it. I think Wildest Dreams was my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I thought that one was good but it wasn't in my top 3."
"__MUSIC__ What's your top three from that album?"
"__MUSIC__ Blank Space, Style, and This Love."
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember This Love."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it wasn't a very popular one. i don't think it even made the top charts. But it was a really sweet song."
"__MUSIC__ She also did a lot of music videos for that album. She always has great ones."
"__MUSIC__ Did you see Bad Blood? SHe had so many celebrities help with it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Selena Gomez was in it, I love her. Also Gigi Hadid and Zendaya and many more."
"__MUSIC__ It was truly a star-studded music video."
"__MUSIC__ I still like her old songs, too. Especially when she was still in the country genre."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, her older albums of country music are still gold. There were so many good breakup songs."
"__MUSIC__ Especially Picture to Burn. I still sing that one all the time."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if she will ever release anything country again."
"__MUSIC__ She might, but probably not as a popular album piece. Maybe as a special or single or something."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's true. As long as she keeps making albums, I'll be happy."
