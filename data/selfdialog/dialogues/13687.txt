"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think is the best player in the NBA right now."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think I have to go with Russel Westbrook."
"__BASKETBALL__ Really? He had a great season but he's a ball hog."
"__BASKETBALL__ But he averaged a triple double this season. No one has done that since Oscar Robertson."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes I understand that. But Lebron is Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron also has a team full of stars. It's only Russ on the Thunder."
"__BASKETBALL__ But Russ doesn't have a championship mentality . That's why KD left."
"__BASKETBALL__ KD just wanted a ring. If he would have stayed on the Thunder his time was coming."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but he didn't want to get older and have to team travel in order to get a ring. He looks good with the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Realistic though Russ is by far the best in the league. Look at his stats."
"__BASKETBALL__ Stats don't get you wins."
"__BASKETBALL__ True but he's having an historical season. We might not see this in our lifetime again."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know. I just think that the Thunder are just letting Russ get these stats."
"__BASKETBALL__ Have you even seen the Thunder play this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No!! But I been watching highlights on ESPN."
"__BASKETBALL__ My point exactly. I have the NBA league Pass. We can watch the game when they play the Heat and you will realize his skill."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't get me wrong I like Russ like I said but I'm not interested in one man basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ You know he's average a triple double in points, rebounds and assist right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes I am aware of that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well how can you play one man ball if you are averaging more than 10 assist a game?"
