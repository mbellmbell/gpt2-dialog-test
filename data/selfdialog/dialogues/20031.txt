"__MOVIES__ I need to find another movie to watch! I am constantly watching 'Interstellar' by Christopher Nolan."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was absolutely fascinating! It doesn't sound like I've seen it as many times as you but I enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when it was released I went and saw it in Imax. It made the movie so much more enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ I was unable to see it at a theater but I did see it on DVD."
"__MOVIES__ I learned a lot about our universe watching this movie and I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and Jessica Chastain."
"__MOVIES__ I have seen the majority of Christopher Nolan movies and he really does a great job with his movies. I am looking forward to Dunkirk coming out soon."
"__MOVIES__ Man, that looks like another great movie and one I will definitely go see in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ This movie takes place in World War II. Its another war movie but the is a genre I like to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Lone Survivor and American Sniper are some of my favorite war movies."
"__MOVIES__ Those all have been great movies in general and 'Dunkirk' should be just as good!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, That movie wont be out for a while but I finally got to see 'La La Land'"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Wonderfully done, great music, great actors. I can see why this movie won so many awards this year."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that. I didnt see anyone else beating Emma Stone for best actress this year at the Academy Awards."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Ryan Gosling would win as well but that doesnt take away from how great this movie was overall."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I really enjoyed how Emma Stone played a struggling actress named Mia. The scenes where she went into audition seemed to be spot on with what I would imagine that experience to be!"
"__MOVIES__ She has come a long way since her first movie appearance in Superbad. I think she has a great career ahead"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and I didnt know Ryan Gosling knew how to play the piano but he sure learned how and pulled it off quite well!"
"__MOVIES__ The summer season for movies has started. This is a part of the year I always look forward to and this weekend I will be going to see 'Baby Driver.'"
"__MOVIES__ Let me know what you think of that movie. I have never missed a Jamie Foxx movie. I will let you know what I think of the new Transformers movie as well since I will be seeing that on Friday."
