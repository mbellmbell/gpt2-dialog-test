"__MOVIES__ Over the weekend I binge watched all of the Indiana Jones movies."
"__MOVIES__ I love those movies. Did you know they're making another one?"
"__MOVIES__ Really? When?"
"__MOVIES__ It's due to come out in 2019."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I can wait that long. Do you know of any other movies that are like Indiana Jones?"
"__MOVIES__ You would probably like the Tomb Raider movies. They star Angelina Jolie."
"__MOVIES__ I saw those a long time ago."
"__MOVIES__ There's also Romancing the Stone and it's sequel The Jewel of the Nile."
"__MOVIES__ Who stars in those?"
"__MOVIES__ Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito."
"__MOVIES__ If Danny Devito is in it, it must have some humor."
"__MOVIES__ It does. There's also the Crocodile Dundee trilogy that stars Paul Hogan."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of him."
"__MOVIES__ Those are the only movies I know of with him."
"__MOVIES__ Someone else I know recommended a movie called sahara."
"__MOVIES__ That was a good movie. Not exactly the same genre, but it is adventurous."
"__MOVIES__ I still can't believe Harrison Ford is doing another Indiana Jones movie. I mean, he's getting up there in age."
"__MOVIES__ I know.He;s currently 74 years old."
"__MOVIES__ He must have a lot of energy to make another one of those."
"__MOVIES__ He sure must."
