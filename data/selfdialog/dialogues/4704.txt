"__MUSIC__ Didn't you see India Arie in concert last year?"
"__MUSIC__ I did! She has such good music."
"__MUSIC__ Where did you see her at?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw her in Sydney, Australia. Why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I won two tickets to see her the other day on a radio station."
"__MUSIC__ Get out! You're not even familiar with her music are you?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I was going to see if you wanted the tickets."
"__MUSIC__ I will totally take those tickets. You could come with me."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I do not know any of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you can listen to some of her music before the concert."
"__MUSIC__ That is a good idea. I can stream some of her songs on my phone."
"__MUSIC__ When is the concert."
"__MUSIC__ It is next Thursday at 8:00 PM."
"__MUSIC__ That blows. I have to work!"
"__MUSIC__ Can you try to get rid of your shift?"
"__MUSIC__ For India Arie, I will call in sick."
"__MUSIC__ I think you should at least get rid of your shift before you call in."
"__MUSIC__ Don't worry, I will. Let me see your phone."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you want to see my phone?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I am going to find some of her best songs so you can become familiar with her music."
