"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the movie Dirty Dancing?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, with Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. It was one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ It was a good movie. The love scenes were pretty tame compared to today's movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably true. They seemed to have a lot of chemistry though."
"__MOVIES__ They did but I read somewhere they didn't like each other very much."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if they didn't like each other they sure were good actors, they had me fooled."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah those dance scenes were pretty steamy. I think everyone wanted to be Jennifer Grey."
"__MOVIES__ I know I did. I had the old VHS tape of it and I must have watched it a hundred times."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a lot. I don't think I have watched anything a hundred times."
"__MOVIES__ Even today when a song comes on from the movie, I can picture what was happening."
"__MOVIES__ Hunh, its like you don't have to watch the movie anymore. You can just picture it in your mind."
"__MOVIES__ I can but its still nice to see it once in a while when it comes on TV."
"__MOVIES__ The original hasn't been on for awhile but I did see they made a remake of it that was on a few weeks ago. Did you watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched a little of it, it was pretty boring. There was no chemistry between the two main characters and they changed some of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't watch it but I heard it was a flop. I think they changed it too much."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway I got a 30th Anniversary set for my birthday. There's a script in there, the DVD, a movie poster, a little purse, and a room key. There is all kinds of things that came with it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that sounds like you should host a movie night for some of your friends. It might be nice to watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ That does sound like fun. Maybe I will do that."
"__MOVIES__ I know I would love to see Patrick Swayze in action again. He never goes out of style."
