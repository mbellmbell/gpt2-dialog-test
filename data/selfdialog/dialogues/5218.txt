"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I've always felt that the Fast & Furious films have had great settings."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I can agree with that. The settings always add so much more to the movie overall."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Absolutely. Do you have a favorite?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes. For me, it's Tokyo Drift."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I wanted to say that too! I thought seeing them race through the streets of Japan looked absolutely gorgeous."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You took the words from my mouth there. It was a great experience."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you have a second place for setting?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, because I absolutely love Dubai, I'm going to say Furious 7."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ But that movie wasn't only in Dubai."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's true, but the time that they were in Dubai was great, I thought."
