"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Alien 3?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and I never quite understood the universal hatred for it."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither. I think it is full of good ideas and it's an interesting take on the series."
"__MOVIES__ And David Fincher's visual style is amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember first seeing it and knowing I wanted to see more from Fincher."
"__MOVIES__ So why do you think it's so universally despised?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's becasue it's so different from Aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, people wanted more shoot 'em action like in Cameron's version."
"__MOVIES__ And Alien 3 is very deliberately paced, which of ocurse if frowned upon in Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ But that's why I like it. Have you seen the Assembled Cut?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually just watched it last week. I thought that cut greatly improved the film."
"__MOVIES__ I was surprised by how different the opening was."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, it did a much better job of setting the stage with stark visuals."
"__MOVIES__ I also preferred the alien gestating in the ox rather than the dog."
"__MOVIES__ It was cooler, that's for sure. I also always thought the acting was so good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's a great mix of underacting and overacting that works becasue of the setting."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know Sigourney Weaver only agreed to do the movie if there were no guns?"
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting. It definitley made them go a different way from the second one."
"__MOVIES__ I think it made the writers think more about the world so they could make it work."
"__MOVIES__ And as a result they created a great sci-fi film that doesn't get its due."
