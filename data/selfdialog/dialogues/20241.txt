"__MOVIES__ Did you see the move 'The Interview?'"
"__MOVIES__ No, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  I loved it!"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that movie only successful because of the controversy surrounding it?"
"__MOVIES__ That's what I was expecting which is why I avoided seeing it at first."
"__MOVIES__ But you didn't think that was the case?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all.  It was a hilarious, stand-alone comedy.  It didn't need all the hype."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in that movie again?"
"__MOVIES__ Seth Rogen and James Franco."
"__MOVIES__ I know Franco is one of you all-time favorites, but I thought you hated all Rogen films."
"__MOVIES__ I usually do but this movie wasn't 'cheesy' like the other films he's in."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Franco just in another film that came out more recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was called 'Why Him.'"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  I had lower expectations for that one too but it was great."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't one of those movies where they show all the funny parts in the previews?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that's what I was expecting but it was much better than that."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ I ended up buying both of them so you could borrow them if you want."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, thanks!"
