"__MOVIES__ Remember the original Christopher Reeve Superman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I loved him as Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Much better than today's movies.  I didn't care for Man of Steel."
"__MOVIES__ Plus Gene Hackman as Lex Luther was good."
"__MOVIES__ He brought a lot of comedy to the role."
"__MOVIES__ Which was nice for the time period it was made in."
"__MOVIES__ It was a little silly when Superman went backwards around the world to turn back time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was.  They shouldn't have killed Lois in the first place."
"__MOVIES__ Other than that it was a pretty solid movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and the score by John Williams was good too."
"__MOVIES__ Any time I think Superman I hear that song in my head."
"__MOVIES__ I actually think the new guy is pretty good as Superman the movies are just bad."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I hope Justice league is better."
"__MOVIES__ I hope he's in it.  He died in Batman vs Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Well we know he didn't die, but the DC Universe doesn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ And at some time they'll have to bring in Green Lantern."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and not the poorly done Ryan Reynalds thing either."
"__MOVIES__ Which I believe is not part of DCEU."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're right."
