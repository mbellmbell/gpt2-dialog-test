"__BASKETBALL__ Did you watch the game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Which game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Warriors and the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh.  No, I didn't catch it.  Who won?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Warriors, 120 to 108."
"__BASKETBALL__ Nice.  They're really slaying the Spurs this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah.  This is game 3, and they're undefeated this conference."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the Spurs weren't fantastic this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ What?  The Spurs had a great season!  That's how they made it to the conference."
"__BASKETBALL__ I admit they've been okay, but they haven't been great this year.  They're not the Celtics or anything like that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Fine, they're not the Celtics.  But the Spurs have had a good season!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm just not feeling that.  I think they got into the Western Conference on a fluke."
"__BASKETBALL__ They're second in their division!  They beat the Rockets, Clippers.."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but they didn't beat the Warriors, did they?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Fine. They didn't beat the Warriors, yet.  We've still got a couple of games to go."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, fine.  When's the next game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Monday, the 22nd.  It's in Oakland."
"__BASKETBALL__ They'd better win it, otherwise their season is going to end early."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah.  We'll see what happens."
"__BASKETBALL__ That we will."
