"__THRILLER__ Scared you that much huh."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that top view shot they do whenthe shark swims next to the boat and its as long as the boat, that scared me to death."
"__THRILLER__ Were gonna need a bigger boat."
"__THRILLER__ Exactly.  Or when the woman is swimming at the beginning and gets dragged ever all over before being pulled under."
"__THRILLER__ You know they did that scene by tieing ropes around her waist and pulling her back and forth to make it look real."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I saw the documentry about it.  Didn't make it any less scary."
