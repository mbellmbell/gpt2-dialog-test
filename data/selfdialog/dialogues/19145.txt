"__MOVIES__ Do you prefer watching movies or listening to music?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I definitely prefer watching movies. I have a big collection at home."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Any classic comedy, but my all-time favorite is Little Shop of Horrors."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the movie with the talking plant?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I love the musical version, but also the older one."
"__MOVIES__ There's another version aside from the one with Rick Moranis?"
"__MOVIES__ Indeed, it was originally a black and white pulpy horror film from the early 1960s."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know that! Who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was directed by Roger Corman. He's somewhat a cult figure in the world of B-movies."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the musical version and liked it. Reminds me of Labyrinth."
"__MOVIES__ I love Labyrinth! Bowie was brilliant in it."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Who played that girl, though?"
"__MOVIES__ That girl was a young Jennifer Connelly."
"__MOVIES__ She did a great job in that film."
"__MOVIES__ She really did, but Jim Henson's puppets really stole the show."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Labyrinth in the theatres recently."
"__MOVIES__ Really? But it came out in the 1980s!"
"__MOVIES__ They did a double feature with Dark Crystal."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like it must have been a really wild night!"
