"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie, 'Bridesmaids'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's a good movie. Very funny."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of my favorites. What types of movies are you into?"
"__MOVIES__ I like a little bit of everything. You?"
"__MOVIES__ Same here. Do you like horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do, but they can't be gory. I am more into the suspense parts of the horror films."
"__MOVIES__ So I'm guessing you didn't like any of the 'Saw' films?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not at all. Way too gory for me."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie, 'Would you Rather?'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. That movie was crazy. So crazy."
"__MOVIES__ It really was. And the ending was intense."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think she'd shoot the guy. I really didn't."
"__MOVIES__ I thought she would. She had been through so much already, what else was there to lose?"
"__MOVIES__ And when her brother committed suicide? Unbelievable."
"__MOVIES__ I know! So crazy!"
"__MOVIES__ I had trouble watching the drowning in the barrel part."
"__MOVIES__ He didn't even let her hold her breath first! He just pushed her right into it!"
"__MOVIES__ I know!"
"__MOVIES__ There were so many people, you would think they could have all escaped."
"__MOVIES__ They tried. The other guys had weapons, though."
