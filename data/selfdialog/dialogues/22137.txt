"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah? What inspired that?"
"__DISNEY__ I overheard a conversation about the soundtrack earlier."
"__DISNEY__ It does have some great songs! And some great catch phrases."
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't one of the songs a big radio hit?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think so. Some famous singer made it super popular."
"__DISNEY__ And it's such a sad movie, but Simba succeeds."
"__DISNEY__ He does. Even despite the untimely death of Mufasa."
