"__STAR_WARS__ Want to come over and watch 'Rogue One' this weekend? I just got it on DVD."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, that movie was awesome! I'd love to see it again."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite scene?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, that's a tough one, there was so much to like in that movie. I'd have to go with the Darth Vader scene at the end of the movie though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, that was something else. I don't think I even breathed during that scene, it was so intense!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right? Darth Vader is such a great villain. His storyline throughout the series is one of my favorites!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, such a great character. I did like many of the new characters in 'Rogue One' though too, even if they didn't make it past the end of the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Jynn and Cassian were great leads."
"__STAR_WARS__ And who could forget K2-SO! Haha"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, he was the best and really brought up some great dialogue between the main group of rebels."
