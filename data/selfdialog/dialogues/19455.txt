"__MOVIES__ Did you enjoy Perks of Being a Wallflower more then the Spectacular Now?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough question. I liked both movies a lot. Those two are probably my favorite current Coming of Age movies in our modern time."
"__MOVIES__ I was having this debate with my cousin and he says Spectacular Now was such a superior movie with Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller."
"__MOVIES__ I think I liked Perks of Being a Wallflower a little bit more. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller had such great chemistry and they all had really good character backgrounds and growth throughout the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm in the middle. I can't really decide, both were exceptional movies. I felt with The Spectacular Now, Miles and Shailene's performances were so good, plus it had Brie Larson too."
"__MOVIES__ Brie played Miles ex-girlfriend right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she's more of a minor character but her character really sets forth the motivation for Miles character to grow up."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe the feel good moments in Perks of Being a Wallflower were more powerful for me. I remember feeling really good, victorious, free, when they played that song in the bridge scene."
"__MOVIES__ That was such an iconic moment. They played We Can Be Heroes from the Foo Fighters. It was a really uplifting scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was. I mean they struggled so much to overcome all their adversities. Logan had repressed issues from his past. Emma had relationship issues, Ezra had the coming out of the closet issues."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that dynamic but the Spectacular Now had Miles growing up from a class clown character to a mature adult from his relationship with Shailene."
"__MOVIES__ Shailene does really well in these Coming of Age movies. Have you seen her in White Bird in a Blizzard?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't. Is that the one with her and Eva Green."
"__MOVIES__ It's really good. It's a mystery. Her mother played by Eva Green disappears, and their relationship prior was bad, so she grows up without a mother but has the nagging thought of what happened to her mother in her mind throughout."
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing the trailer. You just reminded me that I need to watch it. I want to find out what happens in White Bird in a Blizzard."
"__MOVIES__ You'll really like it. It's a Coming of Age movie too, but a darker one. Shailenes really good in it."
"__MOVIES__ There have been so many good Coming of Age movies recently. Short Term 12 with Brie Larson, I would even say Room is somewhat of that too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you don't have to tell me twice. I feel Brie is probably the best young actress today."
"__MOVIES__ She did win an Oscar for best actress so you're right. She has the credentials and now she's appearing in everything notable."
"__MOVIES__ I really want to watch Glass Castle when it comes out starring Brie, it looks so good!"
