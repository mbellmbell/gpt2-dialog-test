"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I get asked that a lot but never have a good answer. Probably Juno."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool, that one is so funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the writing is really great. It won the Oscar for Best Screenplay."
"__MOVIES__ No way! Who wrote it?"
"__MOVIES__ Her name is Diablo Cody, she's super cool."
"__MOVIES__ That's so cool. I really like Ellen Page, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's so good. What's that new one she's in?"
"__MOVIES__ Flatliners, I think it's called."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That looks weird, but it's a cool concept."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, I can't really tell what genre they're going for."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither. It seems like horror for a lot of the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's probably it."
"__MOVIES__ Nina Dobrev is in it, too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, she's been in another creepy movie I think."
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called The Roommate, from 2011."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool, what's it rated?"
"__MOVIES__ PG-13, according to Wikipedia."
