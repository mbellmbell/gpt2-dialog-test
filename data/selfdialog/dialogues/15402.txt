"__HARRY_POTTER__ Seeing people like Neville and Luna develop in Dumbledore's army during the fifth movie is the best."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, I love seeing all the minor characters in the army like Cho, Padma and Seamus."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Cho seems like a really sweet character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It seems like Harry's really grown up when he finally kisses Cho."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I still like seeing Neville and Luna getting more confident platonically than the romantic relationships."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Everyone who watches the movie probably cheers for Neville as he gets stronger."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And when he kills the snake in the end of The Deathly Hallows.."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, that part is awesome."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You see him and Luna talking together in the end of the Deathly Hallows."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe they get together."
