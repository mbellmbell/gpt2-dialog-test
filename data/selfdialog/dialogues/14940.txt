"__ACTION__ What action movies do you recommend me to see this summer?"
"__ACTION__ Personally I'd recommend Wonder Woman."
"__ACTION__ I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to that movie. I really feel it's over hyped because it's a chick."
"__ACTION__ Honestly the movie is good, I won't lie to you it does a bit of the whole 'girl power' crap but not so much where you get turned off."
"__ACTION__ So what is the movie about? Origin story or something else?"
"__ACTION__ Yup it's basically just like the comics. Set in world war 2, meets that stranded pilot,etc. You know how the story goes."
"__ACTION__ So she helps end world war 2?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, well she basically ends it herself, but the guys help too."
"__ACTION__ Seriously? If it's overdone just let me know now so I don't waste my time."
"__ACTION__ No it's very enjoyable. You won't even think about all the girl power junk in it if you are a fan of the comic and character."
