"__HORROR__ I watched A Nightmare on Elm Street and I don't know if I should watch the sequels."
"__HORROR__ You definitely should! At least watch some of them. Especially Wes Craven's New Nightmare."
"__HORROR__ Is that the remake?"
"__HORROR__ No, it is a sequel after one of the times Freddy Krueger supposedly dies. But it is directed by Wes Craven, who also did the original."
"__HORROR__ If Kruger is dead, how can they make a sequel?"
"__HORROR__ This movie takes place in 'our' world, with the actors and even Wes Craven playing themselves. Even Robert Englund plays himself."
"__HORROR__ Whoa, that sounds meta! Does he still play Freddy or what?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, but the Freddy that appears isn't the same as the one in the first movie. It's scarier and less funny, the way Craven originally thought of it."
"__HORROR__ Is the same girl the main character?"
"__HORROR__ Heather Langenkamp is the lead, yeah, but she's an adult and is kind of tired of only being known for her role in the Nightmare movies."
