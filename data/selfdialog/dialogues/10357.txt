"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I am not really fond of rap music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really? Why's that?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think the rhymes are incredibly stupid, and the artists really mumble."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess you are right.  Is there anybody you like that raps."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know any of their names.  Usually, I am just telling my son to choose something different on the radio."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you heard of Nicki Minaj?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I have, and I actually like her.  She has some talent."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I like her too.  She can rap and sing."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you heard her sing with Drake and Lil Wayne?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know if I have, but I will look them up together and listen.  Nicki makes rap bearable."
