"__MUSIC__ Ok so... those are the scales Debussy used, Why are we talking about Debussy anyway?"
"__MUSIC__ Um... you asked about'modern music and who was the best, and I gave you my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.. I remember... ok continue"
"__MUSIC__ Sigh. Ok. So What set Debussy apart from his contemporaries, his scales, the use of bitonality...."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah explain that. you said bitonality isn't atonal."
"__MUSIC__ yes, and no, bitonal is not atonal. What would you say if you have to guess what bitonality is?"
"__MUSIC__ A tonality that is confused sexually?"
"__MUSIC__ That is just so mature. Whatelse?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Really I have no idea. I guess two tonalities. but what does that even mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's somwhat correct. Tonality refers to the centeredness ina musical piece."
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea what that even means."
"__MUSIC__ Yes you do. If you return to the center you feel the finality of the song. Like it's the end of the song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh... ok."
"__MUSIC__ That happens because you have returned to the tonal center in a tonal piece. Or the tonic note or the chord of the piece which is in a tonic key."
"__MUSIC__ hm... ok."
"__MUSIC__ Now in a bitonal piece, there are two tonal centers. How do yo think this is possible?"
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea. Use two tonic notes at the same time?"
"__MUSIC__ That's basically what it is. Bitonal pieces have two keys with two different tonic center at the same time, and aim to harmonize or contrast using the devices."
"__MUSIC__ Um... confusing."
"__MUSIC__ Like stravinsky's Petrushka uses C and F# major at the same time."
