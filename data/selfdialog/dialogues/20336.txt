"__MOVIES__ What do you think about comedy movies of today?"
"__MOVIES__ Not much. I don't really watch too many movies these days."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Not much time. Not much interest, and the movie industry has become too commercialized."
"__MOVIES__ I could see those things affecting your interest."
"__MOVIES__ Also, movies were more thoughtful and comedies were more hilarious years ago."
"__MOVIES__ How long ago?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say comedies from the 1980s and 1990s were much more thoughtful and funny than those that come out today."
"__MOVIES__ What movies from that time come to mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I would say, movies like National Lampoons, Clerks, Office Space, Used Cars, and Dumb and Dumber."
"__MOVIES__ I have never heard of used cars."
"__MOVIES__ It was a little known 1980's movie about two brothers who had competing car lots."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds kind of strange. Is it really that funny?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it's hilarious. You should really watch it whenever you have free time. You won't regret it."
"__MOVIES__ What makes it so funny?"
"__MOVIES__ The brothers really take selling used cars to an extreme and go all out warfare on each other's competing car lots to out-do the others."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds kind of funny. What else stands out that makes it a good comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Some of the dialogue is unforgettable and there is an extreme amount of dry humor contained in the dialogue."
"__MOVIES__ Dry humor. I should have known you would like movies with dry humor."
"__MOVIES__ You know me well."
