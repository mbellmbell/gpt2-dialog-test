"__DISNEY__ Do you like the animated version or movie version of The Jungle Book better?"
"__DISNEY__ To be honest I have never seen the movie version."
"__DISNEY__ You haven't? Why not?"
"__DISNEY__ Because I loved the animated version as a kid. I did not want the movie version to disappoint me and take away from that."
"__DISNEY__ Why would you think it would."
"__DISNEY__ I just did not think the Shere Khan, Bagheera and especially Balou could be properly represented in a real life version."
"__DISNEY__ I thought they did an ok job."
"__DISNEY__ See you said ok. But in the animated version they were spectacular!"
"__DISNEY__ Do you think you will ever watch the movie version?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably not as I just cannot picture a real bear singing Bear Necessities."
