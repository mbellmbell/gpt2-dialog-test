"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What were the best touchdown dances you have ever seen in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's a good question. I'm guessing I would have to go back a few years because players can't get too crazy anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. They can't. Chad Johnson really made the NFL crackdown on the extremity of the dances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember the Joe Horn cell phone touchdown celebration?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that was a Sunday night game, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it was. The Saints were atrocious at that time. I believe that was 2003."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a ridiculous celebration. Probably one of the most absurd ones I have ever seen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely absurd. Another one from the Saints, remember the Leap Frog dance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was sometime in the 1990's, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe it was the early 1990's. I think the Saints were so bad that they even screwed up that celebration."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't surprise me. Remember the Chad Johnson golfing celebration?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do remember that. He got fined for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guess the commissioner didn't like using the pile-on as a prop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certainly not. Seems like the wide receivers were always the entertainment divas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely. Terrell Owens. He was the diva that got everything started."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His touchdown celebration on the star in Dallas is when things started to accelerate with the celebration stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like it was around that time. Remember his pom-pom cheerleader celebration."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I definitely remember that. His sharpie autograph celebration was great also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That guy was definitely a diva."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chad Johnson definitely followed in his foot steps."
