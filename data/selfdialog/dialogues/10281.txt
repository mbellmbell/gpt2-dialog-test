"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What was the first hip-hop you remember hearing?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Good question, it was definitely Puff Daddy. That song that was memorial for Notorious BIG."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yeah, I'll be missing you. The one with Sting in it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, and the music video with the candles everywhere."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I think Puff Daddy/P. Diddy might have been my entrance point to hip hop as well."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you still listen to him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, if I do it's not usually by choice."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The classic take is that he's a much better businessman than a rapper."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Agreed. He helped put B.I.G. on the map, but he didn't ever make anything super great."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, a crucial player in rap and hip hop, but not necessarily for his musical contributions."
