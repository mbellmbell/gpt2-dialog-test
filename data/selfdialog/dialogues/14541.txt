"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey there, seen any good movies lately?"

"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What movie are you going to see?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wonder Woman!  I can not wait!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have seen previews for that one!  Do you think it will be really good?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I hope so.  I really liked the character in the Batman vs Superman movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too!  She looked really tough and dangerous."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I thought so too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think that she can carry a movie by herself just fine, too!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes!  The preview really made her look scary, too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I would not like to get on her bad side!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you know that the actress is from Israel?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, I had thought she was from France."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ And, she has two children!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I wonder if her kids will be seeing the movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too!  Imagine seeing your mom as Wonder Woman on the big screen."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That would have to be really different!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I bet they go to school and tell everybody that their mom is a superhero!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ha!  Let me know if the movie is any good!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think that it will be a great, action packed movie!"
