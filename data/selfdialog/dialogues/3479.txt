"__MUSIC__ I wonder why Skrillex hasn't come out with a new album in years."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that sucks.  I'd love to hear some new work from him."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed.  He's so talented."
"__MUSIC__ I think he's been working on random projects with other artists."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Justin Bieber I think."
"__MUSIC__ What a waste of time.  He should concentrate on his own music."
"__MUSIC__ Totally!  The Spring Breakers soundtrack was great!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think that's the last thing he produced."
"__MUSIC__ I heard he came out with some cell phone case."
"__MUSIC__ What does it do?"
"__MUSIC__ No idea, it never took off... hence why he should focus only on his music career."
"__MUSIC__ He's so young still, he's got time to dabble in other ventures."
"__MUSIC__ I guess but why bother, he's wasting his talent on cell phone cases."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe he's just not inspired to make music right now."
"__MUSIC__ Perhaps.  Maybe he used up all his beats rewriting the same tunes over and over again."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if he's dating anyone."
"__MUSIC__ Not sure but I know he broke up with that Elle girl that was in one of his songs."
"__MUSIC__ That sucks, I liked her."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she really could have benefited from his stardom."
