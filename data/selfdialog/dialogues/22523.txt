"__DISNEY__ I don't get how they are going to make a live action Lion King Movie."
"__DISNEY__ I assume it will be kind of like the Jungle Book."
"__DISNEY__ But there weren't any people in the Lion King so how will any of it be live action?"
"__DISNEY__ Most of the Jungle Book was CGI, so I guess all of the movie will be CGI."
"__DISNEY__ It should just be considered an animated movie then."
"__DISNEY__ I do love that they are bringing back James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa."
"__DISNEY__ And Donald Glover will be Simba!"
"__DISNEY__ I don't think I know who any of the other characters are or if they have even been cast yet."
"__DISNEY__ It should be interesting, hopefully it goes well."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder what they will do with the music in this one. Maybe they will update it a little bit."
