"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really didn't."
"__STAR_WARS__ No? Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought is was just a poor retelling of A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was cool to see the old characters older."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't. Harrison Ford looked like he really didn't want to be there. And those aliens they fought when he came up looked fake."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that was some bad CGI. But the rest of the movie looked good."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the New Order or whatever looked way too glossy. The Empire was crushed, now there's a bigger Empire suddenly?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that was confusing."
"__STAR_WARS__ There wasn't a sense of setting in it. Just a safe rehash."
