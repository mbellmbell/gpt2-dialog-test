"__DISNEY__ Who's your favorite Disney princess?"

"__DISNEY__ I agree. It's so timeless, kids today still watch it."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, Jodi Benson was the perfect voice as Ariel."
"__DISNEY__ I know, she really made the music in that movie so beautiful."
"__DISNEY__ The rest of the music from that movie is some of my favorite of all time."
