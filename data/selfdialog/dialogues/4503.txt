"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Blake Shelton's latest song?"
"__MUSIC__ Which one are you talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the newest I heard was that song about a Guy with a Girl."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I really don't like that song, although I think he's great."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  I love most of his music but I feel like that one is weak."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like how his voice sounds in it.  It's whiny."
"__MUSIC__ That and the lyrics are just kinda blah to me."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I agree.  But most of his music is incredible."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I really like Doin' What She Likes and Neon Light."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too.  And Drink on It is great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're all really catchy with great lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ What was the name of his first album?"
"__MUSIC__ I really can't remember!  He's been around longer than I thought."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I first started hearing him just a few years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but I think he was making music long before that."
"__MUSIC__ I hope he keeps producing new music and albums so we can get more of him."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I bet he will.  It doesn't seem like he's quitting anytime soon."
"__MUSIC__ Not considering how famous he's become."
"__MUSIC__ No, I doubt it.  I'd love to see him in concert."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  Maybe he'll come nearby."
