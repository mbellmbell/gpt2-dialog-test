"__ROCK__ Did you know Foo Fighters is releasing a new album??"
"__ROCK__ No! I didn't know that, I love them...glad you told me about this."
"__ROCK__ I figured you may want to know since you love Dave Grohl so much."
"__ROCK__ I know, I've been a fan since his Nirvana days."
"__ROCK__ Don't you wish 90's rock style were still being made??"
"__ROCK__ Definitely. That era of rock is my absolute favorite. Rage Against the Machine started then too."
"__ROCK__ Now that is a great band, I should have gone to see them when I had the chance."
"__ROCK__ I've seen them live once, one of the best shows of my life."
"__ROCK__ I'm so jealous!! I didn't know they would split up."
"__ROCK__ Maybe they'll do a reunion show one day. I would definitely go see them again."
