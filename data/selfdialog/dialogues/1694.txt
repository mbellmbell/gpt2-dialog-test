"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Justin Bieber?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really care for him, but I don't really care about him at all."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think he is overrated?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  I'm not a fan, but I don't think he's horrible."
"__MUSIC__ You think he actually has talent."
"__MUSIC__ I think he does, but he has a crappy attitude."
"__MUSIC__ At least we are on the same wavelenghth on that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he just needs to grow up."
"__MUSIC__ How old is he now?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm guessing he has to be in his mid-twenties."
"__MUSIC__ See?  And the guy still acts like a little kid."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's a shame because I think he does have a bit of talent."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think he'd ever be able to get farther than he is in the business?"
"__MUSIC__ If he starts taking it seriously, then yeah.  There's a lot of twenty five year olds that decide to grow up and get real."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  He doesn't seem like that kind of guy."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you."
"__MUSIC__ It seems all he likes to do is party."
"__MUSIC__ He really needs to diversify."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he needs to be more businesslike and invest and play smart.  His fans aren't going to love him forever."
