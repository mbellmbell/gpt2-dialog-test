"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Marilyn Monroe movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say, 'Don't bother to Knock'."
"__MOVIES__ That's not one I hear too often! What do you like the most about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I know, usually people say 'Seven Year Itch' or 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'! But, I love her character in the movie, Nell."
"__MOVIES__ What is Nell Like?"
"__MOVIES__ Very different from Monroe's other characters! She is a young woman who was just released from the mental hospital after attempting suicide because her husband was lost overseas during World War Two."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that sounds dramatic, not like the light hearted comedies she was in before. What is the main storyline, without giving away any spoilers!"
"__MOVIES__ It is very dramatic, almost a dark noir, sort of like 'Niagra' in a way. Well, the main storyline is that her Uncle works as a elevator man and is letting Nell have a gig babysitting one of the guest's childern while they attend some banquet."
"__MOVIES__ Seems interesting already!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! Of course, as is with these types of movies, Nell doesn't simply do as she's told and watch the girl, but her eyes wonder to a gentlemen across the hotel's next building. I'll leave it there!"
"__MOVIES__ Is there any other big  name stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ No one as big a Monroe, that's for sure. But, it does have Anne Bancroft playing a minor role as a hotel singer."
"__MOVIES__ What year was it released?"
"__MOVIES__ I think early 1950s."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty early in Monroe's career then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! She is very fresh faced in the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think it's one of her lesser known roles?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, like I said, it is very early in her career, and she is not all 'sexed' up like she was in other films. The theme is also dark, about suicide, and I think it might scare some people. I also admit, sometimes it borders on the melodramatic, but, I really love it! I love seeing her playing a serious role like that."
"__MOVIES__ I can see some parellels between Nell's character and Monroe's own personal life, can't you."
"__MOVIES__ For sure! I think that's another reason why I like it so much. I can only imagine how much she gleaned from her real life to play the role, and it makes it that much more special of a performance."
