"__BASEBALL__ What did you think of last night's Yankees Royals game?"
"__BASEBALL__ I wasn't expecting the Royals pitcher to be so good."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it was the pitcher on Wednesday who was supposed to be a problem for the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ And they really beat up on him."
"__BASEBALL__ The baby bombers are becoming the Bronx bashers!"
"__BASEBALL__ One of those radio guys is calling them the Bash Brothers."
"__BASEBALL__ Too bad they couldn't score last night."
"__BASEBALL__ After the game Girardi said they were having trouble seeing the ball well. Duh!"
"__BASEBALL__ Poor Montgomery. I guess it's tough when you're just starting out."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he's a decent pitcher. He has some wins, just has to get used to the pressure of the big league."
"__BASEBALL__ You know, speaking of pitchers, Sabathia was pretty impressive the other night."
"__BASEBALL__ He was awesome!"
"__BASEBALL__ You never know with him."
"__BASEBALL__ Hard to make the transition from high speed thrower to finesse pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ I wonder if Petite has been giving him some lessons."
"__BASEBALL__ He's dealing with a lot, getting over his alcoholism, learning a different way to pitch. And just getting older."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess. Still making the big bucks though."
"__BASEBALL__ For sure. This is his last season with the Yankees. Hope he invested his money wisely."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. Say, who's pitching for the Yankees against Tampa tonight?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know. Tanaka maybe."
