"__DISNEY__ I'm really psyched for the next Star Wars film."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Force Awakens was pretty cool. I was afraid when Disney bought it from Lucas."
"__DISNEY__ Why? You didn't think they would put Donald Duck in it or something?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, that's just silly. I was afraid they wouldn't allow the dark story lines."
"__DISNEY__ They tossed a lot of the EU. But What happened to Han and Leia was pretty damned dark."
"__DISNEY__ So was Rogue One."
"__DISNEY__ I really loved that they fitted it into A New Hope so well."
"__DISNEY__ My dad was a Disney exec, he said they never neglect characters or series with a following."
"__DISNEY__ Disney seems to be listening to George Lucas, without letting him screw up things."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, like those prequels. God."
