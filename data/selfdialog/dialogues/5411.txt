"__STAR_WARS__ What was the last Star Wars movie to come out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rouge One (A new hope)"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  I liked that one.  Did you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but it was really sad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha!  Yes, you can't get attached to any of the characters.  I do mean, you can't get attached to any of the characters!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  That was rough.  How many movies have you seen when pretty much all of the characters die?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not many.  I have to say, that was very unique for a Star Wars movie.  It's one of the few that I actually did like."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait, what?  You didn't like the other Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No.  I think they are just overblown.  Lucas stole most of that from Joseph Campbell.  It's just 'Hero with 1000 Faces' all over again."
"__STAR_WARS__ well, I guess it has mainstreamed.  EVERYONE likes it now, and Disney is a freakin' evil marketing machine."
