"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you catch the Cowboy's game on TV yesterday"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man I haven't watched a football game since the last time the cowboys won the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean you live in Texas and you don't follow the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, all a bunch of nonsense to me, just another way mass media tries to steal my money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have a favorite team, or did you have when you did watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I was a Houston Oilers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know they don't exist now right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, just because I don't follow the NFL doesn't mean I have my head in the sand, Houston has a team called the Texans, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are correct sir, what turned you against the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think about it man, half the players are criminal rapist drug addicts, you really want to spend your Sunday, Monday, and Thursday free time watching them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not that bad man, the NFL works hard to keep their players in line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, the NFL, have they ever given you anything for free to reward you as a loyal customer, and TV games don't count, because you spend at least an hour of the game watching commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I do kind of see your point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are there to take your money, they nickel and dime you and the taxpayers who live in the communities that have to pay for their Billion dollar stadiums."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man you're killing me with your anti-NFL negativity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The last good NFL player was Earl Campbel, everybody else has paled in comparison."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well let me ask you this, who was your favorite all time NFL player when you did watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Roger Staubach, nobody better than him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What would make you come back to football and start watching the games again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When the NFL and the Teams start paying the taxpayers back for subsidizing their Billion dollar stadiums, and we know that isn't going to happen."
