"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah I have ! That's probably my favorite!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really ? Why? That's my least."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love that they travel back in time !"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I personally prefer the goblet of fire. That one is so cool and action packed."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like that one too. I love the maze at the end even though the ending is so sad for Cedric Diggory."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree. It's also pretty scary, that graveyard scene was done well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Poor Harry having to experience that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would be so traumatized watching that death."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too. And to come back with the body like that."
