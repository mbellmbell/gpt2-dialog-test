"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about them Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The expectations are going to be high this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a good young core of players and teams will be ready for them this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak played solid last year, but it will be interesting to see this new season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just seems like the Cowboys have a problem getting over the hump."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really looked good last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak and Zeke are a good combo.  If they can run the ball and chip away at teams like last year, they should be okay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The other nfl teams now have the tapes.  They are going to study up on Dak.  They are going to make it harder on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For him to step in last year and lead them was huge.  Not having Tony Romo looking over his shoulder could be good and bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People loved Romo, but for whatever reason, he couldn't show up when it counted.  I just hope Dak can get them over the hump."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak plays smart.  He is not throwing a bunch of interceptions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being safe with the ball got them lots of wins last year.  They just can't get behind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak being the man now in Dallas means carrying all the weight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a talent.  Dallas had to move on. He just has to win.  If he starts losing, the people will turn quick in Dallas and start talking about Romo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Running the ball and controlling the clock is going to be their way forward."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is hard to mess it up with Zeke running the ball.  Just hand it off and let him go to work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think Dak is going to focus on hitting those open tight ends and wideouts to keep the chains moving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't have to be complex.  Just keep it simple.  Chew the clock and put up points in the red zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The schedule for Dallas is going to be harder this year.  Dak and Zeke are going to have to rise to the occasion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys have a talented young group of players that should be good for years to come."
