"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team do you think improved the most in the offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants, I think the addition of Marshall opens up their offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure does, no more double teams on OBJ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep and they picked up a tight end in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I don't like drafting tight ends in the first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? It worked for them with Jeremy Shockey."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he was a bit of an outlier."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But guys like him and Gronk have changed the way offenses are run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's accurate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Tight ends used to be mostly used for blocking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now, I can't think of a team that doesn't use their end of receiving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely, just a whole new world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's amazing how much the game has changed recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it used to be that the spread offense was seen as a gimmick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, now it seems to be everywhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Almost as if the pro-style offense is going away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it'll always be around, but it's definitely losing its influence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a resurgence is possible though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they say it's all circular."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who knows, but the spread does make for some exciting and high-scoring games."
