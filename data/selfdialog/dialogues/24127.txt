"__SUPERHERO__ So I'm thinking Jared Leto is the best Joker yet."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'll pretend I didn't hear you say that."
"__SUPERHERO__ Let me guess: you think Heath Ledger was."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me and the rest of the world thinks that."
"__SUPERHERO__ Leto was much crazier and dangerous than Ledger ever was."
"__SUPERHERO__ Jack Nicholson was a better Joker than Leto.  So overrated."
"__SUPERHERO__ Didn't you hear him do the laugh in the movie?  Those other Jokers couldn't do that."
"__SUPERHERO__ They didn't need to as their performances were creepy enough."
"__SUPERHERO__ They should make a movie with all three Jokers in it!"
"__SUPERHERO__ You just blew my mind."
