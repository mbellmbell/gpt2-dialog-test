"__MUSIC__ What do you think of opera, Mr. PhD-in-Music?"
"__MUSIC__ I hate it an insane amount."
"__MUSIC__ What, why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's the height of music. It's THE genre you'd write in the 19th century to be a serious composer."
"__MUSIC__ So, what's so bad about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Once we got to Richard Wagner, it became impossible to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he believes in never-ending music. There is no repeating music whatsoever."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that bad?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, know how you can always remember the refrain? You can always hear the melody after the song is over?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Well, not with Wagner. Nothing repeats. Nothing can be remembered."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds awful."
"__MUSIC__ It is. Even with the score I'm lost."
"__MUSIC__ What about other opera composers?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they're not as bad."
"__MUSIC__ But still, you hate them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're far too long and always in a language I don't understand."
"__MUSIC__ Don't they provide subtitles or text?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, some do, but it's impossible to watch the lyrics and the action."
