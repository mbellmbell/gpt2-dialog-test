"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new live action Beauty and The Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't and have little interest, wouldn't want to potientialy tarnish the original one."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you like the classic film so much?"
"__DISNEY__ What is there not to like? It has classic songs, great characters, even Angela Lansbury did one of the voices, you can't beat that."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm maybe I need to watch it again."
"__DISNEY__ If you watch it with the right mindset, you will realize that while the story may seem silly, it's relevant in real life."
"__DISNEY__ In what way would it be relevant?"
"__DISNEY__ We'll look at the fact that Belle falls in love with The Beast, goes to show that there's more to loving someone than outwardly appearance."
"__DISNEY__ Well I suppose that would be a good lesson to learn."
"__DISNEY__ It really is and something a lot of us could learn from, here's to you Beauty and The Beast!"
