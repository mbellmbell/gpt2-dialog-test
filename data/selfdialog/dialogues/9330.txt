"__BASEBALL__ I really hope the Orioles can win the division this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it's going to be tough with the Yankees' resurgence this year."
"__BASEBALL__ But think about it. They are only a game and a half behind the yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ True. The Orioles have been playing pretty well this year."
"__BASEBALL__ I just hope they can keep it up. The yankees have really re-tooled their organization."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but I would love to see David slay Goliath"
"__BASEBALL__ This Orioles team is not a great hitting team, but they have their abundance of sluggers."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah Chris Davis and Manny Machado are definitely dangerous hitters."
"__BASEBALL__ These guys can go yard at anytime."
"__BASEBALL__ In addition, Dylan Bundy has been pitching really well this year for them ."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah right now his ERA is under 3.00. And he has already accumulated 5 wins this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I didn't see that coming from him, but that's been a bonus"
"__BASEBALL__ If he can keep that up throughout the year I give the Orioles a chance to take down the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know. It seems anytime they go up against the yankees they wet the bed."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but if they just play consistently throughout the year then they have a great chance."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope you're right because I cant' stand the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too. But trust me it is not going to be easy. They are going to have to earn it."
"__BASEBALL__ They just need to play better on the road."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah right now they are 13-3 at home but 3 games under .500 on the road."
"__BASEBALL__ yeah they are going to have to improve that record to win this division."
