"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Lonesome Dove?"
"__MOVIES__ No. What kind of movie is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a western."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love westerns. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there's a lot to explain but basically it's about two retired Texas rangers."
"__MOVIES__ How long is it?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one is about seven hours I think."
"__MOVIES__ The first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah there's a few of them."
"__MOVIES__ How many?"
"__MOVIES__ There's Lonesome Dove. Return. Dead Man's Walk, Streets of Laredo and Comanche Moon."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is the best?"
"__MOVIES__ The original of course."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check those out some time. Are they anything like Tombstone?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. Other than the fact that it's a western."
"__MOVIES__ Still sounds pretty good. Do they go in order?"
"__MOVIES__ No you have to watch Dead man's, Comanche, Lonesome Dove, Return and then Streets of Laredo."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Good to know."
"__MOVIES__ They are all very long so set the appropriate time aside."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks. I will."
