"__FAST_FURIOUS__ If you could do one thing from Fast & Furious, what would it be?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Anything at all from any movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, anything, and it was completely legal."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ hmm... I guess I'd have to go with Driving the car between buildings."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You'd really want to drive a car out of a building and into another building?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, in and out of three buildings."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That is just insane."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That is the point. I think it would be awesome."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It probably would be, but it'd be the last awesome thing you do."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Not if I jumped out at the last minute like Dom did."
