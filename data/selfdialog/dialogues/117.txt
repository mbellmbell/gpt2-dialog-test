"__MUSIC__ Did you listen to the American Top Forty song countdown on the radio last week?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I missed it. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's songs though!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think the same song will be in the number one spot?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. What song was it last week?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was Stay by Zedd and Alessia Cara."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard that song. Unless something new has come out it will probably stay on top."
"__MUSIC__ I like the number two song better. It's called Something Just Like This, by The Chainsmokers."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love that song! It has Coldplay in it, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's the one. Coldplay really adds something to the song."
"__MUSIC__ I like The Chainsmokers as a group too."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite song of theirs is Paris."
"__MUSIC__ I like Closer better, but Paris is really good."
"__MUSIC__ I was amazed at how they took off as a band after their first hit song."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I like their music so much better than last summer's big hits."
"__MUSIC__ I liked last summer's top songs a lot more than 2013 when Blurred Lines was popular."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I can't stand that song! They played it all the time on the radio too."
"__MUSIC__ They always overplay whatever is popular."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but usually I like it so I don't complain."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not complaining about the top songs right now. I'll have to listen to the number one from last week."
"__MUSIC__ Listen to the whole top forty songs. They're worth it!"
