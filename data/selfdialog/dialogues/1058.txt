"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, this band started up recently, around the mid 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, honestly, there are better bands than these amateurs."
"__MUSIC__ Dude, respect these guys! Don't let your ego get to you!"
"__MUSIC__ Hey, they're nothing compared to Coldplay, Earth, Wind & Fire, or The Rolling Stones"
"__MUSIC__ Well, apparently no one likes Alternative Indie-Pop that much."
"__MUSIC__ I like rap and hip-hop so much more."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, this genre was created during the 70s, and it was only popular in the UK back then."
"__MUSIC__ Well, us Americans ain't gonna listen much to that crap load of music."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, everyone's just trying to make their own music with a little bit of their own style."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, the new modern world has all of these pop singers, rap artists, and singing legends, but you have to appreciate the music that came before,"
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, the classical and opera concerts, the Renaissance is where music really started for Europe."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I get it, I'll won't do it again."
"__MUSIC__ Seems like you had a change of heart for music now."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like small bands, but I do know my history."
"__MUSIC__ What about your girlfriend? Does she like this music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, she's more into fur fashion."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Maybe, she'll like some 1920s music."
"__MUSIC__ Nahhh, she's like a hardcore woman who's against PETA. She'll fully defend herself in all of her furs, if possible. Like make a fur coat of all the furs that have been made in the world, like an Intarsia fur coat."
