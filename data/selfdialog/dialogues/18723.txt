"__MOVIES__ Do you want to go to the movies with me?"
"__MOVIES__ What were you thinking of seeing?"
"__MOVIES__ How about that Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's not really my cup of tea."
"__MOVIES__ Well, are you into sci-fi at all?"
"__MOVIES__ It depends."
"__MOVIES__ Would you want to see Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I'm not really into that kind of science fiction. That more like a combination of fantasy and science fiction, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of science fiction movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the Star Trek movies."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean the older ones, or the newer ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Good point. I like them all, and I especially like some of the new stuff we see about the Spock character."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ In some of the newer movies, they have the original characters when they were much younger."
"__MOVIES__ Was Spock really different?"
"__MOVIES__ In some ways he was a little different when he was younger. They also show him getting really angry in one of the more recent films."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any new Star Trek movies out right now?"
"__MOVIES__ Not that I know of."
"__MOVIES__ Well, would you be interested in the newest Aliens movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That's definitely more traditional science fiction in my opinion."
