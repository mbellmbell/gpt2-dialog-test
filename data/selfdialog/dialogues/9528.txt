"__BASEBALL__ That Bryce Harper extension was a shocker."
"__BASEBALL__ In what way?"
"__BASEBALL__ The amount of money given to him."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but why not long term."
"__BASEBALL__ Makes you think they dont want him around?"
"__BASEBALL__ Trout got a multiyear deal."
"__BASEBALL__ True, I guess they are treading water for now."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but its baseball without a cap, it makes no sense."
"__BASEBALL__ Well maybe they dont want to commit to him."
"__BASEBALL__ How many guys are like him?"
"__BASEBALL__ He is a generational talent."
"__BASEBALL__ So why not make him your cornerstone."
"__BASEBALL__ This is true"
"__BASEBALL__ I think thats going to hurt them in negotiations."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah if I am Harper I might not sign back with the team."
"__BASEBALL__ Hes gotta be hurt in one respect"
"__BASEBALL__ But on the other hand he just made some serious bank."
"__BASEBALL__ And if he has a bad year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think they look at it as an abberation"
"__BASEBALL__ You could be right with that one"
