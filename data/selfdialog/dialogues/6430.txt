"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think the older movies are better than the new ones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, now that depends.  Are you talking about the force awakens or episode 1 through 3?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm talking about episode 1 through 3."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then, no, I don't think they are better."
"__STAR_WARS__ You at least have to have a favorite character from them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  Although Yoda's epic light-saber duel was pretty cool, I have to say that Jar Jar Binks is my favorite character."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way! Have you read the fan fiction about how Jar Jar is really a Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and I think its garbage.  However, Jar Jar did play a controversial role in helping young Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now there is a dark character.  It's too bad that things didn't work out with Padme."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, anger turned him to the dark-side, which prevented their relationship from really taking off."
