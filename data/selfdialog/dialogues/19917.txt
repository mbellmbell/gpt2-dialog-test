"__MOVIES__ So what are you planning on doing today?"
"__MOVIES__ I am thinking about just hanging around the house and watching some movies."
"__MOVIES__ What do you plan on watching?"
"__MOVIES__ My dad is wanting me to watch a new movie with him that he just bought."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, do you know what the name of it is?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it is called Wilson. He said it is a comedy that he has heard good things about."
"__MOVIES__ I have seen previews for that one. It stars Woody Harrelson, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that is the one! My dad has always liked him in movies."
"__MOVIES__ I think he is actually a very underrated actor when you think about it."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you,and I think my dad would as well!"
"__MOVIES__ He has played in some really great movies, but he is rarely talked about as one of the best all time actors."
"__MOVIES__ White Men Can't Jump, Kingpin, and Indecent Proposal were all great movies just to name a few."
"__MOVIES__ They were and he done a great job in all of them. Money Train was another excellent movie that he was in."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I forgot about that one! Who else was in that with him?"
"__MOVIES__ It also starred Wesley Snipes and Jenifer Lopez as well. I feel like without him though, the movie would not have been as good."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you about that.We could set here and name all kinds of great movies that he has been in."
"__MOVIES__ I just do not understand why he never gets the true credit that he deserves!"
"__MOVIES__ In my book he is one of the best actors in Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ I feel the same way! I enjoy the vast majority of all of his films."
"__MOVIES__ I am glad he has got some new movies coming out! Love watching him perform!"
