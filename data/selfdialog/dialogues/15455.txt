"__HARRY_POTTER__ I re-watched the first Harry Potter movie today!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, fun. Did you like it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, Hermione is my favorite. I can't believe I never watched these before!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me either, but there's no time like now to catch up."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Haha, yeah. Who's your favorite character?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think Neville was my favorite by the end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How come?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You'll see, he's kind of like a version of Harry that's more like a regular person. Like if things had gone differently."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Didn't his actor get super hot or something?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, you mean Matthew Lewis? Yeah, he did, that doesn't hurt, but it's not until the last movie."
