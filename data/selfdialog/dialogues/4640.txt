"__MUSIC__ Me too. Oh now they're playing some Boyz To Men. Motown Philly."
"__MUSIC__ I like Boyz To Men. But I'd listen to New Edition before them."
"__MUSIC__ New Edition with or WITHOUT Bobby Brown?"
"__MUSIC__ WITHOUT. You know Johnny Gill hit the scene and New Edition became hot all over again."
"__MUSIC__ I like Johnny Gill ever since him and Stacey Latisaw did Perfect Combination."
"__MUSIC__ I think they both were like teenagers when they made that song. He left her and her career fizzled."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they did use to be a couple. I just thought they did a record together."
"__MUSIC__ Man, Johnny Gill made solo music, hooked up with New Edition, and we ain't heard nothing from Stacey Latisaw."
"__MUSIC__ That's because Teena Marie hit the scene and crushed the game. I lost my mind when I found out Teena Marie was white."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I thought she was a sista. Teena Marie was the truth though."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of her, I want to hear my song right now."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ You Make Love Like Springtime. Teena be hitting them hight notes I tell you."
