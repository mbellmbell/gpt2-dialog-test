"__DISNEY__ Anna and Elsa are awesome. I love that sisterly love they have."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't know, I've never had a sister. I was an only child."
"__DISNEY__ Did you ever want a sister or a brother?"
"__DISNEY__ Sometimes, but, usually, I was okay with just being an only child and having my cousins and my friends."
"__DISNEY__ I love my sister. I can't imagine not having her in my life. I would feel horrible if we had to be separated."
"__DISNEY__ I probably would, too, had I a sister. I do know what love feels like, that's pretty universal."
"__DISNEY__ Sometimes I like to be by myself, but I still want to be close to her."
"__DISNEY__ So, would you be more of an Elsa or an Anna?"
"__DISNEY__ Anna, totally. I may be the older one, but I don't think I'm that mature."
"__DISNEY__ I think you are."
