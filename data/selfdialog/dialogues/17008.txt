"__MOVIES__ Did you hear, they are doing another Dead Pool movie."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Why? Because Dead Pool was a hit."
"__MOVIES__ It was stupid not a hit. That was an insult to the comic book."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever read the comic book?"
"__MOVIES__ How else would I know that movie was utterly ridiculous?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was good."
"__MOVIES__ Deadpool is the most asinine superhero ever, at least in the movie.  His character is insufferable, and the story structure is clunky."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like the humor did you?"
"__MOVIES__ Some of the  jokes were good, but most of them were juvenile sex jokes. I don't know how Marvel could let their character be trashed like that."
"__MOVIES__ Money. It rules the world."
"__MOVIES__ The sound, costumes and acting are better than usual, but I don't understand why anyone would claim to have enjoyed watching this bipolar fantasy"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it was my kind of movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not knocking you. If you liked it, cool beans but I just hated that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think you write a better movie for Dead Pool?"
"__MOVIES__ With my eyes closed. He would have been like Dead Pool and less like Spider-Man."
"__MOVIES__ I did think they were trying to make him Spider-Man-ish."
"__MOVIES__ Dead Pool the new anti-super hero movie with a twist."
"__MOVIES__ I still got a pretty big kick out of it."
"__MOVIES__ Goofy movie is what it was."
