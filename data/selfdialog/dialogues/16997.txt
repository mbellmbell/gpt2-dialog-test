"__MOVIES__ I would love to find an awesome scary movie to watch!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah me to, I am in the mood for something old school."
"__MOVIES__ Are you talking about a movie from Hitchcock or something like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, I am thinking perhaps the Shining."
"__MOVIES__ Stephen King huh? I dont know, I have heard that one is really scary."
"__MOVIES__ You mean, you have not ever watched The Shining?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope! I have always wanted to, but admittedly I am a bit of a chicken."
"__MOVIES__ The Shining is definitely a must watch for anyone looking for a classic horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ That is what I have heard! Who all stars in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Shelley Duvall and Jack Nicholson are the two main stars."
"__MOVIES__ Great, I have always been a fan of both of those actors, especially Jack!"
"__MOVIES__ In my opinion, this was by far the creepiest role he ever played!"
"__MOVIES__ I think I will take your word for it! I am nervous about watching this one."
"__MOVIES__ I am not going to lie, there were a few parts that even made me jump!"
"__MOVIES__ What year did The Shining come out? Seems like it has been out forever."
"__MOVIES__ It was released for the first time on May 23rd, 1980."
"__MOVIES__ I am thinking this movie was by Wes Craven, correct?"
