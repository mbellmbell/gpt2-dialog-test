"__STAR_WARS__ I think that blasters are way cooler than light sabers."
"__STAR_WARS__ You've got to be out of your mind! Light sabers are hands down the coolest weapons in the Star Wars universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ Blasters are long range weapons, you can shoot a guy from across the room with a blaster."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll give you that, but close range nothing can beat a light saber.  If someone is right up in your face you don't even have to get the light saber all the way out to be able to disable your enemy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han Solo shoots Greedo under the table in the Mos Eisley Cantina from under the table!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but if he'd had a light saber he could have taken out Greedo and the entire table by just turning it on and flicking his wrist."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or he could have accidentally sliced his own leg off."
"__STAR_WARS__ I still agree with Obi Wan in a New Hope when he says that the light saber is a much more elegant weapon for a more civilized time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but you have to train for years to use a light saber correctly, all you need is a nobody off the streets to pull a trigger."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly my point! Any idiot can use a blaster, you have to be a real warrior to use a light saber."
