"__MOVIES__ What? That doesn't sound like a Kevin Smith movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is, he made it with his daughter Harley."
"__MOVIES__ So it's a kid's movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, more like teen horror comedy."

"__MOVIES__ It's a really goofy movie but it's fun."
"__MOVIES__ So not like your typical Kevin Smith film?"

"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ All I'll say is that involves little mini bratwurst men."
"__MOVIES__ Say what now?"
