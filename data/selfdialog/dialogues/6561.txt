"__STAR_WARS__ Are you looking forward to 'The Last Jedi'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it's going to be great!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you know the director?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rian Johnson, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! Did you know he used to work on Breaking Bad?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No way, really?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He did. He is famous for directing one of the highest rated episodes of the show, Ozymandias."
"__STAR_WARS__ Neat! That means he's used to making things with a more dark and serious tone."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely. I hope Last Jedi turns out like Empire Strikes Back; its my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Should be fun to see how it turns out. Can't wait until December!"
