"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking of going to see a movie this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like fun! What are you going to see?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking of seeing Baby Driver. Would you like to come with me?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd love to. I haven't heard of the movie, though. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ I have been trying to avoid spoilers, but as far as I understand, it's about a getaway driver who wants to get out of the lifestyle."
"__MOVIES__ That could definitely be a good time. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Ansel Elgort plays the driver, Baby. It also stars Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Eiza Gonz√°lez."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. I don't know of Ansel Elgort, but I know I love Jon Hamm in just about everything he does."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree, he's a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know who directed Baby Driver?"
"__MOVIES__ Edgar Wright directed it."
"__MOVIES__ I think I've heard of him, what else has he done?"
"__MOVIES__ You'd probably know him from Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! I loved those movies. I knew I'd heard of him. He directed The World's End, too right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. And did you know he also did Scott Pilgrim vs. the World?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't. That's crazy! I love that one too. Wow, I didn't realize he'd made so many good comedies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'd say he's probably my favorite comedic director working right now."
"__MOVIES__ I can certainly see why."
"__MOVIES__ That's why I can't wait to see Baby Driver this weekend!"
"__MOVIES__ Now you've definitely got me excited, too."
