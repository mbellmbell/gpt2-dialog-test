"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the Vikings to be a sleeper team this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? With Sam Bradford as their QB?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bradford is a solid QB. Their line didn't play the best last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, I like the addition of Reif.  He adds a dimension of toughness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides Patterson, they didn't lose any players to free agency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you talking about? They lost the greatest running back of all-time - Adrian Peterson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree that he WAS a great player.  He's been injured lately and is at the end of his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't count AP out, I bet he runs for 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns in New Orleans this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's washed up and will be out of the league in two years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he holds on and breaks the rushing record in five years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides, the Vikes drafted Delvin Cook to replace AP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cook is decent, but do you think he will be any good in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he wins the rookie of the year, has 1,500 combined yards and 10 tds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty high expectations for a rookie running back!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also, love the Vikings defense, one of the best in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They didn't play that great at the end of the year last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were on the field a lot, so they were tired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So your'e saying that the Vikes will be better on offense and their defense returns to form?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that."
