"__MUSIC__ Who do you think is the greatest artist of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Obviously Beyonce"
"__MUSIC__ Beyonce is great and is probably the best artist out now, but I wouldn't say she is the greatest of all time. At least not yet."
"__MUSIC__ Who is better?"
"__MUSIC__ Michael Jackson, for one."
"__MUSIC__ True! I forgot to think back in time to people who have already passed away"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I did say of all time, not just of our generation"
"__MUSIC__ In that case, I'm going to say Bob Marley was the greatest of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Even better than Michael Jackson?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's put it this way - who is more widely known across the world. Bob or MJ?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough question. I want to say Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ I was recently in Indonesia on vacation, and I was suprised to see Tshirts selling all over Indonesia with Bob Marley's face on it."
"__MUSIC__ Did they know any of his songs?"
"__MUSIC__ They knew more than you would expect. Music really connects people"
"__MUSIC__ That reminds me of a time I was in Mozambique and they apparently love Madonna there."
"__MUSIC__ Madonna hasn't had any new music in ages though"
"__MUSIC__ They don't care! The radio kept playing all of her old music."
"__MUSIC__ That's so random."
"__MUSIC__ A local told me the obsession started when she had two concerts there. No other mega artist had concerts there in the 1980s except her"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that explains it. Sort of.."
