"__STAR_WARS__ But you know what I think is one of THE most illogical things in the Star Wars universe?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Those speeder bikes from Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm.. I can see that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, think about it, you got this REAL dense forest, not a clear path in site, so what do you give your troops?  Bikes that go from zero to hundred miles and hour in a split second."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's not a recipe for disaster."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, right?  To me, you need something like that in a place with lots of open spaces like Tatooine or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they may not work there, it might be something where the sand is always getting in the engines."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think so, if they can have those pod racers from the Phantom Menace (which takes place, what seventy years ago?) they could use speeder bikes."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point.  Be faster than riding one of those giant dewback lizard things."
