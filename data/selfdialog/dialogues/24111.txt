"__SUPERHERO__ What is the best Marvel movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm going to go with Captain America starring Matt Salinger from the early 90s."
"__SUPERHERO__ Haha!  That one was pretty great, but I think Captain America: Civil War is my favorite.  I like moral ambiguity.  Which side is right, which is wrong."
"__SUPERHERO__ That is a great movie.  I'm Team Cap all the way, but he's my favorite, so I'm biased.  I really like Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, those are excellent.  Talk about making secondary characters relevant.  And, the soundtracks are amazing, especially Volume 2."
"__SUPERHERO__ Sylvester Stallone was in that, and he's my favorite actor, so that was exciting."
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you think about the Fox X-Men series?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think they're ok, but I hate that they'll never be able to cross over with other Marvel properties."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe the Fantastic Four?"
"__SUPERHERO__ After that last Fantastic Four movie flopped, I doubt it."
