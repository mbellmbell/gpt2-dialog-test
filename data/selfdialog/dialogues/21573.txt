"__DISNEY__ Did you prefer the first monsters inc or the second one?"
"__DISNEY__ Do you mean Monsters University?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that's the one."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I actually liked the second one better."
"__DISNEY__ Not a lot of people think that because Boo isn't in it."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know, I remember when Monsters University came out and everyone was confused because she wasn't in it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I can say the same. It made more sense when we found out it was a prequel."
"__DISNEY__ Good point. I was glad that some of the originals characters were in it though."
"__DISNEY__ I agree.  It would be Monsters Inc. without John Goodman."
"__DISNEY__ Or Billy Crystal."
