"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey Uncle Lenny I am free today did you want to hang?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most definitely Brandon I am setting up for the football game tonight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool, are you guys playing or just watching?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We can play a bit in the backyard but we were just gonna watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which game is on tonight?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we got the Redskins and the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Two good old school offensive teams, I'll definitely be there!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great, and yeah it should be a high scoring beast of a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear the Redskins want to keep Kirk Cousins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that but he is an expensive guy, we will see what happens to the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the GM would make a mistake in recommending letting him go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is one of the best quarterbacks in the league that is for sure!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not only that, he is a vital QB on a team that really needs a ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the West in general could use a ring, instead of those Pats!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love a ring, and I'd love for a team from the West to snag it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on through when you are available, I actually have a Cousins jersey."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nice, I actually just bought an Antoine Boldin jersey for cheap, when he was on the Cardinals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great buy, I want to see it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll be over to show it soon!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll be waiting for ya!"
