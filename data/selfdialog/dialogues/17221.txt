"__MOVIES__ What movie won Best Oscar last year?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it was that movie about the guy growing up."
"__MOVIES__ That's not helpful enough.  Remember anything else?"
"__MOVIES__ He was homosexual, African-American..."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Moonlight."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's it."
"__MOVIES__ I watched it the other day on an airplane.  It was okay, but seemed just that."
"__MOVIES__ It was an interesting character study for sure.  Certain parts were stronger than others."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  I liked the first part when he was a child."
"__MOVIES__ Where he befriended the drug dealer?"
"__MOVIES__ Right.  To me, that was the emotional core of the film."
"__MOVIES__ I also thought it was the best part."
"__MOVIES__ It really introduced the problems he would encounter later in life."
"__MOVIES__ It did, though it was kind of disappointing that the best part was in the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ The ending was somewhat ineffective to me."
"__MOVIES__ It didn't match the same pace that he did as a child or at school."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, way too much talking."
"__MOVIES__ Especially in the diner.  It just felt the air was let out of it a bit."
"__MOVIES__ I actually think it's a movie that would have been better being told in reverse."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, that's a very interesting idea."
