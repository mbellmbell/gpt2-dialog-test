"__MOVIES__ Seen anything good lately."
"__MOVIES__ Not really. The kids control my movie selections these days."
"__MOVIES__ Ha! Kiddy films for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup. If I see Trolls one more time, I might freak out!"
"__MOVIES__ That wasn't such a bad flick."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but 100 times is pushing it."
"__MOVIES__ You know what animation I'd like to see?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ Lego Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! The first Lego Movie was so good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought it was all stop animation."
"__MOVIES__ Nope. Mostly CGI."
"__MOVIES__ But they did such a great job, you couldn't really tell."
"__MOVIES__ I'll be Lego Batman will be just as good."
"__MOVIES__ And it will be a welcomed relief from Trolls!"
"__MOVIES__ I wonder when it comes out."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's not in theatre anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'll bet it'll be soon."
"__MOVIES__ You aught to bring the family over when it does."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that'd be fun!"
