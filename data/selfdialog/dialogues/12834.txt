"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What would be your prediction for the Bears this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 16-0, baby! Da Bears!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very funny."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, I'm expecting another rough year. Maybe 5-11."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think John Fox gets fired?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a definite possibility."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think if they aren't at least 7-9, maybe 8-8, he's gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't really argue that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The problem I see with the team is that on offense, they don't really have established receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Meredith had a breakout year last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He showed he could make some plays, but I don't trust him as a #1 receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for all his inconsistencies, you still had Alshon Jeffry last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And I just am not buying Kevin White at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Poor guy can't stay on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I do feel bad for him, but injuries are a part of the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I think the Bears might actually have a solid defense this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only if they can fix the safety position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The whole secondary is a little bit unsettled."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 'Unsettled' is a nice way to put it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, it's kinder than 'terrible'!"
