"__BEATLES__ I am so happy!"
"__BEATLES__ Why's that?"
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles music is now on most of the major streaming services."
"__BEATLES__ Wow! That's excellent news."
"__BEATLES__ I know, it has been annoying since I've gotten so dependent on Spotify, that I would always have to find my old CDs."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, streaming is the future of music and not having The Beatles music on there was limiting access to a younger generation."
"__BEATLES__ For sure. I've actually been listening to a lot of their really early stuff on Spotify that I've never listened to."
"__BEATLES__ Like what?"
"__BEATLES__ The album Please Please Me. It has a few songs I know, like I Saw Her Standing There, Twist and Shout, and Love Me Do, but most of it is unfamiliar."
"__BEATLES__ That's really cool. I'm in a similar place, I haven't listened to it either."
