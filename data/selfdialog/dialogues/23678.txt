"__DISNEY__ Do you know of any Disney movies coming out in 2017."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, actually. I think I can name a few."
"__DISNEY__ What movies are coming out."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I know that there's Cars 3, Lou, and Coco."
"__DISNEY__ Cars 3! I hope we get more of the backstory about where all of the humans went."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! Why do the cars have doors and seats if there are no humans?"
"__DISNEY__ It really doesn't make sense. What could have killed off all the humans, but not the Cars?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't think it was nuclear war because that'd probably destroy the cars."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's kind of dark for a kids movie when you think about it."
"__DISNEY__ Very dark! Although, I think that level of inference is beyond the abilities of most of the young kids watching it."
