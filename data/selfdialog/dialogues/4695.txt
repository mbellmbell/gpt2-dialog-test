"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of K-Pop?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure, what is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's Korean pop music and it's great!"
"__MUSIC__ What are some good bands? I'll have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Monsta X, G-Dragon and BTS are really popular right now."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Right now, I'd say Monsta X. They have a great sound and good image."
"__MUSIC__ Is their music really catchy?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes! It's very upbeat and unique, I'd call it fun and exciting."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll definitely check it out sometime. Have you listened to much Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I love older Metallica stuff like Battery."
"__MUSIC__ So K-Pop isn't anything like Metallica, is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not! It's kind of like American pop, only with different themes."
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, I don't listen to much American pop, I like metal and rock better."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can understand that. Metal and rock are really intense and have a totally different sound."
"__MUSIC__ That's so true! I probably like older rock the best like Motley Crue and AC/DC."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like that stuff too, since that's what I grew up on. I'd say I like a little bit of everything."
"__MUSIC__ It's nice to have variety in music, that's for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, every variety of music offers something a little different."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, you can't listen to the same thing all the time and sometimes you want quieter music instead of louder music."
