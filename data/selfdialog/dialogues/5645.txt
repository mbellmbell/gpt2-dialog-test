"__STAR_WARS__ I love the Ewoks!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, I never liked them. They look like teddy bears. They ruined Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, they didn't. They were awesome!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Awesome for cute little teddy bears, you mean."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's not fair. Chewbacca is cute too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Chewie would hurt you for even suggesting that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really don't see how you can think Chewbacca is tough, but ewoks are teddy bears."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ewoks are so small and they speak gibberish."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, because everyone can understand Chewbacca."
"__STAR_WARS__ Everyone in the movies, seems to do okay. Ewoks, are primitive teddy bears. You won't change my mind."
