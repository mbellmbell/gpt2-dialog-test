"__MOVIES__ Do you think you'll go see the new Transformers movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. It looks fun, but I've heard it's epically terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Aren't they all kind of terrible, though?"
"__MOVIES__ True. Anthony Hopkins is in it, which could be fun."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of lost track of the plot after the first one. I can't believe they're still making them."
"__MOVIES__ I can't figure out why giant robots that could go all over the universe have so much to do with the Earth."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's kind of what this new one is supposed to be about."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Maybe humans made them."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they made humans!"
"__MOVIES__ You know what the real problem is, though? They killed off Jazz right away."
"__MOVIES__ He would have made the series more fun. Fewer explosions, more story."
"__MOVIES__ Well, to be fair, this one has swords, not just explosions!"
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what Transformers would have transformed into if they were really around in Arthurian times?"
"__MOVIES__ They scan stuff and copy it, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. So they would pick some kind of interesting piece of technology."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe Starscream would have turned into the first window hinge."
"__MOVIES__ Or a piece of an aqueduct leftover from the Roman Empire."
"__MOVIES__ Chamberpot. Or an oil lamp."
"__MOVIES__ I read that in this one, there's a robot that is someone's butler."
"__MOVIES__ There may actually be no point to this movie, after all."
