"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love them all, but I think my favorite would have to be 'Half-Blood Prince.'"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, I love that one too.  I especially like the romance between Ron and Lavender Brown."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too!  All the kids are growing up and really starting to notice the opposite sex in that one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The relationship between Ron and Lavender is kind of the spark that gets Ron and Hermione together."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And then there's Harry and Ginny--they get together in this one too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ There really is a lot that goes on in 'Half-Blood Prince.'"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yep.  You find out about the horcruxes, you're introduced to Professor Slughorn . . ."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Malfoy joins the death eaters and Dumbledore dies at the end . . ."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, it's really an emotional roller coaster.  There's humor, passion, terror, and finally grief all rolled into one great movie!"
