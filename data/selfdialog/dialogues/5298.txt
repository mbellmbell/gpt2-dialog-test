"__STAR_WARS__ Someone told me you love Star Wars Episodes I, II and III... WHY?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because despite the poor performance in II and III, the set the tone for the later years..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Give me two reasons why they're better than the original films. I bet you can't!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't say they were better. Just that they were great. I'll give you two factors that are improvements over the originals though. Number one: the CGI effect allowed for more creatures, more beautiful landscapes, more action than ever before."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, I'll give you that one. The Naboo landscapes were gorgeous, and the underwater Gungan City were phenomenal. Reason number two?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It showed the origins of Anakin Skywalker, and the real reason why he turned to the dark side in the other films."
"__STAR_WARS__ The real reason? Do you mean that he turned to the dark side when Padme was killed?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, no, that's not what I mean. I mean, Anakin was never supposed to be a Jedi. He was never supposed to be good. It was only the love he received from his mother, from Qui-Gon, Padme and Obi-Wan that made him conflicted and want to be good. It was these warring factions inside himself that caused the emotional battles that ultimately brought balance to the force by his coming full circle."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know what to say. I'm speechless. Great points. May the force be with you."
"__STAR_WARS__ And also with you."
