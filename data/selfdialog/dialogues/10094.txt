"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which is the better Madlib collaboration album: Madvillainy or Pi単ata?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Madvillainy is definitely more iconic, but I actually prefer Pi単ata."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, that's really interesting. I didn't know other people felt that way too."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You mean you prefer Pi単ata as well?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yeah, definitely. One thing I like is all the different features."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, there are some great rappers on the album. You get quite a variety."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They're both classic albums though. Pi単ata is only slightly better in my opinion."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, and they're both very different albums with different stories and visions."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would love to see Madlib do an album like that with Mos Def."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That would be awesome! Too bad Yasiin Bey says he's retired now."
