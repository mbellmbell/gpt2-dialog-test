"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Got your fantasy team set up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not yet. I will be doing such soon. I am stilled baffled that the season's almost here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the one thing you are most looking to find out this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really want to see what happens with the Seahawks overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have had some serious controversy huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it seems like every season some report about their locker room comes out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened before this recent report again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They said that Wilson didn't have the support of the locker room."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How could you not support someone like him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. The guy plays his heart out despite being like 5'10' max."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He puts it all on the field regardless if he is injured or his line is porous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't agree with that. Now we have reports about Sherman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Weren't they actually actively trying to trade him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Seahawks admitted to dangling him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't find a lot of great corners. You can't just give one out or attempt to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He didn't have as good of a season last year, but the guy can still play at a high level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. The team definitely showed that they are completely ripe for the pickings when Earl Thomas is out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Shows that Sherman isn't the best on his team, but he's still great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a tendency to start slow too, so a record below .500 early in could definitely stir some things up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know. It's going to be interesting to observe."
