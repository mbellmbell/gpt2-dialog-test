"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the best game you ever played?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hallway football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hallway football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I'll bite. What is Hallway Football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just like it sounds. It is football you play in the hallway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What, like touch football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, like NFL football.  Full contact."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you fit 22 players in a hallway, along with referees?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, no, not like that!  It was a one-on-one game between I and my brother, played in the hallway next to the living room of our house, on our knees, on shag rug, with a nerf ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds crazy!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was! One player would hike the ball, and then try to pus their way down the hallway toward the doorway on the other end, which was the goal line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But where was your brother while you were crawling through the hallway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On my back mostly!  We spent hours crawling, slamming each other into the walls, and landing on top of each other until the other couldn't move anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds brutal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was, and it was great!  And we imagined that we were our favorite players from our favorite NFL teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What were your teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was the Stealers, and my brother was the Raiders. We were totally brutal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you wear uniforms or helmets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, we just wore our play closes, and that was the year I wore out the knees on five pairs of jeans on the carpet. My brother and I loved the game, but my mother definitely did not!"
