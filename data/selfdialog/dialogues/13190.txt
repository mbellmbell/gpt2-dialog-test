"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are the Bears gonna be this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're a terrible team and have been for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't have faith in Trubisky?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't have faith in the organization."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For one, they can't retain talent. Marshall, Forte, Jeffrey, all gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cutler too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cutler wasn't great but face it, he's the best QB they've ever had."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better than McMahon?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Way better. That team got by on its defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All Bears teams have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And this Bears team has a terrible defense as well!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're pretty sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's even sadder is how they think they're this legendary franchise because they won once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're an old team, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, with a long history of futility."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have the Ditka sketch though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And that's about it."
