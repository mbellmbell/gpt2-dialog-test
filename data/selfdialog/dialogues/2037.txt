"__MUSIC__ Did you notice that Taylor Swift is on Spotify now?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? That's cool I guess."
"__MUSIC__ What, you don't like her?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean she's fine, but never really my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I get that, she's more of a middle school thing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I did like some of her old stuff, even though I'm not a huge fan of country."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! Teardrops on My Guitar was the first thing I ever looked up on Google."
"__MUSIC__ What? That's so funny."
"__MUSIC__ I liked Our Song, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, people used to sing that in music class."
"__MUSIC__ True, it's definitely that kind of song."
"__MUSIC__ Catchy, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Has she even released anything lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I don't think so."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm pretty sure her last album was a few years ago."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that. It was my junior year of high school and everyone was obsessed."
"__MUSIC__ There were some good tracks. I liked Wonderland."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was fine."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you should give her a listen on Spotify."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, maybe I will."
