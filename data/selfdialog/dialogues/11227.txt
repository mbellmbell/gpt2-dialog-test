"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you have for MVP this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got Matt Ryan repeating again, I think the Falcons are going to have another great season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that, it is hard to win back to back though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you have for MVP?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Drew Brees is going to win it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, why do you think he's winning it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Saints are going to surprise everyone and win over 11 games and make the playoffs, and Brees will put up 5000 yards again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can definitely see the the 5000 yards happening, but the Saints winning that many games, I don't know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just have a feeling, either way it could be Brady and Rodgers too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they will always be up there, especially Aaron, the Packers are going to be very good this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too, they are my Superbowl favorites."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't believe that Rodgers only has one ring, he's been the the best player for the last five years at least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to agree, put him on the Patriots and they win every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, anybody with top 10 talent can succeed in that system."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, I wonder if Jimmy Garoppolo is even that good, or if it was the system."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Won't know until he gets a chance to shine, we'll see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think anyone is about to have a comeback season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Newton, he might get the Panthers back this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might, but I think he just had that one Superbowl season, I think the new young Quarter Backs are about to take over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I am so excited about that, hopefully this will be a competitive season."
