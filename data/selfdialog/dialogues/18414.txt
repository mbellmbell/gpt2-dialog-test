"__MOVIES__ I hate how everything has to be a cinematic universe now."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I blame Marvel."
"__MOVIES__ I guess in a way it's their fault since they were the first to do it, but it's hard to blame them for being successful."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't matter if this is what they wanted to happen or not. Their success lead everyone to copy them, ergo, it's their fault."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. I don't know, but I do know that some franchises just don't need cinematic universes."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, take The Mummy for example. The new one, not the Brendan Fraser movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I remember them advertising as something like 'The start of a Dark Universe'? Something like that."
"__MOVIES__ Right, right. From the start the movie was basically supposed to kick off a monster universe."
"__MOVIES__ So if it was successful, we'd get stuff like Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, but, you know, in color this time."
"__MOVIES__ Sort of. Despite having the original cinematic universe back, Universal Pictures has no idea how make one now."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, they had a few of those films where monsters would meet each other. Like Dracula and Frankenstein would be in the same film together."
"__MOVIES__ And now they want to do it again, to chase that sweet, sweet Marvel money, but they don't know what they're doing."
"__MOVIES__ Well, The Mummy basically bombing, does that mean this is the end of their ambitions?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably not. Dracula Untold was supposed to be the start of a cinematic universe too, before it bombed."
"__MOVIES__ You think they'll try again?"
"__MOVIES__ Did DC stop when Green Lantern failed?"
"__MOVIES__ I suppose not."
"__MOVIES__ See, they'll just keep trying over and over, until somehow they get it right."
"__MOVIES__ Or go bankrupt in the process!"
