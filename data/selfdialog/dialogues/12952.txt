"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ready to see Kirk Cousins light up the field this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. Can't wait for football season to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. My Redskins are looking great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't look better than my Giants though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Giants do look sick, I'll admit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know how we do... One good year and then one bad year and then back to good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they can slay the Pats again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Someone has to do it. We know the Falcons and Seahawks can't!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else does the Redskisn have this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I missed the draft, but I know we got that great new running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He looks crazy good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes indeed. I can't wait to see how moving through holes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited to see Christian McCaffrey as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's just what the Panthers need."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and an actual decent receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Benjamin is looking a bit big nowadays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's the Eddie Lacy of the Panthers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard he lost weight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did, supposedly, but he obviously has no self control. Seahawks might have messed up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see. Can't wait to see them play Marshawn this season!"
