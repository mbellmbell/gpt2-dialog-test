"__MUSIC__ Hey Marty, what are you doing?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, hey Doc, I'm about to plug my guitar into this giant amp!"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm...I think there's something wrong with that amp, you should try this smaller one here."
"__MUSIC__ Ok Doc, I will do that.  Want to hear what I've been practicing?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, Marty, what is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song.  That was the band's first number one song!"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that.  You seem to know a lot about Huey Lewis and the News."
"__MUSIC__ I sure do, they are my favorite band!"
"__MUSIC__ Cool, do you know any Huey Lewis Trivia?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Marty, let me think.  Did you know that they were originally called Huey Lewis and the American Express, but had to change their name because of the credit card company?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that...that's interesting.  I do know that Huey has a cameo in Back to the Future!"
"__MUSIC__ He sure does!  He has two songs in the movie.  The Power of Love, and Back in Time."
"__MUSIC__ Nice, what else do you know about the band?"
"__MUSIC__ During the 80s and 90s they had 19 top ten hits!"
"__MUSIC__ That's quite a few, they must have been really popular."
"__MUSIC__ They sure were, they were even nominated for an Academy Award for Power of Love."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that!  Did they win?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they were beaten out by 'Say You, Say Me'  by Lionel Richie."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad, but you know, it was an honor for them to be nominated!"
