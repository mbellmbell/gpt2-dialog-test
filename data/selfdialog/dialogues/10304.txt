"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you like any rap artists?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I do like some rap, but don't know who it is i'm hearing most of the time, i just know i like it"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, i get that. Tupac's one of my favorites."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, he was a cool dude. It was sad when he got killed."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ For sure. I also like DMX"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I've heard the name but i know so little rap music i couldn't identify him by song or picture!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's cool. It's not a contest, I was just wondering"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ haha. I do like it though, i've just never made a habit of listening so i don't get to know the artists"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think partially cause it wasn't a big thing when i was growing up so i never got in the habit. Probably if i grew up in a younger generation I would know more."
