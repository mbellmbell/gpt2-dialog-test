"__MOVIES__ Wait, do I have all the dreamworks movies?"
"__MOVIES__ How should I know? Do you have all the dreamworks movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I need a list of ALL the movies dreamworks made."
"__MOVIES__ Even the shorts?"
"__MOVIES__ They made shorts?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, to be honest, I have no idea. I have to go check. Let me get to a list here, let me see here. Whoa."
"__MOVIES__ What? Whoa, dude, they made 34 movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, 34 feature films, meaning full length theater movies. So, yes. 34 movies."
"__MOVIES__ That seems a lot. and I don't think I own them all. I wanna check, go down the list and read them off. I wanna check."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Want me to read the names of the movies? Ok Fine."
"__MOVIES__ Phew. I have seen all their movies, but I don't have all of them. Maybe half of them at most."
"__MOVIES__ Half more than I have."
"__MOVIES__ I like animations. Obviously. You know looking at this list does remind me that some dreamworks movies were flops."
"__MOVIES__ Not all studios can produce hits all of the time, every time."
"__MOVIES__ More like 'NO studios can do that.' See though. Sharktale shouldn't be ranked a low as that. That was a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Rottentomatoes rankings are not that reliable if you ask me. I think IMDB is much better at ranking the quality of the movies than RT."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, maybe, and this movie ratings is an example."
"__MOVIES__ So which ones do you not own and want to own now?"
"__MOVIES__ Rise of the guardians. hat's the Christmas Movie I told you about. it's so cute. It's a brand new spin on old Christmas stories."
"__MOVIES__ The one where Jack Frost loses his memories and turns into the guardian of having fun? That one?"
