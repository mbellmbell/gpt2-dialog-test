"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team is your favorite?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a fan of the Chargers."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah we would be pretty bad without him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We would also be bad without Rivers. Any players that you're looking forward to watching this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I'm excited for Martellus Bennet. I was amazed we signed a new free agent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he will go well with Rodgers. I'm really hoping Melving Gordon can have another good yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to see him do well, I was a fan of his on college. How do you think the Chargers will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll play really well but fall short of a wild card. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we should be able to win the division again. It's too bad your team's conference is so tough."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, unless one of the other teams surprises everyone, then we shouldn't have it too tough."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats tough but I have to say the Patriots. I think they'll end up playing us."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you ever bet on football at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I don't, but I know a few people that do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like to. Last year went well for me."
