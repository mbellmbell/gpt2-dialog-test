"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you ready for the next football season? Are you playing fantasy football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I am really ready. I'm tired of no sports playing at the moment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are you rooting for this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I am rooting for the seahawks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will be ready to get back to the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, Russell Wilson has been training his body and getting work done"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think the trouble between Wilson and the legion of Boom will affect this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think that was all created by the media, I really don't think there is any real substance going on here"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I kind of agree with you, I think when it all comes down to it, they all want to get back to the glory of the superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Lynch coming back and playing for the raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think it is crazy, it will be a must watch game when they play the seahawks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he will be back to his old self?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, he does not look fast in his training videos, he looks bigger, but he has always been big"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, not to mention that he is one year out of the league and 30 years old"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is ancient in terms of football"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure if he can handle the likes of the new and younger players in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I agree, he was a legend, but coming back after a year off is tough. Remember these are all pro players and they are all very good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True that. I hope he does well. Do you think the Patriots are going to repeat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom brady sure looks good, I think as long as he is healthy, they have a really good shot"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he is old, but as long as he doesn't get hit too often, he will be fine"
