"__MOVIES__ Pulp Fiction is on HBO so I just decided to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, I do that with Pulp Fiction too. If I am looking at the guide and I see it's on I watch it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a good enough movie you are still entertained each time you watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, i know what happens and still enjoy it. But honestly i like the Jules and Vincent story the best."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's the best when they are in the apartment and the guy shoots and misses each of them."
"__MOVIES__ I LOVE the look on Samuel L. Jackson's face when he realizes they have been missed by the bullets."
"__MOVIES__ I'll admit, the first time I saw it I didn't like it."
"__MOVIES__ I did, why didn't you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Because it's confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I get that. The story being told out of order is a bit confusing."
"__MOVIES__ It's more than a bit confusing when new characters pop up unrelated to the story you were just watching."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is. I am smiling and shaking my head over here."
"__MOVIES__ I also don't like the Mia story because I didn't know why she overdosed for years."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I knew what was happening so it was clear to me."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't understand if they were supposed to be in the 50's, or the 70,s or present day."
"__MOVIES__ Instead of the 90's I get that."
"__MOVIES__ I honestly didn't understand the movie the first time I watched it."
"__MOVIES__ It takes multiple viewing to catch everything."
"__MOVIES__ But after the second time I knew it was a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ A masterpiece is more like it!"
