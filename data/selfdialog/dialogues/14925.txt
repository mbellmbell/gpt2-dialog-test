"__ACTION__ What would you consider an iconic action movie or series?"
"__ACTION__ I have really enjoyed the Die Hard series. They weren't all stellar, but when they hit, they were really enjoyable."
"__ACTION__ The first one was such a classic. I didn't watch Bruce Willlis much on that TV show he did, but I really thought he made a great transition to films with Die Hard."
"__ACTION__ I loved how the filmmakers weren't afraid to blow a ton of shit up, and they ended up basically destroying the entire bulding by the end."
"__ACTION__ I've watched the film many times, and it's amazing how beat up John gets over the course of the film, but he keeps on fighting, and he's really believable."
"__ACTION__ I agree with you there. John was a really credible, realistic hero, and you could feel his pain and frustration and determination to get the bad guy."
"__ACTION__ And what a great bad guy! I love that he was urbane and witty and cultured and in the end, all he wanted was a shitload of money."
"__ACTION__ That movie really stands the test of time, too. The fight sequences were epic."
"__ACTION__ Guns, fights, lots of action, the hero reuniting with his estranged wife, the cop sidekick, the wisecracking FBI guys. A great movie all around."
"__ACTION__ I think Bruce Willis really eanred his rep as an action hero in this and subsequent movies."
