"__THRILLER__ I finally watched 'The Sixth Sense' last week."
"__THRILLER__ Wow, you were really late to the party on that one."
"__THRILLER__ It's funny that I just never got around to watching it before."
"__THRILLER__ So what did you think of it?"
"__THRILLER__ Surprisingly, I didn't figure out the ending, and no one has ever spoiled it for me."
"__THRILLER__ Oh that's great, because if you know beforehand, the whole film would have been ruined for you."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I can't believe I didn't see the ending coming."
"__THRILLER__ When I saw it when it first came out, I didn't figure it out either."
"__THRILLER__ I guess that's why they call it a twist."
"__THRILLER__ It's so much fun when it happens and you don't see it coming."
