"__ROCK__ What are you doing?"
"__ROCK__ Talking to myself..."
"__ROCK__ Is anybody listening?"
"__ROCK__ I don't think so. I think I put myself to sleep."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, you are quite the conversationalist."
"__ROCK__ Uh-huh."
"__ROCK__ OK. Do you mind if I change the topic of conversation to rock music?"
"__ROCK__ Fine. Just stay away from death musicians...they freak me out."
"__ROCK__ Ok. Did you hear that Ozzie Osbourne is making a come-back?"
"__ROCK__ Why? Did he tire of needlepoint?"
