"__STAR_WARS__ The special effects in Star Wars are some of the greatest in movie history!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, there was a lot of new technology in them when they first came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ The puppets in the movies are spectacular, and they looks so real in some of the scenes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some of Tattooine is still around, they just built it in the dessert."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that some of the sound effects are just crazy combos of everyday stuff.  Like the Tie Fighter is an elephant mixed with a car driving over wet pavement."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is insane how they can make those sounds out of something so different."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the scenery in some of the planets too.  Especially the Hoth, the snow is beautiful."
"__STAR_WARS__ That always was one of my favorite scenes to watch, the fighting and all of the action."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even the wampa that they stuffed Luke inside was pretty cool, a little gross."
"__STAR_WARS__ It looked so real though!"
