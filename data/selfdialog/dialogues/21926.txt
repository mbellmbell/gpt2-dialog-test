"__DISNEY__ What do you think about Disney buying Star Wars?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's a good move. They have the money to do great things."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure the casting and graphics will be amazing."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think it loses something by becoming so commercial?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it started to lose it's specialness when they did episodes 1-3."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, come on! Episodes 2 and 3 were pretty good."
"__DISNEY__ The dialogue was atrocious."
"__DISNEY__ I think you have to step back and see it differently. Anakin and Padme were teenagers. Their angsty dialogue fits."
"__DISNEY__ And then Padme dies in childbirth for no reason but a broken heart?"
"__DISNEY__ No, the Emperor sucked her life force to save Anakin."
