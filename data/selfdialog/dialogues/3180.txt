"__MUSIC__ Have you seen Psy's new music videos?"
"__MUSIC__ Psy?  Isn't he the Korean pop singer who did 'Gangnam Style?'"
"__MUSIC__ Yes he is.  He released two new music videos called 'I Luv it' and 'New Face.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, I had no idea.  I didn't realize he still did music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yea, he does.  He's huge in Korea."
"__MUSIC__ How are his new music videos and songs?"
"__MUSIC__ They are very catchy and fun videos."
"__MUSIC__ Better than 'Gangnam Style?'"
"__MUSIC__ I think 'Gangnam Style' set too high a bar."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, it was so unique.  Catchy song, crazy dance moves and music video setting."
"__MUSIC__ It became such a huge recognizable meme."
"__MUSIC__ And it was interesting that a foreign music video by a foreign artist became such a major part of our own pop culture."
"__MUSIC__ Even though K-pop is becoming extremely popular around the world, none of the other artists made it as mainstream as Psy."
"__MUSIC__ Does he do similar in his new videos?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, he does definitely try to replicate the magic of 'Gangnam Style.'  Gentleman, Daddy, I Luv it, and New Face all have the same trademark dance moves, settings, and catchy hook."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check out the videos when I get home."
"__MUSIC__ Do so, and let me know what you think."
"__MUSIC__ I will."
"__MUSIC__ I hope he keeps making more videos.  I'm always eager to see the new ones."
"__MUSIC__ I'll let you know what I think of the videos after I watch them."
