"__MUSIC__ Yo! Let's do a jam session sometime."
"__MUSIC__ What's a jam session."
"__MUSIC__ Where we just start making music together, impromptu."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I would suck at that."
"__MUSIC__ You don't need to be good to jam. You play any instruments?"
"__MUSIC__ I played piano once when I was kid."
"__MUSIC__ Perfect! Let's get you on a piano and just start playing."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really remember how to play though. It's been a while."
"__MUSIC__ I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Come here let's go to the piano"
"__MUSIC__ Okay."
"__MUSIC__ Alright I'll start by giving you a beat."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, what do I do now?"
"__MUSIC__ It's easy just start playing in any key."
"__MUSIC__ Like this?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. See this isn't too bad right?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess so. Now what do I do?"
"__MUSIC__ Start changing up the keys!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Hey this is kind of fun."
"__MUSIC__ You bet. And the better we get at it, the faster we can make a mix tape."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah funny."
