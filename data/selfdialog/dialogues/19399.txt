"__MOVIES__ Did you see Moonlight yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I did. It was pretty decent. Don't think it deserved to win Best Picture though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I would have picked La La Land."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
"__MOVIES__ Though I do think Moonlight deserved to be nominated."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can see that."
"__MOVIES__ I personally don't get too hung up on who wins though."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither. I just like to try and catch as many of the nominees as I can."
"__MOVIES__ So do I. I find that I have caught a lot of great movies that way."
"__MOVIES__ Right? I don't think I would have watched Hell Or High Water if not for it being nominated."
"__MOVIES__ Same with me and Lion."
"__MOVIES__ It's a great way to help some less mainstream films get attention."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Still, it's fun when the one you're rooting for wins."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but that is rarely what happens."
"__MOVIES__ They pick the right movie sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Such as?"
"__MOVIES__ The Silence of the Lambs? The Departed?"
"__MOVIES__ Those were pretty solid picks."
"__MOVIES__ It's interesting how rarely best picture is also a hit film anymore though."
"__MOVIES__ Well I think that has a lot to do with the volume of movies being produced these days."
