"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not racism, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course not. Blacks make up, what, 13% of America? They make up 70% of the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is NOT racism."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there is a difference in the positions they gravitate towards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Running backs are 86% black"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And wide receivers are 91% black"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And, the corners. cornerbacks are 96% black"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the safeties are 90% black."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe It has to do with genes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably, and since much of physical movements needed in NFL are biomechanically analyzable, we can even quantify the traits."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kinesiology"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep and there are experts in NFL who specialize in Kinesiology"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably have the meaurements down to a science, like the leg length, arm length, muscle strength, speed. etc"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The reason black sprinters dominate the Olympics because they have long legs and higher center of gravity"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How does that help?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, running isn't just applying muscle power, Running is turning potential eneergy in your body into kinetic energy.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So.. how does that help?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it helps because higher center of gravity means more mass on top to store as potential energy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh... So more potential energy, more... kinetic energy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which means they're faster."
