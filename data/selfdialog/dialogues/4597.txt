"__MUSIC__ Can we talk about Kendrick Lamar's music?"
"__MUSIC__ Who? Kenny, K Dot, Mr. Lamar, Kendrick, of course we can!"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I'm being hyperbolic when I say straight up that he is the best storyteller of our generation."
"__MUSIC__ You're not being hyperbolic. I don't even know who would come close."
"__MUSIC__ Vince Staples is a pretty good storyteller, but he's got a ways to come."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you're right Vince Staples is good, but I think his newer stuff is veering away from storytelling a bit."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Kendrick's storytelling is just unbelievable."
"__MUSIC__ I know, good kid, m.A.A.d. city brings you into Kendrick's mind and out on the streets of Compton."
"__MUSIC__ It feels so true, which of course I don't know if that's the case because I grew up in a totally different circumstance than Kendrick."
"__MUSIC__ Same, I also grew up in an affluent middle class suburb, but I can't help but feel that it's authentic, that's what people who have shared his experience say."
"__MUSIC__ That's amazing that it's authentic, but also can connect on such a broad level."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, good kid, maad city is a special album. I love how weird it sounds."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Kendrick switching voices, getting pitchy, slowing his voice down, sing-speaking, etc., is all risky, but he pulls it off."
"__MUSIC__ We have to talk about the sequencing too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the sequencing totally changes the meaning of his tracks."
"__MUSIC__ For example, Backseat Freestyle on its own sounds like a crazy boast. Pretty standard for hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ Right, and then it's followed by 'The Art of Peer Pressure' which is super introspective, about not knowing who one is, about regretting stupid things one has done, about being vulnerable."
"__MUSIC__ It's crazy. His sequencing is absurdly good, I don't think people appreciate it enough."
"__MUSIC__ DAMN. is another great example of this. You can play it forward and then play it backwards and the meaning changes."
"__MUSIC__ Did we ever get word from Kendrick himself on whether that was intentional? Either way, I love the effect of reversing it."
