"__MUSIC__ I remember when everyone thought K-Pop was going to take over the music industry. I guess that didn't happen."
"__MUSIC__ It was silly to think it ever would."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I kind of get it.  Psy had a couple hits, and there are a few big groups like Girls' Generation, but no way South Korea could dominate the entire music industry."
"__MUSIC__ Girls' Generation is pretty big though. Japan loves them, too."
"__MUSIC__ It's not surprising, Japan has been big for idol groups for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I suppose so. They even have virtual idols."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, like Miku Hatsune, and the other Vocaloids. Which, to be fair, is a pretty decent music making program."
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget all those video game idols they have too, like in the Idolmaster and Love Live games."
"__MUSIC__ I never really got much into the idol stuff. I like Babymetal though."
"__MUSIC__ Babymetal kind of feels like a parody of idol groups to me."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but it's more of an affectionate parody in that case. They're a fun group."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song by them?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably either 'Megitsune', or 'Doki Doki Morning'."
"__MUSIC__ I like 'Awadama Fever' from their newest album best."
"__MUSIC__ That one came out last year, right? I wonder when they'll make another album."
"__MUSIC__ It might be a while, they really blew up and now they've been touring a lot."
"__MUSIC__ If their live shows are anything like their music videos I bet it's a fun time. Their videos are really creative."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're pretty cool. It's hard not to like them."
"__MUSIC__ People try though, but Rob Zombie has their backs. He defended them against people who said they weren't a real metal group."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, they met him, and Rob Halford, too. They know a lot of famous musicians; if anyone will take over the industry it'll those kids."
