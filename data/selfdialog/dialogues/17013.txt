"__MOVIES__ What do you think will do big this year at the box office?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well, you know Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is definitely going to do well for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's true, but I'm not going to see it in theaters, I'll wait to stream it."
"__MOVIES__ I never watch movies via streaming. I prefer to watch my movies on disc."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I could never give up Netflix. They make the best original films these days."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I will admit that their Death Note movie does seem interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they have a ton of neat movies coming out, like To the Bone."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, is that the movie with Keanu Reeves?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one."
"__MOVIES__ It's been forever since I've seen him in anything. I think the last thing I watched he was in was Knock Knock."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't watch John Wick?"
"__MOVIES__ John Wick? I didn't watch The Matrix!"
"__MOVIES__ You gotta be kidding me! Tell me you're joking!"
"__MOVIES__ I will tell you that, because I am. Though, actually, I always preferred Johnny Mnemonic."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot about that movie. We could use more cyberpunk films like that."
"__MOVIES__ Cyberpunk movies went out of style 20 years ago."
"__MOVIES__ True, but maybe the new Blade Runner will rekindle the genre?"
"__MOVIES__ Sequels made so long after the original are never good. For example, Zoolander 2, Anchorman 2, Blues Brothers 2000; need I go on?"
"__MOVIES__ I see your Blues Brothers and raise you a The Force Awakens."
"__MOVIES__ Debatable my friend. Though, if you had said Rogue One I'd give you that, even if it is more of a spin-off than a real sequel."
