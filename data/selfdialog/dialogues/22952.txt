"__DISNEY__ Do all of the Disney classic movies have singing in them?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't think they do. There are live action ones that don't."
"__DISNEY__ But the animated ones?"
"__DISNEY__ Most do for sure, but I don't know about all of them. There are a few I haven't seen."
"__DISNEY__ Which ones?"
"__DISNEY__ I never saw the Black Cauldron and it has been years since I've seen Sword in the Stone."
"__DISNEY__ Those certainly aren't the more popular ones."
"__DISNEY__ No, definitely not."
"__DISNEY__ I really like the ones from the early 90s and late 80s."
"__DISNEY__ Well that's when we got Beauty and the Beast, the Little Mermaid, and Lion King so I can see why!"
