"__DISNEY__ Yes! She was the villiain of the whole film."
"__DISNEY__ I suppose that is true, I just always felt sympathy for her plight."
"__DISNEY__ Just because you felt badly for her does not make her a saint."
"__DISNEY__ True, I just did not see her as evil as I guess she was."
"__DISNEY__ She was evil, she tricks Ariel to gain rulership of the sea."
"__DISNEY__ I am not saying she did not do some bad things. I suppose I just need to admit she is evil."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, yes you do. You can still enjoy her, I do."
"__DISNEY__ I will always enjo ursula. She had some great numbers. Think I just wanted to make her out to be not so bad."
"__DISNEY__ We are what we are. She is a villiain with a good voice."
