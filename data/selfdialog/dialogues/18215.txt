"__MOVIES__ Did you know they're coming out with another Ring movie?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean, another Ring movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's another sequel to the Ring!  I think this will be the third one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that scary movie!  Yeah, I loved the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but the second one was really lame.  I'm hoping the third will be better."
"__MOVIES__ What's it called?  The Ring 3?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's called Rings."
"__MOVIES__ Well I wonder what this one will be about.  So often it seems like horror movies just decline in quality with each sequel they make."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that the truth!  I don't know, I hope it's as scary as the first one."
"__MOVIES__ I think the first one was just downright creepy!  I got nightmares after watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I had to sleep with a light on for several weeks."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny, me too!  I do love a good horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, even the old Jason and Freddy movies were great."
"__MOVIES__ I know!  I was watching a Nightmare on Elm Street marathon just the other week."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those are always fun to re-watch.  I love it when they play them around Halloween."
"__MOVIES__ Me too!  I always try to binge watch them then."
"__MOVIES__ Well it seems like they keep making those too, and they do kinda decline in quality over time."
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah, but I guess they just run out of ideas maybe."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  I think it's just like everything else in life."
"__MOVIES__ They don't make them like they used to."
