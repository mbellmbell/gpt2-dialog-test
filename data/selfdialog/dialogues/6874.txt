"__STAR_WARS__ So you know, Greedo shot first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Um, says you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Come on."
"__STAR_WARS__ No really. The original Star Wars trilogy, without the new special edition, is what counts. And Han Solo clearly shot first"
"__STAR_WARS__ The THX remastered version?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that is the definitive account of Star Wars. Nothing else matters. No CGI'd aliens, not Jar Jar Binks, none of it."
"__STAR_WARS__ OK, but doesn't that make Han kind of a scoundrel?`"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course it does. That's what Han is. That's why it's significant that he later finds the good inside and helps the rebellion."
"__STAR_WARS__ Man, you really take this stuff seriously."
"__STAR_WARS__ What can I say? I'm a Star Wars purist."
