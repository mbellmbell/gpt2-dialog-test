"__MOVIES__ Way better."
"__MOVIES__ What about Jackie Brown?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup. That one, too."
"__MOVIES__ That's impossible."
"__MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Jackie Brown is criminally underrated."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't mean it's better, though."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's subjective. But, in all seriousness, you can't beat the characters in Jackie Brown."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's subjective, too."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, but I think we're just going to have to agree it disagree on this one. I liked it, but I haven't seen one as good as Jackie Brown, yet. Django was up there, though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. Django was great."
"__MOVIES__ Django was great, but I thought it went downhill a little when they get to Candyland."
"__MOVIES__ No way! Candyland was the best part. That's where he goes crazy on everybody."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that part was good, but it takes so long to get there after they first arrive. Also, I can't stand Calvin Candie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you're not supposed to."
"__MOVIES__ I know, and that's a testament to Leonardo DiCaprio. But, I want to like a villain at least a little bit. Look at Ordell in Jackie Brown."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, here we go."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sorry, but it's my favorite. I don't know if he'll ever make one that good again."
"__MOVIES__ I like it, too. But, I need more action in my Tarantino movies."
"__MOVIES__ Not me. I'm perfectly content with shady people just doing some shady things."
