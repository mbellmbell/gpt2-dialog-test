"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's a real shame about the Blues not advancing to the finals, isn't it?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, it is. I'm bummed."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who'd they lose to, the Predators?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, Nashville beat them 3-1."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ At least they made it to game 6!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah. Did you hear about Tarasenko?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He has to have surgery, right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, that's what the Russian news reported but it wasn't right."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Huh!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah he claims he won't need surgery."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He played well this season. How do you think Mike Yeo did as head coach?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think he did pretty well."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm kind of glad they let Hitchcock go."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ We'll see how Yeo does."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think it sets us up for next season."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Possibly. I'd love to see us in the Cup someday."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too, but you know how it goes--always in the semis, never in the finals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ain't that the truth!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well maybe next year will be our year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hope so! Let's Go Blues!"
