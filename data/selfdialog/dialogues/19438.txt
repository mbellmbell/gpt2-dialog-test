"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new, live-action Beauty and the Beast yet?"

"__MOVIES__ You're right she was perfect as Belle."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part of the movie?"

"__MOVIES__ Was there anything that you didn't like about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought Gaston's character was a lot darker than the original."
"__MOVIES__ Totally,  the part where he left Maurice to die in the woods was disturbing."
"__MOVIES__ I think it made the movie a little too scary for young kids."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely,  the original had a few scary scenes, but this was much more intense."

"__MOVIES__ Did you like how they handled the enchanted objects?"
