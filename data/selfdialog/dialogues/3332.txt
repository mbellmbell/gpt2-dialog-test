"__MUSIC__ Do you like John Mellencamp?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, but it's not without reservations."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ He writes some incredibly good songs that I love deep down inside, but he's really hit and miss."
"__MUSIC__ So what do you do, just listen to greatest hits compilations?"
"__MUSIC__ No, my choices don't match up very well with theirs. I have an iTunes playlist that I made of my favorite songs by him."
"__MUSIC__ Good idea. If I wasn't so lazy, I could do that with a few different artists that I feel that way about."
"__MUSIC__ I recommend it. You know, there's a funny thing about him --"
"__MUSIC__ Please don't tell me that story about when your sister's friend met him AGAIN."
"__MUSIC__ No, no. I was going to say that it seems like his music matures almost in sync with me. He grows and changes just when I do."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Well, I guess I kind of see what you mean. I can't listen to anything before Scarecrow without it being a pure nostalgia trip."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, me too. And Scarecrow is starting to go that way for me now."
"__MUSIC__ Favorite album from him? Mine's Human Wheels."
"__MUSIC__ I guess Mr. Happy Go Lucky, but it's a little hard to day because even that one only has so many I songs on it that I like."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song Empty Hands. In a way it could be heard as a Christmas song,  but it's really so much more."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. It's excellent. And it shows something about him which I love, his concern and support for the common people."
"__MUSIC__ True, true. Farm Aid and all."
"__MUSIC__ Right. I think they still do that."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. But I don't like to think too much about his personal life."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I agree. All that smoking and so many marriages."
