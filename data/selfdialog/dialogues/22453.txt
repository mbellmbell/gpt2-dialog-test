"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the very first Disney movie you ever saw?"
"__DISNEY__ I do! I saw Bambi at the drive in movie theater."
"__DISNEY__ At the drive in? Wow, that's cool."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I remember how cool it was. I loved the short movie clips they played before the movie too."
"__DISNEY__ They are starting to bring back some of those too."
"__DISNEY__ I noticed! I saw an old time Mikey Mouse clip last time I went to the theater."
"__DISNEY__ How fun! I just love how things have evolved."
"__DISNEY__ It gets better every year. The 3D Disney movies are my favorites now!"
"__DISNEY__ I saw Toy Story 2 in 3D! I absolutely loved it!"
"__DISNEY__ I wish it was easier to watch 3D movies from home. I love them, but don't like the price tag at the theaters."
