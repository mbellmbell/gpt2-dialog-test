"__ACTION__ DId you watch the movie 'Unbreakable'?"
"__ACTION__ Yes, that is the one with Bruce Willis as the Security Guard."
"__ACTION__ Yes, he did a good job. I was expecting something like he usually does, but this one had a slow pace."
"__ACTION__ I really did not expect him to turn into a super hero, it really picked up on all the action and suspense, great ending"
"__ACTION__ Did you catch the twist at the ending?"
"__ACTION__ Kinda, can you fill me in a bit?"
"__ACTION__ Well starts out Bruce is a security guard with one kid, and he and his wife are having issues. He is on a train going to NYC, for an interview."
"__ACTION__ That is when the train wrecks and he is the only one, left alive."
"__ACTION__ Yes, and the reason he was left alive was that he had the powers of a superhero, but he had no idea."
"__ACTION__ Then he runs into the man that has the broken bone disease. Who in turns in the end orchestrated the entire thing. Bruce was the good guy and the other guy was MR. Glass."
