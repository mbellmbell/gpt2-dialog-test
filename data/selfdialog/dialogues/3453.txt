"__MUSIC__ Are you much of a country music fan?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I can't say I am."
"__MUSIC__ I'm the same way, I just can't really get into the stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Why did you bring it up."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I've got a new girlfriend, and she's really into country music."
"__MUSIC__ Yikes! She might not be a keeper."
"__MUSIC__ Settle down. We get along great and she's an amazing woman, it's just the country music thing."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to any country music since you guys started dating?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I've tried to get into it a little, or at least see what she sees in it."
"__MUSIC__ And how has that gone?"
"__MUSIC__ Not amazingly well. I've found a few songs that are OK, but mostly I'm not a fan."
"__MUSIC__ What have you liked."
"__MUSIC__ There's a song called 'My Wish' that's not bad."
"__MUSIC__ Who sings it?"
"__MUSIC__ A group called 'Rascal Flatts'."
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me neither until recently. Some of it is decent, but most of it just doesn't work for me."
"__MUSIC__ Are you going to keep listening to country music?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I sort of have to, as long as I'm with my girlfriend."
"__MUSIC__ Poor guy! Maybe you'll start to get used to it."
