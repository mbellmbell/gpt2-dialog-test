"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Coldplay? They are my favorite band of all time!"
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard a couple of their songs...Do you have any you could show me?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I have their CD from a few years ago, it's called 'X&Y' from 2005. I'll lend it to you."
"__MUSIC__ Ok that would be great! What is their sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's ballad type songs, and a sort of pop-like sound. But better then standard pop."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I might like that. Do they have real talent?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, although, Coldplay got in trouble several years ago for plagiarism."
"__MUSIC__ What? what does that mean, what did they do?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they apparently stole music from other musicians who weren't very well known. And even admitted to it.."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's not cool. How'd they get away with that?"
"__MUSIC__ They took music from really low level musicians who weren't well known and didn't have their music out there. So know one knew."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I just googled it. Yeah, apparently Coldplay changed the songs just enough, so know one noticed for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't approve of what they did, but, I am ashamed to admit I still like their music."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, well that's ok. I can't wait to hear some, I guess I won't focus on the plagiarism."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I listened to a Coldplay song and then I listened to the song they supposedly plagiarized. Coldplay sounded so much better."
"__MUSIC__ Well I guess they do have some talent then!"
"__MUSIC__ They do, and I hope the lead singer Chris Martin has since turned from his ways. I doubt he still plagiarizes, it would be too risky at this point."
"__MUSIC__ oh yeah, Chris Martin, wasn't he married to Gwyneth Paltrow?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but they got divorced and now he's dating, I think Jennifer Lawrence."
"__MUSIC__ Must be nice to be Chris Martin lol."
