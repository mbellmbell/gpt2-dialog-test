"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ It's so difficult to pick just one album!"
"__BEATLES__ I know, I feel like they spanned so many genres that there is something for everyone."
"__BEATLES__ Agreed.  That said, I would probably say that the White Album is my favorite."
"__BEATLES__ The album most people tend to choose?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, but I think it truly deserves the praise."
"__BEATLES__ Could you explain what you mean?"
"__BEATLES__ Of course!  It marked a real departure from the rest of their catalog and an evolution in their sound."
"__BEATLES__ It doesn't hurt that there are multiple popular songs on that album."
"__BEATLES__ Of course not.  I'd say it's almost like The Wall of the Beatles catalog because it has so many popular songs and is so iconic."
