"__MOVIES__ Do you like  gory movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Like horror gory or just slasher films?"
"__MOVIES__ No I am talking about Tarantino-esque movies"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, no I do not see the point of it."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither, there is no appeal to them."
"__MOVIES__ They do quite well so we may be in the minority."
"__MOVIES__ I think there is no point in having them in these movies."
"__MOVIES__ I would move away from it as well but I could see why they do well."
"__MOVIES__ Whys that?"
"__MOVIES__ People love to see that dramatic part of stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Its not needed in these films."
"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about horror movies using it?"
"__MOVIES__ Its important to show how vile some of the villains are."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I would probably say you are right."
"__MOVIES__ But even then some of it can be brought back,"
"__MOVIES__ I like the mind suspense ones better anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Thats really my point, people can make a movie without needing a ton of blood."
"__MOVIES__ I like the psychological thrillers that just really move you as far as being scared."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah seeing blood doesnt make me scared just pissed off sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ There hasnt been a ton of those types released lately"
