"__DISNEY__ Did you ever watch Aladdin when you were a little kid?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, all the time! It was my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I loved the music in it so much."
"__DISNEY__ 'One Jump Ahead' is my favorite, especially when that one lady sings 'still I think he's rather tasty' in a weird voice."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite is 'Prince Ali,' I love the scene during that song, there's so much going on!"
"__DISNEY__ Aladdin and Jasmine both had such cute pets, too."
"__DISNEY__ I would definitely be happy to have Abu or Rajah as a pet. They were both very loyal."
"__DISNEY__ Though Abu was a little mischievous!"
"__DISNEY__ I was surprised he listened to Aladdin and gave those kids his bread!"
"__DISNEY__ He was so cute and pouty because he didn't want to, though. The kids were very happy with him!"
