"__DISNEY__ Did you hear about the live action Little Mermaid movie that's coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I'm really excited!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too. I loved the cartoon version. Ariel is one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ Mine too. Do you know who is playing Ariel?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't heard yet. They'll need a good actress."
"__DISNEY__ They'll need good cast for Eric, Ursula and King Triton too."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if it's all going to be filmed underwater or on a green screen?"
"__DISNEY__ I would think a green screen!"
"__DISNEY__ Wouldn't that sort of cheapen it?"
"__DISNEY__ Nah, with effects these days it will look great. Besides, they have to add in Flounder and Sebastian!"
