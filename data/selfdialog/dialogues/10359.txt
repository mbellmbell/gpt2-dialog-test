"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Man, what's with all these mumble rappers on the radio like Future and Lil Uzi Vert?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah man, I can never understand what any of them are saying in their songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Remember music like The Fugees and Mobb Deep? Whatever happened to good rap music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Speaking of Mobb Deep, did you hear that Prodigy just died?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No way, I didn't know that! Do they know what happened to him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, he was battling sickle cell anemia for years. Sad to see a legend like him pass."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Tell me about it man. The Infamous is probably one of my favorite rap albums of all time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's definitely a classic man, I've had it on repeat all day after hearing the news."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'll make sure to pour out a 40 for him after I go to the liquor store. Rest in peace to the legend."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Totally man, come over. We'll have a couple beers and listen to some of his music in his honor."
