"__MOVIES__ I'm looking for a good movie to watch!"
"__MOVIES__ Any particular genre you are interested in?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually yes, comedy. I want to laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Hm, what is a movie you think is funny?"
"__MOVIES__ The Hangover is the funniest movie I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that is hilarious. So you like raunchy comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but not just that. I think Elf is hilarious too and that's totally family friendly."
"__MOVIES__ Good call, yeah that is a funny movie. So are you a Will Ferrell fan then?"
"__MOVIES__ He has made lots of funny movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree, although it's been a while since I've seen one of his that really made me laugh a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that is true."
"__MOVIES__ How about Sausage Party?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually just saw that. It was OK."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Jump Street movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, saw both of them, very funny."
"__MOVIES__ So you might be looking for something a little more obscure?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'd say so. I've seen lots of mainstream comedies. Something under the radar would be good."
"__MOVIES__ You should watch the Inbetweeners movie. It's a sequel to a hilarious British TV show."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I've heard of that. It's on Netflix. I think I'll check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You won't regret it!"
