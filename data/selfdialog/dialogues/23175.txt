"__DISNEY__ Have you watched Toy Story?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course, who hasn't!?"
"__DISNEY__ Doesn't it make you wish your childhood toys could have come to life?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, definitely!"
"__DISNEY__ Did you have any of the same toys as in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I had a Mr. Potato Head and a slinky, but just a plain slinky, no dog head or tail. How about you?"
"__DISNEY__ I had both of those too. I even had a cowboy doll, but it looked a little different than Woody."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think it would have freaked you out to see your toys come to life?"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe at first, but then it would have been pretty awesome!"
"__DISNEY__ Who knows, maybe all our toys really did come to life but we never knew about it just like Andy didn't!"
