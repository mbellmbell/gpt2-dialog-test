"__ACTION__ What is a good action movie to watch?"
"__ACTION__ We could watch Law Abiding Citizen."
"__ACTION__ Oh, I haven't seen that for a long time. Gerard Butler was fantastic in that!"
"__ACTION__ He was. I definitely didn't expect it to be so dark."
"__ACTION__ Me either. Especially after seeing him play the good guy so much."
"__ACTION__ I know what you mean. He was a really good guy in Gamer."
"__ACTION__ Exactly. He went from misunderstood hero to crazy vigilante like it was nothing."
"__ACTION__ I was completely on the edge of my seat during Gamer."
"__ACTION__ Me too. Also, his role in 300, just amazing."
"__ACTION__ I know! He's such a great actor, he can really do anything."
