"__ROCK__ Are you at all a fan of Metallica's self-titled album?"
"__ROCK__ That's the one they call the black album, right?"
"__ROCK__ That's the one. I've been told that a lot of metal fans don't like it much."
"__ROCK__ That's understandable, considering that the band went from thrash metal to more straightforward hard rock on the album."
"__ROCK__ So you don't like it?"
"__ROCK__ Actually, I do. I respect Metallica for taking such a bold risk."
"__ROCK__ That was unexpected. Do you like all of their more rock-oriented albums?"
"__ROCK__ Honestly, I am. Like I said, I appreciated them for the risks that they took."
"__ROCK__ But what's your opinion on the music itself?"
"__ROCK__ I really like it. Can't go wrong with a little variety."
