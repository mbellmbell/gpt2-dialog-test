"__MUSIC__ I just love jazz. I don't know a lot about it, but I love most of it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so do I. I loved all that 'light' jazz in the 80s. Kenny G, Earl Klugh"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Kenny G was a bit cheesy, but I loved Earl Klugh and had all his albums."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! What was your favorite piece?"
"__MUSIC__ Waiting for Kathy. I was probably around 18 and I remember listening to that over and over."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Modern Jazz Quartet?"
"__MUSIC__ Funny, back when I was in my early 20s, a family friend took me to see them. I was bored. Now I LOVE THEM."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, yes. I love Milt Jackson. Bag's Groove is a fave!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and I love that one too. Milt was already deceased when I saw them in a reunion concert."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like that big band stuff very much."
"__MUSIC__ Ohhh, I love it. You kind of have to dig deeper than Glenn Miller."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's exactly who I think of when I think big band."
"__MUSIC__ His stuff is great, but over-played, at least these days when people want to reminisce."
"__MUSIC__ Who else do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I've bought some Tommy Dorsey, some Harry James. Some Duke Ellington."
"__MUSIC__ My Dad loves Harry James."
"__MUSIC__ Check out Green Onion - fab!"
"__MUSIC__ I will! Who else should I try out?"
"__MUSIC__ Go to internet archive and listen to some of the old WWII weekly radio broadcasts for the troops - a lot of variety."
"__MUSIC__ Cool! And it will sort of jump me back to the actual period."
