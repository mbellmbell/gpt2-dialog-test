"__MOVIES__ Do you think moonlight should have won best picture?"
"__MOVIES__ I do and I don't.I really liked LA LA LAND, I was so horrified by the mix up. It took away from Moonlight's win."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was unfortunate for sure. But did you think moonlight was the better film?"
"__MOVIES__ Like I said I am torn, they are so different.  I thought moonlight had some strong performances and was great to see a small movie get recognition."
"__MOVIES__ I also liked a smaller budget film getting credit. but am not sure it was truly a better film overall. Much more serious / darker subject matter."
"__MOVIES__ Moonlight definitely showcased a more taboo subject matter. So maybe to me wins over the lighter la la land."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. I felt la la land, had funny moments, but I was also in tears in the theater. I think the academy tends to award drama more."
"__MOVIES__ Probably true, more drama winners than comedies. Both were great films win or loose. Or even if they never got nominated."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. You know what film got snubbed in my mind?"
"__MOVIES__ What? So hard to guess.."
"__MOVIES__ Arrival.  I think it was deserving of many more nominations. did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did see it. I liked it a lot. Amy Adams was snubbed for sure, she deserved at least a nomination."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. her performance was so believable. She stole the movie. I can't believe she was not recognized."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose they can't nominate everyone."
"__MOVIES__ But Adams really was overlooked big time, she deserved it."
"__MOVIES__ More than Viola Davis or Emma stone?"
"__MOVIES__ No I am not saying that they did both also deserve their nominations. Just felt Amy was overlooked for Arrival."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough. She has been great in a lot of movies. Did you see doubt or the fighter?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, loved her performance in both ."
"__MOVIES__ She is a strong actress."
