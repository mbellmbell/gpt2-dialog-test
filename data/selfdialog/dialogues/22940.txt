"__DISNEY__ Had you ever seen the original Adventures in Babysitting?"
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know there was an original.  Was it good?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved it as a kid, but I didn't like it as much when I watched it again."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that sucks.  Should I even bother?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess.  There are some funny parts to it."
"__DISNEY__ I guess you thought it was funnier when you were a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Probably so.  Was the newer one any good?"
"__DISNEY__ It was okay."
"__DISNEY__ That doesn't sound promising."
"__DISNEY__ I guess neither one was great."
