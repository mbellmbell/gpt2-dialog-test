"__MUSIC__ Do you like southern rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes, got someone on your mind?"

"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I have heard of them."

"__MUSIC__ I might have."
"__MUSIC__ He does a lot of good stuff."
"__MUSIC__ What does CCR even stand for?"
"__MUSIC__ Creedence Clearwater Revival. It is an older southern rock band I enjoy."
"__MUSIC__ They have many songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Quite a few. I tend to like their stuff like Susie Q and Green River."
"__MUSIC__ So they have a pretty big library of songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, very large. They made a lot of songs before Fogerty went solo."
"__MUSIC__ Any good songs you'd say I definitely should listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Lookin Out My Back Door a lot. It is a pretty crazy and catchy song."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy you say?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he is singing about flying spoons and dinosaurs dancing on on his lawn. It is goofy and I love it."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds interesting."
"__MUSIC__ But beyond that... Stuff like Bad Moon Rising, Who'll Stop the Rain, Down on the Corner are all classics."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I will look into them later."
