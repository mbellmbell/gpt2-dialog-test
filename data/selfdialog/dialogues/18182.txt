"__MOVIES__ Batman v Superman is such a strange film."
"__MOVIES__ Strange, good or bad?"
"__MOVIES__ Good, mostly. In my opinion, anyway."
"__MOVIES__ What makes you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's just such an absurd idea. A movie about Batman deciding that Superman must die."
"__MOVIES__ Jeez, that does sound weird."
"__MOVIES__ Not only that, but it's full of subtext and symbolism. I even read they snuck a time-travel plot in that only lasts about 2 minutes."
"__MOVIES__ And that makes it a good movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It makes it ambitious. It works on a lot of levels, even if it doesn't work for everyone."
"__MOVIES__ It obviously didn't work for everyone. It bombed at the box office."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, not really. It did make almost 900 million dollars."
"__MOVIES__ These days, if a movie doesn't make a billion it's a failure. Besides, critics hated it."
"__MOVIES__ Critics saw the theatrical cut which was butchered. 30 whole minutes of important scenes were cut from it!"
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, that's a lot! Why would they cut so much?"
"__MOVIES__ Warner Bros. wanted the run time shorter so they could sell more tickets."
"__MOVIES__ That seems kind of short-sighted in hindsight."
"__MOVIES__ It was. I mean, the movie would still probably be divisive, but at least people would understand it if they had seen the full thing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but a 3-hour long film? Most people would probably think that's too long."
"__MOVIES__ Heck, like I said, if nothing else, it's an ambitious film. Even if it is flawed."
"__MOVIES__ Flawed, but ambitious, huh? Well, at least it's not boring."
