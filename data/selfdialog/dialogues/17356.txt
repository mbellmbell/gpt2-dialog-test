"__MOVIES__ Soo bored today, I think we are gonna go to the movies. Any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm... what kind of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I love thrillers and action. Not drama or romance as much."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Fast and Furious 8. I didn't think I would like it, but it was enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ Is that with the Rock and Vin Diesel."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and Charlize Theron is in it too."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I have seen any Fast and Furious since the first one. That love scene between Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez. OH my."
"__MOVIES__ This one doesn't have any of that. Lot's of cool cars, but soooo unrealistic."
"__MOVIES__ We were also considering Guardians of the Galaxy 2, have you seen that?"
"__MOVIES__ No but I heard it is really funny."
"__MOVIES__ Too bad Baby Driver isn't out yet. I would love to see that."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that one. Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Jamie Foxx I think."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a kids movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's a thriller. Supposed to be really good."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, hmm. Speaking of the Rock, did you see Baywatch?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I thought it looked kind of stupid."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably, but he doesn't wear a shirt for the whole movie soo...."
"__MOVIES__ Lol, true, might be worth watching."
"__MOVIES__ We are going later, I'll let you know."
