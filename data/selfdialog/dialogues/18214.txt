"__MOVIES__ Last night I finally saw a movie you told me about like two years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is it?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Casa de Mi Padre'."
"__MOVIES__ Man, I laughed so hard with that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it by myslef because I knew my wife would hate it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that is our sense of humor, not our wives'."
"__MOVIES__ She would have also made me look away in the nude scene."
"__MOVIES__ What a beauty that actress is, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Such a beautiful woman. And Will Farrell is extraordinary, speaking Spanish and all."
"__MOVIES__ Man, I couldn't stop laughin!"
"__MOVIES__ Everything is so intensly spoken. And the bad quality of the special effects makes everything even better."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the tiger is so funny! And the cow at the biginning."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was so funny when in the first scene the three guys on the horses were just 'kind of laughin' for like 3 minutes."
"__MOVIES__ It was so funny! I think it was a hard concept to work on and get a good result, but they definitely did it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, an over acted soap opera, but making it genuinely funny."
"__MOVIES__ They did it perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, Will Farrell is a master of comedy, but this was a risky move."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I don't know what the critics said about it."
"__MOVIES__ The important thing is for us to enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ Totally agree."
