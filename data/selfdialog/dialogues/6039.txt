"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely Jar Jar Binks"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You heard me."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's the most god-awful character there is and is just a massive racial stereotype. What good can you see in him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's a sith lord."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh no, you're not buying into that theory, are you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course I am, why wouldn't I?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because you're smarter than that. What's the evidence?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's like Palpatine: appears helpless but is actually in control. He wiped out half a droid army with 'goofiness'"
