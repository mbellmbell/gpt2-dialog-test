"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think will be the biggest Cinderella team this year in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm gonna go with the Rams winning the NFC North division!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that is a very bold prediction."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Here is my other prediction. Brock Osweiler will start at quarterback for the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You must be a comedian. Brock is the absolute worst quarterback I have ever seen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He at least has some experience, so there's some hope. Maybe a new team will suit him better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the Browns man. They are not a great team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but they are a young team and hungry. You never know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright. My prediction is that Brady retires this season after winning the Superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, The man says he wants to play until he is mid-40s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, when you have six rings, that might be untouchable. Plus his wife is worried about him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. He's still playing at a high level. And if they win, he has to try for the three-peat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe you're right. That would be a crazy goal that he would like to achieve."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Him and Bill Belichick you know! No one has done that before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How crazy would it be if they went 19-0 this year to win the superbowl and then next year, get the threepeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No one, and I mean no one can ever touch their legacies ever!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it. Imagine watching that play out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be historic. Any NFL fan would have to appreciate it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for the season to start already!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I got a new big screen TV just to watch the games."
