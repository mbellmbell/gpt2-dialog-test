"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Howdy. What's up?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not much. Just hanging around my house."

"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What kind?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Just some old movies. Want to come over?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I could do that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm getting some black and white movies, if that's ok."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That sounds terrific. Which ones?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I planned on getting 'Casablanca' and maybe another one like that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's a great start."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I like Bogart, so maybe I'll get another one of his."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Bogart was awesome, but I don't know many of his movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, he's got plenty of them."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There's some detective movies of his, like 'The Big Sleep' and 'The Maltese Falcon.'"

"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Have you seen 'The Big Sleep' yet? I could get that one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, I haven't. Sounds like a good one to get."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok, I'll get 'Casablanca' and 'The Big Sleep.'  Meet me at my house at 7:00 tonight?"
