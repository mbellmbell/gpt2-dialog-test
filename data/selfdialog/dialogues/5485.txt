"__STAR_WARS__ What do you like most about Yoda?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I think Yoda is one of the coolest characters in all the Star Wars movies. I'd have to think about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I really like how he lives in the middle of no where in a swamp."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's pretty cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ So have you thought about what you like best about him yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's really cool that he lived for hundreds of years."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's hard to believe how long Yoda was around."
"__STAR_WARS__ You would think that after all that time, he would be stronger than any Sith Lord."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, some of them master the force faster than others, like Annakin did."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, I just wish Yoda was more powerful I guess."
