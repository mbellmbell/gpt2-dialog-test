"__SUPERHERO__ Logan really changed the trajectory of superhero films."
"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think so?  It was an amazing film, but I am not sure if other superhero films will go the route of Logan."
"__SUPERHERO__ I truly think that it will influence other films.  The relationship that Logan had with Professor Xavier and X-23 was touching."
"__SUPERHERO__ It was.  I just don't know if movie studios are willing to take a risk to make their films more serious like Logan."
"__SUPERHERO__ True.  I don't think that all superhero movies should have the tone but Logan, but it would work for some."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ultimately, entertaining and amusing comic book films seem to do the best.  Deadpool was much more adult than other comic book films, but it still had a lot of humor."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes.  When compared to Deadpool, Logan didn't have much humor at all."
"__SUPERHERO__ For me, I think that The Winter Soldier had a great balance of humor and seriousness."
"__SUPERHERO__ That was a well-done movie.  It was essentially a political thriller."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think if more movies had that tone, then the Hollywood box office would be happy."
