"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you catch the game last night?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was crazy. I can't believe they pulled back from that score!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At first I thought it was over for the Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but then Carson Wentz started playing really well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that. I thought the offensive line just held well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But without the passes from Wentz, they would have never scored a touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that's fair, but I don't think Wentz has been playing too well recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He won them the last game didn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but that was one good game out of the last couple. Recently he's been playing poorly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he has been playing alight. I mean the Eagles are winning aren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess a win is a win. So I won't complain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm definitely not complaining about the winning after last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. Last season was rough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I cant believe that we went 7-9-0."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To think that in the early 2000s the Eagles were making it to conference championships and now we have a negative record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's a rough time to be an Eagles fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least we aren't doing too bad this season. What is our record right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles are 4-3-0 right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey that's actually pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll take it. At least we have a winning record."
