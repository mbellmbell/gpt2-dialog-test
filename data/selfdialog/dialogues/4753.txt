"__MUSIC__ 2016 was a tough year for music."
"__MUSIC__ I know, we lost Bowie, Prince, and Lou Reed."
"__MUSIC__ Those were three of our favorite artists."
"__MUSIC__ Three of the best. Three of the most original."
"__MUSIC__ Highly original, with their own aesthetic and boldness in pursuing whatever they wanted to pursue."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Think of Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, I think it's commercially unviable and just not a great album, but it is an artistic statement."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Bowie was an absolute chameleon. That guy changed his style and aesthetic so many times."
"__MUSIC__ Plastic soul! Honky tonk! Punk! Rocknroll! Post-Punk! Electronic! Jazz!"
"__MUSIC__ An absolute chameleon! Prince was a chameleon in his own way."
"__MUSIC__ He changed his name to a symbol."
"__MUSIC__ And he wrote a funk album, a rock/nu wave album, a blues album, albums that sounded kind of metal, an r&b album. He was prolific."
"__MUSIC__ Super prolific. It was tough to lose such innovative musicians and people."
"__MUSIC__ 2016 was a tough year for music, but I can remain hopeful knowing that each artist plants many more seeds in people's minds and that we're not done hearing Prince, Bowie or Lou Reed."
"__MUSIC__ Great point. They'll influence others for years to come."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the influence will take variegated forms, but we'll still be hearing each of them generations from now."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite Prince song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I do. It's not super well known, but it's called 'When You Were Mine.'"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know a thing about that song."
"__MUSIC__ It's a raw new wave and rock song with one of my favorite pop melodies of all time. Think Prince plus Elvis Costello."
"__MUSIC__ That combination sounds so incredibly amazing! I must listen!"
