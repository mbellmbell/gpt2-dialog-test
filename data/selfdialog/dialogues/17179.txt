"__MOVIES__ Hey man, are you into those wizard movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Blizzard movie? You mean the World of Warcraft movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, wizard movies. You know, Harry Potter."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! Yeah, not really. I've only ever seen the second one and I couldn't quite figure out who was what."
"__MOVIES__ You really should try them all out. The first one really sets the scene."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, in the first one, you see where Harry is starting out. Actually, you get to see where all the kids come from."
"__MOVIES__ Even all those red headed ones? That part was confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the Weasleys. That really is a big family. You only get to know a few of them at a time."
"__MOVIES__ That Ron kid was pretty goofy."
"__MOVIES__ Do you not like goofy characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I like the goofy characters the most. They feel more down to earth and real."
"__MOVIES__ Then you most have loved the half giant, Hagrid."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah. I liked that guy. Wasn't he expelled from school and everything? But got to come back to work for them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was. His full story is pretty interesting. His book character and movie character line up pretty well."
"__MOVIES__ So, he's a half giant in both of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he is. He also uses that fact to help the heroes, you know, Harry and the bunch, out of a lot of trouble."
"__MOVIES__ So, the real hero of these movies is Hagrid?"
"__MOVIES__ Well... you know, you could say so. Hagrid is the one who gets Harry to Hogwarts in the first place and he helps them all through the story."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it great when heroes of movies are different than the main character? It gives it some good depth."
