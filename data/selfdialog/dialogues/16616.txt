"__MOVIES__ What do you think of the movie War Room?"
"__MOVIES__ War Room? I don't know if I've heard of that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's an old movie but you told me you were reading about it online one night when you couldn't sleep."
"__MOVIES__ How long ago was that?"
"__MOVIES__ About 3 or 4 months ago."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. The one I said I think it was going to be a different kind of movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. You were excited about the reviews."
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't seen it yet. But I do want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I know you will like it. It's talking about prayer."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. A way that I never saw prayer acted out before."
"__MOVIES__ It was very different from other religious movies. It was full of action."
"__MOVIES__ Action? What kind of action?"
"__MOVIES__ Action in the sense that the character wasn't just talking but they showed how to pray."
"__MOVIES__ Were they doing a lot of praying?"
"__MOVIES__ Not a lot. But they showed how to pray through situations."
"__MOVIES__ So it wasn't just telling but also showing?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh Yes!!! One of the main characters was a praying woman."
"__MOVIES__ Hearing you really make me want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I tell you, you won't reget it and it will help you through some situations you are facing."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to get it tomorow. I saw it in Walmart. Thanks"
