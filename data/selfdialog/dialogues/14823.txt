"__ACTION__ What is the best Schwarzenegger Action movie?"
"__ACTION__ I have always thought that Terminator 2 is probably his best."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, that one is good, but I was wondering about his lesser known stuff."
"__ACTION__ Most of them are pretty weak 80s action plots, but the sure have a lot of action. Have you ever seen The 6th Day"
"__ACTION__ No. What is it about?"
"__ACTION__ It is pretty wild. It is about human cloning."
"__ACTION__ That sounds cool! Who else is in it?"
"__ACTION__ It has Michael Rappaport and Robert Duvall."
"__ACTION__ I like Robert Duvall. Wasn't he in Apocalypse Now?"
"__ACTION__ He sure was. He was the surfer."
