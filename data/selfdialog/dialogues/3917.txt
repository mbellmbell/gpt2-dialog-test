"__MUSIC__ Why do you think the music for Jaws is so scary?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really think it's too bad, but I have a theory."
"__MUSIC__ Such as?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's a combination of a few things."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ It starts out very low with the tubas and basses. I don't know other scores that use that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they typically start high for the scares."
"__MUSIC__ It's also highly repetitive and sounds like the tempo is increasing even though it's not."
"__MUSIC__ How can it sound like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the tempo stays consistent. It's just the amount they play gets shorter each time, and the window between soundings gets shorter too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right."
"__MUSIC__ It also occurs while the camera 'swims' underwater, giving you that weird sensation."
"__MUSIC__ Claustrophobia?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, for some people."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks!"
"__MUSIC__ I thought you'd say it was the tuba solo."
"__MUSIC__ Just because I play tuba doesn't mean I'm going to bring it up all the time."
"__MUSIC__ The tuba part is super effective though, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup! I think it's because it's a super low instrument but the part is quite high for the instrument. They put us underwater and give us timbres we're not used to."
