"__HORROR__ I saw this great movie last night called, The Babadook."
"__HORROR__ Never heard of that."
"__HORROR__ You should look it up. It is Australian and not your usual horror movie."
"__HORROR__ What do you mean?"
"__HORROR__ Well it is more psychological than the usual slasher type horror movies. It has a good story line about a mother and her son."
"__HORROR__ I like psychological horror too more than just blood and guts. I like to get really scared and the usual stuff just grosses me out."
"__HORROR__ Well you'll like this then. The son thinks the monster in a pop-up book is real and he makes weapons to defend himself and his mother."
"__HORROR__ So the kid is the hero"
"__HORROR__ Kind of. The movie is more about the dark side of grief. You see the mother Amelia, her husband is killed in a car accident the night Sam is born and she never quite got over it."
"__HORROR__ Ok, I'm going to take your advice and look for it. We can talk more about it after I watch it."
