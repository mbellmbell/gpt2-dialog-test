"__MOVIES__ Oh my god, have you watched Moana with your kids?"
"__MOVIES__ No, why?"
"__MOVIES__ It is so cute and sweet!"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I'll have to check it out what's it about again?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie about ancient Hawaiians."
"__MOVIES__ Is it live action or animated?"
"__MOVIES__ It's an animated musical."
"__MOVIES__ Oh is that the one with the Rock?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I will definitely check it out."
"__MOVIES__ I think your little girl will really like it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's really into the Princess and the Frog right now, I need to get her to watch something else."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that was a cute one too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, kind of."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I just wasn't a fan, there were a lot of stereotypes in that film!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but that firefly is horrible. It's just really annoying the 50th time you watch it!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes. Haha I know how that feels."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to pick up a copy of Moana and see if that will distract her."
