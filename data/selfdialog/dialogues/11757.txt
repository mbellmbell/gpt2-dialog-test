"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a football fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I grew up watching the Cowboys.  This got interesting when I was in Nashville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did you become a Titans fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've never rooted for an AFC team in my life!  But my boys on the other hand..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the didn't cut their teeth on Romo and Co?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish!  They'd watch the Titans game at noon, then go mow the lawn when the Cowboys kicked off at 4:00."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Disgusting!  How did you lure them back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football snacks.  I thought about forcing them to watch the Dallas games, but..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A plate of taquitos goes a long way.  It had to help that the Cowboys had a consistently good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but the media was all about the Tennessee Titans.  It was hard for Jerry Jones to compete."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd imagine, but they enjoy the game just the same.  You follow the NFL draft, keep up with who's on waivers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mostly just enjoy the season.  I used to know those things when Dallas was at Valley Ranch in the old days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And now that you're in Michigan.  I bet everyone is a huge Detroit Lions fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We prefer Eli Manning--since Payton's retired.  Never cared for Archie professionally, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The ol' Cowboy-Saints rivalry, eh?  I know how it is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't make me laugh, but yeah.  Archie Manning is a stand-up guy; love his sons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And football, though it's become politicized these past few years with that Colin Kaepernick kneeling stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but maybe we should change the subject."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We could talk about the Red Skins and Supreme Court cases..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Washington?  Don't get me started!!!"
