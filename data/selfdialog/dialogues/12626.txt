"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch the NFL draft this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but only the first couple of nights."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. Who do you think had the best draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a lot of teams did well, but I think the 49ers scored pretty well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too, especially after gaining all those picks after barely moving down in the first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cleveland seemed to have neverending picks, but who knows what they will do with them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that Myles Garrett was a great pick for Cleveland, but they need a lot more help than just one guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, there are too many teams that are more complete than them for it to matter now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Denver is just a few new people away from another Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What Denver really needs is a quarterback, but I don't know who will step up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that they should've traded for someone, but John Elway is all in with the guys he has already."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could be their downfall, like last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have Paxton Lynch, who seems very young but promising. I think if anyone can help him, it's Elway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure Elway has a way with quarterbacks since he has so much experience of his own."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think he should really step aside and let his coach make some decisions though because he might be getting too emotional."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't know much about the new coach, but I do know that he has a successful background and should make for an interesting coach in Denver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With that Denver defense it has to be a coach's dream job. Von Miller is crazy talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Von is one of the top talents in the league, but he needs an offense to keep him off the field more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Denver defense helped them limp through so many games last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait to see their new players start to make an impact!"
