"__SUPERHERO__ I finally got around to seeing Catwoman the other day."
"__SUPERHERO__ What did you think of it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Halle Berry was good,but the plot wasn't as good as I'd hoped."
"__SUPERHERO__ I felt the same way. It was a pretty big let down."
"__SUPERHERO__ I wonder if they'll remake it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, it seems like woman super hero are making a comeback, so maybe."
"__SUPERHERO__ I feel like Halle Berry was a lot better as Storm, she was more in control."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe they can make a stand alone movie about Storm."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'd pay to see that. I think Halle Berry could pull it off."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh for sure! That would be awesome."
