"__LADY_GAGA__ What did you think of the Born This Way video?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ You know, I don't really know if I like it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I loved it! It was crazy to see her dancing that well."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'll give you that, but I guess I just don't like the song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Don't tell me you're one of the ones who thinks it sounds like Madonna."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Come on! It totally sounds like Madonna."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, but Lady GaGa is clearly inspired by Madonna. I don't think that's a bad thing."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree, but she should do something new with it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she is."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she could do a lot more with all her talent."
