"__HARRY_POTTER__ I watched Goblet of Fire again the other day!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh? Was it on television?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, I found the DVD and decided to give it another go. You know, I never realized that Cedric was played by Rob Pattinson!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No? I really prefer him as Cedric; seeing him in Twilight really kind of ruined it for me!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I hear you. But I'll tell you, Amos' reaction after Cedric's death gets me every time. It's the most realistic reaction I've ever seen."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It makes me sad every time I watch it, too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But I love the ball storyline. Seeing Ron get all thrown off by Hermione's transformation is still hilarious."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I do wish they'd done some things a little more like that book, though. I thought some parts needed a little more reaction or emotion."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Agreed. And I missed the scene from the book where Hermione teaches Krum how to say her name."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know. It's perfect. Hermmy-o-ninny! I still laugh!"
