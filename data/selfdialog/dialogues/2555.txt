"__MUSIC__ What is up with the DJ?"
"__MUSIC__ I know! He's playing all Disco."
"__MUSIC__ He'd better change it up, or I'm getting out of hear."
"__MUSIC__ Wonder if he takes requests?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but the booth is completely surrounded."
"__MUSIC__ Please play some Rock for crying out loud."
"__MUSIC__ Anything but this!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, there go the Beegees."
"__MUSIC__ Did you see the Grammys?"
"__MUSIC__ No. Missed it this year."
"__MUSIC__ They did a tribute to the Beegees."
"__MUSIC__ How was that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm not a Disco nut by any means, but it was pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ With those tight jeans they use to wear, no wonder they could hit those high notes."
"__MUSIC__ You're such a dork."
"__MUSIC__ I know!"
"__MUSIC__ Hey, let's hit that kareoke joint around the corner."
"__MUSIC__ Can't be worse that this!"
"__MUSIC__ Cool. Let's go."
"__MUSIC__ Just gotta grab my jacket."
