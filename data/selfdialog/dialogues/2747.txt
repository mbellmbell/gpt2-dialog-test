"__MUSIC__ What's the best concert you've ever seen?"
"__MUSIC__ That's hard to say. I will say that when I saw ZZ Top, they were amazing. They played for two hours straight."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't they in their 90s or something."
"__MUSIC__ Probably. But they could still rock. And you realized just how many hits they had, going back decades."
"__MUSIC__ Fun trivia fact: their first tour was opening act for Jimi Hendrix."
"__MUSIC__ That is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I saw Bon Jovi when they were an opening act, hardly anybody had really heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny. Who did they open for?"
"__MUSIC__ Ratt."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Now that's some old 80s hair-metal. I got to see KISS, which was cool."
"__MUSIC__ Cool! Were they all dressed up and in makeup?"
"__MUSIC__ No, unfortunately this was after they gave that up."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you mean from their 'I was made for lovin' you' days."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, I'm sure you saw some less than awesome concerts."
"__MUSIC__ At a casino once,  just happened to stumble into a Molly Hatchet concert."
"__MUSIC__ Molly Hatchet is still around?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, and they were trying to rock."
"__MUSIC__ Trying but not succeeding?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not succeeding. But they still had their groupies there."
"__MUSIC__ That gives me a terrible mental image."
