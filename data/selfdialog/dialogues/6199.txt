"__STAR_WARS__ You know what Star Wars movie they should make next?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?"
"__STAR_WARS__ A Darth Maul spin-off."
"__STAR_WARS__ We already had a Darth Maul spin-off series. It was called The Clone Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was only in like, 5 episodes!"
"__STAR_WARS__ And it was more than enough."
"__STAR_WARS__ But there's gotta be more to tell!"
"__STAR_WARS__ They should the time before Episode I when he was training under Sidious, but why bother? It's a Sidious movie at that point which Maul happens to be in."
"__STAR_WARS__ But his character was such a waste!"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, General Grievous was a waste. Maul eventually got character development, with a beginning, middle, and end."
