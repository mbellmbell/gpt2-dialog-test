"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really hope the Vikings go to the Superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Meh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's that supposed to mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It means it won't happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because they haven't been there since the 1970s and we lost at that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But we made it to the playoffs since then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That falls under the category of 'close but no cigar.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, you're mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If by 'mean' you actually meant 'truthful' yes, I am."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We almost made it the year Brett Favre was in it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Saints really cheated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't call it cheating, but they were out of line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even if Farve was a mile away from the ball the Saints would have 10 guys pile up on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was obvious they were trying to hurt him and put him out of commission."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even I could see that and I almost never watch football games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we'll make it this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure. Then at the end of a losing season you'll be saying 'we'll get 'em next year.'"
