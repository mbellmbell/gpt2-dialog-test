"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Lady Gaga?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm always concerned when a musician is known as much for their clothes as their music."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously? Did you say the same about Kraftwerk or Daft Punk?"
"__MUSIC__ No...but their music at least made you think!"
"__MUSIC__ So does Lady Gaga's. I think you're just being a generational snob."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. She's been compared to Madonna a lot hasn't she?"
"__MUSIC__ She has. I think it's got more to do with the constantly changing image than anything else."
"__MUSIC__ See that's exactly my point proved for me!"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ She's known for her clothes more than her music."
"__MUSIC__ OK, let's try another. What do you think of Rihanna?"
"__MUSIC__ Now you're talking about a proper star."
"__MUSIC__ In what way is she more of a star?"
"__MUSIC__ She's just got that X-Factor hasn't she?"
"__MUSIC__ You're talking nonsense. Gaga has mystery about her, Rihanna has none."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but Rihanna is always herself so after a while the image is secondary, because it never changes, so you stop noticing."
"__MUSIC__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Gaga disguises herself, dresses up in meat-suits and worse. It was a real surprise to see her face for the first time...she aims to shock and image always comes first, not music."
"__MUSIC__ You can't accept music and image can go hand in hand can you?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think we're ever going to agree!"
