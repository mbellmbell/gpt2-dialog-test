"__MUSIC__ I'm glad you like rock n roll."
"__MUSIC__ Me too."
"__MUSIC__ Now we just have one more thing in common!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I can't believe I didn't enjoy it until just recently, even though I heard it all the time growing up."
"__MUSIC__ Were your parents into rock n roll?"
"__MUSIC__ My mom was, big time. She would share it with me but I never connected with it."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's natural to grow up despising the music your parents like."
"__MUSIC__ Well if I did because of that I wasn't conscious of it at the time. I think I just needed to listen to different artists till I found a particular sound I liked."
"__MUSIC__ You mean Little Richard and Elvis didn't do anything for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha, no. I mean I can understand why they're popular, though."
"__MUSIC__ The beat, the beat, the beat."
"__MUSIC__ The beats are good and their songs are catchy, I just couldn't get into the lyrics and their voices."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, if you can't get used to their voice that pretty much ruins the experience."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! I like Jerry Lee Lewis' and Buddy Knox's voices for some reason."
"__MUSIC__ Oh okay. I like that one song 'Party Doll'."
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Jerry Lee Lewis' songs although they get stuck in my head a lot I'm actually not a big fan."
"__MUSIC__ I gotcha, I have songs like that."
"__MUSIC__ I have a bunch of old rock n roll records you should help me go through sometime."
"__MUSIC__ Will do!"
