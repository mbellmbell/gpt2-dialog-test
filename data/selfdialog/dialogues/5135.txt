"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The fast & Furious Franchise lost a great friend when Paul Walker died."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Man don't even say that to me, I always cry."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I remember the first day we met Brian Spilner, sitting in the dinner asking for a tuna fish sandwich."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Spilner/ Don't you mean O'conor."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, I mean Spilner; that was his undercover alias when he was after Dom in the first film."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How exactly do you remember that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How do you not, when Dom took his ID and said 'Brian Spilner? That sounds like a serial killer's name.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh yeah, ok, now I remember. Dude how many times did you watch that movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ 30, why is that a lot?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, that is way too many, but do you wanna make it 31 because now I want to watch it again."
