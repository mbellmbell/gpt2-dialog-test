"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know why you root for the Pats"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're the home team, you gotta support the locals"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but Belichick's a hack, Brady too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why root for dirty cheaters?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The franchise is bigger than a couple of guys, not all of the Patriots are cheaters"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still don't get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I've been a Pats fan my whole life, I'm not going to jump ship just because we have a few bad eggs on board right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever, go Steelers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steelers?  Seriously?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're not even going to make the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're the one who just lectured me about sticking with your team..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but you're not even from Pennsylvania"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But my Dad is, and I grew in a Steelers house."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they could make the playoffs this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They wont"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It could happen"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A flying pig could happen too, but it wont."
