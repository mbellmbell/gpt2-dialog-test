"__MUSIC__ How long has there been music?"
"__MUSIC__ That's an interesting question."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what's the answer?"
"__MUSIC__ Animals have had music for millions of years. But, I assume you mean human music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I'm interested in human music."
"__MUSIC__ There's evidence for music dating back at least 50,000 years."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that'a amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is. It's equally amazing that music has been found in every single culture ever discovered."
"__MUSIC__ Even in ancient Babylon, Egypt, and Greece?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. It's funny that you should mention Babylon."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's where the oldest known song was discovered."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I wonder what it sounded like."
"__MUSIC__ I've no idea, but there's one interesting thing. It was written using a music scale."
"__MUSIC__ What does that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, we still use scales today. The most common music scale is the chromatic scale with its majors and minors."
"__MUSIC__ I understand a little bit about music theory."
"__MUSIC__ But, that leads to another interesting point."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Since it was written using a scale, there must have been a system in place. So, there's even older songs out there somewhere."
