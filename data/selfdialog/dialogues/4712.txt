"__MUSIC__ Well you just multiplied 4 by 4 and said 16. Wrong."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. That's what I did. And it sounds good to me. I'm happy with it."
"__MUSIC__ it really depends on how you approach this. It's a permutations problem"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, permute this. I say 16."
"__MUSIC__ Now we started this because we wanted to understand how to construct an atonal music piece."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. There are 16. I took the 4 and mutliplied it it. Looks good to me."
"__MUSIC__ That's... just wrong. Let's try this. is the music only going to be 2 rows?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh. wait..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. you get it now."
"__MUSIC__ I see. So it combinatorailly explodes as the number or the rosw increase."
"__MUSIC__ it's not without a reason all these atonal music sound so different from each other and yet still sound the same"
"__MUSIC__ because there are so many possibilities."
"__MUSIC__ All of them following the same rule of having no keys"
"__MUSIC__ how do you have no keys?"
"__MUSIC__ Um... we just talked about it."
"__MUSIC__ yes, but summarize it."
"__MUSIC__ No."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. one was what? Don;t use the same notes?"
"__MUSIC__ Sigh... No.. use all 12 notes of the chrimatic scale. Rule 2 is do not use the same notes in a row. (which is kinda breakble)"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah... And rule 3 is the tranformation stuff and the 4 is start the row with any note you want."
