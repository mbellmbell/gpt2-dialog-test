"__MUSIC__ Are there any songs you only like to listen to with specfic other people?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean like with my girlfriend, like we have a song that's 'ours'?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, that could be an example. Though there could be others."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really look at music that way. I think if a song is good, it's good no matter what."
"__MUSIC__ For me, all the songs from the soundtrack of the musical Rent. I can only listen to them with my sister."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Why?"
"__MUSIC__ When we were younger, we used to be big fans of the musical, and the music."
"__MUSIC__ But you don't like them now?"
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to say. I'm not actively a fan of them, but there's a nostalgia factor."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I can relate to that."
"__MUSIC__ I'd probably say I don't like them very much now but it's fun to get together with my sister every once in a while and listen to the album."
"__MUSIC__ Makes sense. I never listened to Rent, or saw it."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, it's kind of cheesy, when I see it now. It was a product of its era."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that it was very 'topical' and 'edgy'."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but a lot of the music is fairly timeless."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't there a song called 'Light my Candle'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's one of the songs from the musical."
"__MUSIC__ I saw someone reference that song online somewhere. I can't remember where."
"__MUSIC__ It's not one of the more famous songs, but it's one of the more romantic ones."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'll give Rent's soundtrack a listen."
