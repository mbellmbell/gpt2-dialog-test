"__LADY_GAGA__ What is your favorite album by Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh wow. All of them are perfect but I'm going to have to say either The Fame or The Fame Monster."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Nice! So you've been a fan from day one. So have I! What are your favorite songs from each of those albums?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like Paparazzi from The Fame and Speechless from The Fame Monster. All of the songs are awesome though. What about you?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like Brown Eyes from The Fame and Monster from The Fame Monster. I agree, the entire albums are epic."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Cool. I'll be happy when she has a concert near here so we can go."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree! That would be such a treat. I'm dying to see what amazing outfit and stage setting she will come up with."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh right! She is very good about those things. I dont care what anyone says, her fashion is top notch."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Indeed! Oh I have another question, what is your favorite music video from her? I think the music video for G.U.Y is awesome."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like G.U.Y too! My favorite would probably be the Eh Eh Nothing Else I Can Say video. I loved her cute hair bow hairstyle, the Italian theme and that spaghetti in the video looked so delicious."
