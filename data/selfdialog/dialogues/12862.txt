"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As a Patriots fan, I'm probably biased so I'd say yes. It is hard to argue with five Super Bowls championships."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like you are hesitant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I also recognize that the game is totally different now that for a Johnny Unitas or Joe Montana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's respectable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton and Favre also have a ton of records, but when it comes down to it, I think championships become the tiebreaker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's fair. I'm not a Patriots fan, but I think it's a hard argument to say that Brady isn't the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree in general, but I also look at the fact that Brady played a lot longer than all the others."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you arguing against him now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, just trying to recognize that I'm biased!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's fair. I really do think he's cemented himself as the best quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Counterarguments and all, I do agree. I think he could be in conversation for the best ever player, but I don't know that he's got that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is so difficult. It is like comparing apples to oranges."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. How do you compare a quarterback with a receiver or back? I just don't think you can do it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you look at stats alone, Jerry Rice may be the best of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. His records are mind blowing. Although some say Jim Brown deserves the title of best ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay help me out here. Who is he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Way before our time. He played for the Browns from '57-'65,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I need to look into him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should. He's in the conversation, but like with Brady now, it was just a totally different time and game then."
