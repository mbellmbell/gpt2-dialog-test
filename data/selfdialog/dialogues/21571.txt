"__DISNEY__ Have you ever seen some of the older Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I have seen some.  Which ones are your favorites?"
"__DISNEY__ I love Bambi and The Little Mermaid.  They are classics."
"__DISNEY__ I have seen The Little Mermaid but I have never taken the time to watch Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ It was one of the first Disney movies that I ever saw so it holds a special place in my heart."
"__DISNEY__ Doesn't Bambi's mother get killed in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ She does but they move the storyline along quickly enough for it to be a kids movie.  Besides, someone always seems to be killed in a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ That is true which confuses me sometimes because they are all really kids movies."
"__DISNEY__ I think that kids don't really pay attention to that and it probably bothers adults more."
"__DISNEY__ That is true.  In Beauty and the Beast, my kids just love the music and Belle and don't really care that Gaston dies in the end."
