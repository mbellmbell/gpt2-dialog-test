"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to music at the gym at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes, but I have a hard time finding music I like that motivates me!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I'm actually looking for suggestions."
"__MUSIC__ Now that you mention it, I take a Zumba class and really like the music there."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah good point! I actually think reggaeton is pretty motivating."
"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to it when running?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't. I just want to make me dance but I kind of want to next time I go for a run."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes when I go to a club I'll recognize a song or two from Zumba."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome! Do you bust out in Zumba dance moves in a club?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes!"
"__MUSIC__ I used to listen to a lot of EDM when I run, but since the EDM station went off the air I don't know any songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I miss the Evolution radio station!"
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to that station at all recently?"
"__MUSIC__ No, why? What's on it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's another country station!"
"__MUSIC__ Ugh, seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know. We don't even live in the south!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, I don't even have a single friend that listens to country music!"
"__MUSIC__ Me neither, but some of the country singers are pretty cute!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but we can't see their cute faces through the radio! Haha"
