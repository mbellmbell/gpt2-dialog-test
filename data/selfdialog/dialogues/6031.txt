"__STAR_WARS__ Which star wars movie is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first one definitely, its originality was awe inspiring."
"__STAR_WARS__ The first one really? Mine was The Empire Strikes back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why did you like that one more than the others?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well simply because Darth Vader is my favorite character in any of the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's funny because Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi are my favorite characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, so that's why you like the first movie so much, haha."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, and Its crazy that Obi Wan was killed by Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that scene was pretty weird, it almost seemed like he just let himself get killed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I think what he was doing is transcending to a spiritual level like other jedi did when they died, I read something about how a jedi can do that if he is powerful enough. His body was missing when he was killed so I would think that is what happened."
