"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the Star Wars prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They had some good moments, but overall I felt they were pretty disappointing."
"__STAR_WARS__ What were some of the things you liked about the movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really enjoyed the pod racing in the first film. I also enjoyed seeing lots of Jedi throughout all the films."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought having that many Jedi was overkill. It seemed lame to just flood the films with Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a fair point, but I felt that the Jedi were never properly explained or explored in the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought that made them more mysterious and interesting. We don't need to have everything fully explained in order to enjoy what's going on."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that was one of the big problems with the prequels, George Lucas tried to overexplain everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's how we ended up getting the 'midi-chlorians' explaination of the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, Star Wars is science fiction, but it should be a lot more focused on the fiction than the science."
