"__MUSIC__ I don't get it."
"__MUSIC__ What about?"
"__MUSIC__ I was TRYING to find a recording of Carl Orff's 'Musika Poetica', and it barely exists."
"__MUSIC__ Where did you hear that music? You said it was in some movie you saw years ago."
"__MUSIC__ I heard it in the movie, 'Badlands' with Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen. I think 1973 or so."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, Carl Orff. Wasn't he the composer of 'Carmina Burana'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, performed first in 1937 or so. THAT music you can hear everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ It's that grim chorus you've heard a hundred times in commercials, video games, movies. It's embarrassing."
"__MUSIC__ Amen. But you can't find 'Musika Poetica', a really short, famous piece that you'd think would be widely available."
"__MUSIC__ That's that really short, Caribbean-sounding drum and Xylophone thing, like a marching song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Carl Orff wrote hundreds of pieces for music students to play."
"__MUSIC__ Like William Gillock did for piano music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I'm not familiar with that. I'll have to look that up."
"__MUSIC__ 'Carmina Burana' was based on a 13th century poem, I think it was called 'O Fortuna'."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's pretty grim sounding to me. And it's EVERYWHERE. I heard a thing about it on NPR radio once."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yes, right. The rappers Naz and Puff Daddy did versions of it, for gosh sakes."
"__MUSIC__ Heavy metal group Therion did a version of it. There's 'Carmina Burana' used in that movie about The Doors."
"__MUSIC__ I remember Ray Manzarek, the keyboardist from The Doors, had an album in 1983, called 'Carmina Burana'."
"__MUSIC__ It's been used in dozens of commercials, movies, video games, sporting events. It's like Pachelbel's 'Canon' in the old days."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, no. Don't remind me of Pachelbel's 'Canon'!"
