"__MUSIC__ I like that one and Bye Bye Bye."
"__MUSIC__ The video for that one is great. I think they were puppets right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes it was a great video. I can't think of any by The Backstreet Boys."

"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah now I remember. They were really big back then."
"__MUSIC__ Justin Timberlake going solo was the best thing he could have ever done."

"__MUSIC__ My favorite collaboration from the two of them is What Goes Around Comes Around."
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen the video for that song?"

"__MUSIC__ Wow that's crazy. Who'd have thought he was so crazy over her?"
