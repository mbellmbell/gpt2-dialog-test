"__MUSIC__ Ugh, this thing never ends."
"__MUSIC__ You want music, this is it."
"__MUSIC__ No, Music is for listening, not analyzing."
"__MUSIC__ Well, music is for both, actually. Music is logic, and it is as beautiful as any mathematical proof you'll ever see"
"__MUSIC__ Stop with math stuff. Go back to music. That hemi, non hemi stuff"
"__MUSIC__ Hemitonic. Well, the Hemitonic scale is a pentatonic scale that contains one or more semitones."
"__MUSIC__ A semitone is a half step note?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. So is the c major pentatpnic a hemitponic scale?"
"__MUSIC__ Um.. How do I find out?"
"__MUSIC__ Look for semitone step in the note."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. um... Ok. so it's C, D, E, G, A, right?"
"__MUSIC__ yes. are any notes separated by a semitone?"
"__MUSIC__ Um... no. but is three half steps considered a semi tone?"
"__MUSIC__ 3 is not equal to 1. so no."
"__MUSIC__ So c major pentatoni scale is not a hemitonic scale?"
"__MUSIC__ NO it's not a hemitonic scale, it is an anhemitonic scale. Also known and ditonic scale."
"__MUSIC__ Um what's ditonic mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Di, 2. tonic, related to a tone. Two tone scales. Or the notes combine the two neighboring notes. since all whole notes are 2 half steps away, what notes are ditonis in the c major pentatonic scale?"
"__MUSIC__ Wait,. start over. What?"
"__MUSIC__ You asked if 3 half steps count as half steps, yes?"
