"__MOVIES__ What is the most disappointing movie you can recall from recent memory?"
"__MOVIES__ This may be a random one to you, but I would have to go with '88 Minutes', with Al Pacino."
"__MOVIES__ I think I have heard of that one but please fill me in."
"__MOVIES__ It's a very basic plot. Al Pacino plays a psychiatric therapist, who receives a threatening phone call claiming that he was but 88 minutes to live."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it could actually be interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately, the movie is filled with plot holes and some bad acting."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame. What is the general idea?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, after Pacino receives the call, he feels the need to crack the case on his own, using all of his skills and knowledge."
"__MOVIES__ But he does not play a cop, right? He just works for them?"
"__MOVIES__ Sort of, yes. He is definitely not a cop, but has several ties to the FBI in the film."
"__MOVIES__ So if his life in threatened, why wouldn't he just sit out at a police station?"
"__MOVIES__ Because what is the fun in that? In all seriousness, logically, that's what I think most would do."
"__MOVIES__ Feel free to spoil the movie if you like. Since it is apparently quite bad."
"__MOVIES__ I won't give every little bit of detail away, but I think the person behind is pretty obvious."
"__MOVIES__ Is there a big twist involved?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not really. It honestly presents itself as if it were a 'Who done it?'"
"__MOVIES__ Did you think it was doomed from the start?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. I think a movie like this could have been great but fell very short."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame, because Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors of all time."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree and I do think he is better than this!"
