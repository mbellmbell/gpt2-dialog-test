"__DISNEY__ Did you ever wonder if Snow White hates animals?"
"__DISNEY__ What are you talking about?"
"__DISNEY__ I mean, she thanks the animals for helping her, but seems like she's short on gratitude."
"__DISNEY__ I swear, you're going crazy."
"__DISNEY__ Hear me out.  Why didn't she take any of them as pets at the end?"
"__DISNEY__ How was she supposed to take them on pets when she was on the back of a horse?"
"__DISNEY__ She could have taken a rabbit."
"__DISNEY__ She's not going to take wild beasts with her and the prince."
"__DISNEY__ Or a cuddly mouse."
"__DISNEY__ You need serious help."
