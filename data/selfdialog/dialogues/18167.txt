"__MOVIES__ Are you planning to go see the Tupac movie All Eyez on Me?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I heard it's really good. The guy playing 2Pac really looks like him."
"__MOVIES__ Looks like him, sounds like him, everything. I heard they really nailed it with him."
"__MOVIES__ That's good. You know fans would be disappointed if he didn't embody 2Pac as much as possible."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. Did you see Straight Outta Compton?"
"__MOVIES__ You know what, I started watching it but only made it halfway through."
"__MOVIES__ Now that's a movie where the actor embodied the character fully."
"__MOVIES__ Right because Ice Cube's son O'shea Jackson played him right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! He looks more like Ice Cube than Ice Cube does."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that. It's a movie that surprised a lot of people by how well done it was."
"__MOVIES__ Yes we don't have a lot of good urban movies these days."
"__MOVIES__ Boyz in the Hood will always be an urban classic. It still holds up to this day."
"__MOVIES__ That scene where Ricky was shot and killed. That still affects me to this day."
"__MOVIES__ Yes the scene with his mom and girlfriend after that is really hard to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Cuba Gooding Jr. really made a name for himself after that."
"__MOVIES__ He did. I think he did Jerry Maguire, Radio, and a few other notable movies."
"__MOVIES__ Right but he's sort of disappeared out of the limelight. He's been gone for a minute."
"__MOVIES__ I just barely saw him in As Good as it Gets. I'd never seen it before."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's a great movie, it's hilarious. Jack Nicholson played that part so well."
"__MOVIES__ Oh he definitely has a great flair for the dramatic. Just look at him in The Shining."
