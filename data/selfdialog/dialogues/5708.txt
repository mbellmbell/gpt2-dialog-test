"__STAR_WARS__ If you watched all of the movies, which order would you view them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ah, that's a highly debated question.  I guess I would go chronologically."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  Interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  I think I would want to see the rise and fall of Anakin before I watched the stories of his children."
"__STAR_WARS__ See, now I'm more apt to go in order of release."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  So, I would stars with Star Wars, then Empire Strikes Back, then Return of the Jedi, then I would..."
"__STAR_WARS__ I get it.  Then you would move on to Episodes 1, 2, and 3."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly.  And then I'd finish with The Force Awakens and Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, luckily there is no wrong way to watch the series."
