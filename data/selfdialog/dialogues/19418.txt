"__MOVIES__ My favorite movie is 'Law Abiding Citizen' starring Jamie Foxx."
"__MOVIES__ That was a good but I didn't like the ending."
"__MOVIES__ Why because you thought the ending was predictable?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I wished the villian in that one had got away with killing all the people that he did."
"__MOVIES__ Oop spoiler alert right? Most people want the villian in movies to get their due"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but in 'Law Abiding Citizen' the court system screwed the man who eventually becomes the main villian."
"__MOVIES__ I actually thought the premise was genius and the way killer killed his victims was outstanding."
"__MOVIES__ Your sick. But to give us all that action, planning and murders then the movie turns around and gives us a predictable ending."
"__MOVIES__ But if the villian in the movie didn't get their due who would the audience root for?"
"__MOVIES__ That's exactly my point. The main character wasn't a murderer or villian at the start of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ He was still the antagonist and antagonists in movies should die, drown and at least go to jail"
"__MOVIES__ I agree but this movie was about the court system failing a 'Law Abiding Citizens.'"
"__MOVIES__ The fact that the court system fails you doesn't make or give you the right to go out and commit murder."
"__MOVIES__ Dororthy of the Wizard Of Oz threw water on the green witch and she died because of it. Shouldn't Dorothy have been killed?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Two completely different movies. The witch in the Wizard Of Oz brought Dorothy to her castle against her will so the witch got what she deserved."
"__MOVIES__ Monkey see monkey do you know literally, with the flying monkeys hunh?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh you got jokes but I was fascinated by castle guards, the apple throwing trees and Glenda the good witch's gown."
"__MOVIES__ Why? Because the guards wore red, silver and black uniforms? Or that Glenda the good witch travelled by bubble?"
"__MOVIES__ No because I think they the guards, were the originators of line dancing?"
"__MOVIES__ You and your take on movies is whacked and out of this world. (laughing)"
