"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey remember the Finding Nemo movie? The one with the fish?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, it's an old movie. I remember watching that as a kid. It's a good one, though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, well. They made a Finding DORY movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Finding Dory? About the blue fish that has bad memory?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes! Let's go see it tonight!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I can't tonight, let's go tomorrow."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I am such a Star Wars fan. I want to go see the new Star War's movie!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I kind of want to see it too. I heard the graphics are simply amazing."

"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That sounds like a great plan! Be ready at 4."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you know any good movies playing for kids right now? My nephew's birthday is this weekend!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Movies for kids? Well, Zootopia is a great movie for kids."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Zootopia huh? I heard some good things about that movie. Do you think my nephew would like to see it?"

"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's the problem! I have no idea!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well she likes the super hero movies right? Why not take her to go see Ant Man?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ She might like that. I'll probably end up seeing it with her. I'll let you know what I decide on, okay? Thanks for the help!"
