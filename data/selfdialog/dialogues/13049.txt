"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the AFC East?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, doesn't it start and end with the New England Patriots>"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certainly, but have they changed enough?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.   First, there's Brandin Cooks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A hot wide receiver, sure to improve the position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A big loss for New Orleans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, but they are already packed there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, but I would be surprised if they don't hold on to at least five guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, so the Patriots are your pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The division should be easy, a decent chance at a championship repeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the rest of the division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dolphins have their Tannehill issue at Quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you see problems all year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.     He is good, but cannot carry a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what about the bottom dwellers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Buffalo Bills are bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, you don't see them as a last place team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they still have enough talent to keep their heads above water."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That leaves the New York Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.      The Jets are easily the worst team in the division."
