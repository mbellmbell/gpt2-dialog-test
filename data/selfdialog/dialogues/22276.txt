"__DISNEY__ I remember the first Toy Story movie; I think we watched it ten times."
"__DISNEY__ Me, too!  My favorite character is Mr. Potato Head, he's so funny."
"__DISNEY__ Poor Woody starts out as the toy in charge, the most important."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, until Buzz Lightyear comes along."
"__DISNEY__ I used to pretend that my toys would do things, in a way, like they were real, but I never imagined what these toys did."
"__DISNEY__ I kind of look at toys in a different light now, like, is this toy going to come to life as soon as I shut the door and leave?"
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean.  It used to give me nightmares, wondering if a spider with a baby head was going to come crawling up my leg!"
"__DISNEY__ Ewww!  That gives me the creeps!"
"__DISNEY__ The whole perseverance thing with Woody and Buzz, though, is what I remember best from it."
"__DISNEY__ I like it that they were friends at the end."
