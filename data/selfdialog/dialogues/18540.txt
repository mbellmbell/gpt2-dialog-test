"__MOVIES__ Did you see that there's a new 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie out?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard that, but I don't know much about it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they're bringing back Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow!"
"__MOVIES__ What about the other two, um, I can't think of their names . . . ?"
"__MOVIES__ It was Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swann."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes!!  They had a great romance."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately, I don't think they have a big part in the new movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's too bad, I really like their characters."
"__MOVIES__ I believe Orlando Bloom is in the movie, but not Keira Knightly."
"__MOVIES__ They're not giving him a new love interest, are they?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think so."
"__MOVIES__ Because that would be a terrible thing to do after all they went through to be together!"
"__MOVIES__ And if you remember, they didn't get much time together in the last one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, their story was really tragic."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they are planning to somehow get Will back from the 'Underworld' or whereever he's supposed to be now."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe that's part of the premise of this new movie."
"__MOVIES__ I guess we should go see it and find out."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great idea."
"__MOVIES__ Let's see if we can get matinee tickets."
"__MOVIES__ I agree--the price of movie tickets is astronomical these days!!"
