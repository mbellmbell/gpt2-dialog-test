"__BEATLES__ What do you think about the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ I think they are awesome, I wish they had made more movies, though."
"__BEATLES__ Really? I was talking more about their music."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, yes, I know, I just think their movies were really groundbreaking, especially Hard Days' Night."
"__BEATLES__ I haven't ever seen that."
"__BEATLES__ You should. It's almost like the first feature length music video with a plot. Do you like old Beatles or newer Beatles music?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know, it's hard to say, they both are good in their own way. There's a huge difference between I Want To Hold Your Hand, and Let It Be."
"__BEATLES__ That's true.  There was a lot of innocence in their early music."
"__BEATLES__ Right, and by the time they had been around awhile the lyrics got a lot deeper."
"__BEATLES__ Well, now that you say that, I think that I do prefer their later music, songs like Yesterday, or In my Life."
