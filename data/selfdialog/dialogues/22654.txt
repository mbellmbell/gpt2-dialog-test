"__DISNEY__ I think Robin Williams gave the Genie so much character in Aladdin."

"__DISNEY__ Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock to name a few"
"__DISNEY__ All fine actors, but that role was practically made for Robin."
"__DISNEY__ Give me a better argument."

"__DISNEY__ That's actually a good point."
"__DISNEY__ His mannerisms even in cartoon form were top notch."
"__DISNEY__ He was such a lengend; R.I.P."
