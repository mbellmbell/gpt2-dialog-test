"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the Dubstep genre?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, at first I didn't like it, but then it kind of grew on me."
"__MUSIC__ Yea me too. But I'm particular with the type of Dubstep I like."
"__MUSIC__ What kind do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I need my Dubstep to be a dirty, filthy Dubstep."
"__MUSIC__ I don't understand what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Excision or Downlink?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, they are a bass heavy Dubstep."
"__MUSIC__ Well all Dubstep is bass heavy, but yea, they are more than most."
"__MUSIC__ So that's dirty Dubstep?"
"__MUSIC__ More or less, I want to feel like I need to take a shower after I listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha that's great! I like them too, but I like a more mellow style as well."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Datsik is really good."
"__MUSIC__ I like them too, but they are much more mellow than Excision."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, to each their own."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, who else do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Bassnectar is another one my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Oh me too! What's your favorite song by them?"
"__MUSIC__ Hard to say, but I would have to go with Timestretch."
