"__DISNEY__ Hey! Have you ever seen 'Finding Dory'?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I still haven't watched it. Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, It's one of my favorite movies- lets watch it sometime together."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that would be great!"
"__DISNEY__ Ellen Degeneres voices the character Dory, and Ty Burrell voices a beluga whale named Bailey."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, cool. I love Ellen! Did you like this movie as much as Finding Nemo?"
"__DISNEY__ I actually liked it a little better than Finding Nemo if you can believe it!"
"__DISNEY__ Awesome, now I'm really excited to see it."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I just loved the story and message about family. Great for adults and children."
"__DISNEY__ Nice, let's plan to watch it this weekend."
