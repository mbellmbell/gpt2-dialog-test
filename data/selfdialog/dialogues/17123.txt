"__MOVIES__ What do you like about going to the movies? It seems too costly for me for what you get."
"__MOVIES__ I actually agree. The last movie I saw in theaters was the second Chipmunks one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so you don't go often."
"__MOVIES__ No. I feel like it costs too much."
"__MOVIES__ The snacks are expensive too."
"__MOVIES__ I like to watch at home so I can spend my money on better snacks."
"__MOVIES__ Pls it's not so much hassle to go to the bathroom or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ Right. You have to try getting past all those lets."
"__MOVIES__ You also get to avoid people's badly behaved kids if you watch at home."
"__MOVIES__ Don't get me started about that. I'm not sure wht people don't make their kids sit down and behave."
"__MOVIES__ Especially if they just spent all that money."
"__MOVIES__ Right. It's insane."
"__MOVIES__ I don't take my kids unless I feel like they can handle it."
"__MOVIES__ Neither do I."
"__MOVIES__ Have your been to the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Only the oldest. She went with some friends."
"__MOVIES__ Was she good?"

"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed that."
"__MOVIES__ So did she."
