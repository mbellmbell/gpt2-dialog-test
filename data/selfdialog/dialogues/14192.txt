"__HORROR__ So, what are some of the more recent good horror films?"
"__HORROR__ Jeez. I can't get on board with most of them. So many weak franchises"
"__HORROR__ I'm with you there. Annabelle, Conjuring, Insidious. It's just all the same"
"__HORROR__ Isn't it funny how horror works? So many trends and ripoffs."
"__HORROR__ The last good ones were The Babadook and The Witch"
"__HORROR__ I really loved The Babadook. And The Witch was quite interesting"
"__HORROR__ Not as scary as hyped, mistake in marketing there."
"__HORROR__ I can't even think of any horror titles coming out this year actually."
"__HORROR__ I know. It's really depressing"
"__HORROR__ Think I'll just go back to the old classics, like Halloween"
