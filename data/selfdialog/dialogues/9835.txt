"__COMEDY__ Better comedy Monty Python and The Holy Grail, or Groundhog Day?"
"__COMEDY__ Is this a serious question? Groundhog Day is enjoyable, if a bit overplayed on TV, but Python all the way."
"__COMEDY__ I would agree if we were talking The Life of Brian, but always felt Holy Grail was overrated."
"__COMEDY__ No way, how could you not laugh at some of the scenes?"
"__COMEDY__ Notice I never said I didn't laugh, it's still a funny film, although never been huge on British humor."
"__COMEDY__ Well I will concede that Life of Brian was even better and while I love Bill Murray, Groundhog Day isn't on the same level."
"__COMEDY__ Well we can agree to disagree, Murray makes anything better."
"__COMEDY__ Oh he does indeed, but Monty Python makes everything better as well."
"__COMEDY__ I did really laugh at the banging coconuts for hooves."
"__COMEDY__ Ha yeah that was great."
