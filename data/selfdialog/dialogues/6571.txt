"__STAR_WARS__ Did you think Attack of the Clones was out of place?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In the timeline?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I just feel like it was a half hearted movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was an improvement over The Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Tyranus was pretty cool"

"__STAR_WARS__ Plus I think the character of Darth Sidious would be ruined."
