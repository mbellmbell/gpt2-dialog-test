"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm watching all the Harry Potter movies over again."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh awesome! I always see something new every time I do."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wasn't Dumbledore the absolute worst?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes! What a master manipulator. I'm pretty sure Grindewald broke up with him because he was so passive aggressive."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wait, didn't they duel over that whole, 'For the greater good' thing?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but I'm betting the backstory in the next Fantastic Beasts film shows quite a bit more of it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really like Dumbledore though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You don't get on tumblr much do you? Dumbledore was the worst. He justified leaving a child in an abusive home."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Dumbledore was just trying to protect Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Dumbledore was protecting Dumbledore. I'm telling you, he was the worst."
