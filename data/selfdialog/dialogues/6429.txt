"__STAR_WARS__ I was really surprised when Carrie Fisher died."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. It was very sad."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if she will be in any of the rest of the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they have filmed some scenes but they will have to do a lot of rewriting."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a shame I really liked seeing the old characters interact with the new ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ They can still concentrate on Han Solo and Luke Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes and well that's good it won't be quite the same."
"__STAR_WARS__ The original movies were the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I appreciate what they're trying to do but sometimes the storyline is too diluted."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know the ones that concentrate on the senate are kind of boring.  More action less talking."
