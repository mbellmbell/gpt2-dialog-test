"__STAR_WARS__ Do you prefer the original Star War Trilogy, the prequels, or the new films coming out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they all have their bright spots.  I really enjoyed The Rogue One film for example."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you like about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I enjoyed how the movie went more in depth about the events that happened prior to the first Star Wars film."
"__STAR_WARS__ It did add a lot of good backstory to things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep.  For example, one of the last scenes where the rebels are trying to escape with the Deathstar plans was amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Watching Darth Vader attempting to get the Deathstar plans while cutting through Rebel soldiers was scary."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know!  That was probably the most fearsome version of Darth Vader we have seen on screen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue One ended with a pretty cool nod to A New Hope with the hologram of Princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep.  It is sad that we won't see more of her in the movies due to Carrie Fischer's passing."
