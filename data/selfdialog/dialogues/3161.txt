"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of jazz music?"
"__MUSIC__ Me? No, not really."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I would've said the same thing if you asked me a week ago."
"__MUSIC__ Really? What changed?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, my boyfriend is a big fan of jazz. The traditional, old fashioned kind. Like big band."
"__MUSIC__ Like Benny Goodman? Glenn Miller? People like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. He really loves that kind of music. I've always kind of shied away from it."
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, it gives me a headache."
"__MUSIC__ Last week was my boyfriend's birthday. I told him I'd take him anywhere he wanted to go and he picked this jazz club down by the beach."
"__MUSIC__ That was nice of you. And he had a great time?"
"__MUSIC__ He loved it. That was no surprise. What was unexpected was the fact that I had such a good time."
"__MUSIC__ What made the difference?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was hearing the music live. It sounded so vibrant and clear. I think I had heard too many old recordings that weren't great quality."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. That can definitely influence your feelings."
"__MUSIC__ I was really caught off guard by how beautiful the music sounded. So emotional, so stirring."
"__MUSIC__ That's exciting. So now you're as big a fan as your boyfriend?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I would go that far. At least not yet. But I'm definitely a fan."
"__MUSIC__ The way you're talking kind of makes me want to hear the music the way you did."
"__MUSIC__ It's really a thrilling experience. You and I should go sometime."
"__MUSIC__ I'd love it. Maybe I'll be converted, too."
