"__MUSIC__ My heart has been hurting this week. I have been thinking of Toby Mac's song When Love Broke Though."
"__MUSIC__ I heard what happened. I'm sorry you had to go through that. But if that is song that you are thinking of. It's a great song to help you heal."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. It speaks of how we have to Jesus break through us."
"__MUSIC__ If you have not seen the video it also speaks of race tensions. The video itself is a very powerful video."
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics really sooth my heart. It tells me there is hope and that I don't have to be alone."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes we have to be broken in order to be fixed."
"__MUSIC__ Right now I feel broken and alone."
"__MUSIC__ Allow those words to sooth you. And as you meditate on them pray and ask God to show you where He should heal and restore you."
"__MUSIC__ When you are rejected it is hard to see the future. The only thing you see is the rejection and pain."
"__MUSIC__ But that is where you learn to see how you can be healed and move on. I understand it is hard, but if you take one moment at a time you will get through."
"__MUSIC__ Each step is so painful."
"__MUSIC__ That is one less step you have to take. Look at the journey ahead."
"__MUSIC__ I have to get past what I see and move on I know."
"__MUSIC__ know that you have hope and that each day it gets you closer to that hope."
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to think that anyone would want me after what I have done."
"__MUSIC__ Jesus does. He will meet you where you are. He will show you the way. But you have to forgive yourself and then start to know that you are worth something."
"__MUSIC__ My heart is wounded."
"__MUSIC__ And it will heal. But you have to know that this is a song that speaks the truth."
"__MUSIC__ It does give me hope."
"__MUSIC__ Allow those words to bath you in hope. And know that one day it will be in the past and you will get through this."
