"__THRILLER__ The movie 16 Blocks was crazy."
"__THRILLER__ I know! I just caught that on TV a few months ago."
"__THRILLER__ I thought the plot was a bit ridiculous. I mean, how many people could have wanted to kill that convict guy?"
"__THRILLER__ Apparently a lot, if it caused Bruce Willis so much grief to get him 16 blocks to court."
"__THRILLER__ That hostage scene on the bus in that movie was a bit too intense for me. I was worried something bad would happen."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that movie had a few moments where Iw wasn't sure if people would make it out alive."
"__THRILLER__ Fortunately, the movie had a happy ending."
"__THRILLER__ I know! I loved the birthday scene."
"__THRILLER__ Me too. I feel like they haven't made many movies like that one recently."
"__THRILLER__ I agree. I wish they would!"
