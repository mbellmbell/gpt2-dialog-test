"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What was your favorite 'Fast & Furious' movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's a tough question to answer.  I loved Five, but Seven was so emotional."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, that last scene was such a touching goodbye to Paul Walker and his character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'd say it's a tie between those two.  How about you?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I actually really loved the first two."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You mean when it used to be about street racing?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Exactly.  That was always the main appeal for me."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They still have racing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They do, but the racing is portrayed almost like an afterthought."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You have a point.  After Tokyo Drift, that street racing element started to get placed in the background."
