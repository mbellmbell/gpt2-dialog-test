"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see that crazy Harrison Ford thriller where his whole family got kidnapped?"
"__THRILLER__ I don't think so. When did it come out?"
"__THRILLER__ I think it was bout ten years ago."
"__THRILLER__ It doesn't ring a bell. Do you remember what it was called?"
"__THRILLER__ It had something to do with computers. Oh, it was Firewall!"
"__THRILLER__ I remember seeing previews for that, but never saw it. Is it worth a watch?"
"__THRILLER__ I think if you like thrillers, you'd like this movie. It's not deep, but it's a fun ride."
"__THRILLER__ Is it dark though? I don't like movies with sad endings."
"__THRILLER__ No, I don't think so."
"__THRILLER__ Maybe I'll have to watch sometime then!"
