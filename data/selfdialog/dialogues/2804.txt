"__MUSIC__ Do you like the rock group, Yes?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the band named Yes? Yes, I do."
"__MUSIC__ For many years in my childhood they were my favorite band, and pretty much the only music I ever listened to."
"__MUSIC__ I was a big fan of them also during their hayday. I've often wondered what other bands were in the same league with their creativity and ability."
"__MUSIC__ I think if you are a Yes fan, you should check out some of the solo albums and other spinoff albums that were done by the members of the group."
"__MUSIC__ Is that so? I wasn't aware of those works."
"__MUSIC__ In particular, the solo albums by Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman and Chris Squire are very good."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Which ones would you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Center of the Earth is well known, and he did an album called No Earthly Connection, which is really terrific."
"__MUSIC__ What about Chris Squire? He was the base player, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but he did a really good album that sounds a lot like Yes. It was called Fish out of Water."
"__MUSIC__ That's nice to know. What about Bill Bruford?"
"__MUSIC__ Bill Bruford is definitely one of the greatest drummers to ever play in a rock band. He created some great jazz-rock fusion albums, although it bares no resemblance to the Yes sound."
"__MUSIC__ He was also the drummer for King Crimson, wasn't he?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. For a while, after he left Yes, he played with King Crimson."
"__MUSIC__ What do his solo albums sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ It sounds mostly like jazz, but the instrumentation and structure is somewhat rock influenced. It seems he is primarily a Jazz artist."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't gotten into jazz-rock fusion very much, but I do like jazz and progressive rock in general."
"__MUSIC__ If that's the case you should definitely give Bill Bruford a try. My favorite song of his is 'One of a Kind' of the same titled album."
"__MUSIC__ Good suggestion. Next time I'm on Spotify I'll give it a go."
