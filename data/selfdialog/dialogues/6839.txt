"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about all of the changes that George Lucas made to the original Star Wars trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't mind the small special effects improvements but the major changes and ones that actually alter the story, I really dislike."
"__STAR_WARS__ What change do you dislike the most?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably that music number from Return of the Jedi called Jedi Rocks. It changes the whole tone of the scene and it extremely annoying."
"__STAR_WARS__ Most people would say that the Han shot first change is the worst."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's pretty bad but it's so quick that you can ignore it. You can't ignore the Jedi Rocks song."
"__STAR_WARS__ What change did you like the most of them all?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like I said, the minor special effects changes are nice actually. They just make the movies look a little nicer and more modern without dramatically changing the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about the CGI Jabba the Hutt that was added in the Star Wars Special addition?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it looks very fake and out of place. It's kind of a cool scene that maybe they could have added as a DVD extra but to have it as part of the movie forever is a bad thing I think."
