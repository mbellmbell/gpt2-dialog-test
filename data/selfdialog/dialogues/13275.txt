"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's talk about who you think will win each AFC division.  Let's start with the AFC East."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The New England Patriots - hands down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you on that.  Miami will be improved, but they still can't touch the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the AFC North?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's going to be a tough division. for sure the Browns won't win it.  They are really bad again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with that statement.  i think this divisions is going to be one of the toughest in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it looks like a three team race between the Ravens, Bengals, and Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Ravens will take it.  they picked up Maclin and have a stellar defense, and Flacco has been in big games before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of big game players, Roethlisberger's been there too.  They have Bell and Brown, I'm going with the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On to the AFC West. Another tough division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really think the Raiders are going to be tough.  They picked up Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For me, it's a toss up between Denver and Kansas City."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Denver's quarterback is really suspect."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with that, I would pick Kansas City to win it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ KC has a great defense and Smith is a decent QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How About the AFC South?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This one is easy for me.  I like Houston's defense, so I'm going Houston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Houston has a great defense, but their QB is suspect."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm picking Tennessee. I think Mariotta surprises people and they win the division."
