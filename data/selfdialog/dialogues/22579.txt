"__DISNEY__ So, I was building a snowman this afternoon and it reminded me of that song from Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ Do you want to build a snowman?"
"__DISNEY__ No, the one Ana sings to Elsa when their parents die."
"__DISNEY__ Do you want to build a snowman?"
"__DISNEY__ No I did that early today. Damn I wish I could remember the song?"
"__DISNEY__ Do you want to build a snowman!"
"__DISNEY__ No I don't, let it go already."
"__DISNEY__ No, you let it go."
"__DISNEY__ Stop being such an Elsa and go outside."
"__DISNEY__ Fine. The cold never bothered me anyway."
