"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Quarterback situation in Houston?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Texans?     After Brock Osweiler, anything would be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but that guy is gone.     What about the others."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They keep saying Tom Savage will start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that a good thing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we need to see how Deshaun Watson does in preseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was incredible in college last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but the NCAA is not the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't they have another quarterback too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Brandon Weedon is still on the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team did he come from?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the last team he was with was the Dallas Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.     They didn't draft him though, did they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I believe the Cleveland Browns originally drafted Weedon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's three, guys.    Will talent win out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Watson is definitely the most talented, but sometimes it takes time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope they give him an opportunity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, let him learn.    I hope he takes over sometime during the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if Tom Savage wins the job and makes it through the year, it can't be too bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so, that means Watson can learn, and the team is doing good."
