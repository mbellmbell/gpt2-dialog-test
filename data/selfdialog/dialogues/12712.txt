"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite part of an NFL gameday experience?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's a tough one, I love a bunch of things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For me, it's the tailgating and the food."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, that's definitely my favorite thing too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's just so many foods and drinks that I enjoy before I go into the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I try to take it easy so I can still enjoy the ballgame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One time, I ate so much at the stadium that I spent the whole game with a stomach ache."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no, that would be no fun at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It wasn't fun, and it was an overtime game, so it lasted even longer and I couldn't go home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to say that my second favorite thing about going to an NFL game is the crowd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really enjoy all those people?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. Why wouldn't I love being in a big crowd?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It takes a long time to park, drive, and get to your seat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but it feels great to be a part of 70,000 people cheering or booing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it is cool and unique to be among a crowd with that sheer size."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're not going to experience that feeling in a lot of other places, so you might as well enjoy it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I went to a New York Jets game last year, and the crowd was rowdy and rude."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That can happen at certain NFL stadiums, but for the most part the people are really nice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess when I go to a game this year I will have to learn to appreciate the people around me more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Try it, because it creates a great sense of community and togetherness while cheering for your team."
