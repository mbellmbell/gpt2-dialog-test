"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited for the Texans this coming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and no."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why no?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to get excited about Tom Savage being QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel you there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more excited about the future of the team with Watson under helm:"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think most of the city of Houston is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully Watson starts next season and the defense still has a few years left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be the perfect scenario."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just want to see a Championship here in Houston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Even the Oilers could't bring one home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. Only been a NBA title here in Houston. We need something else!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully Clowney can have another great season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. He was a best last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He made Tom Brady look like a rag doll in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the only bright spots in that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't want him chasing me down!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'd be scared as heck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, Watt coming back this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I'm excited about that."
