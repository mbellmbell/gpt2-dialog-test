"__LADY_GAGA__ i was scared the whole album would be like that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ it was a big strong song though."
"__LADY_GAGA__ it reminded me too much of artpop."
"__LADY_GAGA__ artpop was grand but wasn't catchy enough."
"__LADY_GAGA__ that was what i got from perfect illusion"
"__LADY_GAGA__ i get what you mean."
"__LADY_GAGA__ the chorus was not as strong either"
