"__MOVIES__ Have you seen a movie called Signs?"
"__MOVIES__ The one with Mel Gibson in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and aliens and crop circles."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've seen it a few times."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it for the first time last night myself."
"__MOVIES__ How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was good. I wasn't expecting to like it after reading some reviews, but it was better than I heard."
"__MOVIES__ Signs is one of M.Night Shyamalan's better movies."
"__MOVIES__ There was one thing I didn't like about Signs, though."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ When the alien ships were hovering over different countries, why weren't any jets scrambled?"
"__MOVIES__ I know right? I wondered the something."
"__MOVIES__ Someone could have fired a few missiles at them atleast. It was like the entire planet was docile and defenseless."
"__MOVIES__ Makes better drama, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ The part I liked the most was how everything was connected."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the water and stuff? Yeah, that was a nice touch."
"__MOVIES__ Those aliens were pretty dumb for trying to invade a planet that has more water than land."
"__MOVIES__ They weren't counting on people discovering their weakness so easily."
"__MOVIES__ What if it rained on them? What were those silly aliens going to do then?"
"__MOVIES__ Grab an umbrella I guess."
