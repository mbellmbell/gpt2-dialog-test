"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that animation 'Storks'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I did. What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I was really surprised and laughed out loud."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Though I thought the plot line was pretty typical."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess it's your typical layout but they got some really clever scenes in there."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too. What was your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ It was just kind of a chuckle until the wolves showed up!"
"__MOVIES__ Aww, man! That was favorite too!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you recognize the voices?"
"__MOVIES__ Key and Peel, right? Those guys are so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ I love how they totally played off the Wonder Twins powers!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know!"
"__MOVIES__ You know 'shape of a submarine'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and then all those wolves do the magic of turning in to sub, or plane or a boat!"
"__MOVIES__ It was crazy how they 'magnetized' together!"
"__MOVIES__ The faces on those guys were great too. Those wolves were snarling and wincing."
"__MOVIES__ I love the initial stand off. 'I'm going to be the Alpha.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and so typically the other guys 'No I'm going to be the new Alpha.'"
"__MOVIES__ 'No it's going to be me.' Those guys are so funny."
"__MOVIES__ They are they totally make that movie. I don't know how they come up with stuff. It's great!"
