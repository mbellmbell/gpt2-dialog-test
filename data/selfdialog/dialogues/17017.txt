"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new movie snatched?"
"__MOVIES__ No who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer."
"__MOVIES__ I love them both! How have I not heard of this film."
"__MOVIES__ No clue. I was hoping to get your opinion. I felt let down by Trainwreck."
"__MOVIES__ Trainwreck was a little disappointing for sure. Still adore schumer though."
"__MOVIES__ I still like her as well. I just don't want to waste money on tickets if snatched is another trainwreck."
"__MOVIES__ Ya. I bet it will be better if it has Goldie Hawn."
"__MOVIES__ True she is like a comedy legend. I love so many of her other films."
"__MOVIES__ Ya private benjamin is great."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Also Death becomes her is one of my top goldie hawn movie picks."
"__MOVIES__ It is exciting to see her on film again, been forever since she has done a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Too long if you ask me."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. Banger sisters was her last film I think and that was like ten years ago."
"__MOVIES__ I never actually saw it. Did you?"
"__MOVIES__ I did see that movie. It was just okay. I think I loved it for the actors in it more than the film making quality."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. Goldie is just so lovable. You can look past a bad film and just enjoy it for her."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she has that It factor movies need."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose I will probably like Snatched no matter what!"
"__MOVIES__ Probably true, enjoy it!"
