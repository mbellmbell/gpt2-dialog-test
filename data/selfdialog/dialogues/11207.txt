"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's going on Brian? Aren't you a Raiders fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You better believe it! Raider Nation!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think they can make a run with the new quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man our defense is scary, I don't care about offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? You guys have some pretty good weapons in your receivers and running backs man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Listen, I'm in it for the hitting bro, not the flash f touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you can score on defense and most times it's flashier than an offensive score,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, because it's such a magnificent play to strip your opponent of his goal and run it in their faces."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your clearly biased towards them, I don't know why I even brought up the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of hostility in that tone Eagles fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, whatever bro, you want to go to the game this weekend?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure man, it's not a good time for me to buy any tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't ask that bro, I asked if you wanted to see your bum Raiders get whooped?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, more hostility I see. Let's see if those bum eagles can match your enthusiasm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, whatever man. My former teammates gave me some cool tickets and I knew you were a bums fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? On who's team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your bum Raiders but you don't pay attention to offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know my team man, what's there names? I know every Raider I'm sure of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, we'll see when you meet them. Don't get all star struck and pee your pants asking for an autograph."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait, so I HAVE to know him right? I know every Raider man come on!"
