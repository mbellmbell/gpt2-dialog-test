"__HORROR__ Have you seen the movie Get Out yet?"
"__HORROR__ No I haven't seen it. Is it as good as the hype?"
"__HORROR__ Even better. Jordan Peele did such a good job writing and directing that film."
"__HORROR__ I heard that was his debut film too, is that right?"
"__HORROR__ That's true. And with him being a comedian it's surprising that he could delve into such dark territory."
"__HORROR__ Right you are. I've been wanting to see it because I've heard so many positive things about it."
"__HORROR__ It's filled with subliminal messages and little easter eggs to look for."
"__HORROR__ Right and I did hear it was actually frightening. That means a lot since modern horror movies aren't scary anymore."
"__HORROR__ This one definitely is. There's a seen where the main character is sent into the Sunken Place, which is just blood curdling."
"__HORROR__ He was under hypnosis, I remember hearing about that part."
