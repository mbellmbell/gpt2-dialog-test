"__DISNEY__ Have you ever seen The Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't seen it. What is it about?"
"__DISNEY__ It's about a mermaid named Ariel who gives up her voice in order to be able to go on land."
"__DISNEY__ Why does she want to go on land?"
"__DISNEY__ She falls in love with a handsome prince, but since she's a mermaid she can't get to know him."
"__DISNEY__ Does she end up marrying him?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but first she has to make him fall in love with her even though she can't talk."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds challenging. I don't understand how you can fall in love with someone if you can't talk to them."
"__DISNEY__ The evil sea witch Ursula tries to stop them from falling in love by using Ariel's voice to woo the prince."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that sounds kind of interesting."
