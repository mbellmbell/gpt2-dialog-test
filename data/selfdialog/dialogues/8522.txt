"__BEATLES__ I love that song!"
"__BEATLES__ What song?"
"__BEATLES__ The one that's playing on the radio."
"__BEATLES__ I can't make it out."
"__BEATLES__ It's the old Kenny Roger's song, 'The Gambler.'"
"__BEATLES__ No kidding?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. I used to sing that song every day back in high school."
"__BEATLES__ Every day?  It's a good song, but singing it every day...?"
"__BEATLES__ I fancied myself somewhat of a maverick and a great poker player. The song was my theme song!"
"__BEATLES__ It still suits you. Perfect song about an old guy sitting around reminiscing and constantly telling others his opinions."
