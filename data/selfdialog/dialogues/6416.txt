"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have any Star Wars memorabilia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I got the 'Art of' books of the first trilogy, because they had the screenplays as well as wonderful artwork."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wasn't into action figures, but I like movie posters, so I got the posters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever been to movie poster sites? The original posters are worth a mint now, if kept in pristine condition."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do have a few rare ones, as it happens.They aren't quite in pristine condition, but they're worth a nice little amount."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have several other books, and there was a collection of pre-viz sketches done by Ralph McQuarrie that were fantastic, so I got that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess there are geeks out there with basement shelves full of action figures still in their original packaging, so they'll be worth more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I was never that kind of collector. I didn't collect to sell later."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. Somehow it takes the fun out of being a fan when you can't play with the action figures."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or hang up the posters, right?"
