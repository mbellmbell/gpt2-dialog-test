"__MOVIES__ I finally saw Manchester by the Sea."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was good... but not as great as everyone said it was, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ What about the movie did you not like?"
"__MOVIES__ I just think I saw the basic storyline in the previews: 'I can't be the guardian.'"
"__MOVIES__ No way. There was the whole dark past secret thing. You didn't see that in the previews."
"__MOVIES__ I just didn't think it was great. Good and decent, but not Oscar-worthy."
"__MOVIES__ Casey Affleck is a good actor, though. He did an amazing job."
"__MOVIES__ I guess. I just thought it would be more riveting or something."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was great. I wouldn't mind seeing it again."
"__MOVIES__ I was expecting more from the Michelle Williams character."
"__MOVIES__ True. Her role seemed kind of small in comparison."
"__MOVIES__ Kyle Chandler, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. But I think Casey Affleck's character was meant to be the centerpiece of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Of course. I get that."
"__MOVIES__ But you were underwhelmed?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know... I guess it just didn't blow my mind or anything."
"__MOVIES__ You were expecting the movie to blow your mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah. There was so much hype leading up to the Oscars."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it was overhyped a bit. But I still thought it was a great movie."
