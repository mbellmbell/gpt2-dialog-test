"__MOVIES__ Wow what a boring day it is!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, there is nothing to do on this stormy day."
"__MOVIES__ I have an idea. Since it is storming out, do you want to watch a scary movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, do you have any in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen all of the Scream movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Are those the ones with Neve Campbell"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I think they are awesome."
"__MOVIES__ How many of them are there in all?"
"__MOVIES__ There is four in all."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I just thought there was three. I have not seen the last one."
"__MOVIES__ The last one came out in 2011."
"__MOVIES__ Does it have all the same people in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah basically. Other than Campbell there is David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Emma Roberts."
"__MOVIES__ Who is Emma Roberts?"
"__MOVIES__ She is Julia Roberts niece."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow. What character does she play in the film?"
"__MOVIES__ She plays Campbell's niece and the masked person is chasing her and her friends."
"__MOVIES__ Is it as good as all the others?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it is just as good if not better, but I truly love them all."
"__MOVIES__ Ok put it in, I can't wait to watch it."
