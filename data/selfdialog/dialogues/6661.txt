"__STAR_WARS__ Do you know if Princess Leia is going to be in anymore Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She has a part in eight, but not nine."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder why not nine. They could put her in digitally."
"__STAR_WARS__ I read where the president of LucusFilms doesn't want to do that."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's weird. First we lose Han Solo and now Princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if any other main characters wil not be in nine."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope Luke still is."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do, too. He was one of my favorite characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think lots of people still like him a lot."
