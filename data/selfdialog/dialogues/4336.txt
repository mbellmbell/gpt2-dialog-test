"__MUSIC__ Have you ever thought about taking a road trip to Texas?"
"__MUSIC__ I drove through Texas once on my way to the West Coast. Why, what's happening in Texas?"
"__MUSIC__ They're having the Austin City Limits Music Festival the first and second weekend of October."
"__MUSIC__ Is there a lot of good bands playing?"
"__MUSIC__ There's over 100 bands with eight different stages, that's why it runs for two different weekends. And yes, there are lots of good bands."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of nice, two different weekends in case you can't make it on a certain weekend. What kind of bands would I like?"
"__MUSIC__ Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jay Z, Chance the Rapper, The Killers, Gorillaz, Martin Garrix, Ice Cube, Ryan Adams, Live, EDM, and lots of others."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I LOVE The Red Hot Chili Peppers!"
"__MUSIC__ They don't have prices up for tickets for a single day yet, those are supposedly coming soon"
"__MUSIC__ What about the 3 day passes?"
"__MUSIC__ The 3 day pass for weekend one is sold out already, they still have those available for weekend two for $255."
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of expensive, that works out to $85 a day with the three day pass."
"__MUSIC__ It's because there are so many bands there that they have to pay."
"__MUSIC__ Is there parking nearby?"
"__MUSIC__ No. It's in a park, and they advise you can't park in the neighborhood. The recommended route is to park in one of the downtown paid lots and ride the shuttle bus down to the festival."
"__MUSIC__ What about places to stay?"
"__MUSIC__ There's lots of hotels with ticket packages, but there are probably plenty of smaller motelds if you want to find some place cheaper to stay. It's always best in these events to book way ahead."
"__MUSIC__ What do people post about their experiences there?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called the live music capital of the world. I've never been, but I imagine it'slike Texas where everything is bigger- the number of bands, number of people, and amount of fun hopefully."
"__MUSIC__ It does sound like an 'experience"
