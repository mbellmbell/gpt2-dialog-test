"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did you watch this year's NFL Draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I did. Not only did I watch it, I actually went to Philadelphia for it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's great! How was it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was cool. There was a lot of people!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Were there a lot of Packers fans there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess. But it was 99% Eagles fans. Which I guess isn't surprising, but kinda is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I expected there to be a lot more of fans from other teams from around the entire NFL, but it was very Philly dominant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it was in Philadelphia. So that makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, yeah, but you'd think there would have been a lot of travelers looking to experience it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team was second most in fans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually. It probably was the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow really? Thats weird."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well I guess it was their Super Bowl. Haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It isnt that close to Philly either. So that's interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but there was some suspense around their pick. And now all their fans can say they were there when they took Miles Garrett."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ....and not Mitch Trubiskey. haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was probably the craziest part of the draft. Nobody saw that coming."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bears traded up ONE Pick for him!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they must have thought someone else was gonna trade up. It's going to be fun to look at in the future!"
