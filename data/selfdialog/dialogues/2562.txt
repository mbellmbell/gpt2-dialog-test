"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't listen to much of the new stuff. I like a lot of the older stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. Do you like '90s music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like some of it. There wer a lot of interesting bands back then."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. The grunge movement was really big."
"__MUSIC__ I like grunge music. I like stuff like Nirvana and Stone Temple Pilots."
"__MUSIC__ The drummer from Nirvana went on to form Foo Fighters."
"__MUSIC__ I like Foo Fighters. It seems like you don't hear much from them nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. There's not much continuity in music these."
"__MUSIC__ Hip Hop is really big, which is fine. It's just that it seems like there's that lack of classic talent that lasts a long time."
"__MUSIC__ True, other than artists like Eminem. He's still around, and still considered very good."
"__MUSIC__ Eminem is considered one of the best. I've just never really listened to him much personally."
"__MUSIC__ What other kind of music do you listen to then, when not listeing to rock music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like classical, actually."
"__MUSIC__ Classical is good. We wouldn't have good movie soundtracks without classical music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Some of the best soundtracks make use of existing classical music."
"__MUSIC__ There's also new music written for movies that becomes iconic, like Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I think everyone recognizes the them to Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ In a way, it reminds a little of that song Flight of the Valkeryies."
"__MUSIC__ That's another song that everyone recognizes when they hear it. Beethoven's 5th is another."
