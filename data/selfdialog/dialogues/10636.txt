"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you prefer guy rappers or girl rappers?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think there's a big difference?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think girls tend to rap a bit harder because they think they need to prove themselves."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm not sure about that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well look at Angel Haze or Cupcakke."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But Busta Rhymes goes just as hard."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but female rappers make it a point to never be lazy."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's true. Azealia Banks is another one."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Also M.I.A., although she definitely blurs the lines between rap and electronic."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ She's too experimental for me."
