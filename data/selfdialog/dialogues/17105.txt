"__MOVIES__ What movie are you most anticipating?"
"__MOVIES__ I am dying to see the new It film."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the trailer , It looks like they did a great job. So creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Ya it looks better than the original film to me. I love Tim Curry as penny wise but this updated version looks amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Pennywise does look especially scary in this new trailer. Tim Curry is awesome, I loved him in the film clue."
"__MOVIES__ Never heard of it.. like the board game?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. teh movie was made based off the game clue. Really funny. Great halloween movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool , I will have to check it out.I am also looking forward to stephen king's other big movie. Dark Tower."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I loved that book series. I am a little weary of the film version."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ The books are so epic not sure the movie will do it justice. Also don't love the casting."
"__MOVIES__ I agree the casting is a little off from the book character descriptions but elba is a strong actor."
"__MOVIES__ I am a fan of his. Just not very true to the original material. I would have rather seen matthew McConaughey as the gunslinger Roland."
"__MOVIES__ He looks closer to the book version true. But I still think this movie will be great."
"__MOVIES__ I hope you are right about that. The trailer does look well done."
"__MOVIES__ Stephen King is really going to town with the movie adaptations this year."
"__MOVIES__ I know they have been trying to get the dark tower made into a movie for years now."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting it comes around as the same time as the new IT movie."
"__MOVIES__ I am sure he will be racking in the profits."
"__MOVIES__ I would be laughing if I were him. These two movies are probably going to sell so many tickets."
