"__MOVIES__ So, your contention is that movies can be a good way to get people interested in history, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  I think people who write history books are generally so devoted to getting absolutely every detail right, they bore people to death with minutiae."
"__MOVIES__ You've got a point there."
"__MOVIES__ You ask the average American soldier, for example, what the significance was of the Nuremberg trials after WW2, what answer do you think you'd get?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't even know what you're talking about."
"__MOVIES__ See?  We do such a poor job of educating our citizens, you're a junior in college and you've never heard of them."
"__MOVIES__ OK, I'll bite.  What was the significance of the Nuremberg trials?  And for the record, I'm a music major."
"__MOVIES__ The Nuremberg defendants were tried for war crimes, like shooting unarmed prisoners,  and crimes against humanity, like killing millions of civillians."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the Jews in concentration camps?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it wasn't just Jews--gypsies, communists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Poles, Political dissidents. Russians, gays, handicapped--those people killed anyone they didn't like."
"__MOVIES__ What does that have to do with our soldiers today?"
"__MOVIES__ You've heard of Abu Gahraib, right?  Where US soldiers were ordered to humiliate and torture prisoners?"
"__MOVIES__ Rings a bell, but what's THAT got to do with Nazis?"
"__MOVIES__ The soldiers at Abu Gahraib thought what they were doing was ok,because they were following orders."
"__MOVIES__ So?"
"__MOVIES__ The major defendants at Nuremberg tried to argue the same thing.  The courts found that some orders are illegal, like orders to torture someone, and that people have a duty to disobey those orders.  That's why some of our soldiers were court-martialed.  I think a General was even force to retire."
"__MOVIES__ What's that got to do with movies?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a really good movie about it, called 'Judgement at Nuremberg'.  I think it was ,ade in like 1962, or something.  Our service men and women ought to see that movie in boot camp.  That way they will know better than to follow orders like that."
"__MOVIES__ You and your old movies!"
"__MOVIES__ It's a good one.  Check it out."
