"__MOVIES__ I really like old classic movies, how about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I like some of them, especially the film noir stuff from the 1940's."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, film noir, yes, I like that kind of movie too...especially with famous stars like Evelyn Keys, Robert Mitchum, Humphrey Bogart and many more.  I also like the comedies of the 1940's, how about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm...I do like comedies in general, but my favorite comedy films come from the 1960's, you know, like The Producers."
"__MOVIES__ The original Producers was great!  The casting was incredible.  I think that film inspired future comedies, things like the Pink Panther, and all those other Mel Brooks films.  Do you have a favorite Mel Brooks film?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say The Producers, the original one.  I also liked Young Frankenstein."
"__MOVIES__ Those were gems!  I must admit that I found Blazing Saddles wildly funny.  I thought the second version of The Producers was okay, but lost something compared to the original.  Why is it when they re-do a movie it is rarely as good as the original?"
"__MOVIES__ Beats me, but I totally agree.  There have been some lousy remakes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, here's one that comes to mind, Sabrina.  That was a perfectly fine Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart vehicle, but when they remade it, it was just sad."
"__MOVIES__ <laughs> That's for sure!  I understand that Gaslight, the Ingrid Bergman/Charles Boyer version, was a remake of an English film.  I found both were good, and both had different takes, including different supporting characters."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting, I hadn't seen the earlier version, do you know who stars in that version?"
"__MOVIES__ English actors, Anton Walback, or something like that.  It was made just a few years before the Hollywood version."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting, I think I will Google it and check it out.  It sure is fun to explore movies, isn't it!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Do you like musicals?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I like the sappy ones from the 40's and 50's.  I love Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, you know, all those talented folks."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  I can't think of a musical I like in current times though."
"__MOVIES__ It really was a different era back then, and the movies sure reflected it."
"__MOVIES__ I did not like the musical Evita, if you could call that a musical."
"__MOVIES__ I found Evita to be a real downer, and I got sick of the same song going on and on!  Speaking of going on and on, I'm out of time!  Let's talk about movies tomorrow too, okay?"
"__MOVIES__ That would be great!  Lovely to talk with you, good bye."
