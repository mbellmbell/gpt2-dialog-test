"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie, 'Split'?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I think it's one of the best movies of the year."
"__MOVIES__ Really? It's an M. Night Shayamalan movie, isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but this one is really good -- unlike some of his recent films that were not so great."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a guy with multiple personalites that has a secret monstrous personality called the beast."
"__MOVIES__ Which actors are in it? Are there any major stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ There aren't any A-list stars in it, but the acting is very good. The main character is played by James McAvoy. He does an amazing job portraying over a dozen different characters."
"__MOVIES__ Is it scary?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say, for most people, it's not really scary, but it's suspenseful and the plot is pretty interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in it besides McAvoy?"
"__MOVIES__ There's this really cute girl that plays the main protagonist. The actress's name is Anya Taylor-Joy."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of her, or at least, I don't know her by name."
"__MOVIES__ She's a new actress and she looks like a teenager. She was in the movie, 'The Witch.'"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see that one."
"__MOVIES__ It was weird, but good. She is supposed to star in the upcoming New Mutants movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm still not sure if I want to see Split. It sounds like one of those movies with a lot of dialog but not much action."
"__MOVIES__ If you are the type that needs a lot of constant violence and nudity to keep you engaged in a movie, then you definitely won't like it. If you have slightly above-average intelligence, you will probably like it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay then. Maybe I'll give it a shot."
