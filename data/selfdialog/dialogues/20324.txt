"__MOVIES__ Are you familiar with the Shrek franchise?"
"__MOVIES__ The one that Dreamworks did?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen several of them."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is your favorite."
"__MOVIES__ I think that the first one is the best, but I never saw Puss in Boots."
"__MOVIES__ What do you like about the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know; it's a solid self-contained story that doesn't take itself too seriously."
"__MOVIES__ I personally thing that Shrek 2 is the best."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ The second movie introduces Puss in Boots to the ensemble, which does a good job of shaking up the hero, foil, romantic interest triangle and allows more nuanced character interactions."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I had considered that. Who voices Puss again?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Antonio Banderas."
"__MOVIES__ That's right."
"__MOVIES__ The really masterful thing about the Shrek Cinematic Universe is that it co-opts centuries of European fairy tales and folk stories into a cohesive whole and explores the logistical outcomes of such a shared world, while maintaining a lighthearted atmosphere conducive to a series of humorous fantasy jaunts."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into the Shrek movies."
"__MOVIES__ Furthermore, it pulls together an all-star cast and gives them opportunities to live up to their voice acting potential."
"__MOVIES__ I noticed that pun you put in with 'all star.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Smash Mouth's 1999 hit was also a perfect choice that really captured the emotional milieu of the film."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose it was."
