"__FASHION__ Hi"
"__FASHION__ Hi, do you like fashion?"
"__FASHION__ Yes I try and stay on top of the latest trends."
"__FASHION__ Me too, I just bought another romper."

"__FASHION__ The one I just got is white, I love it. I got matching sandals too."
"__FASHION__ That sounds cute, I've been wanting a white romper."
"__FASHION__ I just got a pair of skinny jeans, with holes in them too, from Hollister."

"__FASHION__ I always wear jeans, sandals, and tank tops. It's my favorite fashion statement."
"__FASHION__ That sounds cute, I do it when I got out, but not all the time."
"__FASHION__ Sometimes I wear leggins, with a tunic, when I want to look cute, but comfortable."
"__FASHION__ I love leggings, I'm pretty sure I have a pair in every color."
"__FASHION__ I only have black and brown. I don't like the pattern ones."
"__FASHION__ I like them. I have these camp leggings and I have a super cute black shirt that I wear with them."
"__FASHION__ That sounds like it looks good. I wanted to get a geometric design once, but I couldn't find a shirt I liked with them."
"__FASHION__ To pull it off it has to be a solid color shirt, it can't have anythng on it"
"__FASHION__ Yea, I have trouble finding solid color shirts I like."
"__FASHION__ I have a pink pattern leggings and I wear a solid white shirt. Love it."
