"__DISNEY__ Are you going to see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I will probably see it when it comes out on DVD. I've seen all the previous ones."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know how I feel about it. The series has gone a little stale."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I feel like Captain Jack Sparrow's character has gotten old."
"__DISNEY__ The first movie was awesome, but it seems like they are really milking it now."
"__DISNEY__ I think that's true of all movie series."
"__DISNEY__ Having said that, I will probably still see it."
"__DISNEY__ I still am a Johnny Depp fan, but I won't waste money and time going to the theater."
"__DISNEY__ I much prefer him as Captain Jack Sparrow than the Mad Hatter in the Alice in Wonderland movies."
"__DISNEY__ No disagreement from me!"
