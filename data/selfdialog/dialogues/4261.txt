"__MUSIC__ So, how do you feel about funk music?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like Millennials don't really get it, or care for it."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe it's sort of become dated, in the sense that lots of musical genres are 'funky' now?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I was on an online messageboard made up primarily of indie rock fans, and they said the only 'funky' band they like is the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
"__MUSIC__ That's weird. Because the Chili Peppers definitely absorbed seminal funk influences."
"__MUSIC__ For sure, the stuff like George Clinton with Parliament and Funkadelic, for one."
"__MUSIC__ Or the funky post-punk artists, like Gang of Four."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, if you listen to early Chili Peppers they sound like a Gang of Four tribute band, with sillier lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like once hip-hop emerged, it stole fans away from live bands playing funk music."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, and hip-hop has gotten less funky as it moved away from samples of James Brown and those types of guys."
"__MUSIC__ But then you have the Roots, who are funky, and a live hip-hop band, and enormously popular."
"__MUSIC__ Well, but the thing is, they're a live band on a talk show now, so they're more for aging Generation X-ers..."
"__MUSIC__ In other words, people who get more of the context for funk music, as opposed to rock or other genres."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I think the issue is more that distinct musical genres aren't what they used to be."
"__MUSIC__ So things like techno music and all its many, many offshoots are very 'funky'..."
"__MUSIC__ But their fans won't really identify it as such."
"__MUSIC__ So maybe we're just less into labeling things, which could be the issue."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I find when Millennial music listeners talk about funk, they kind of mean funky hippie jam bands like Phish, which have a bad reputation."
"__MUSIC__ You mean, they find them corny or outdated..."
"__MUSIC__ I think so. They need to hear the good stuff, like the Isley Brothers from the late Sixties and early Seventies."
