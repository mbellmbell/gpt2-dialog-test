"__HARRY_POTTER__ How do you think the harry potter movies compared to the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think overall they did a really good job with the basic plot, but they could have done better in some of the finer details."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True.  I know they had to cut some stuff due to the length of the books, but some of the changes they made didn't make sense."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, i have always hated their ending of the 8th movie.  Voldemort just kind of disintegrated."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And i liked harry repairing his wand with the elder wand in the book better than him just breaking it in the movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ and in the book the portrait of dumbledore in the office was a nice thing to see.  the movie skips that completly"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really wish peeves had been in the movies as well.  he was such a funny character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, i was really surprised when they excluded him from the movies.  he played an important part in some of the scenes in the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I am really looking forward to the fantastic beasts trilogy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too.  it will be nice to see some of dumbledore's back story."
