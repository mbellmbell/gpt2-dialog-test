"__STAR_WARS__ Which star wars movie is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite is probably episode 3."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a good one.  Why is that your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because you get to see the birth of darth vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is he your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, i have always liked that character since the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think he and Luke are a lot alike?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  I just think Luke was better at controlling his anger.  It wouldn't surprise me if Luke ended up going to the dark side at some point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, i have always thought that about him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hopefully he won't, but it just seems like his character is at least partially in touch with the dark side of the force."
