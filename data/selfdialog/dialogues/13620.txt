"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Bills have a shot this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a chance. Tyrod Taylor hasn't done much of anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He went to the Pro Bowl and doesn't throw any interceptions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he also doesn't throw for many yards. Sammy Watkins is going to waste on that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Watkins healthy this year, he should get at least 1,200 yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he stays healthy. That's a huge if."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And what about LeSean McCoy? Shady should have another fantastic year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pinning your hopes on an aging running back is never a good idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well look at the defense. They added Micah Hyde and should be a lot better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also lost Stephon Gilmore at cornerback. That's a huge loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the new coaching staff is all about discipline and that will make a big difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rex Ryan was garbage last year, I'll give you that, but Sean McDermott is no miracle worker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the new front office will start bringing in the right people and turn the team around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've been saying that since 2000. Nothing there will ever change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't be such a pessimist. This is the year the 17-year playoff drought ends."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've also been saying THAT forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When Tyrod is leading the Bills on a game-winning drive in the playoffs, you'll feel pretty stupid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When Tyrod is doing that, who will you be playing against in your Madden video game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very funny. I'm telling you, the Bills will be in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In an AFC East that has the Patriots and Dolphins? I doubt it."
