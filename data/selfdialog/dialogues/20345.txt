"__MOVIES__ Recently I started watching Korean dramas and movies"
"__MOVIES__ Really, why?"
"__MOVIES__ I just find them refreshing and different.  I enjoy seeing what is, to me, an exotic locale and how the society differs or is the same."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't reading subtitles hard?"
"__MOVIES__ No, actually I like it. I even use subtitles sometimes on American movies because some of them seem hard for me to hear everything."
"__MOVIES__ That's weird, I think I'd hate subtitles.  Do they have any dubbed versions?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably.  I mainly watch on DramaFever and theirs are all subtitled."
"__MOVIES__ So what have you watched?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched Lump of Sugar, which is about a race horse."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it a lot, but it was a real tear jerker.  You have to remember with korean drama they don't feel like everything has to end happily ever after."
"__MOVIES__ How does it end then?"
"__MOVIES__ The horse dies after a race."
"__MOVIES__ That would be really sad.  Why did you like it then?"
"__MOVIES__ As someone who has worked with horses, it was very realistic.  Not idealized or fantasy."
"__MOVIES__ But what's the point if the horse just dies in the end?"
"__MOVIES__ It was about peoples relationships to each other, and to the horse - and about that particular horses courage and desire to win."
"__MOVIES__ I hate it when they race horses to death. Is it a horrible death scene?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  It's sad, but it isn't bloody or awful.  Lots of tears. They don't force him to race, or juice him up with painkillers like they do here either."
"__MOVIES__ I still don't think I would like it."
