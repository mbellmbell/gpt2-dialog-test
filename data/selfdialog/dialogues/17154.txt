"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favorite film from a Stephen King story?"
"__MOVIES__ Stand By Me was really good."
"__MOVIES__ It most definitely was, and it's not really a horror film is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, I mean there is a dead kid and Kiefer Sutherland plays a really bad dude but that's about it."
"__MOVIES__ What about Chopper?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean the junkyard dog?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was kind of scary. He was definitely a mean dog, might have had rabies or something."
"__MOVIES__ You know who was in that movie but looks completely different today?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's easy. It's Jerry O'Connell. Wil Wheaton looks exactly the same still."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. Wil looks like a kind of grown up kid with a beard."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if River Phoenix hadn't died, would he have been as successful an actor as his brother?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably, he was really talented. It would have been cool to see him and Joaquin in movies together."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they would have been better than the Baldwin brothers."
"__MOVIES__ Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez were in some movies together weren't they?"
"__MOVIES__ Men at Work is the only one that I can think of. It definitely wasn't the best film."
"__MOVIES__ Emilio kind of fell off the map didn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes he did. The last big hit that I remember him starring in was Young Guns."
"__MOVIES__ Great movie, and Charlie Sheen was in that film too. I forgot about that one."
"__MOVIES__ At least Emilio didn't slide down the rabbit hole like Charlie. Unfortunately, I think that's it for Sheen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah man, it's no good. Wall Street is one of my favorite movies. I kind of miss Charlie."
