"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best RB ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's some tough competition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh sure.  You can make a case for a number of guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For me, I'll go with Jim Brown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was definitely a load to bring down.  A man among boys when he played."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, they couldn't stop him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure how well he would match up these days though.  Players are much bigger, stronger, faster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair point I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would give the edge to Barry Sanders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to knock you on that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To me, he was the best back ever even if he doesn't have many records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Playing on a bad line didn't help him out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was so shifty though.  Can you imagine how well he would have done with a better line?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean one like Emmitt Smith had?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  A good OL makes all the difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Within reason.  I mean, Smith had a great line, but he was also a great back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not discounting him, just saying it's easier to get yards when you have huge lanes to run through."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Sanders never really had that advantage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  I bet he would have the single season and career record with a better group."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guess we'll never know for sure."
