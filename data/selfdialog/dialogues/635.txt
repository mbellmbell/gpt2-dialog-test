"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of people seeing musical notes as colors?"
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's called Synesthesia."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds weird."
"__MUSIC__ Like less than 1% of the population is born with some of their senses intertwined."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I wish I had that."
"__MUSIC__ I actually have a friend who, when he plays piano, just has a river of colors flowing in his brain."
"__MUSIC__ You framed it like a disease at first, but now it sounds like a boon."
"__MUSIC__ Oh totally. I'm sure Synesthesia makes you better at music."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. It probably can only help."
"__MUSIC__ There are also other forms of Synesthesia, like people smelling colors."
"__MUSIC__ That one doesn't seem as useful."
"__MUSIC__ What is the best chef in the world smells a rainbow of flavors."
"__MUSIC__ Or the best food critic has a refined color wheel on his palette."
"__MUSIC__ I see what you did there. Palette."
"__MUSIC__ I kid I kid. Thanks for telling me about this."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah no problem. I just thought it was interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Now I just wish I had it."
"__MUSIC__ I do too. We're just going to have to imagine colors while we do things."
"__MUSIC__ I'm thinking of rainbow!!"
