"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's talk Pittsburgh Steelers.  How about their 2008 draft picks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch.  That was a tough one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  Not one of their picks is still with the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right!  Bruce Davis!  He was a linebacker, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. He went to the Oakland Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only for a couple of years, though, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  He didn't pan out there at all either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least he ended up close to home.  Wasn't he from UCLA?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.  Guess you he ended where he started."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Rashard Mendenhall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man.. he fumbled and people still blame him for the Green Bay Packers loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, ya gotta blame someone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  Let's blame him.  He doesn't play for the Steelers now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huey Richardson is the one I remember as being a horrible pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh absolutely.   What about Tim Worley?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's no way he was gonna be the next Herschel Walker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No one can be Herschel Walker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's crazy someone actually thought that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we can sit here all day blasting Pittsburgh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it.  Let's lighten the mood with Terry Bradshaw talk."
