"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm so excited about the Stanley Cup playoffs!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too, I think the Penguins will win this year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No way, the Kings are going to be on top."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Penguins are better."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No they aren't. Besides, Sidney Crosby will probably get hurt again."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Crosby isn't the Penguins only player you know."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know, but he is by far the best player on the team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who do the Kings have who is so good?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Kings have a complete team. The Penguins are just basically Crosby."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The goal tender wouldn't like to hear that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If he was better I wouldn't say it. Besides, the Kings have a better won/lost record."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ All you have to do is get into the playoffs, then your record doesn't matter. It's just who wins."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Penguins can't beat the Kings four times."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think they can. I don't even think the Kings are the best team in their conferecne."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're nuts. The Kings are by far the best. They will win the cup easily."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's what you said about the Capitols last year, and they were out in the first round."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Capitols had too many injuries. The Kings are healthy."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Kings are healthy until someone gets hurt in the first game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Whatever. We'll see what happens when the tournament starts."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You've got that right."
