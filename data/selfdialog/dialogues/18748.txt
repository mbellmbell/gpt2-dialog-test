"__MOVIES__ hey there. can you tell me show timings of new alien movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure. first you have to tell me which specific theater you are planning to go."
"__MOVIES__ Not any specific theater decided. I guess I am okay with any theater."
"__MOVIES__ why don't you try searching it on google? it will show you all the theaters in which alien is currently running along with show timings."
"__MOVIES__ I am not very technology friendly. by the way do you know that the first alien movie came out in 1980?"
"__MOVIES__ yes I know that. In fact I am a fan of alien movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! that is so nice to hear. Have you seen all the parts of alien movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I am pretty sure that I have seen all the parts of alien series but I am not sure about alien vs predator movies."
"__MOVIES__ there has been only two alien vs predator movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, then I am certain that I have seen both of them."
"__MOVIES__ So which one do you like more? aliens? or predators?"
"__MOVIES__ I like predators more. I love their use of technological weapons. Especially their cloaking ability."
"__MOVIES__ yes, predators are definitely more technologically advanced compared to aliens."
"__MOVIES__ But I also like aliens, especially their way of reproducing."
"__MOVIES__ I think that is one of the iconic horror scenes of alien movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, It can be really scary to watch alien babies coming out of bodies of human hosts."
"__MOVIES__ anyways, I don't have much time today, So I should better figure out show timings before I run out of free time."
"__MOVIES__ you know what? I will look it on google right now and tell you."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that is so nice of you. thank you so much!"
"__MOVIES__ No problem buddy. It's my pleasure."
