"__MUSIC__ I had a fun evening yesterday with my husband. He did the DJ for me."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that sounds fun! What did he play?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, a mix of genres. We love to do that. He's a bit of a music savant, actually."
"__MUSIC__ So, what did he start with?"
"__MUSIC__ A bit of classic rock. He loves his old 80's rock."
"__MUSIC__ And do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Meh... Some things I like. But I prefer the new wave from the 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Like Depeche Mode and Tears for Fear?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! But I also like some good funk from the 80's and 90's."
"__MUSIC__ Oh funk is always great! Although I have a fondness for more recent funk, like Brooklyn Funk Essentials."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love those guys!"
"__MUSIC__ 'The revolution was postponed because of the rain.' That' genius!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! And of course, I love some classic hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ What is classic for you in hip hop?"
"__MUSIC__ Guru, 50 Cents, Nas, Eminem."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, classic. What about Tupac?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know him much at all actually, I have to listen to some of what he did."
"__MUSIC__ You know what I like? Gorillaz. I love their mix of genres."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love those guys. Plastic Beach is one of my favorite albums of all times."
"__MUSIC__ 'Lady You're a Winner.' It's so good!"
