"__DISNEY__ Isn't it considered the gold standard for Disney art?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, now that I'm an adult, I can really appreciate the historical artistic touches.  But I didn't like it as a kid."

"__DISNEY__ Did you like Aurora's dress better in pink or blue."
"__DISNEY__ I liked both.  But they should have mixed the two and done purple."
