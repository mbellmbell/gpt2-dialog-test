"__MUSIC__ So, what do you think of Nicki Minaj?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I like her music, just not her videos."
"__MUSIC__ Did you see the one for Anaconda?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I liked most of it but couldn't watch it with my little sister."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't like the lyrics.  She sure is pretty, though."
"__MUSIC__ I like when she gets together with other singers, like when she sang with Jessie J in 'Bang Bang.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, I like that song, too.  DIdn't they both sing with Ariana Grande?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, all three got together on stage with 'Bang Bang.'"
"__MUSIC__ Ludacris did a song with Nicky singing, too, yeah?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, that was 'My Chick Bad', back in 2010."
"__MUSIC__ She also sang in 'Monster' with Kanye!"
"__MUSIC__ I love her lips, I think they're great."
"__MUSIC__ Her lips and her huge booty, but she's pretty proud of her booty."
"__MUSIC__ That's because she's not oddly shaped; everything matches up well on her body."
"__MUSIC__ So, what's her latest song out now?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she dropped 3 new ones back in March:   'Regret In Your Tears,' 'Changed It,' and 'No Frauds.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Lil Wayne sung with her on 'Changed It'."
"__MUSIC__ She was talking to Remy Ma Beef when she rapped, ''Tried to drop 'Another One,' you was itchin' to scrap / You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish you were scrapped / Heard your pussy on 'Yuck,' I guess you needed a pap / What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rap,'"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely love some hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Nicki Minaj is one of the best."
