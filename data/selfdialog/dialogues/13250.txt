"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like the Dallas Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't get why they are always talked about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get it, but I don't like it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the reason why they are always in the national media?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they are called America's Team, but it's really just about money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah, so they are the team that the league wants to push on people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, and their fan base is somewhat large, so it makes sense to give them a lot of attention."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I heard that their ticket and merchandise sales are high compared to small market teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That may be true, but they haven't fielded a championship team in a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So they are mostly hype?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and that's what makes people mad about all the media coverage they get."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it's all style, and no substance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I guess that's half of the reason why anyone gets attention in this world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do the Cowboys have any good players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their running back Ezekiel Elliott is good, but he was only a rookie last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How's their quarterback situation?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott had a solid year last season too, but he was a rookie just like Elliott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it's anybody's guess if they can continue their success this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the question, and usually players have a sophomore slump in their second season."
