"__MUSIC__ You know what I was listening to in the car yesterday?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Classic rock radio."
"__MUSIC__ Awwwww yeah. I listen to that a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I had never listened to it before."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious... why?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Probably because I thought it was for old dudes."
"__MUSIC__ Well maybe that means you're an old dude now. Let's see, what's your favorite classic rock band?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough one. Probably Led Zeppelin."
"__MUSIC__ Nice choice. Frickin' John Bonham man. That intro to When The Levee breaks is the greatest sounding drum part ever."
"__MUSIC__ Totally! Jimmy Paige is incredible too."
"__MUSIC__ One of my favorites of all time, for sure.  But you know what?-"
"__MUSIC__ -I think I know what you're gonna say. Robert plant is annoying."
"__MUSIC__ Well kind of... I wouldn't say he's annoying. But  I just think the instrumentalists in the band are better than him."
"__MUSIC__ Right. I agree. If he was in a band that didn't have the craziest musicians ever, he would stand out as an amazing vocalist."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, they probably wouldn't be as good without him."
"__MUSIC__ Probably not. But honestly, Robert Plant's voice is the only reason I can't listen to too much Led Zeppelin in a row."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I'm the same way. But dude, keep listening to classic rock radio, it's usually one of the best stations available."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was hit after hit. I'm gonna start listening to it more often."
"__MUSIC__ Nice, I'll keep listening to it all the time because at 27 years old, I'm already an old man."
