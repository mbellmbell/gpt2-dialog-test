"__MUSIC__ So what do you think of Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh, I haven't really listened to anything by them for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? That's a shame, they did a new album recently."
"__MUSIC__ Whats the album called? I guess I'll give it a try."
"__MUSIC__ Hardwired to self destruct."
"__MUSIC__ I'll look it up now and give some of the songs a try."
"__MUSIC__ So what do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't really listened to it all yet but I'm not really a fan of the opening song at least."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah Confusion is a bit out of place to be honest, Try Dream no more."
"__MUSIC__ Ah well if its just Confusion thats like this I suppose I'll try some of the other songs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh fair warning, Dream no more has a bit of a Cthulhu theme going."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah so I've found. I really like it though, really consistent song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I suppose thats true. You listening to anything else new recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh yeah actually, I recently found Motörhead and I'm mostly stuck on the Inferno album."
"__MUSIC__ Ah so you basically found God then, nice."
"__MUSIC__ Is that really how some of the fans view Lemmy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah actually. No jokes there. So you got a favourite song in Inferno I should take a look at, or is the entire album worth a look?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess the entire album is worth a look, though maybe try Terminal show first. If you look it up its the first song in the album so no worries about finding it in a playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Inferno is a really great album actually, don't listen to it enough."
"__MUSIC__ Can you really ever listen to Motörhead enough?"
