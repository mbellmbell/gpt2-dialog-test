"__MUSIC__ So did you hear about Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ What, is she releasing a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but it's almost as exciting as that!"
"__MUSIC__ Don't keep me in the dark, what happened?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she has officially put her music back on spotify!"
"__MUSIC__ No kidding? I thought she had some kind of beef with the music companies."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she'd said before that it was ripping off artists and you didn't make enough money from it."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, why'd she change her mind?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I haven't heard."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'll take the music anyway. Is she on Google Play too?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she was always with them, something to do with YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, good to know. I'll look forward to listening to some of her old songs!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too, especially since I never owned a couple of them and so there will be songs I've never heard."
"__MUSIC__ So it kinda is like her releasing a new album, at least in your case."
"__MUSIC__ Yep! I can't wait to get some classic Tay back in my life."
"__MUSIC__ You prefer her older music best?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean don't get me wrong, 1989 is great. But something about Tim McGraw will always be special."
"__MUSIC__ It's probably just 'cause you grew up with it."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I guess, but I love that country twang."
"__MUSIC__ I'll pull it up now for you, in that case!"
