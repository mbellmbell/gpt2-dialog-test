"__MUSIC__ Not to be a downer but I really hate classical music."
"__MUSIC__ What makes you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's boring. It's doctor's office music."
"__MUSIC__ Doctor's office music? What does that even mean?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the music you put on in a waiting room to keep people calm."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, well yes people do use it for that but it's definitely not boring!"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard a lot of it. I think I can safely say 'Bored!'"
"__MUSIC__ You've heard it, but have you really listened?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, yeah. What was I going to do, plug my ears?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I mean have you listened to it and actually paid attention to what's happening?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, take this for example. Everyone's heard Moonlight Sonata right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah... I've probably heard it a million times."
"__MUSIC__ Great, then it's a good example. It starts out all quiet and soft and kind of repetitive, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. That 'dun da da' thing keeps happening over and over."
"__MUSIC__ But if you listen, underneath it keeps changing. That little bit of melody is floating on top of something that's always moving and shifting around."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, but it's still not exciting. Floating isn't exciting."
"__MUSIC__ Right, but if you keep listening it gets bigger. There's tension building, and all of a sudden instead of floating you have these surges of energy and sound!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, when it gets all low and poundy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! And then it relaxes for a second and then pounds again. Tension and release, over and over. That's not boring!"
