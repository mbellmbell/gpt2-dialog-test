"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, who was your favorite Star Wars Alien?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Chewbacca, obivously!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh, I kind of liked Greedo a little."
"__STAR_WARS__ What, why. The guy was a loser."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but he did have the guts to talk tough to Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, right until Han blasted him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that whole edit of having Greedo shoot first was just dumb."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Han's a bit of rogue and Greedo was a slimebag, so why not shoot first?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus, the whole last minute shift by Solo looks lousy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but it's not like they could really reshoot the scene with him dodging the shot, now could they?"
