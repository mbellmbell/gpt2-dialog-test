"__POP__ I hate pop music. Its thin, it's simple, it's flavorless."
"__POP__ It's supposed to be like that. The Beatles started out making pop. So did Madonna."
"__POP__ Yeah, they made it to be accessible. So nobody would be offended, and usually everybody would dance."
"__POP__ Or sing along, in their car, in the shower, wherever. What's wrong with that?"
"__POP__ It's built out of lightweight ideas that anyone can grasp, that are not specific to anyone's life or ideas. It's generic."
"__POP__ It's not generic, it's universal. It brings people together, the way songs of praise do in a house of worship."
"__POP__ And it's made to be shocking, in a manipulative way, with sex or swearing or violence. Without provoking real thought or feeling."
"__POP__ I disagree. Love songs hit us where we live, and so many pop tunes deal with breaking away, becoming ourselves."
"__POP__ Becoming ourselves crowded in one of those giant stadiums, where the spectacle dazzles us, but nothing really happens."
"__POP__ A lot happens to me, I'll tell you. I love pop."
