"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey Pete, what do you think of the Philadelphia Eagles this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles?  Oh man, I hope they tank."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, me too.  They are my least favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine too.  Why do you dislike them so much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mainly because they are in the same division as the Cowboys, who are my favorite team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats a good reason, I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and they are really just very unlikeable.  They seem dirty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dirty as in unclean??"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No dirty, as in I think they don't necessarily follow the rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, ok.  I don't like them because I don't like the color green."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, that's not a good reason not to like a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure it is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, then who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um, I like the New York Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The New York Giants?? Why on Earth do you like the Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like them because they wear blue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow, you can't be serious!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am serious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you don't like the Eagles because they wear green and you like the Giants because you like blue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly!"
