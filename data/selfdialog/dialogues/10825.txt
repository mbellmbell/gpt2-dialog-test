"__FASHION__ Here we are at the lake again, with our leggings on."
"__FASHION__ It's a beautiful day for a run."
"__FASHION__ Yeah but I'm insecure. All the skinny young things with their ponytails bouncing, and nothing else."
"__FASHION__ Oh, nobody sees us. Let's go."
"__FASHION__ No? I feel conspicuous, running aat my age."
"__FASHION__ You're not though. Just remember the rule of 40."
"__FASHION__ What rule? Ah, I can haradly speak."
"__FASHION__ Let's slow down a little. The rule of 40 says women over 40 are invisible on the street."
"__FASHION__ Oh... See what you mean."
"__FASHION__ Right. Nobody even sees us."
"__FASHION__ You think?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah. So don't worry, run your heart out."
"__FASHION__ I--I am."
"__FASHION__ The leggings help so much, too. They compress, so they feel good and look good."
"__FASHION__ Prints conceal too. I hope."
"__FASHION__ Nobody cares. I promise."
"__FASHION__ I know, but..."
"__FASHION__ Who cares. Just run."
"__FASHION__ Done. Thank God."
"__FASHION__ Yeah! Good tights, good run."
