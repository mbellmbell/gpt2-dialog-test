"__MUSIC__ I was just thinking today, what songs do you think have lyrics that really speak to your life and experiences."
"__MUSIC__ Good question. I've thought about this a few times before."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Today wasn't the first time I've thought about it."
"__MUSIC__ Three songs come to mind: Smile Empty Soul - Silhouettes, Staind - So Far Away, and Filter - Take a Picture."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting three songs. Why does Take a Picture pertain to your life?"
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics sometimes really speak to how I feel about regret and not really living in the moment of good times in my younger years."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. Could you elaborate more on that?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. The lyrics state, could you wanna take my picture, because I won't remember. I believe that slowing down and really enjoying life back then would have helped me enjoy my life more. I think that taking a picture is metaphorically referring to slowing down and being in the moment."
"__MUSIC__ That is interesting. I could see where those lyrics could speak to that experience."
"__MUSIC__ I also sometimes regret that I didn't really live in the moment and really take advantage of all I had to be thankful for back in those times."
"__MUSIC__ I think we all have regrets. Now, I have to ask, what about the Smile Empty Soul song?"
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics seem to fit the case of my life and the experiences I've had throughout my entire life."
"__MUSIC__ How so? Please tell me more."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the lyrics say, I don't want to live like my father and give up before I die."
"__MUSIC__ How does that pertain to your life?"
"__MUSIC__ My father was in an accident and it affected him so much that he ended up committing suicide."
"__MUSIC__ Do you feel like you are going down the same path?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel that my life is really stressful and that I don't want to give up when things are so difficult. No, I don't think I'm going fully down that path, but I feel that I must stay strong in spite of all the hardships and never give up."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting stuff. Sounds like you really listen to the lyrics of songs and they have profound effects on your life."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. Sometimes I feel that some songs are speaking to me, lyrically."
