"__STAR_WARS__ Did you watch Rogue one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes i watched Rogue one. the movie was awesome. The whole series seems so much better that they are making filler movies such as rogue one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes i have to agree, now we know the whole story of how the rebels got the coordinates for the death star."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah not bad and Felicty Jones did a great job with her role as Jyn Esro."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to disagree i think the best acting in rogue one was by Diego Luna who played the role of Captain Cassian. He was the real rebel he was bad ass in my opinion."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but i still like Felicity Jones but i know what you mean by when Diego Luna did a good job. Especially when he killed of his own informant to get out of trouble, thats a real rebel move."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha I guess, what do you think of the new Star movies movie that is coming out this December."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am definetly excited but i do not like the name."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really you dont like the name The Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah i feel like they are changing up the story too much. I also didnt like the fact that they killed off Han Solo in Force Awakens."
