"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think of The Prisoner of Azkaban?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought it was pretty cool to start putting things like werewolves in there."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, too bad for that Professor Lupin though.  He was awesome."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, very powerful and pretty good with the kids as well.  He would have taught them well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I didn't expect Scabbers to be Peter Petigrew the whole time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, how fitting he was a rat."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Also that Serious Black was a good guy.  They put some good plot twist in there."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree, he's a good character too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ One of the best ones.  And best friends with Harry's father."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, him, Lupin, and that rat Peter.  I hate him."
