"__ACTION__ Did you ever see The Accountant?"
"__ACTION__ Wasn't that the movie that came out with Ben Affleck?"
"__ACTION__ Yep.  I saw it on a plane the other day."
"__ACTION__ What's the verdict?"
"__ACTION__ Pretty forgettable.  He's not a very likeable hero and the action scenes were bland."
"__ACTION__ It kind of bombed at the box office if I remember correctly."
"__ACTION__ Ben Affleck is just not an action star."
"__ACTION__ I think he's a better director than actor personally."
"__ACTION__ Agreed.  He needs to stay out of the camera lens as his true talent lies elsewhere."
"__ACTION__ Hopefully his next movie will be better."
