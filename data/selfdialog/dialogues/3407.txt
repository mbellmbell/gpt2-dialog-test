"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite classical music composer?"
"__MUSIC__ I've never really thought that much about it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, are there any classical compositions that you especially like?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm... I like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. And Fur Elise."
"__MUSIC__ Those are both great songs."
"__MUSIC__ So maybe Beethoven is my favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Not a bad pick. I am more partial to Bach."
"__MUSIC__ He's the one that wrote Toccata and Fugue?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that was Bach."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that was a pretty good song too."
"__MUSIC__ What I like about Bach was how mathematical his music is."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ He wrote music in a way that had mathematical precision in the foundation. His songs were structured almost like equations."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa! That's not a concept I've ever heard of."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's very interesting. Most people think about music as free-form expression, but Bach's compositions were anything but."
"__MUSIC__ I don't appreciate music on that deep a level. I just like a good tune."
"__MUSIC__ I think Bach's songs work on that surface level too. Like you said, Toccata and Fugue is pleasant to listen to without knowing the deep stuff."
"__MUSIC__ True. I'll still stick with Beethoven, though."
"__MUSIC__ Nothing wrong with that. Both guys would be on the Mt. Rushmore of classical music."
"__MUSIC__ Along with Mozart!"
