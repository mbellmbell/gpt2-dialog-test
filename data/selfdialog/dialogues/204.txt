"__MUSIC__ I just got a new album for a band I really like called Chevelle."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them and I think I have one of their albums."
"__MUSIC__ I just got their new one titled The North Corridor."
"__MUSIC__ I don't have that one, is it any good."
"__MUSIC__ It's alright, but mostly the album prompted me to look up their old material."
"__MUSIC__ I think the album I have is This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)."
"__MUSIC__ I have that one as well, but I'm really enjoying their first album Point #1."
"__MUSIC__ I don't have that one."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's their best material that I've heard."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you like it so much?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it has a less refined sound and a more simplistic approach.  I can see why someone would offer them a record deal."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by simplistic approach."
"__MUSIC__ I mean that the songs tend to follow the same rhythm with varying intensity and there aren't a lot of guitar solos."
"__MUSIC__ That's nice, it really annoys me when a song is filled with three minutes of random guitar shredding."
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, that's turned me off on a lot of music, but this Chevelle album is totally not like that."
"__MUSIC__ I might have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ If you do, be sure to listen to the song Blank Earth."
"__MUSIC__ You think I'll like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably.  But it's actually just a great example of what you can expect from the album."
"__MUSIC__ I'll be sure to remember that."
