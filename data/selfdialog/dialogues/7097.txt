"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are you interested in ice hockey?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, I hate sports"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, it's fun to watch hockey because there are usually fights"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I suppose so, if you like that sort of thing"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, it's a way to relax for me"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, OK.  I just don't care for violent sports I guess."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's better for men to take out aggressive impulses by watching sports than through war"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I suppose"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It is a theory of redirectd aggression"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, maybe.  But what if it makes you more likely to be violent by rewarding the enjoyment of violence?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hadn't thought of that, but I enjoy ice hockey, it's fast paced and fun"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, I'm not saying you shouldn't, just that it's not my thing"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You should watch a game with me sometime, you might change your mind"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I doubt I would, but if there's a pizza involved I'd be up for it!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'll see what I can do, what about next Friday"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I will have to check my calendar and get back to you"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hope you give it a try, I can explain the rules as we are watching"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ OK, well, if I can make it I will"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sounds good, hope to see you then!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Bye"
