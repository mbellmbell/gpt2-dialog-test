"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What did you think about Fast 8?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought it was okay, a little over the top if you ask me. I thought Fast 8 was better."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why do you say that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, the part where all the cars were dropping from the above parking garage and the auto driving cars causing havoc in the city, that was a little too cheesy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, I guess I agree a bit but that's how these movies usually are.  The storyline wasn't as good either."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Also, the part where they had 5 cars latched onto Dom's car trying to take it apart yet it remained steady.  A bit unbelievable."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I like how they worked Jason Statham into the story and he eventually became a good guy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea probably.  I think they're going to have a story where Jason Statham is part of the team in Fast 9"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You think there will be a Fast 9?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, the movie franchise is on a roll right now."
