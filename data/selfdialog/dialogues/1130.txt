"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Megadeth's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I didn't know they released one this year."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's called Dystopia. I saw them on the Grammy's last night."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. Did they win?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but get this. They played Master of Puppets as they accepted the award!"
"__MUSIC__ No way. They played a Metallica song for a Megadeth win."
"__MUSIC__ And Dave said it was the worst version of Master of Puppets he's ever heard. Ha Ha. It's true!"
"__MUSIC__ Poor Dave Mustaine. First he gets kicked off Metallica then they play a Metallica song at his Grammy night."
"__MUSIC__ Megadeth's album is very good. Lots of guitar and double bass. Poisonous Shadows is my favorite song."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't they hire a new guitarist."
"__MUSIC__ Kiko Loureiro. He replaced Chris Broderick when he quit."
"__MUSIC__ That's right. Still, my favorite Megadeth guitarist has to be Marty Friedman."
"__MUSIC__ I'm with you there. Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia are my favorite Megadeth albums."
"__MUSIC__ I have to give props to Chirs. Have you seen his Betcha Can't PLay This on Youtube?"
"__MUSIC__ No?"
"__MUSIC__ He plays these figures on the guitar like it was a piano. He was tapping on the strings super fast."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean like a piano?"
"__MUSIC__ Instead of having his fingers go under the neck, he moves up and down and over the neck. He taps each string like it was a piano."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I kind of get what you saying. Chris is a talented guitar player."
"__MUSIC__ Definately. But I still like Marty Friedman more."
