"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hell yea! I can't wait Falcons all the way this year baby."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really think they will make the Super Bowl again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do Matt Ryan was on fire last year no one will stop him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know Tom Brady and the Patriots I think might repeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way man Brady is getting old and Matt Ryan is still young and has alot of years in front of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks and Packers are tough too. I like Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rodgers isn't too bad. Cam Newton is good but he needs more weapons. Panthers has a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Panthers I agree unless the Saints come around. Drew Brees hasn't been himself lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Brees needs to retire. The problem with quaterbacks is they don't know when to call it quits."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean like Brett Favre. He kept playing and playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly he never knew when to quit. Speaking of the Falcons did you hear they are retiring Michael Vick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did regardless of his criminal record he was still a hell of an athelete. I still think he would have made a better running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I agree once he starts running no one could stop him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it could be the Patriots and the Falcons again in the Super Bowl this year. Imagine that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Never happened before in the history of the NFL I don't think two teams repeating. One team yes but not two teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the Falcons getting the new stadium this year that would be great too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see what happens if Oakland's quarterback doesn't get hurt at the end of the season they might go further this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes that was horrible for them. That rookie was amazing too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This season will be great to see what these second year quarterbacks can do."
