"__BEATLES__ Hey Jerry, I bet you will never guess what my first words were."
"__BEATLES__ You mean the very first thing you learned to say when you were a child?"
"__BEATLES__ That's right. My first words."
"__BEATLES__ Probably something like, 'More pizza please!'"
"__BEATLES__ No. really! What do you think were my first words?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know. Maybe you said, 'Do they have these baby booties in plaid?''"
"__BEATLES__ Stop goofing around! Make a serious guess."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll guess"
"__BEATLES__ That's right! I sang the lyrics from the Beatles song, 'She Loves You.'"
"__BEATLES__ She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah!"
