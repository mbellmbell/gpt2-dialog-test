"__HORROR__ I watched the movie 'Devil's Rejects' last night."
"__HORROR__ Oh, I have seen that, Rob Zombie at his best, I've watched it three times."
"__HORROR__ Yes, what a crazy show that was, I loved it!  My favorite character is Captain Spaulding."
"__HORROR__ He's great, isn't he?  Come and get my FRIED CHICKEN!"
"__HORROR__ Did you notice that the actor from the Hills Have Eyes has a small role in the film?"
"__HORROR__ Yep, that's Micheal Berryman, and boy is he ugly, but what a perfect mug for a horror movie!"
"__HORROR__ I thought the use of 'Freebird' at the end of the movie when they are in the car was perfect."
"__HORROR__ Yes, Zombie always uses songs well, the Allman Bros. song at the beginning of the show was so cool."
"__HORROR__ I'm going to have to watch this movie again,  I have a feeling there are plenty of things I missed!"
"__HORROR__ Yes, play close attention and oh yeah, next time you get ice cream, make sure its Tutti effing Frutti!"
