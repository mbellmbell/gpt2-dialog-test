"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Aaron Rodgers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Aaron Rodgers. He's one of the best quarterbacks in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he's better than Drew Brees?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, a lot better. Aaron Rodgers can do just about anything. I wish we had him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's only been to one Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He doesn't get there or NOT get there on his own. They've had so many injuries these past couple of years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone has injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year they had so many people out, they were using their 3rd and 4th string players in some positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't know that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's infinitely better than Brett Favre ever was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wasn't a Favre fan. I'm not a Green Bay fan either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are teams I like and others I don't for various reasons. I like Green Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I used to like the Saints until that whole deal with the bounties. Turned me off knowing Brees and the coaches went along with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They said they didn't know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They knew. Even the players who admitted it said Brees and everyone else knew. Heck, the coach instituted the bounty and on film."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was sickening. They had a bounty on Peyton Manning but didn't get him hurt. They got to everyone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds illegal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it should be punishable by law. At least Coach Williams got fired and suspended and Head Coach Payton got a one-year suspension."
