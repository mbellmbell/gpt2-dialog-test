"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think The Dark Knight is as good of a movie as people remember it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Sort of. I loved it at the time and still love it but can't watch it that much."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why not?"
"__SUPERHERO__ The score is too pulsating and overall it's just yelling and fighting. Gives me a headache in my old age."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think that's it great, but people remember it as being better because of Heath."
"__SUPERHERO__ You think that if he didn't die, it wouldn't be as well-regarded."
"__SUPERHERO__ Sadly, yes."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's kind of cruel."
"__SUPERHERO__ It's true, though. It has this aura over it because it's the role the 'killed' him."
"__SUPERHERO__ Either way, far better than The Dark Knight Rises."
