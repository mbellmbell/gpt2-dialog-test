"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the penalties the refs call?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the refs do the best they can but they inevitably get some wrong"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to agree with you on that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sometimes the referees determine the entire outcome of the game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is the worst thing in my opinion"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they call penalties a little too much"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, they should lay off the whistle a little bit"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are trying to make the game safer though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like it really isn't working all the well though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, a lot of big name players still get hurt from illegal plays every year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel bad for those players"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Luckily though, some get to rest with their millions of dollars"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It still doesn't make it fair though because they are losing money"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is true, I wonder if they recieve workman's compensation"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably get free medical care from their team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They certainly do"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate it when coaches lie about player injuries so that they can play"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's selfish and irresponsible"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope the league moves toward a more technology based method of detecting penatlies"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And I hope those changes reduce the amount of injuries in the league."
