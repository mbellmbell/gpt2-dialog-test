"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, are you getting excited for the new season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, kinda. I'm not too sure about how the Seahawks are going to do though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, are the Seahawks your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I always watched them growing up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, why are you worried about how they're going to do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their draft class looks kind of weak, and Russel Wilson isn't getting any younger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he really got banged up last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. He's the most mobile quarterback in the league so of course they turned him into a pocket passer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why did they do that? He was in good shape before he got hurt, wasn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was doing great in the preseason, but for some reason they decided he'd stand behind his awful line and wait to get tackled."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, don't even bring up the Seattle offensive line. They were just awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, what do you expect, the lowest paid line in the league, for a good reason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, did they at least draft anybody to shore up the line for next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ethan Pocic is supposed to be a good offensive lineman, but I don't know, I don't watch college ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I read an interview where the Seahawks were really eager to get Pocic, maybe he's good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so, otherwise it's going to be sack city again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't have to be, if they just let Russel Wilson move with the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's definitely still the most mobile QB in the league, but he's too short to just stand in the pocket."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I hope they do well, I always liked the Seahawks too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. Maybe we should see if we can get some tickets and see a home game?"
