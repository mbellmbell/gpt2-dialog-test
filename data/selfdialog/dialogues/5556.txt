"__STAR_WARS__ Who is the best fighter in all of the Star Wars galaxy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda of course!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Would he beat Vader in a fight?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd love to see that! I dont know who would win"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think yoda would win, but after a long right"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Vader is stronger but Yoda is more agile"
"__STAR_WARS__ True, Vader would be better at first but then get tired"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that's why Yoda can only win in a long battle"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish I could see a fight like that!"
