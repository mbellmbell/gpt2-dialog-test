"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, how you doing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good to see you! I'm fine. What's new with you lately?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I saw a really interesting movie last night."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What was it called?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Interstellar. It's the latest Christopher Nolan movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I heard that was good, but that it had some absurd science in it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I really liked it. But yeah, there were some major implausibilities in it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Worst was the 'going into a black hole and surviving' thing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ugh. I had that. But was it worth it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think so. I mean, there's are symbolic ways to interpret the absurd science in this case."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like, love was seen as a fundamental force in the universe, like gravity. Scientifically absurd, but beautiful on a symbolic level, and emotionally resonant."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I guess. I have a hard time with movies that have implausibility. Wasn't Matt Damon in that movie? He's one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, Damon played a minor character. A real jerk, did not behave very well to say the least!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How were the female characters in the movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There were some strong, smart women in the movie. Well, mostly the main character's daughter. But she was really good."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I wish there were more good female characters in movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Agreed. Pretty rare for a movie to have multiple richly-drawn female characters these days."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Especially science fiction movies!"
