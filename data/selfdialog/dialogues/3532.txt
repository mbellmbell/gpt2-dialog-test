"__MUSIC__ I'm falling in love with this new Mika album."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard anything from him in a while."
"__MUSIC__ He's been very subtle as of late. The new album is great."
"__MUSIC__ Is it true he worked with Madonna?"
"__MUSIC__ They worked together, but on her album MDNA."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't buy MDNA. Was it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ It was okay, but not really up to Madonna's standards."
"__MUSIC__ I did buy her new one, Rebel Heart."
"__MUSIC__ Rebel Heart is a much better album with lots of good material."
"__MUSIC__ Well she worked with the right people, I think."
"__MUSIC__ I think she worked with Kanye."
"__MUSIC__ She worked with Kanye and Aviici and Natalia Kills I think."
"__MUSIC__ Who would have that Kanye could do such a good job producing?"
"__MUSIC__ Well have you heard My Dark Twisted Fantasy?"
"__MUSIC__ I've only heard that Monster single with Nicki Minaj and Jay-Z and Bon Iver on it."
"__MUSIC__ He did an amazing job on that record. He's a good producer."
"__MUSIC__ I believed it once I heard Madonna's record."
"__MUSIC__ I hope she releases another album soon."
"__MUSIC__ I think she needs to take a break for a while and come back with something slower and more serious."
"__MUSIC__ That would be heavenly."
