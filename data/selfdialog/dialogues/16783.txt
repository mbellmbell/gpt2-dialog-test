"__MOVIES__ Well, I tried looking for that weird movie I saw as a kid, around 1970. No luck."
"__MOVIES__ The one about 'Don Quixote', with a comedy bit at the beginning?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's 'Sanco Panza' who was Don Quixote's sidekick, not ' PANCHO', like I said."
"__MOVIES__ You were probably thinking of the 'The Cisco Kid' TV show, with Pancho."
"__MOVIES__ This sidekick gets thrown out of a Cadillac at the beginning of the movie, gets a big laugh."
"__MOVIES__ And there's a train wreck at the end of the movie, you told me."
"__MOVIES__ And I don't know the name of the movie. No one does."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, hey, I saw that 'Eraserhead' movie you mentioned."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it? It's a black and white Surrealist film from around 1980, I think."
"__MOVIES__ David Lynch, 1977. Reminded me of my old neighborhood in Los Angeles 1968 to 1972."
"__MOVIES__ The opening sequence was mind-warping and stomach-turning, but I guess it was a Creation Myth."
"__MOVIES__ The whole movie is mind-warping, full of dark comedy and seems to be an alternative world, I suppose."
"__MOVIES__ A chicken on a plate, that gets up an dances around after it's been stabbed by a fork..."
"__MOVIES__ A miniature, rubber-faced woman singing a song in a spotlight on top of a cigar box ..."
"__MOVIES__ I had a fever once of 105, Easter 1970, and saw something very, very similar, oddly."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't want to see the end of the movie. I turned it off. Didn't want to see the 'baby'."
"__MOVIES__ I don't blame you. You know how much I hate movies like 'Beetle Juice'."
"__MOVIES__ You said that was the worst movie ever made, and that you turned it off after the first ten minutes!"
"__MOVIES__ I did. But I always like Surrealism, at least I did when I was 16."
"__MOVIES__ And the characters in 'Eraserhead' reminded you of the old neighborhood. You're very sentimental like that."
