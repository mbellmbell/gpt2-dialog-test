"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Steven King movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh gosh, that's a really tough decision.  I liked all of them."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, but you have to have had a favorite!"
"__MOVIES__ Probably the Shining.  That movie really scared me."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that movie was terrifying!  Jack Nicholson was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ I know, and just that creepy hotel.  It was so well done."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, That came out back in 1980 didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it's been awhile.  I think his best movies came out in that time period."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah most definitely.  I thought Pet Semetary was great too."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I didn't like that one as much."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ It didn't really scare me, but I thought Carrie was scary."
"__MOVIES__ See I'm the opposite.  I didn't think Carrie was scary but Pet Semetary spooked me out."
"__MOVIES__ Carrie was just downright creepy!  The scene with the blood and all that gave me shivers."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was kinda silly."
"__MOVIES__ Well there was definitely nothing silly about the Shining."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no.  I couldn't sleep for weeks after seeing that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Especially the scene with the elevator and the little girls."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that one still kinda haunts me."
"__MOVIES__ I always feel weird in hotels."
