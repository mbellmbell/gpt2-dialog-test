"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are there any other countries that are interested in Football like we are in the USA?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really think there are. Everyone else seems to like soccer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. It must be an American thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so. Do you like football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. I'm not the biggest fan in the world, but I like to watch sometimes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 49ers. I grew up in San Francisco, so I watched them a lot as a kid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny, I grew up near there too, but I always liked the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's probably cooler to be a Raiders fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. It just gives off that image to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. Well that makes me happy I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think they stand a chance at winning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now that we have Marshawn Lynch, I think it's possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm. Well, I guess it'll be an exciting season then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that I'll be following it closely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to have any watch parties or anything?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking about it. Maybe for the first game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should! I'd come."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great, then I will then!"
