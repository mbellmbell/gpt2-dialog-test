"__MUSIC__ Do you like 21 Pilots?"
"__MUSIC__ They are okay, but I don't listen to them on my own will"
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ They have catchy songs but I don't care for the lyrics"
"__MUSIC__ What about the lyrics don't you like?"
"__MUSIC__ They seem to be too cool for school or they complain about adult life?"
"__MUSIC__ When did they complain about adult life?"
"__MUSIC__ In the song stressed out they said people make them wake up early and go earn money"
"__MUSIC__ Well they are rich as heck now, they don't need to worry about that I guess"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have had enough hits to be rich for a long time!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they are one hit wonders?"
"__MUSIC__ It is tough to say but i don't think they are"
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ They have a very unique style that nobody has been able to copy"
"__MUSIC__ How would you describe that style?"
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty dark but happy too. Their song Heathens was so cool"
"__MUSIC__ I dont think I know that song"
"__MUSIC__ It goes 'All my friends are Heathens take it slow...'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh now I know that song! I liked it a lot before it was popular!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah then it was on the radio way too much!"
