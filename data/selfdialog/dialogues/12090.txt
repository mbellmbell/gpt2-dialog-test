"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you like them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like that they are a small market team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is pretty cool.  There are no other professional sports in Green Bay, Wisconsin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I like that they are publicly owned too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are also the only publicly owned team in the Big 4 sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the city of Green Bay owns them.  It is pretty cool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So there is no threat of the team moving to another town."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  Hahaha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A couple of years ago, the owner of the San Diego Chargers tried to sell the team to the city, but the NFL wouldn't let him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  They can't have cities owning the teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the cities owned the teams, the teams couldn't threaten to leave."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder where NFL will threaten to take teams now that Los Angeles has teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would bet London."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ St. Louis would be a good bet too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the NFL wants a team in London."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would give it a global reach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure would.  The schedule would be a nightmare for a London team though."
