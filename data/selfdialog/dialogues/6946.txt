"__STAR_WARS__ How many Star Wars movies do you think they will end up making?"
"__STAR_WARS__ As many as can be profitable."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's kind of cynical, don't you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm just sick of seeing another movie franchise being sold to the highest bidder, and then being squeezed for every penny it's worth."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think it's as bad as all that, because I can see some creativity in these new movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess they are still entertaining, and it will be nice to see what another director can do with the characters and world of Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, J.J. Abrams is a competent science-fiction guy, so I put my trust into him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, but I think that some of his stuff like Lost didn't finish well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I'm on board for these movies just to see how Luke Skywalker figures into the new plot."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll admit, it was very cool seeing Mark Hamill play that role again."
