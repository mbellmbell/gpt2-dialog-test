"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch 'Kill Bill'?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, GOD that was gross."
"__MOVIES__ What do you expect from Quentin Tarantino, the guy is weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but his movies are awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Remember that one school girl who was kicking tail until she got totally bashed in the head?"
"__MOVIES__ Gogo Yubari!"
"__MOVIES__ Her entrance made me laugh so much."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, innocent little Japanese school girl with a ball and chain ready to kill."
"__MOVIES__ That scene was unbelievable!"
"__MOVIES__ When that ball went through the table and Black Mamba had to lean back to avoid it...I loved that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it was pretty bad acting which kind of ruined it."
"__MOVIES__ Until Black Mamba was being choked, that looked real."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's true, her face was all red and her eyes were bugging out."
"__MOVIES__ Then the nail board to the head and the innocent school girl was out."
"__MOVIES__ It was funny but sick at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, definitely leaves you feeling weird, like your body doesn't know if it should laugh or recoil in disgust."
"__MOVIES__ And then it gets worse!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's when Lucy Liu comes on scene."
"__MOVIES__ When the music kicks in, you know it's about to get good."
"__MOVIES__ I need to rent that movie again."
