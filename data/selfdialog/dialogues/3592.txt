"__MUSIC__ Hey man!  I'm trying to find some new music to work out to, any suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ Well what kind of music are you looking for?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I think I'm trying to change it up a little bit."
"__MUSIC__ You've gotta help me out a little bit haha, What do you listen to now?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to stuff like Staind and Disturbed."
"__MUSIC__ No wonder you want a change, that stuff is garbage."
"__MUSIC__ I guess, I kind of like it though."
"__MUSIC__ Well, when I go I listen to a lot of rap and metal.  It really gets me pumped up."
"__MUSIC__ I'm open to suggestions. What bands should I put on a playlist?"
"__MUSIC__ For rap, I would add some Kendrick, some Future, some Dram, and maybe some old school stuff like Nas."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I've only heard of Kendrick and Nas, do the other 2 sound like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, but it'll be good to change it up, I'm sure you've heard Future before, he does the song that goes 'Molly, Percocet.'"
"__MUSIC__ Alright, yeah I've heard that one before it's pretty catchy.  I don't know if it would get me pumped in the gym though."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know man, it works for me."
"__MUSIC__ What about some of the metal you were talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, it really gets me hyped up.  Have you heard Norma Jean or Bury your dead?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but they have cool names."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, check them out, if they don't get you pumped up, I don't know what will."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I put a bunch of their songs on a playlist for the gym tonight."
"__MUSIC__ Let me know what you think man!"
