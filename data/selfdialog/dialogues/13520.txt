"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the 49ers this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a tough question.     Division-wise, not much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they came in last place in the NFC West last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand that, but didn't they improve?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch know what they are doing, yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how will that knowledge show up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they will win more than two games!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your prediction on wins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is early, but 8 wins (a 0.500 season) would be a challenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where would that leave them in the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still last, probably."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team do you expect to win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Seattle is a lock."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the rest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cardinals and Rams may keep San Francisco in the picture."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's difficult to hear."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually its a good thing, as the 49ers are improving quickly and may have a shot in a couple of years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that is reason for optimism."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but there are always the Patriots as most likely AFC opponent."
