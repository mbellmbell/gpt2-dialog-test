"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, what did you think of Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Weeel... I don't know.  It was okay, I guess.  I mean, it was good to see Star Wars again, but I really they retread the plot of the first film too much."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  You need to ask?  Well, let's start at the beginning..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay."
"__STAR_WARS__ We got a young protagonist on a desert planet (again), and she find a droid that has secret plans the bad guys want."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it does sound kind of familiar."
"__STAR_WARS__ She finds out she has talents she doesn't know about and goes to get advice from a short alien."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, see what you mean.. we even have a big planet destroyer again."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly."
