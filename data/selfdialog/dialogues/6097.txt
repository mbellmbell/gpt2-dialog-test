"__STAR_WARS__ Did you ever see the re-releases of the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean the ones they put out in the theatres?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah."
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw the first one, but it didn't really seem worth my time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was kind of strange."
"__STAR_WARS__ The stuff they added was just weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. Guess they were just trying to make an extra buck."
"__STAR_WARS__ Leave it to the studios to make something worse."
"__STAR_WARS__ How about George Lucas?"
"__STAR_WARS__ True. Probably as much his fault."
