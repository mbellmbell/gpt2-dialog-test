"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, here's one thing that bugs me about the Harry Potter movies compared to the books..."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ There's several that happen in the films that, unless you've read the books, just do not make ANY sense."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's a good example?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix they all form this secret group called Dumbledore's Army and Hermione has the kids sign their names to a sheet of parchment.  Now, in the book she does this because she's put a curse on the paper."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ A curse?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, something, anyone who tells anybody about the club will burst out in painful sore and whatnot, which is exactly what happens.  but in the movie it makes NO sense for her to do this."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, right, it just gives the bad guys a convenient list of everyone's who's involved in the group."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly!  So there was no reason about all her for to do that. Plus, they changed who had told about the club (and why) so the whole thing is moot anyhow."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, they had it be Chang in the film and they had drugged her with that truth potion."
