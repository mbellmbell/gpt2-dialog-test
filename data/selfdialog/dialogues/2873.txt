"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Mariah Carey?"
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I just discovered her the other day."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?"
"__MUSIC__ What am I missing?"
"__MUSIC__ She's the top-selling female singer of all-time. She's worth half a billion dollars. She's been on the radio for over twenty years."
"__MUSIC__ Well, then I live under a rock."
"__MUSIC__ You sure do. Why do you bring her up?"
"__MUSIC__ She was on Carpool Karaoke and I was wondering if my opinion was correct, given your musical expertise."
"__MUSIC__ So what do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ Her voice is terrible. She didn't even try."
"__MUSIC__ Right, there's a reason why."
"__MUSIC__ What happened?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she had a great voice. She can even sing five octaves because of her vocal chords."
"__MUSIC__ That's insane."
"__MUSIC__ She blew out her voice in the 90s due to poor maintenance and not studying with an actual vocal coach."
"__MUSIC__ What about her not trying?"
"__MUSIC__ In that case: she's just a diva. She's obnoxious."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of got that--very entitled."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she IS worth more money than the entire state of West Virginia."
