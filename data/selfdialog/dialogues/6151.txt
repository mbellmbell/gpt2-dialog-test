"__STAR_WARS__ I was thinking about he STAR WARS Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ That thing must have been big."
"__STAR_WARS__ Remember when Luke and them first saw it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. They thought it was a planet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then I think someone said, 'That's no planet.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ That tractor beam pulled them right in."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was crazy how Luke and them went all over the ship without being found."
"__STAR_WARS__ They used those Storm Trooper outfits."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think that would work in reality."
"__STAR_WARS__ But it worked in the movie!"
