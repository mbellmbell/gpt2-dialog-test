"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think has the best receiving corps in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a tough one.  I think the New York Giants receivers are all really, really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they are better than the Patriots receivers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots have a more balanced team with the running game and the looks they can give defenses, but I think based off talent alone, the Giants receivers are better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots did add Brandin Crooks to Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but the Giants have Odell Beckham Jr., Sterling Shephard, and they added Brandon Marshall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marshall is an injury risk though, and sometimes does not do well with his teammates."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Team chemistry is a concern, but the talent is there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Giants stack up against the receivers of some of the other NFL teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Giants as the best in the NFL.  Other good teams with good receiving corps, to me, are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys, and the Atlanta Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now I really like the Falcons receivers, I think they can get back to the Super Bowl with those guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They certainly have a great chance to do that.  Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu, and Tyler Gabriel are great receivers.  Plus, they have Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be interesting to see the divisional games between the Falcons and the Bucs though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure.  The Buccaneers added DeSean Jackson to Mike Evans.  That move alone puts two big time play makers on the field on the outsides."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That combination resembles what the Steelers have in Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good comparison actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I feel like Jameis Winston compares nicely to Big Ben when Ben was younger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting comparison.  Winston has a cannon for an arm, and his ability to be just mobile enough is where they are similar.  Winston's accuracy is a big question mark in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Winston was just a rookie last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but accuracy is a must have trait in an NFL Quarterback."
