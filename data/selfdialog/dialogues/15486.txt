"__HARRY_POTTER__ You think butterbeer is actually beer?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course not.  They would never sell that to children."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Then why do they call it that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It is a catchy name."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That doesn't answer my question though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm pretty sure it talks about why it's called that in first or second movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's a shame they didn't let the kids go into town more than they did."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe they could have butterbeer in a can."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I doubt they'd let them take that into Hogwarts.  It would be illegal."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Everything Harry did at Hogwarts was illegal!"
