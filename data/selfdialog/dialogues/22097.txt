"__DISNEY__ You know what bugs me?"
"__DISNEY__ What's that?"
"__DISNEY__ Whenever you see Rapunzel, why does she have long hair again?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ So Flynn Rider cut her hair off in the movie, but it's always long in the cartoons again."
"__DISNEY__ Ah, I see.  Guess it's better marketing."
"__DISNEY__ But it totally breaks the canon of the series."
"__DISNEY__ Do you really think kids care about that stuff?"
"__DISNEY__ My five year old noticed it!"
"__DISNEY__ Mine was too busy dancing around to the music."
