"__MOVIES__ I think they need to change the marketing of this."
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ It Comes at Night."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say? I just saw the trailer and it looks good."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the movie and after seeing the new trailer released yesterday it's made me worried just how much people will be expecting something else going into this movie"
"__MOVIES__ That's disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ This movie is a great film and it has one of the most intense moments I've seen in a movie IMO but.."
"__MOVIES__ But what?"
"__MOVIES__ The movie is very artsy and all the super creepy scenes in the trailer are from dream sequences."
"__MOVIES__ What? Dream sequences?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. This movie is much more comparable to 'the Road' then any horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ Why do they do this? You lead people to believe it's one thing but...."
"__MOVIES__ But in actuality it's another?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ Because they want to sell tickets."
"__MOVIES__ That is only going to work once. When people realize this isn't what they thought it would be, they will tell their friends not to waste their money."
"__MOVIES__ It's a very well made movie filled with tension."
"__MOVIES__ That means nothing to me now."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm just warning you strictly because most you are probably gonna get a film that you weren't expecting."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know that they sat around a table & planned it out this way but I do feel a little burned as I was hoping for a creature flick.Thanks for warning me, though."
