"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which do you prefer? East coast hip hop or West Coast hip hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I live on the East coast so I want to say East coast, even though I'm not sure I know what the difference is."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There's a difference in terms of rapping style. It's always been a topic of discussion and feud over which is better."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Give me some examples of artists from each coast."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Some East coast rappers are Jay Z from Brooklyn, and Nas from Queens"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And on the west coast there's Snoop Dogg."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly! Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre. One of the biggest rivalries that best shows the East vs West feud was the rivalry between Tupac and Bigge"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Tupac was from the west and Biggie from the East right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's right."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's hard to choose sides when both coasts have such great talent!"
