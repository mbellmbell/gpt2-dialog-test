"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So are you going to go to Latrobe to watch training camp?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am, and I am excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is going good for the Steelers this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Martavis Bryant is back for one thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, that's great, I'm glad he got reinstated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, some of the rules in the NFL are pretty arbitrary and outdated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like they would work more with the guys that have problems instead of ostracizing them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but that's over for him. He is back in the black and gold and I think he is going to have a breakout year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be fantastic. Who else is back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Heyward for one, he's recovered from that chest tear and will be back to take over leadership on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard one of the Steelers say this week that your best ability is availability. So true isn't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could not agree more. Staying healthy is completely the name of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Ben will stay healthy this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh my goodness, I certainly hope so. I'm planning on watching him take this team to the super bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you are telling me there is a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely.  Martavis Bryant, Antonio Brown, Leveon Bell, Ben, all of those guys are top of the heap competitors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really just one team to beat then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't even mention their name."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K. I definitely will not say the name of the team that has Tom Brady as its quarterback and that is the team the Steelers must be able to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good.  I don't want to hear it.  And anyways, this is the year that the Steelers D learns how to shut them down. Hard."
