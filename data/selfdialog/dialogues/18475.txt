"__MOVIES__ That good huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Totally.  And the song, I can't get it out of my head."
"__MOVIES__ What's the song?"
"__MOVIES__ Everything is Awesome.  Really upbeat."
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha. Can you stand it?"
"__MOVIES__ Chris Pratt was the main character.  Kind of your average Joe."
"__MOVIES__ He can do that.  Did it in The Office."
"__MOVIES__ Elizabeth Banks was his love interest.  An action-girl all dressed in black."
"__MOVIES__ She liked him?"
"__MOVIES__ No not at first. Will Ferrell was the bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ Kinda hard to see that."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you had to be there.  Chased the Legos all over for Crazy Glue."
