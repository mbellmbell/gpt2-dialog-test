"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I remember that.  What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Tom Hanks' character is off for the week so he is hanging around the house.  He starts to notice his new neighbors are really weird."
"__MOVIES__ What is weird about them?"
"__MOVIES__ They just look weird, first of all.  And they never come out during the day."
"__MOVIES__ Some people just look weird.  That's no reason to hate!"
"__MOVIES__ No, they kind of looked inbred weird.  Then things start happening."
"__MOVIES__ Okay.  Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ I think a cat went missing and then a person."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so Tom Hanks thinks that they have something to do with it?"
