"__FASHION__ Where did you get your new hat?"
"__FASHION__ Do you like it?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, it's really cool. What store did you get it from?"
"__FASHION__ I got it down at the J Crew at the mall. There were some really cool belts there, too."
"__FASHION__ Really? What kind of belts did you see?"
"__FASHION__ There were a bunch! Black leather, brown leather, and a really cool white one."
"__FASHION__ What's up with the white one?"
"__FASHION__ It was a Jennifer Lopez belt, with white leather and silver trim."
"__FASHION__ Jennifer Lopez, huh? Did she have any other clothing there?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah. I saw quite a few of her pieces. She also had some capris."
"__FASHION__ Did you buy a pair of capris?"
"__FASHION__ No, but I was thinking about it. They were pretty pricey."
"__FASHION__ How much were they? Her stuff is always expensive."
"__FASHION__ They were eighty dollars each! That's too much."
"__FASHION__ How about tops? Did you see any?"
"__FASHION__ I saw a really cute red top with blue trim. Don't tell anyone, but I bought that one."
"__FASHION__ Nice! Does it have a design on it?"
"__FASHION__ Not really. It's just plain red with some blue trim around the collar. It's a boat neck."
"__FASHION__ I love boat necks, but I can't wear them anymore."
"__FASHION__ Yeah. I prefer crewnecks now."
