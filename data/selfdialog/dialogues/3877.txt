"__MUSIC__ Hey, what's your opinion on Kendrick Lamar?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man. I think Kendrick is the best rapper of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa. I like him but I don't know if I would go that far."
"__MUSIC__ I would. Everything he releases is just top tier. What's your favorite album by him?"
"__MUSIC__ Mine is 'To Pimp a Butterfly'. What's yours?"
"__MUSIC__ Mine is 'Damn'. It is so close though between yours, mine and then 'Good Kid, MAAD City' that it isn't even funny."
"__MUSIC__ True. My favorite probably chances every couple of months."
"__MUSIC__ That's my point! That's why he's the greatest!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll wait a couple more albums before I put him before Nas and Andre 3000k."
"__MUSIC__ Nas is whack man."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?! 'Illmatic' is the best album every made."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not going to argue that, I agree. 'Life's a bitch' is the pinnacle of hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ Finally we can agree on something! Now I'm going to ask you a question that will determine the fate of your relationship."
"__MUSIC__ What is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you know Devin the Dude?"
"__MUSIC__ I love Devin the Dude. I listened to him for about a year straight during my college years."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad you said that. Devin the Dude is your favorite rapper's favorite rapper."
"__MUSIC__ Did we just become best friends?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes we did. I want to go listen to the new Young Thug album."
"__MUSIC__ Sure. Meet you at your house in 30 minutes."
