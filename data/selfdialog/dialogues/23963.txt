"__SUPERHERO__ I'm really glad they held off on superhero movies until now."
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Could you imagine how awful the special effects would've looked back in the 80s?  As much as I love Superman from the 70s, but it looks cheesy in parts."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think it's really ahead of it's time.  I think it looks better than the cgi in the first X-Men."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, when Wolverine swing around on Lady Liberty's crown, he looks like he came straight from an Xbox."
"__SUPERHERO__ Hugh Jackman was an excellent Wolverine."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know!  Who do you think they'll get to replace him?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't know.  I'm sure whoever it is will be a disappointment."
"__SUPERHERO__ I wonder when they'll make another X-Men movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think it's Deadpool next-- you know that'll be hilarious."
