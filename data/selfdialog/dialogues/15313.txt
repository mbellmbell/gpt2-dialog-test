"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just watched Harry Potter, there are some things that do not add up about the first one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Like what?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, Harry's aunt and uncle were abusive. How did no one see this?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I do not think they let on to his living conditions to others."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right, but what about when Harry went to his muggle school, how did the teachers not notice his clothes, his over all look of neglect."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe it was magic?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, this is before. The kid was pretty much a prisoner. Did people who came over to visit not see this?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe the Dursleys were good at hiding?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They were awful ! I wish they would have gotten more of a punishment in the end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They locked him up more than once."
