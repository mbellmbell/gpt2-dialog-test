"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the Disney movie 'The Little Mermaid?'"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah. It's a classic. It was one of my favorites as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Me, too. My favorite character was Ariel. She sang beautifully."
"__DISNEY__ I liked Ariel too, but my favorite character was Flounder."
"__DISNEY__ He was really cute. He always got so scared in the different scenes."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think of the crab?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean, Sebastian? He was a cute character. He had a great accent."
"__DISNEY__ One of my favorite characters was Scuttle the seagull."
"__DISNEY__ I know. He was really funny, right?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought he was kind of on the dingy side. But, it made the movie comical."
