"__MOVIES__ Hey I finally saw the new Star Trek movie."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was great. Just as good as the first two."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen any of those yet."
"__MOVIES__ What??? That really surprises me."
"__MOVIES__ I want to. But I was busy when the first one came out and just missed it."
"__MOVIES__ The reboots are fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm I've heard some complaints."
"__MOVIES__ Don't listen to them. See the movies and judge for yourself."
"__MOVIES__ Okay I'll do that."
"__MOVIES__ HAHAHA Yeah that sounds like a 'I want to do it but I'll probably be to busy and end up not doing it'"
"__MOVIES__ It's true."
"__MOVIES__ Look I own the first two. Come over this weekend. I get a pizza and we'll watch."
"__MOVIES__ Alright. I'm down for that."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me you will like them. The casting is perfect and the direction is on point."
"__MOVIES__ And I do like Zoe Saldana."
"__MOVIES__ She is definitely the queen of Sci-fi right now."
"__MOVIES__ Well deserved. Avatar, Guardians, and Trek"
"__MOVIES__ I love her. She can't do wrong."
"__MOVIES__ HAHAHA. I don't know about that. But her sci-fi stuff rocks"
