"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can't stand this new rap music, I think it's all garbage. What happened to the great 90s artists, like 2pac and Biggie?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a really closed-minded statement man! Not all rap music is like the stuff you hear on the radio, you gotta listen to underground stuff."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What kind of underground stuff? Do I look like I live in a hole to you?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That was a good one man. But anyways, you should check out SoundCloud, there's a lot of great rappers on there who aren't getting the exposure they deserve."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Care to name a few rappers for me to look up when I get home?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, if you're into alternative or experimental stuff, I'd recommend Bones and xxxtentacion. If you like Three 6 Mafia, check out $uicideboy$."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Man, those rappers have some pretty weird names."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Take my word for it man, you won't be disappointed."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Alright, I'll give them a chance. Any more rap recommendations?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Dude, I'll send you my Soundcloud on Facebook when I get home. I have a bunch of rap playlists you should check out."
