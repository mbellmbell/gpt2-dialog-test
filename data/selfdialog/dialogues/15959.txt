"__ROCK__ It's tough but you must decide, mine is Rocket to Russia."
"__ROCK__ Great choice, guess mind would have to be their self titled album."
"__ROCK__ Also a great choice, you really can't go wrong with any of their early stuff."
"__ROCK__ Definitely agree, my other half for example would probably choose Leave Home."
"__ROCK__ Ha interesting that we would all three have different choices, but I think it just goes to show how tough a choice it is."
"__ROCK__ Yeah rarely has any rock band, independent if genre had three albums of that caliber to start their career."
"__ROCK__ Absolutely and to think critics of the time were so confused by them."
