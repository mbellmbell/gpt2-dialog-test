"__MUSIC__ Okay, I have a tough question for you about music."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, what is that?"
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite insturnment, I know you play a lot."
"__MUSIC__ I do play quite a few, but I think my favorite is the trumpet."
"__MUSIC__ I love the old big band music where someone is just wailing on a trumpet."
"__MUSIC__ And that is why I like it!"
"__MUSIC__ I really like how Michael Buble and a few other people are bringing more music back from that era."
"__MUSIC__ So do I. I feel like our generation has got very far from what music really is."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Half of the 'music' these days is just a computer doing sound effects."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, I miss the old big bands. They were so talented!"
"__MUSIC__ Like Benny Goodman, I know that is reaching back around 80 years. But man, that was some good music."
"__MUSIC__ You truly had to be talented back in the day. It took hard work."
"__MUSIC__ Or think of Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, or Nat King Cole. They were incredibly talented and had to work very hard."
"__MUSIC__ I feel old saying this, but they just don't make music like they used to."
"__MUSIC__ That is true. Though one thing I have really gotten into is accapella."
"__MUSIC__ I enjoy some modern accapella groups as well. They really have to work at it and it is pure vocal music."
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Straight No Chaser?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, they are fantastic. I also like Pentatonix."
"__MUSIC__ You know who does a couple good covers of older songs that really suprises me? Adam Levine."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard them. I guess I will have to check them out."
