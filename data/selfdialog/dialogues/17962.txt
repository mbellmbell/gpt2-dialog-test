"__MOVIES__ I wanna watch a movie this weekend. Something funny or maybe scary."
"__MOVIES__ What do you wanna see exactly. Funny or scary is a category."
"__MOVIES__ What's popular right now?"
"__MOVIES__ Right now? I don't know let's check."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Check out IMDB"
"__MOVIES__ I want to check rottentomatoes first."
"__MOVIES__ I like IMDB better."
"__MOVIES__ Fine, I don't have a preference over a movie review sites, so let's check IMDB. There, you happy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Go to the 'in the theaters'"
"__MOVIES__ i know what I'mm doing. Ok. here we go. Woo! New Pirates movie's opening this weekend! We need to see that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh snap. That's gotta be good. Ok Whatelse. Find something funny."
"__MOVIES__ Baywatch... No. i am not watching that stupid movie. And what are all these 'limited' things?"
"__MOVIES__ They're only opening/showing in limited cities. Ergo, 'limited'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Nevermind that then. What about..."
"__MOVIES__ Go to the box office top ten. Those are popular ones."
"__MOVIES__ Woo, new alien movie... i wanna see that. Guardian 2. Eh that's ok."
"__MOVIES__ King Arthur movie seems ok. Oh my God. No. NO Amy Schumer, that's a stupid movie. Skip. Scroll. What about Boss Baby?"
"__MOVIES__ We do love our animations, but that seems a bit annoying and didn't rank that high. That's kinda rare for Dreamworks to not rank above 7.5"
"__MOVIES__ it's a stupid premise, that's why."
"__MOVIES__ it's a cute baby who's the boss, why is that a stupid premise? Anyway, let's watch the new alien movie. That seems violent and spooky and all around good. makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside with all the alien/human deaths and ghoulish images,."
