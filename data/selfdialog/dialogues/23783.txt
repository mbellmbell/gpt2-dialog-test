"__SUPERHERO__ is it just me or some of the Avengers not really that good of superheroes."
"__SUPERHERO__ Explain what you mean."
"__SUPERHERO__ Take Hawkeye.  No special powers, just really good with a bow."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why's that a problem?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Because in the real world, he would have been killed long ago in battle."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, but that's why it's called a movie.  You have to suspend belief."
"__SUPERHERO__ Same thing with Black Widow.  Secret agent doesn't mean you're invincible."
"__SUPERHERO__ But it would be boring if they weren't mortal.  They could always be killed off."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe they will be in the next movie.  Got to do something to keep the series interesting."
"__SUPERHERO__ They won't be missed even if they did."
