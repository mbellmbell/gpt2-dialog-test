"__MOVIES__ I know you're a pro wrestling fan, so I wanted to ask you about movies featuring wrestlers."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, shoot."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think is the best movie with a pro wrestler in a starring role?"
"__MOVIES__ The Rock has a few good movies to his credit, but I'm going to go with Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, what do you think is the worst movie with a pro wrestler in a starring role?"
"__MOVIES__ Take your pick of any movie that stars Hulk Hogan."
"__MOVIES__ Does that include Rocky 3?"
"__MOVIES__ He doesn't star in that-- it's little more than a cameo.  I'm talking about Mr Nanny, No Holds Barred, Santa with Muscles."
"__MOVIES__ Santa with Muscles??"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, his this rich bodybuilder that gets amnesia and thinks he's Santa Claus, and starts fighting crime."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like both the best and worst thing I've ever heard of."
"__MOVIES__ And, a young Mila Kunis appeared in a supporting role."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any movies about pro wrestling that are any good?"
"__MOVIES__ The Wrestler, with Mickey Rourke is pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ It must've been-- it revitalized his career for a while."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he appeared in a string of movies after that, most notably Iron Man 2."
"__MOVIES__ What about bad movies about pro wrestling?"
"__MOVIES__ The Wrestler, from the 1970s.  So slow, dull, and they can't decide if wrestling is real or fake in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who stars in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The guy you think of when you think of thickly muscled, intimidating men-- Ed Asner."
