"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite television theme song? It doesn't have to be an original song."
"__MUSIC__ Well, does the 'Breaking Bad' music count? I had warm feelings whenever I heard it."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that too, but that's not really a theme song. What else?"
"__MUSIC__ I always like the theme song for 'Alice'. Are you too young to know the show Alice?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean 'Kiss my grits' show? I'm not that young."
"__MUSIC__ Linda Lavin is an accomplished singer. She was slumming coming to television."
"__MUSIC__ I always loved 'WKRP in Cincinnati'. Do you know who produced that?"
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea. But I also love the music from 'Barney Miller'. That's good music."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think the writers of those theme songs get royalties for all that use? They'd all be rich."
"__MUSIC__ That would be great. Most likely they were robbed."
"__MUSIC__ So tell me more about television themes past the nineties. Do you have any more recent music you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I loved the theme song for 'True Blood'. I bought that and still play it."
"__MUSIC__ That was a winner. I wonder where they found that. Or if it was recorded for the show."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think it was recorded for the show. I think they found and it matched."
"__MUSIC__ I think one of the best is the theme from 'Mad Men'. It's such a contrast to the time of the show."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. However it works perfectly. Actually all the music on the show was expertly picked."
"__MUSIC__ I can't stand the theme music for 'Orange is the New Black'. I must mute it."
"__MUSIC__ it has the same affect on me. It's jarring even though it matches the feeling of being in jail."
"__MUSIC__ You're funny. My favorite is the theme song for 'The Young and the Restless'."
"__MUSIC__ I love it too. That music is haunting and a classic. I think the composer didn't think it was going to on a soap for forty years."
