"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you get a chance to see the Pittsburgh and Ottawa game?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, It was a crazy game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am just really surprised that Pittsburgh didn't win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah me too.  Especially all the talk around Crosby taking them to the Stanley Cup again."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ To be honest I am tired of everyone talking about Pittsburgh going back to the Stanley cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah me too.  They are a good team, but I don't think they are good enough to go back or to even win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Your right, especially the way Nashville is playing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Nashville has been a total surprise.  There was talk about Pittsburgh, and the Capitals over and over, but Nashville has continuously been overlooked."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I thought that the Blue would have beat Nashville, but boy was I wrong."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too, I thought Nashville was going to loose in the first round."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It is amazing how well they played against the Blues."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, if they make it through this series, they will definitely win the Stanley Cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think so too.  Look how bad Ottawa and Pittsburgh are struggling to just win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, neither team look really good.  Pittsburgh's defense has been off the last couple of games."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If Pittsburgh doesn't get their defense in line, they won't make it to the Stanley cup, and if they do, Nashville will destroy them easily."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, It will be nice to not have to hear about Ovenchkin and Crosby anymore."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It does get tiring hearing those name over and over.  They may be good, but they are not the only players in the NHL."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree, and what makes it worse is every sportscaster just talks about them continuously throughout each game, even if neither of those players are playing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I noticed that too.  It seams they build up and tear down certain players."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am really hoping Nashville, pulls it off and through a huge kink in their plans of who is the greatest!"
