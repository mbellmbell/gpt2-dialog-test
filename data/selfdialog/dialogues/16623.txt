"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favorite director?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, well, a favorite pair of directors."
"__MOVIES__ What does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm a huge fan of a set of brothers."
"__MOVIES__ What brothers?"
"__MOVIES__ The Coen Brothers. Joel and Ethan Coen."
"__MOVIES__ Do they direct together?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they direct and produce."
"__MOVIES__ What movies have they done? Their names sound slightly familiar."
"__MOVIES__ Oh jeeze, they have a giant body of work. Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, No Country for Old Men, Barton Fink, Burn After Reading, Inside Llewyn Davis, I could go on and on and on."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know them! I've seen No Country For Old Men."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was disturbing. Highly disturbing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is an extremely disturbing movie. The killer, Chigurgh is a madman and a nihlist."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that guy was super scary. He flipped a coin to see if people would live."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I find that sometimes people have difficulty saying they love a movie with such a disturbing villain."
"__MOVIES__ What's your takeaway from it then?"
"__MOVIES__ That in facing real nihilism, those with recognizable emotional responses and dispositions are at a big disadvantage."
"__MOVIES__ So it's a message movie in your opinion?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'd say so. It also has some of the best cinematography of all time."
