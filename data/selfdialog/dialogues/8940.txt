"__BEATLES__ Everyone seems to have a different opinion on their favorite Beatles album."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I know a lot of people who love The White Album, but I prefer Abbey Road."
"__BEATLES__ Really? Me too!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, 'Something' is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life."
"__BEATLES__ Didn't George Harrison write that one?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, he wrote it for his wife, Pattie Boyd. Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney considered it to be the best song on the entire album."
"__BEATLES__ I'd have to agree with them!"
"__BEATLES__ Another great song from that album is 'Here Comes the Sun'."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah, I love that one."
"__BEATLES__ Me too. It always makes me feel better when I'm having a bad day."
