"__MUSIC__ Hey have your heard about the latest StarBomb album?"
"__MUSIC__ Player Select? ya but i haven't listened to it yet."
"__MUSIC__ Don't hold your breath for anything earth shattering like the first one."
"__MUSIC__ Was it disappointing?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, but aside from about two good new songs and some continuations of some music from the first album it was average."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe i wont buy it then."
"__MUSIC__ Its still better than any other indie video game parody music out there."
"__MUSIC__ your probably right"
"__MUSIC__ Dan's vocals really shine through in this album too."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, you can tell he is getting better in the NSP albums"
"__MUSIC__ I got the physical CD so if you want to barrow it and see if you like it let me know."
"__MUSIC__ Great, i think i will take you up on that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they also hinted at a 3rd album."
"__MUSIC__ really. was it subtle or was it Danny, Brian and Aaron style?"
"__MUSIC__ No it was very obvious, pretty much said number three is in the works."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's good news for you since you really like the band."
"__MUSIC__ Ya i am looking forward it it but i am a little leery."
"__MUSIC__ Afraid the quality will slip like from album one to album 2 and that you wont like number three."
"__MUSIC__ Nailed it."
"__MUSIC__ Well lets hope the guys surprise you, you have been following them for over 5 years and you know they can still do quality work."
