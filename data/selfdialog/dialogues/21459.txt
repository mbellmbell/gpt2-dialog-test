"__DISNEY__ I heard there is a live-action remake on cards of 101 Dalmatians."
"__DISNEY__ I absolutely loved the movie and the dogs were a delight to watch."
"__DISNEY__ Well, brace yourself, as the story focuses on Cruella."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I'm not much interested in that villainous character."
"__DISNEY__ Then another piece of news for you, Emma Stone plays Cruella."
"__DISNEY__ What kind of story will the movie have then?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess it will focus on the back story of Curella and how she became what she is now."
"__DISNEY__ Do you really think people want to know that?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess not. I would love more of those Dalmatians on my screen."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't even mind any other breed of dogs or puppies."
