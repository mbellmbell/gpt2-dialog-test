"__LADY_GAGA__ So what are your thoughts on Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she's a pretender."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you mean by that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She just tries to copy what Madonna did in the 1980's."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I can see what you mean."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She just acts weird and dresses up to get attention and sell albums."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well isn't that what every pop artist does?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think some of them have musical merit."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You are pretty tough on her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's just a reproduction of all the gimmicks that have come before."
