"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you had to pick a DT to build around, who would it be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I wouldn't take a DT if I were building a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a hypothetical question."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but DT is not a position I would do.  I would always start with a QB or pass rusher."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, I get it, but since you can't answer the question, I'll go first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fine, smart guy, who are you taking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Donald."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great young player for sure.  Seems like he's a forgotten man in LA."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only because his team is so bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Rams are eternally awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Donald just plays hard every turn.  I knew he was a star the moment he was drafted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was hoping for him to fall in the draft to my team, but it didn't happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, that's my pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're forgetting one little guy I think though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who am I forgetting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some guy named JJ Watt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, I did forget JJ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he hadn't been hurt last year, he'd be a slam dunk pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, will be interesting to see how he comes back from injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When healthy, best player in the league in my opinion."
