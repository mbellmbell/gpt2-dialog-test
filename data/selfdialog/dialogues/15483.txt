"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know you're a big fan of the Harry Potter books. What did you think of the final movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know. They were very good. But Harry and Hermione passionately kissing with no clothes on? I don't think that needed to be in a movie for children."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree. I didn't like the fact that they were so 'grown up' toward the end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, they could have made them mature young adults, but they didn't quite need to visualize that. I took my six year old daughter to see that!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh no! And what happened?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I have to admit, she didn't really understand it. She was more upset about Dobby suddenly dying!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah tell me about it! Did they really need to kill off such an adorable, beloved character?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess they killed off a lot of beloved characters, but Dobby was a hard one to see go."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Overall though, I think the movies were as true to the books as possible."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, that's true, they did a really good job of that, especially considering how much material is in the books!"
