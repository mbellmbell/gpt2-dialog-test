"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you think that the Browns have any chance of ending the season at .500?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I don't think so, even with their draft picks this year I just don't see that happening."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, they need to get their quarterback situation figured out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they do! They haven't had someone that they can rely on to run the offense in so long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they need to find a head coach that they can stick with for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think that they should've stuck with Mike Pettine back when they had him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't get why they didn't stick with him. I think that he could've really done something with the team if given more of a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the front office doesn't ever seem to give head coaches much of a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have no patience!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also feel really bad for Joe Thomas. That man has been so dedicated to the team his whole career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know! They guy hasn't even seen the playoffs since he's been in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has a chance to be a hall of famer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he does! I just hope that someday he's able to at least make it into the playoffs somehow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I honestly would be happy if they could go 4-12 this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah me too, but I don't even know if that's realistic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many wins do you think they can get this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I say maybe two or three games. Three might even be pushing it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I guess we'll see. I still say that they can get four wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm still sticking with two or three."
