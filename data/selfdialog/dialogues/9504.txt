"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the Indians game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ I didn't, but I heard about it today on ESPN!"
"__BASEBALL__ You should of saw it, Kluber struck out 15 and was unhittable."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? At least he finally got some run support."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, Santana hit a homerun and two doubles."
"__BASEBALL__ He always seems to hit the Royals well."
"__BASEBALL__ Well if he can stay healthy, I think the middle of the order is set for the Tribe."
"__BASEBALL__ Yup, it was good that they let Napoli walk in the offseason, or else they might need another bat."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think that the Indians will win the Central?"
"__BASEBALL__ I do. There isn't another strong team in the division this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, if they make it back to the Series, they might not be seeing the Cubs this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Nope! They look lost after last year."
"__BASEBALL__ One of the strengths of this Cleveland team is their bullpen."
"__BASEBALL__ It sure is. Miller hasn't even given up a run yet this year!"
"__BASEBALL__ The way Francona manages this team is the best I've seen since Mike Hargrove."
"__BASEBALL__ Not even close, Francona is the best manager Cleveland has had in my lifetime."
"__BASEBALL__ Who is pitching tonight for the Tribe?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's supposed to be Tomlin."
"__BASEBALL__ Good. He has had a pretty decent year so far."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. I'm going to the bar to watch it tonight. Go Tribe!"
