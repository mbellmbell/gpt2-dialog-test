"__STAR_WARS__ One of my favorite parts of Star Wars is when Luke goes to Dagobah to train with Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is a great little storyline!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I always thought Yoda was kind of a perfect teacher. He's patient but firm."
"__STAR_WARS__ He does talk really weirdly though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I sort of wondered if he was supposed to be, like, a mountaintop guru from a kung-fu movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see that. That's probably the trope they were going for."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but even so, I think it turned out really well."
"__STAR_WARS__ If only Luke had actually listened to him!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. But it ended up being good for the story!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess so."
