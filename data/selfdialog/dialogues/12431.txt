"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, here's a question for you: What is the most overrated and most underrated NFL position?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean like in the organization or on the field?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's go with field position for now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I'll bite. I will say the most overrated position is the Wide Receiver"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wide Receiver? What makes you think so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are a great weapon in the QB's arsenal, and I'm not saying they aren't important, but they get a lot more publicity as a part of the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See for me I think it's the QB who's most overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? They are part of every play!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just like with the WR, I'm not saying they aren't important, but a lot of what they do is a result of what the other players do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, you put Tom Brady behind a rookie line and he'll look like a rookie QB"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, that's why I think Offensive Line positions are the most underrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because they give the QB the opportunity he needs to make the pass?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, Manning's last years with Denver show this. If he had time in the pocket and good routes, he was the best QB ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, but when the OL had all those injuries and restructures his rating fell bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but they always act like it's all the QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and for me I would say Punter or kicker is most underrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting, why those ones?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The punter makes the difference in a game so often by determining field position and a great punter can end another team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, a punt followed by a safety is brutal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget what a 50 yard field goal can do in a close game either and that kind of precision is not common."
