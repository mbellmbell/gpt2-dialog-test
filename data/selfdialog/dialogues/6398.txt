"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know people misquote the like from Empire Strikes Back all the time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I am your father."
"__STAR_WARS__ How do they say it wrong?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They say, Luke I am your father."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. A lot of people think that is the quote."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not surprised. It sounds more natural."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. it's just a fun fact."
"__STAR_WARS__ There are probably way more quotes that people get wrong."
