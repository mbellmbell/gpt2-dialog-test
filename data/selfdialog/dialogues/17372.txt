"__MOVIES__ I kept seeing advertisements all over the place for this one movie that didn't look great, but I can't think of the name of it. Do you know which one I mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't say. What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about this kid being born on Mars and then going back to Earth."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you must mean The Space Between Us."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's it! Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I have. It's kind of a mess."
"__MOVIES__ In what ways is it a mess?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Asa Butterfield is a great young actor. He was very solid in Ender's Game, but he couldn't save this one."
"__MOVIES__ It did seem a bit cheesy. Was it that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, partly. The dialogue wasn't working, and it was trying too hard to be both a sci-fi film and a romantic comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough. So I shouldn't see it?"
"__MOVIES__ No. But what have you seen lately that you liked?"
"__MOVIES__ Logan was really fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Do you usually like superhero films?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not at all. I found that it really went beyond the superhero genre."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It was in the end just a touching story about the end of life. Logan and Patrick Stewart's character were going through serious difficulties."
"__MOVIES__ And they resolved those difficulties?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. At least, they resolved them in personally satisfying ways."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great. Thanks."
