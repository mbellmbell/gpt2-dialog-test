"__BASEBALL__ I can't believe how many injuries the Mets have had this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they've really had terrible luck"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't think it's luck, I think there's something wrong with their medical staff."
"__BASEBALL__ Flores had a leg infection and Duda hurt his elbow. How can you blame that on the trainers?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I still remember Ryan Church flying back to New York with a concussion"
"__BASEBALL__ That was fifteen years ago."
"__BASEBALL__ You have to admit there's something wrong there."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't think so. Every team has injuries."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess, but it seems like their window is closing."
"__BASEBALL__ They've still got Syndergaard and deGrom under control for a few more years."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok, but they need to be thinking about how to win now, especially with their injuries."
"__BASEBALL__ Who is out there that they can get?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know. I really think they should get a catcher."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, d'Arnaud is awful and he can't stay on the field."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe Lucroy will get traded again."
"__BASEBALL__ I doubt it. I think Texas will be good this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Also I'm worried about their bullpen without Famllia."
"__BASEBALL__ I think Reed is a good enough closer."
"__BASEBALL__ But other than him, they're all terrible"
"__BASEBALL__ Blevins is pretty good."
