"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a Bears fan at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't like the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Understandable. So, I guess you're a Packers fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more partial to the Packers, yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bears had a really rough time last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I feel like they're losing fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe they only had three wins last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't seem like they'll have many more this coming season either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I feel like they gave up too much in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. It wasn't worth losing their picks for a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree to an extent. They did need a quarterback, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they still have huge problems in their defense that could have been addressed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, they did pick up a tight end, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got Sheenan, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and Trubinsky as a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Trubinsky was actually the top prospect for quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was. I still think they gave up way too much for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Trubinsky and Sheenan are not going to be able to carry the team themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely not. They're still ranked 32nd overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not the spot you want to be in starting off a new season."
