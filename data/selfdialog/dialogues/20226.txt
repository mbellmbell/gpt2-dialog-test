"__MOVIES__ You have to watch that movie 'Waking Ned Devine'."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ For one, it's hilarious, and two, it's on the Man of Isle and you love Ireland so it's right up your alley."
"__MOVIES__ So it has Irish humor?"
"__MOVIES__ It absolutely has Irish humor which is the main reason it's so freaking good."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds cool, but what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, you know how everyone says, 'If I won the lottery I'd die of a heart attack'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I probably would, too."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, well, that's pretty much the plot of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What?  Someone dies because they won the lottery?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Ned dies of shock when he realizes he's won the lottery."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, so how does that become a movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Keep in mind that we are talking Irish humor here."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, but I still want to know how that becomes an entire movie."
"__MOVIES__ When Ned dies, everyone in town finds out that he won the lottery, and the devise a plan to fool the lottery office in to handing over the winnings anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Who is going to get the winnings?"
"__MOVIES__ The entire town is in on it."
"__MOVIES__ Are you serious, the entire town tries to steal the lottery winnings from a dead man?"
"__MOVIES__ That's exactly right."
"__MOVIES__ I totally have to see that movie."
