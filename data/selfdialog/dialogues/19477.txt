"__MOVIES__ Wonder woman was great."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I was surprised."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it lived up to the hype?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't think there was tons of hype around it, but it sure was good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think the lack of hype was because no one knew how the first girl super hero movie would be."
"__MOVIES__ I was even hesitant to go until I read the reviews."
"__MOVIES__ I waited too. The actress who played wonder woman was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I never even heard of her!"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently she was in the Israeli army."
"__MOVIES__ So she's a bit of wonder woman in real life as well."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think of the costume?"
"__MOVIES__ I love it. You?"
"__MOVIES__ It's one of my least favorite super hero ones."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it stays true to the comic book."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. It didn't take away from the movie, either."
"__MOVIES__ Of course not."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think we'll see a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, definitely. It got like 500 million or something crazy like that."
"__MOVIES__ Id count on a 2019 release."
"__MOVIES__ Most likely."
