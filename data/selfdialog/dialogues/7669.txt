"__LADY_GAGA__ So, Lady Gaga. What do you think of her?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She tries wayyyy too hard. She's always wearing some stupid costume to get attention and stay relevant."
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, no, I'm talking about her music dude."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I mean... I guess her music is okay? Most of it's just generic pop."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Then why do people keep saying she's groundbreaking and different?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Because she dresses in bizarre costumes and says weird stuff all the time."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah but you have to admit. She has talent. At least her stuff sounds good."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, that's true. Her better songs tend to be the ones people aren't familiar with."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well that's true with any artist."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Sure, sure. But I just wish she'd focus more on being weird and different with her music instead of doing that with her visual style."
