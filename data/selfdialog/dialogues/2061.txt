"__MUSIC__ Any new albums releases on your radar this week?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, not that I'm aware of."
"__MUSIC__ That's actually kind of rare this year; it seems like there's been at least one album every week that I've wanted to check out."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It's been kind of hard to keep up with."
"__MUSIC__ What has grabbed your attention the most over the last few months?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm still listening to that new Elder album a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Man, you really love that album."
"__MUSIC__ It's just kind of a sweet spot of good riffs, solid songwriting, and not too repetitive. I can't get enough of it."
"__MUSIC__ What's your biggest disappointment so far this year?"
"__MUSIC__ It pains me to say this, but I can't get into the new Fleet Foxes album."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I know you liked their first two albums a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and I was looking forward to their new one so much."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard it a few times; it definitely seems like a grower."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that before I listened to it. I've probably gotten through it 7-8 times and it's just not grabbing me."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Maybe I'll come back to it in a few months and it'll hit me the right way."
"__MUSIC__ It's funny how some albums do that."
"__MUSIC__ Like I couldn't get into Radiohead for years."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I thought they were kind of universal."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess they just took me a minute for some reason."
