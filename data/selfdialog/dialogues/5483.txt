"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favorite Star Wars villain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Darth Maul was probably my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ His character design was awesome. I didn't like the movie he was in that much, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Episode One isn't very well-liked."
"__STAR_WARS__ You don't think Darth Vader was a better villain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Vader is more legendary for sure. However, he didn't feel as evil as Darth Maul to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ I could see that. Vader's lore is very dark but his character doesn't do much to show it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus Darth Maul had that awesome double bladed lightsaber."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. That thing was really cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ Too bad he ended up getting sliced in half."
