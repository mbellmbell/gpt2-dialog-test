"__STAR_WARS__ Which one of the Star Wars Movies is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really loved the new 'Rogue One' movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked that one, too. It seemed closer in tone to the original movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ There weren't a lot of politics and superfluous stories like in episodes I-III."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those weren't bad, but they just weren't like the originals. I know that most people prefer 'Empire,' but I'll always be a big fan of 'Return of the Jedi.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, what do you like most about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the final battle scene outside of Endor and I think that the final confrontation between Luke and Vader is really dramatic and meaningful."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see you're point. I'm an 'Empire' guy myself, but 'ROTJ' did have some great moments."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you like most about 'Empire'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like how it puts the heroes' backs to the wall. It places them in really difficult situations and shows their vulnerabilities."
