"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been to the Hollywood Bowl for a music concert?"
"__MUSIC__ A couple times. Cool venue."
"__MUSIC__ I grew up going to the Bowl for the annual July 4th extravaganza with the fireworks."
"__MUSIC__ That must have been a fun tradition."
"__MUSIC__ I had three siblings, and there's not many places a family of six can go for good inexpensive entertainment."
"__MUSIC__ I'm guessing you didn't get food at the Bowl, then. The prices!"
"__MUSIC__ No, we brought boxed Kentucky Fried Chicken dinners."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that was another family tradition, along with the Bowl."
"__MUSIC__ This is why I love KFC to this day. Those are great memories."
"__MUSIC__ How did your evenings go?"
"__MUSIC__ We always sat in the nosebleed seats way in the back, because they were the cheapest,"
"__MUSIC__ That inexpensive family entertainment you mentioned before."
"__MUSIC__ Of course. But when you go for the view and the music, those are actually the best seats in the house."
"__MUSIC__ I remember from my trips to the Bowl that it was an amazing view of the entire valley the Bowl is located in."
"__MUSIC__ And as soon as night falls, it feels like you're in another world, just you and the crowd and the music."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music did you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ It was usually standards, classical pieces and the like. I learned about a lot of classical music from my nights at the Bowl."
"__MUSIC__ And you said there were fireworks at the end?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, accompanied by the 1812 Overture. It was a perfect ending to a great evening."
"__MUSIC__ They still do the July 4th shows at the Bowl. I'll have to go to one someday."
