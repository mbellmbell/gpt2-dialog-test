"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Kilo Ren in the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought he was a little weak."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?  He stopped a blaster full on out."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just didn't appreciate the temper tantrums in an otherwise good movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right about that.  Vader would never have had a tantrum."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, he may be powerful but needs to grow up."
"__STAR_WARS__ You are right about the blaster scene though.  That was amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ He also seemed to know something about Rey, he was pretty upset when he found out who she was."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they're cousins."
"__STAR_WARS__ Seems a little obvious but that would make sense."
