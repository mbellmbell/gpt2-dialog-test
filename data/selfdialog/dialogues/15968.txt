"__ROCK__ Which decade of music had the best rock?"

"__ROCK__ Who is your favorite band from the 1970s?"
"__ROCK__ I think the Rolling Stones is my favorite.  Songs like 'Paint It Black' and 'Sympathy for the Devil' made me a fan."
"__ROCK__ As silly as it sounds, I would put a band like Soundgarden's work up against the Rolling Stones."
