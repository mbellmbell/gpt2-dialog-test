"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You watch Football, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I follow the Ravens and Eagles, but that's about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you watch the Superbowl no matter what, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, of course."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think of this years Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Extremely disappointing at first, but then WOW."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's exactly how I felt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you wanted the Pats to win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, definitely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember turning the game off maybe like 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter because I thought it was over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't turn it off until the end of the 3rd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you turn it back on eventually or find out what happened afterwards?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was following on Twitter. When the Pats looked like they were coming back, I watched again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. It was probably one of the best comebacks ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely was. Tom Brady is the best of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't go that far, but he is one of the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they'll make the superbowl again this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though I'm more of a Ravens fan, I hope they do just to see the reaction to Brady getting another ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's like 41, that would be amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is amazing."
