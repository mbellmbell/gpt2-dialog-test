"__ACTION__ What was the best Lord of the Rings movie?"
"__ACTION__ That's a nearly impossible question to answer.  They were all exceptional."
"__ACTION__ I'm with you.  The third probably had the best action."
"__ACTION__ Do you mean the big battle at the end at the gates of Mordor or the one outside the city?"
"__ACTION__ Pick either one.  There were tons of good examples in that movie."
"__ACTION__ I always thought that Helms Deep from the second movie was my favorite."
"__ACTION__ That one definitely had a very intimate feel since the scale was grand, but centralized."
"__ACTION__ It helped that they were so outnumbered."
"__ACTION__ I'll have to watch the series again to give you the best answer."
"__ACTION__ Let's go watch the first movie right now!"
