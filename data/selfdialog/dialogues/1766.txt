"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with the twilight zone?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, why?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I was watching Perry Mason the other day and I thought I recognized some of the music."
"__MUSIC__ As being from the Twilight Zone?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ What music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it was somewhere in season two of Perry Mason, and I thought it was the same music from the Twilight Zone episode with the slot machine."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I know exactly what music you're talking about!"
"__MUSIC__ Yay! You remember what was playing when the machine is stalking him at his room?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I can hear it as if it was playing right now."
"__MUSIC__ Is that not the same music?"
"__MUSIC__ I believe it is. There was a lot of good music from the Twilight Zone but that particular music is very trademark."
"__MUSIC__ Probably the only more iconic music from it was during the theme."
"__MUSIC__ I love that. I wonder if when they came up with that they knew how many people would do a take off on it in the future."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I think it's just one of those things that was kind of accidental."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely did a good job with all the music in the series though."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, from the slow teasing scenes to the abrupt jarring scenes."
"__MUSIC__ They always know exactly what music to employ to set the scene."
"__MUSIC__ And to scare you or intrigue you as well."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly."
