"__THRILLER__ Do you prefer older or newer thriller films?"
"__THRILLER__ I love the older ones."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, what's your favorite."
"__THRILLER__ Psycho of course. It's a classic."
"__THRILLER__ I totally get that; it's so well done."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and who doesn't like Hitchcock films?"
"__THRILLER__ Exactly. Did you ever notice that there is no music at the beginning of Psycho's shower scene?"
"__THRILLER__ No, you're kidding!"
"__THRILLER__ I'm not! It's totally quiet and then once the killing starts, the music starts."
"__THRILLER__ Oh wow, now I have to rewatch the film so I can catch that."
