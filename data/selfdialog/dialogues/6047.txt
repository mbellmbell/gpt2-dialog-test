"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think the path of Darth Vader would be different if he had known that his children had survived?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that wasn't the possibility, as it was intentionally kept from him."
"__STAR_WARS__ But doesn't the fact that it was kept from him suggest that it could have influenced him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think that it would have brought him back into the Light side again. He was already too far gone."
"__STAR_WARS__ But it seemed that his attitude changed after he met Luke and realized that he was his son."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think so. He was still trying to corrupt Luke and bring him into the Dark Side."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you believe that his affection towards Luke didn't really affect the level of his corruption?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The only thing that got Darth Vader to react was when the Emperor attacked Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ But that suggests that his priorities might have changed."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. He was still dark, but the act of giving up his life for his son redeemed him in a way."
