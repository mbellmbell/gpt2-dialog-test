"__STAR_WARS__ I've always been really curious about Stormtrooper armor."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it seems like it's really useless."
"__STAR_WARS__ Because they can still get shot?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, yeah. What exactly does it protect against?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe physical weapons? Or it's like environmental protection?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like a robot suit?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. That sort of thing. I bet we can look this up."
"__STAR_WARS__ It looks like only some of the guns could pierce stormtrooper armor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that makes sense then."
