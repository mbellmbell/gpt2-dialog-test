"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good question, players are so crazy right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but if you had to choose, who would be your top players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, definitely Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea Tom is a beast, he has to be in the list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, the patriots would be nothing without him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that, but he's a great pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Next would be Antonio Brown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What position does he play again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh right for the steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he's amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Newton"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Panthers QB?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he's up there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess he's pretty good. I'm just not a Panther's fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well you didn't ask what teams I liked, you asked who the best players were."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea true, I just find it hard to think someone is good when they are on a team I hate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's just narrow minded."
