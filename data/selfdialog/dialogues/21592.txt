"__DISNEY__ Hey, do you like the Disney movie Tangled?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you kidding? It's my favorite movie! I love Rapunzel!"
"__DISNEY__ I do too! I love Flynn Ryder too. His story is so great. I'm glad he ends up happy and not a thief anymore."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. I think Rapunzel and Flynn go together well. He really helps her learn about who she is."
"__DISNEY__ It's sweet how he takes her to see the floating lanterns, isn't it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. That's my favorite part. It's so romantic and the song they sing is such a great song."
"__DISNEY__ I think the song in the Ugly Duckling with all the scary guys is my favorite. The one called I've Got A Dream."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, yeah. It's funny to hear about all the characters dreams. They really put a lot of thought into that song."
"__DISNEY__ I bet it was a fun movie to make. The animation was really great, too."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I love everything about the movie. The songs are so catchy and the story is so heart-warming."
