"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's talk about top ranked players this 2017 NFL Season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about we start with quarterback of the Falcons, Matt Ryan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan had a great season, one of the best of his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a threat, passing for 4,944 yards and 38 touchdowns! Those numbers being with just seven interceptions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Falcons exploded with those types of numbers and enjoyed the fruits from which were produced."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But all did not end too well there. Having made it to the grand stage just for the defense to collapse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is all too true, though he is ranked number 10 in the top 100 of players coming into 2017 season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will just have to wait and see if he can build upon this past season and continue strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's turn our focus to Le'Veon Bell, the Steelers running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The word patience fits the man to a t."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That it does, he really showed much patience last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets not forget Bell rushed for 1,268 yards and he peaked with back-to-back 150 plus yard games in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, one must watch for his sudden bursts out of the backfield. Very explosive and a sight to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of his most memorable performances was in a snowstorm! Getting the ball 38 times and had 236 yards rushing with 3 touchdowns on the ground."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that game! Was a great game to witness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would put that in one of my all time favorites of his games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bell is without a doubt, a top 10 player to watch!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, with you on that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are so many greats out there to be on the radar this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and we only named off two of them! So much great talent in this league."
