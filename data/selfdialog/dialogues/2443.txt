"__MUSIC__ So how are you doing since The Gaslight Anthem has been on hiatus?"
"__MUSIC__ Man, not good, I can't find anything to replace them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah their sound was one of a kind, even though it was drawn from so many other bands."
"__MUSIC__ That Springsteen Jersey sound jived so well with their punk roots, there's a void there for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, when the Summer approaches and there is no Gaslight show to go to I get real sad."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah some of my best memories with friends was seeing Gaslight Anthem perform in the summer."
"__MUSIC__ Thankfully Brian Fallon's solo stuff is pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I like it a lot, just isn't the same you know?"
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ Rosemary was my favorite off of Painkillers because it was dripping with Gaslight vibes."
"__MUSIC__ There's still that Brian Fallon flare though, both his solo work and Gaslight are so obviously him so it's fine."
"__MUSIC__ True, it's just you want to hear Brian's words over Rosamilia's guitar work you know?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely know what you mean, it's like peanut butter and jelly."
"__MUSIC__ Peanut butter and jelly with some heartbreak."
"__MUSIC__ Did you see he's getting Ted Hutt to produce his second solo album?"
"__MUSIC__ Whoa I did not see that, that's awesome news."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Butch Walker did a great job with Painkillers but Ted Hutt did great work on Gaslight and the Crowes."
"__MUSIC__ For sure, who knows maybe it's a secret Gaslight record he's been writing."
"__MUSIC__ That would be such a great surprise."
"__MUSIC__ Christmas would come early if that were the case."
