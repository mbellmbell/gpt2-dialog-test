"__MOVIES__ You should totally see this new movie called 'Keanu'."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that the one made by Key and Peele?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it is hilarious. I think you would really enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ What is it even about? Some kind of cat, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay,  it's about a cat, but it's about so much more than that."
"__MOVIES__ Sound's kind of boring, what's so special about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, let's just say that Key's cat is stolen by accident, and they both kind of become hard core gangsters to get it back."
"__MOVIES__ Ha! So they go on drive by's, and drug deals, and stuff like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much. One scene I think you'll really love has to do with four gang members in a minivan singing George Michael together."
"__MOVIES__ Now that sounds pretty interesting to say the least. Is it kind of like their TV show?"
"__MOVIES__ A little bit, but this is more rounded like a movie. That new one that Keegan Michael-Key made is really good too."
"__MOVIES__ You mean 'Get Out'? I heard that was good."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, its fantastic. Think of like the worst fears that a black man might have about white people actually being realized."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I dont know if I would like that. Sounds more like a drama or scary movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's the thing, it starts off with these fears being realized, but as the movie progresses the fears start becoming outlandish."
"__MOVIES__ Like how? They just treat him terribly?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it starts off with the obvious things happening, like them making jokes at his expense, but then it starts to get crazier and crazier after the girls mom hypnotizes him."
"__MOVIES__ She hypnotizes him? White people don't do that. Jesus, where does it go from there?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh then it starts to get so crazy this horror movie becomes a comedy. Turns out the white people have like underground lairs and are part of a secret cult."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy, we should watch that soon."
