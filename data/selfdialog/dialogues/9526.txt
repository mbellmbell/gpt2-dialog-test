"__BASEBALL__ Are you going to watch the Yankees game tonight?"
"__BASEBALL__ Why?  Because it is Derek Jeter night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  I am not necessarily a fan of the Yankees, but I do want to watch to see how they honor him."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I guess I will be watching as well for that reason."
"__BASEBALL__ What are your thoughts on Derek Jeter's career?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think it really stands out.  He's a legend on a team full of them."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I think no matter how you feel about the Yankees, you have to respect what Jeter did."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree.  He played twenty seasons for the most scrutinized team maybe in all of sports."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly!  And honestly he never had a scandal or got in trouble for anything."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, he did seem to conduct himself as a professional off the field."
"__BASEBALL__ And he was pretty good on the field as well."
"__BASEBALL__ Well the five World Series titles kind of speaks for itself."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, and wining three straight.  I don't know if any team will do that again."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he just had the personality to fit in New York."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  He's a good looking guy, well-spoken, and always seemed to deal with the media very well."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he was the best short stop of his era?"
"__BASEBALL__ I definitely think so.  I mean Alex Rodriguez was a short stop."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, but ironically Rodriguez had to change positions when he came to the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ Well those two did not really get along."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, it will be interested to see if Rodriguez is there tonight for Jeter's night."
