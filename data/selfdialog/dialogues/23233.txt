"__DISNEY__ What do you think Disney's biggest movie of the 90s was?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know.  Probably either Aladdin or Pocahontas."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I'm sure it'd be either one of those two."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know that Aladdin had a sequel or two?"
"__DISNEY__ Was it good?"
"__DISNEY__ I never saw it.  It was straight to video."
"__DISNEY__ How did you know about it?"
"__DISNEY__ My little sister had it."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they used the same voices."
