"__HORROR__ What is the scariest horror movie you have ever seen?"
"__HORROR__ I don't really like horror movies."
"__HORROR__ Really? I love them."
"__HORROR__ Ya they are just not my thing. The scariest one I have probably seen is Scream, if you count that as a horror."
"__HORROR__ I guess you could count it, although it is not the scariest."
"__HORROR__ Ya. They were ok movies. I just don't like a lot of violence."
"__HORROR__ Ya I get that. Which one is your favorite?"
"__HORROR__ I have to say number 3. I really like Courtney Cox"
"__HORROR__ Oh ya she is one of my favorites. If you aren't to afraid you should check out I Know What You Did Last Summer, its not to scary."
"__HORROR__ Ok. I will definitely think about it."
