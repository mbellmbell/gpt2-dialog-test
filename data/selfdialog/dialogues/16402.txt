"__ROCK__ Do you think rock music has to be subversive in order to be good?"
"__ROCK__ I think it plays a part, but 'good' is very subjective."
"__ROCK__ I think the really good stuff always has a political message."
"__ROCK__ Sure, but there's also a formula for it being successful."
"__ROCK__ Like Korn's song 'ya'll want a single'?"
"__ROCK__ Exactly like that. There's a whole industry built on formulating how long's should be and how fast."
"__ROCK__ That detracts from the work of the artist."
"__ROCK__ Of course it does. You will notice that after they become popular and money, then the artist has more freedom to be subversive."
"__ROCK__ At that point, though, they have already become part of the system."
"__ROCK__ That's the music industry and capitalism for you. Take art and make it commercial."
