"__MUSIC__ Well, what can you tell me about The Kinks?"
"__MUSIC__ The Kinks were led by brothers, Ray and Dave Davies, and were one of England's finest rock bands. They started in London and went through many different eras."

"__MUSIC__ Well, the most prominently talked about are their early rock'and'roll stuff, their golden age, and then their theatrical era."
"__MUSIC__ Which of those eras are your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ The golden age of The Kinks stuff, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ So what's happening during the golden age of The Kinks? What's so good about it?"

"__MUSIC__ Well, they write about class and war and life in England. For one, their song Dead End Street, is really sarcastic and great."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what's a song you would recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Lola' is a great song. It's about a trans person and accepting them. It's a great hard rock pop song."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so what's your favorite album by The Kinks?"
"__MUSIC__ Arthur or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire is my absolute favorite. It wasn't a huge commercial success but it's a great mix of pop and social commentary."

"__MUSIC__ Yeah, get that and The Village Green Preservation Society."
