"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the band 'The Toadies'?"
"__MUSIC__ No, never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not surprised. You'd probably have to be around my age to have heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ They were an Alternative Rock band who was briefly popular when I was a teenager. They didn't have a lot of staying power."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I see. Were you a fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I liked their album 'Possum Kingdom' a lot!"
"__MUSIC__ They seem to have an animal theme. Toads and Possums!"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, they were kind of a weird band."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by weird?"
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics of their songs tended to be kind of strange. Not the typical stuff you will hear from a lot of bands."
"__MUSIC__ What's an example?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, one of their popular songs was called 'I Come from the Water'. And that's what it was about, how the singer or character comes from the water."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean, 'come from the water'?"
"__MUSIC__ It was never specified in the song. That's what I mean, they were weird."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that sounds weird, I agree. But you liked them anyway."
"__MUSIC__ I liked them because they were weird, not in spite of it. Their lyrics were kind of dark and sometimes funny."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think I'd enjoy them?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. The sound is kind of dated, very much like grunge-y 90s music."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I might stay away then. It's not really my thing."
