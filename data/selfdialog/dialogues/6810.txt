"__STAR_WARS__ I always liked Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he and Chewie make a great pair of characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's too bad he died in The Force Awakens, but that is probably what Harrison Ford wanted."
"__STAR_WARS__ True - it moved the story along and made Kylo an even more evil character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think that Kylo will be redeemed by the end of the trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know - perhaps he and Luke will destroy each other and Rey will be a middle Grey Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is possible that they will go that route - I wonder if Rey will make her own lightsaber."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that she will continue to use Luke's - maybe she is Luke's daughter!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope that John Williams write the music for Episode IX."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too - he needs to write some epic music for the final movie."
