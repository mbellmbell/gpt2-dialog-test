"__MOVIES__ Quick question; Have you ever seen Angela's Ashes?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh, I don't think I have. Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not anybody I'd think you know, except that Rumpelstiltskin guy from Once."
"__MOVIES__ I know that guy, he was in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was the father."
"__MOVIES__ So, what happens in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's about a poor Irish family."
"__MOVIES__ A little stereotypical, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ It's based on a book and it follows the author's life."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I see."
"__MOVIES__ So, Angela's Ashes follows Frank, the author, in his life."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds a little boring."
"__MOVIES__ It can be slow, but it's a really good movie."
"__MOVIES__ If you say so, where can I find it?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably on a streaming app, maybe Hulu?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. I'll look into it and tell you what I think."
"__MOVIES__ Great! It's one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ Then I need to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly!"
"__MOVIES__ See you!"
