"__POP__ So, is there anyone in Pop music right now that you are really into?"
"__POP__ Oh yeah, there are actually quite a few different artists. But I really like a lot of Drake's new songs."
"__POP__ Oh, cool! I like his new stuff too. Anything that really stands out for you?"
"__POP__ Well, I really like 'Signs.' I just think it is a great song."
"__POP__ I like that song too. Anything else by Drake that you really like?"
"__POP__ Oh, yeah, for sure. I really liked his record 'What a Time to be Alive.'"
"__POP__ I know that album pretty well; it was really good! It had 'Jumpman' on it, which was a great song."
"__POP__ Yeah, that's right! It was a super popular song a few years ago, and I still think it is one of Drake's best."
"__POP__ Oh, totally. I actually can't wait for some new songs."
"__POP__ Me too! He has a tough job of following his own act, but I can't wait to hear what he has next!"
