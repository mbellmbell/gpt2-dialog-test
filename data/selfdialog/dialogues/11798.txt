"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you name me your top five players in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a very difficult question!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I Know! You are the biggest NFL fan I know so I figured you would be the right person to ask."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you talking about five different positions, or what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does not matter what position they play. Simply your top five in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got it, this could take me a while though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is fine by me. I am just interested in hearing your picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I would start my list off with Arron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going in order by the way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I am not naming them in any particular order."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rodgers is a great first choice by the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My second and third players would be Julio Jones and Von Miller."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like those picks, both of those guys are dominant at their positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then I would go with Richard Sherman. He is a lock down corner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he is the foundation of the Seahawk's defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My last pick would probably be Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though he is basically forty years old?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see what he just did in the Superbowl last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, he is amazing to do what he does at his age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So there you have it, my top five NFL players."
