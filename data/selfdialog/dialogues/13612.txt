"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear about Jarvis Landry?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No what happened to him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has hopes to land a new deal with the Miami Dolphins soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what is the problem?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He doesn't want to be engaged in contract negotiations once the season starts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? Thats silly. Why would he say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He says he wants to focus completely on the game and not have to multi task."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can understand that to a degree but I still think it's a bad idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he makes a good deal with the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he's one of ths most underpaid players in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Underpaid? How much is he making?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's making $900,000."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats underpaid!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well compared to others in his position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There has to be some reason for the low pay. Is he a bad player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. Actually the very opposite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh so he is basically asking for a raise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah actually you could say that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure he will get some kind of increase in pay but just under a million a year is good in my opinion."
