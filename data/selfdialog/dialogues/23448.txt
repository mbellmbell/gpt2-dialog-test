"__DISNEY__ Who would you say had the most recognizable voice in Aladdin?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Gilbert Gottfried as Iago. There's no mistaking that voice!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree. Although Robin Williams is a close second as Genie."
"__DISNEY__ You know, if you consider how much he brought that character to life, you could say he's the most recognizable."
"__DISNEY__ True. The jokes and little nuances of the Genie definitely couldn't have been brought by anyone else."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! Especially when he first comes out of the lamp."
"__DISNEY__ I'd say the best was when he was making Aladdin into a prince."
"__DISNEY__ Pretty much any time he changed into something else was amazing!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree. And that shirt he wears when he's finally set free?"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely taken right from Robin Williams' wardrobe!"
