"__MUSIC__ So did you hear that U2 has been touring their Joshua Tree album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, a friend told me about it."
"__MUSIC__ So would you go?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I hate U2."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ I just hate Bono.  He's such a egomaniacal blowhard."
"__MUSIC__ I can see why you say that but his activism does a lot of good in the world."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe.  I see him as a shill."
"__MUSIC__ Why would you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  I heard U2 has a tax haven in the Netherlands."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like their music at least?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really.  It all sounds the same to me.  I did like that Without You song."
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean With or Without You?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like you haven't heard too much of their music."
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't really."
"__MUSIC__ Then how can you say that you hate it?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  I just don't like Bono, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ So you don't know much about their music.  Maybe you should just say you dislike Bono since you're speaking from a place of ignorance."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever.  I guess."
