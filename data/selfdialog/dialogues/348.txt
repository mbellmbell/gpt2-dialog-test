"__MUSIC__ What are you listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been a big Pink Floyd kick."
"__MUSIC__ You know, the president of the Pink Floyd fan club used to visit the library I worked at."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he was doing research on them for a book he was writing."
"__MUSIC__ That's really cool. Did he tell you anything unusual about them?"
"__MUSIC__ Not much that I remember. He had a lot of Dark Side of the Moon T-shirts."
"__MUSIC__ I love that album!"
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song on it?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like money."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I prefer Eclipse."
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to go wrong; they're both great songs."
"__MUSIC__ They are. Is Dark Side of the Moon mostly what you've been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ It's mostly that and The Wall."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, yeah, it's hard to go wrong there either."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know why, but I can listen to it over and over again."
"__MUSIC__ There are some albums that are just like that. They never get old."
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles are like that for me sometimes too."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I'll have to give some of these another shot next time I'm working out."
"__MUSIC__ I hope you do!"
