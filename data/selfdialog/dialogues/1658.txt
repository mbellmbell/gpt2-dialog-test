"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of Train?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I am."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever seen them live?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and it was royally disappointing. They weren't very good at all."
"__MUSIC__ That's surprising. They don't seem super auto-tuned."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure if they actually are. They just don't sound very good live."
"__MUSIC__ That's a really shame. I was going to go buy tickets to their concert."
"__MUSIC__ Well, don't go because of my opinion. Maybe you won't feel the same way I do."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I will go, then. 'Drops of Jupiter' is my all time favorite song."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too!"
"__MUSIC__ Did they play it at the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so, sadly."
"__MUSIC__ Then maybe I actually won't go. That's kind of the reason I was going to go, as crazy as that sounds."
"__MUSIC__ There are much better bands you can go see live than Train!"
"__MUSIC__ Who would you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ The Killers. They're fantastic live."
"__MUSIC__ Ooh, maybe I'll look into getting tickets to their concert then."
"__MUSIC__ You should! They play a really great show. Everyone's on their feet the entire time."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That's the type of concert I want to go."
"__MUSIC__ Then make sure you buy tickets soon, they sell out quickly."
