"__MOVIES__ Which of the James Bond films have you yet to see?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I've seen them all already."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah same here, which did you think were particularly good?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the new Daniel Craig ones, I like the gritty nature of them."
"__MOVIES__ Don't they feel a bit too American? Maybe a bit too Jason Bourne?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think it's just changing with the times like the others have."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like the camp comedy ones and the Cold War ones."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's it. I'm not a huge fan of some of them."
"__MOVIES__ The Lazenby one was a bit ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ Not only ridiculous, it was poorly made. I know they didn't have great graphics but it looked like a child's computer game!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, not all the old ones were bad though. I enjoyed Live and Let Die and Dr. NO."
"__MOVIES__ They were good, they can't compete with the modern ones in terms of looks but the story is just as good."
"__MOVIES__ Goldeneye was quite good for a laugh too."
"__MOVIES__ It was, I'm not a huge fan of Brosnan though."
"__MOVIES__ He was OK but not the greatest."
"__MOVIES__ Top Bonds then?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say Connery, Craig and Roger Moore."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree on Roger Moore."
"__MOVIES__ He's the funny one, you don't have to like the action but you can laugh at him."
"__MOVIES__ We can agree on that."
