"__DISNEY__ So, what did you think of Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I liked it, especially from an artistic point of  view"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I'm a bit of  CG buff myself, so I thought all the effects and animations was terrific!"
"__DISNEY__ Hey, neat fact, did you know in the original script Elsa was supposed to be the villain?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I heard that.  I think it was because it was originally based on The Snow Queen story for Hans Christian Andersen, and the Queen's the villain in that one as well."
"__DISNEY__ Now, as much as I liked the film there were a few things I would have changed."
"__DISNEY__ Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I thought the Trolls were pretty pointless... they could replaced them with the characters getting info from a magic book and nothing would be different."
"__DISNEY__ Ahhh.. but they were so funny!  'I grew a mushroom!'"
