"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?"
"__DISNEY__ Mine would have to be Toy Story. Maybe even all 3 of them."
"__DISNEY__ I honestly would have to say mine is also Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, there are a lot of great Disney movies, but Toy Story just really hits home and makes you feel like a kid again."
"__DISNEY__ Speaking of being a kid again, do you remember watching Mickey Mouse when you were younger?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I loved that show, I even watched it when it was in black and white."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, back in the day I watched Dumbo, the movie about the little elephant."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I loved that movie, I watched that and The Jungle Book over and over!"
"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the song from the Jungle Book?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, haha. Bear necessities those simple bear necessities."
