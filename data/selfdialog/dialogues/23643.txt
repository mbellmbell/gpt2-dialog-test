"__DISNEY__ Did you know Cars 3 is out already?"
"__DISNEY__ I didn't even know they were making a third."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, supposedly Lightning McQueen is old news and he's struggling to keep up with the newer younger racers."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds like a few people I know!"
"__DISNEY__ I saw the trailer for it last time I went to the movies. It looks pretty good!"
"__DISNEY__ Is Mater going to be in this one too? I love Larry the Cable Guy!"
"__DISNEY__ Of course! You can't have Cars without Mater!"
"__DISNEY__ I'll have to go home and watch the trailer."
"__DISNEY__ Or, better yet, let's go to the movies and watch it."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds good! I'm free tonight around 8. See you then!"
