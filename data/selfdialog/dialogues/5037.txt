"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Am I the only one that gets sort of angry at the Fast & Furious characters?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ In what sense?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ In that those guys are all villains.  They are actual bad guys."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Now that you mention it, they are all thieves and crooks."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ More than that even, it's their total disregard for everyone outside of their 'family.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That is so true.  In 'Fast Five,' they basically destroyed parts of Brazil while dragging that bank vault with their cars."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ And don't forget 'The Fate of the Furious' when they go to Germany and kill a bunch of police officers who try to stop them from stealing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was even worse.  They always cheer and have a good time about it too."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think that's why for me, I just can't sympathize with any of them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's very hard to root for characters with such few morals!"
