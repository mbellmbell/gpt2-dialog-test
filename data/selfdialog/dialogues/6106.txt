"__STAR_WARS__ Luke Skywalker is the worst character in Star Wars by far."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's the grand master. How can you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's whiney and he runs and he's responsible for BILLIONS of deaths."
"__STAR_WARS__ Elaborate."
"__STAR_WARS__ Easy. He cried that one of his students turned and ran away to a planet to be by himself. Meanwhile, that student killed an entire star system."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke just sat there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, kind of pathetic, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think he's doing on that planet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably waiting for the pity party to arrive."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha!"
