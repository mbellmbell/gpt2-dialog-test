"__BASKETBALL__ I feel like talking basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, me too."
"__BASKETBALL__ So, you been watching the games much?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I tried to keep up with Notre Dame, but they're not doing so great."
"__BASKETBALL__ Really?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I mean, they lost four of their last five games, including two at home to two ranked teams"
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow, that's not very good."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, it isn't, and it's pretty discouraging as a big fan of the team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Can't be all hopeless, though, huh?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, Mooney isn't doing to bad.  Been pretty excited to see him on the floor."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I've seen him, that guy is TALL, even for a basketball player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I believe he's like six foot nine or so."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, could definitely catch some rebounds."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe they need a change in strategy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I think so... heard some people suggesting they try the 1-4 offensive set"
"__BASKETBALL__ You think that would work?"
"__BASKETBALL__ At this point, it couldn't hurt but that, to me, isn't the real problem."
"__BASKETBALL__ What is?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they keep passing on 'good' shots to try and get 'even better' shots.  Sometimes, you just gotta cut loose."
