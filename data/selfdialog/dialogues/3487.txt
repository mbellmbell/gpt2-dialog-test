"__MUSIC__ Who do you think writes the best lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ Living or Dead?"
"__MUSIC__ Both."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a tough one. There are so many different styles, and it's hard to compare them."
"__MUSIC__ True, but you could think about whose lyrics have the greatest effect on you."
"__MUSIC__ I still think it's really hard. For example, sometimes Kurt Cobain makes me feel so dedicated and strong - if I'm in the mood for Nirvana. But, no way I could argue his lyrics are better than Paul Simon's."
"__MUSIC__ So should I mark you down for picking Paul Simon?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I love him, but I can't say he is hands down my favorite. But he's way up there. Who do you like the best?"
"__MUSIC__ Bob Dylan, no question."
"__MUSIC__ He's fantastic, but I have to be in the mood for him. I would say he writes the best lyrics for sending your thoughts all over the place."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's why I like him. But, that doesn't make him your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ It could, but then I'd be putting him above Paul McCartney, Eddie Vedder, Paul Smon, and Ira Gershwin."
"__MUSIC__ Gershwin, really? I guess that's why you asked about living or dead."
"__MUSIC__ Well, him and Cole Porter. But really I like Gershwin better than Porter. Gershwin has a complete felicity with language that I hear in Paul Simon, too."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I have heard of them, but I don't think I ever paid attention to the Gershwin brothers."
"__MUSIC__ I think you might like them. Did you ever see that Woody Allen movie, Manhattan?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ That was all Gershwin music. I just love the opening sequence with Rhapsody in Blue, an instrumental song, no lyrics, by the way."
"__MUSIC__ I think the whole movie was instrumental."
"__MUSIC__ It was, but most of those songs had lyrics, they just weren't used."
