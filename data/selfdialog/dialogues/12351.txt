"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you looking forward to the new NFL celebration rules?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, Goodell found a way to make it less fun, even though they are allowing more of a celebration."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you mean the new focus on clock management after a touchdown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and they are supposedly limiting the tv timeouts so that the game flows better and finishes on time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure you can always predict which games will flow smoothly, because injuries and penalties in the nfl tend to be rather lengthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why I'm not sure why they modified the celebration rules for the players at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think because the NFL is trying to capture a younger audience, they know they have to make it entertaining for those who may not be interested in the Xs and Os."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but the refs will have the ultimate say, just like before, in regards to player conduct."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe Antonio Brown will get away with some of his flashier dances after scoring the touchdown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only if he doesn't slow the pace of play, because the play clock will start after the ref signals the score."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that might make some teams' kicks a bit rushed and little less accurate than before the rule change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are those kickers who seem to be flustered in times of great stress, but most of the long time kickers will practice the situation with their units."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever the league office's motives are in this case, there are going to be some great highlight reels at the end of every Sunday!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as the refs let the players have a little fun, the NFL fans might relax a bit, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was wondering if any of the celebration rules had to do with player safety as the league is trying to make that a focus."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you mean that excessive celebration leads to other teams getting chippy and causing some personal fouls?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not necessarily, no. I'm thinking more along the lines of large offensive lineman jumping on the smaller players in celebration and accidentally hurting their players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could be a hazard, but I think it's important for teams to celebrate together and build up rapport with one another."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really know what the NFL owners' intentions were with the new touchdown rules, but I hope it makes the games go by a bit quicker!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah those Monday night football games end so late for those who watch on the East coast!"
