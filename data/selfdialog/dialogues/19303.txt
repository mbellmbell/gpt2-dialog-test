"__MOVIES__ So, I checked out the movie Regression, and I really liked it! It was so dark."
"__MOVIES__ Weren't Emma Watson and Ethan Hawke great in it?"
"__MOVIES__ They really were, and I didn't realize David Thewlis was also in there! He was currently in Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ So, that's where I recognized him from! I remember him from other movies too but couldn't put a name to him, but he has such a recognizable face and English accent."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't sure about the ending to Regression but I remember you telling me about the movie and how Emma Watson's character was pretty interesting."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about her performance in the movie and how they shifted her from victim to mastermind?"
"__MOVIES__ I was kind of blown away by it because the whole movie, Ethan, was playing the seasoned detective investigating this cult, and Emma seem to be just a victim in all this, but when they revealed she was setting things up, just wow."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I felt so sick when that happened. The whole movie I was feeling so much sympathy for Emma, and then when the reveal happened I felt just like Ethan's character."
"__MOVIES__ Did the movie scare you? There were some horrifying moments in there, like the supposed dreams."
"__MOVIES__ That old lady creeped me out, actually all the towns people just seem so off."
"__MOVIES__ I was really unsettled by the rituals and the sacrifices. I had to really gather to process what was going on."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the sacrifices were really something else. It's a hard movie to watch. Actually it reminds me of the brutal crime stories from the 90's."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean? I think the movie sets place in the late 80's early 90's actually."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's what they were going for. In the 80's cults were really a big thing so many of the horror and crime stories revolved around that."
"__MOVIES__ I see, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah Regression felt a lot like those older crime and mystery movies. I really did enjoy the movie as well as Ethan and Emma's performances."
"__MOVIES__ It reminded me of a movie called Deliver Us From Evil except the supernatural element wasn't really present in Regression."
"__MOVIES__ That's the Eric Bana and Olivia Munn movie right? I agree, I feel with Regression they really left the supernatural element up to the viewer."
"__MOVIES__ Well I don't think there was an evil presence, I think it was all sort of staged and set up. When Emma confesses about it all, it seem obvious the town was just upside down."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I feel like there was something there because why else would Ethan have those haunting nightmares. I think there has to be somewhat of an evil presence or it wouldn't make a lot of sense."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought of it like that. I think I'll have to go back and give Regression a second watch to see for myself."
