"__MUSIC__ Did you know there are glam metal bands in Asia?"
"__MUSIC__ No kidding?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. and it's a relatively new thing. They still play and release albums and so on. They're popular in Korea, Japan etc."
"__MUSIC__ How do they sound though?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty sad and lame."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha. knew they couldn;t be that good. Glam is so old and the sound was pretty even in the 80s"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the glam rock in Asia is not at all liek the ones we had in the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ No>?. What are they like then?"
"__MUSIC__ They're just weird. They wear period clothings."
"__MUSIC__ What's period clothings?"
"__MUSIC__ like clothing White people wore back in the 19th century.With wide ruffles on their shirts, and things."
"__MUSIC__ That's just so weird. Why would they think that's cool?"
"__MUSIC__ Who knows. And the sound theyhave ranges from flat out lame rock/pop mix to some weird fusion metal thing"
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound at all appealing."
"__MUSIC__ I think they're popular among girl fans in Asia"
"__MUSIC__ Probably just because of their appearances."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. But it's a niche market thing it seems to me."
"__MUSIC__ Give some people what they want, make money, stay in business, etc"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Glam, even in the US, was never about music to begin with anyway. If they like it, so be it. I wouldn't buy their albums."
