"__BASEBALL__ Did you catch the Mets game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I was busy at work. How did it go?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Mets won, 5-0. It was a complete shutout."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the Mets have been doing really well this season."
"__BASEBALL__ I've actually got tickets to see one of their games next weekend."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, really? What day?"
"__BASEBALL__ Saturday. It's in the afternoon, so it should be a great game for the kids too."
"__BASEBALL__ That sounds like a fun family day."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the kids are really excited. My wife, not so much, but you know how it is."
"__BASEBALL__ Actually, my wife is really a bigger Mets fan than I am."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? Have you and she gone to any games yet this season?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but she keeps on bugging me to go. I think she might just give up and buy tickets without me."
"__BASEBALL__ No, you should go too--they're really good this season, it would be fun."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I've been really busy at work lately but it's dying down now, so I think I can make the time."
"__BASEBALL__ We should go together with our families sometime."
"__BASEBALL__ That would be fun! I'll check with my wife when we're free."
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds good. I'll email you a list of games so we can coordinate."
"__BASEBALL__ That would be great. Have fun on Saturday!"
"__BASEBALL__ We will! See you at a game soon."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, see you soon."
