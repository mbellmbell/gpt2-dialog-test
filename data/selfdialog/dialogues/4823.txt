"__MUSIC__ Were you ever a fan of Lil Kim?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to place her. What was one of her songs?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Magic Stick' was a popular one back in 2003."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that one I think! I know that I've seen the music video."
"__MUSIC__ Yea I like some of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Her real name is actually Kimberly Jones. Kind of average."
"__MUSIC__ Right but I'm sure that wasn't a good stage name."
"__MUSIC__ You know what's sad though?"
"__MUSIC__ What is that?"
"__MUSIC__ She ended up bleaching her skin to appear white."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my goodness why?"
"__MUSIC__ Apparently she's always been insecure about her physical appearance."
"__MUSIC__ I had no idea. She was beautiful before dying her skin."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I agree."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of her fans are angry I bet."
"__MUSIC__ Yes they are. Especially her African American fans."
"__MUSIC__ Right, I can see that."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine because it looks like she was embarrassed to have dark skin."
"__MUSIC__ I get that. How sad."
"__MUSIC__ It really is. I wish my skin was darker."
