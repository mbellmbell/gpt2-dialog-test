"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ You mean like Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't really listened to Metallica in a long time.  They kind of lost me in the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean, I didn't really follow them after Load.  But I really liked the black one."
"__MUSIC__ That was the one that turned me off.  I got a little worried with And Justice for All, but the black album really turned me off."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?  There were some great songs on that album."
"__MUSIC__ If you like that sort of thing, then sure, it was ok.  But if you go back an listen to Master of Puppets you will hear a very different band."
"__MUSIC__ Back in the 80s?  Is that what you like, the 80s metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I do like 80s metal, both speed metal like Metallica or Meghadeath, and hair metal like Motley Crue and Poison."
"__MUSIC__ I remember those guys, it is all kind of classic rock now."
"__MUSIC__ It is, but there are still metal bands putting out great new music, both older bands like Iron Maiden and newer bands like Hammerfall and Dragonforce."
"__MUSIC__ You mean the guys from Guitar Hero?  That song was so hard."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Dragonforce had a song on Guitar Hero, but they also have a bunch of albums out and tour all over the world."
"__MUSIC__ But I never hear anything about these bands."
"__MUSIC__ That is because they never really got popular in the United States.  But they are pretty popular everywhere else, especially Europe."
"__MUSIC__ Are they European bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are mostly from Europe, though there are some American bands that play that kind of music."
"__MUSIC__ How do you stay connected to the metal scene in Europe."
"__MUSIC__ The bands and their fans are really good with keeping great content on the internet, so fans like me can keep up."
