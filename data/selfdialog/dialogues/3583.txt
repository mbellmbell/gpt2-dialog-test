"__MUSIC__ You know, sometimes I wish I could go to another time period so that I could have their music as mine."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? What time period would you go to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I am not 100% sure, I just know I do not like the music that is put out today as much."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I can understand that."
"__MUSIC__ Well what time period would you go to?"
"__MUSIC__ Easy, I would go back to the 70's and early 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Who is your top band from that time period."
"__MUSIC__ There are so many, do I have to choose just one?"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, top three."
"__MUSIC__ I can do that. Journey, the Eagles, and the Carpenters."
"__MUSIC__ Now, I could listen to a steady diet of that."
"__MUSIC__ Especially Journey. They are timeless."
"__MUSIC__ True, I think people know there songs as much today as they did back then."
"__MUSIC__ I know that my nieces and nephews still love Journey."
"__MUSIC__ I am sure that you helped them into them."
"__MUSIC__ Well maybe a little good music education happened. So what time period if you had to choose?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say probably the 50's and 60's."
"__MUSIC__ Why so?"
"__MUSIC__ I love that kind of band,  harmony, early rock and roll sound."
"__MUSIC__ I would really enjoy that kind of music too."
