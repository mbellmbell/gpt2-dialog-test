"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you looking forward to the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In a way, yes, but over the last few years I've lost some interest in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?  You used to be such a die hard fan for years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The problem is the way the NFL has marketed the game on TV."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean with all the commercials?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a big part of it.  The games now go on for 3 hours or more and I tend to lose interest unless it's really tight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean.  Most people don't want to spend 3 hours watching a football game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was watching a game last year and realized that it was like 3 or 4 plays and then a series of commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  And then it starts over again - a few plays and then more commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you figure that the game is only 60 minutes, not including time outs, the commercials take up way more time than the game itself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it's all about making money for the NFL and the teams.  The commercials pay the bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's like a catch 22 problem for the NFL.  The bigger salaries require more commericals which allow them to pay bigger salaries which require more commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't you just DVR the game and skip through the commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I tried doing that but it's not the same experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean because you already know the outcome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  It's just not the same as watching it live."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So are you still going to watch some of the games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure.  But I'll be selective and if the game is not interesting I just won't sit through all those commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know others who have given up on the NFL because of so many commercials on TV?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do know a few but the NFL has a problem with the fan base and the solution is not easy."
