"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Hamilton? I'm obsessed."
"__MUSIC__ Heard it! I've memorized it."
"__MUSIC__ Even Act 2? Act 2 is so tragic!"
"__MUSIC__ It is, but I memorized it all. I can't sing Burn without bursting into tears."
"__MUSIC__ The one that gets me is One Last Time. Christopher Jackson's George Washington was so comforting and noble."
"__MUSIC__ He was brilliant, but what about Daveed Diggs?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh you mean Mr. Jefferson? I love him!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I loved him as Lafayette and as Thomas Jefferson."
"__MUSIC__ He could honestly do a one man Hamilton and I would watch ever second."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, those Schuyler sisters are fierce! Angelica is my favourite."
"__MUSIC__ I like Eliza. The way Lin wrote the songs Helpless and Satisfied to show two different perspectives on the same moment was genius."
"__MUSIC__ Literally, genius."
"__MUSIC__ You know who I really loved though? John Laurens."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Laurens! Never straying from his dedication to free the slaves."
"__MUSIC__ He was so brave to fight for that cause when so many people around him were against it."
"__MUSIC__ When he sings, 'But we'll never be truly free, until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me.'"
"__MUSIC__ That was so beautiful. And so true."
"__MUSIC__ I can't stop singing it. I'm getting weird looks in public."
"__MUSIC__ In public?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the other day I broke into a full song and dance with Wait for It in the bread aisle at the grocery store."
