"__STAR_WARS__ I love the Star Wars movies. Would you also consider yourself a fan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Absolutely and I love all of the movies. Do you have a favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say Empire Strikes Back. I just think it was the best all around."
"__STAR_WARS__ Empire is actually my second pick, next to Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not a bad choice, but what makes Return of the Jedi number one in your eyes?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Jedi was just a great way to close the saga, we got to see the return of Anakin, and the acting was completely on par."
"__STAR_WARS__ While I do not disagree, I just feel Empire Strikes Back gave the fans more of what they wanted. It had a little bit of everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not disagree with that one bit, but I just feel it's so popular because of the big 'Father bombshell.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose we can agree to disagree in a friendly way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course. Despite our favorite being a little different, neither of us can disagree on the fact that Star Wars overall is an amazing film series."
