"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready to watch the Dolphins lose again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, my Dolphins are still the only team to go undefeated for an entire season and win the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was way back in 1972, they haven't even been to the Super Bowl since 1985."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They lost it in 1985 and also in 1983, but at least they made it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess they were a good team back then, but they have been struggling ever since."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dan Marino was a great quarterback, but he never got them to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the real reason they were undefeated back in '72 was because of Shula."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Don Shula may have been the greatest coach ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Bob Griese was the quarterback the year they were undefeated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was, but he broke his ankle in week 5 an was out for most of the season after that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't know that, who replaced him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was Earl Morrall that helped them to remain undefeated for the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well hopefully Miami will one day be as great a team as they were back then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope they will within the next few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It must be hard watching them struggle to even make the playoffs every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have to get good enough to beat the Patriots, or they will never make it to a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots are a hard team to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will still be rooting for the Dolphins every year, even if they can't seem to make it to the final game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand team loyalty, I wish the best for you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is going to be the year that Miami finally makes it to the Super Bowl again, and wins it."
