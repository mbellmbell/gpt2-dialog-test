"__DISNEY__ My girlfriend said the weirdest thing yesterday."
"__DISNEY__ What was it?"
"__DISNEY__ She reckons 'The Fox and The Hound' is the best Disney movie ever made."
"__DISNEY__ Well she's right about that."
"__DISNEY__ What?"
"__DISNEY__ That film taught me about friendship and also about the inevitability of outgrowing childhood friends."
"__DISNEY__ That's so bleak."
"__DISNEY__ No, it's also got important messages about accepting people's differences."
"__DISNEY__ Doesn't the hound kill the fox in the end."
"__DISNEY__ Nope, Copper saves Tod from being shot, because despite their differences, they will always be best friends."
