"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you do a Fantasy Football draft like this every year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, or at least the last few. It's fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm. I'm no good at these sorts of things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just not knowledgable about football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could study!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. Last year I had one of my students help me pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did that go well?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's too bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was still fun though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could give you some advice?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. What've you got"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, first, if you want to study, you should look at the statistics."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any specific ones?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just go team by team. Maybe start with the ones that made the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. That makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, just look at who was good last year and guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I can do that. An NFL fantasy draft doesn't have to be intimidating!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really doesn't!"
