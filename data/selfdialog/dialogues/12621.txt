"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you want to go to any of the Rams home games this year with me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love to go to a Rams game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great, which game do you prefer to go to?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely a game against the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that should be good, but it will probably be a blowout win for the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they are a much better team than the Rams are right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a game versus the 49ers would be close though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I want to at least see a potential Superbowl team play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand, so Rams versus Seahawks it is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we just need to make sure we are both available that day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, we could also go tailgate and invite some others."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like a lot of fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be, the last time we tailgated before a game it was amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish I went that time, but I had to work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No worries, this time we'll have you around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ By the way are you planning to go to multiple games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, I want to go to the game against the Cardinals too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, that could be a good game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but mainly because my wife is a Cardinals fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, well it's cool she's interested in going to a game as well, my wife doesn't like going to games that much."
