"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see you're wearing an Arizona Cardinals shirt.  You ready for the season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I cannot wait!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think it's going to be Fitzgerald's last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. He seems to be super-human he may last forever. What do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody's super-human. He's getting up there in age.  This may be it for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If so, he will be missed. He's so fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. right?  How great was that Superbowl game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Such a heartbreaking ending.  We should have won it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe this will be their year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be awesome, but there are some great teams.  I guess we'll wait and see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I hope our defense can step it up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody's better that Patrick Peterson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's awesome to watch him guarding a receiver.  He's on them like glue!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know!  The QB sometimes just ignores that receiver and throws to someone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes it tough for the offence to pretty much lose a player for the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep!  I just hope nobody gets hurt!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That seems to be how the Cardinals roll."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is.  I tell you we could have won it all 2 years ago if we didn't have all of our defense on injured reserve."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree.  Here's hoping we don't have that problem this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fingers crossed!"
