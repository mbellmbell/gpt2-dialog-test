"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When does training camp start for the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In two weeks, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool. I can't wait for the start of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are you pulling for this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am liking the Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carolina? Did they have a good draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they did okay, but they had some key players hurt last year, which cost them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they went from the Super Bowl to the toilet bowl last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on, it wasn't there fault. Like I said, they had some injuries to key people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are you picking this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots to repeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not very original, everyone is picking New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My pick doesn't have to be 'original'...maybe 'everyone' knows what they are talking about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, fair enough. Let see if they stay healthy all year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but every team has that concern."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did the Patriots pick up anyone good in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tough to say. They lost some key picks due to 'Deflategate'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. I remember now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will see if their picks lower in the draft order pan out."
