"__DISNEY__ Who's your favorite sidekick in The Little Mermaid, Flounder or Sebastian?"
"__DISNEY__ I like Flounder because it's so cute how anxious he is."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. It seems like Sebastian is anxious in his own way as well."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. He was overbearing, but his heart was in the right place."
"__DISNEY__ I love when he sings the song Under the Sea to convince Ariel about how great the ocean is."
"__DISNEY__ That is the best song in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I can't even remember any of the other ones."
"__DISNEY__ Me either. Didn't Ursula sing a song sometime?"
"__DISNEY__ Hm. Now that you say that it does ring a bell."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I remember now. It was Poor Unfortunate Souls."
