"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the Raiders moving to Las Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's really disappointing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you have been a Raider fan ever since they moved back to Oakland"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like the ownership really didn't make any effort to stay in Oakland and I think its a crummy way to treat such a loyal fanbase"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they paid good money to Carr to keep him for the future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think he's great and hopefully we can make the most of the remaining time they have in Oakland"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the acquisition of Marshawn Lynch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Beastmode! I think it's aweosme."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was a great move for your team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought it was so cool that he said he would only to come play for us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always respect a player who wants to come back to his hometown and show some love to the hometown fans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its cuz the Raiders have the best fans in the league!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some people would beg to differ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's just because they haven't been to a game.  The fans are really loyal, but we're also really cool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Black Hole?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, we're the only team without a mascot.  The fans are the mascot for the Raiders.  The Black Hole is amazing.  People only think they're scary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think you'll stay a fan after the move?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't really see that happening.  I feel like the only people that will attend the Vegas games are fans of the visiting teams who also wanted a vacation, and guests of corporate bigwigs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think Vegas will kinda suck the soul out of the team and the fanbase."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least my Sundays will be a lot more free in the fall!"
