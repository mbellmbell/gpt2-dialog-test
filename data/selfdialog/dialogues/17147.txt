"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Adam Sandler movie?"
"__MOVIES__ This might sound weird, but Punch Drunk Love is my favorite of his."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that film in years but you're right, it was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a drama with some subtle, dysfunctional comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Philip Seymour Hoffman has played a lot of weird roles but his mattress man role was even weird for him."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you really start to feel sorry for Sandler's character because almost everyone around him treats him like garbage, especially the mattress man."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, or just flat out tries to take advantage of him."
"__MOVIES__ Who played the British girl? His love interest, I forget her name."
"__MOVIES__ Emily Watson."
"__MOVIES__ That's right, she's been in a bunch of good films."
"__MOVIES__ What up with the pudding obsession anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ Frequent flyer miles dude, he was the first extreme couponer."
"__MOVIES__ Personally Billy Madison is my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a funny movie. Norm MacDonald and then Steve Buscemi comes out of nowhere to save the day."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't the pretty teacher married to Pete Sampras in real life?"
"__MOVIES__ They are still married. Have been for a long time now."
"__MOVIES__ You know Happy Gilmore kind of disappointed me. I've never been a big fan."
"__MOVIES__ What about the fight with Bob Barker?"
"__MOVIES__ That's definitely the best part of the entire movie."
"__MOVIES__ Bob ends up kicking Happy's butt pretty good doesn't he?"
