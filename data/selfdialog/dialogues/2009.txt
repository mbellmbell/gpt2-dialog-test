"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to music from the Big Band era?"
"__MUSIC__ You're talking like the 1940s?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, more like the 20s and 30s."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess that kind of answers your question!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, being off by a decade or two probably means you're not a big fan."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard some Big Band songs in movies and things like that, but never sought it out."
"__MUSIC__ It's actually a pretty interesting genre of music, believe it or not."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty much jazz pop music."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, jazz as a genre of music evolved in America around the turn of the century and early 1900s."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I know a little about the history of jazz."
"__MUSIC__ And there were a few different styles of jazz. And Big Band gradually evolved from jazz."
"__MUSIC__ So, was Big Band jazz, or was it not jazz."
"__MUSIC__ It would be considered jazz at its root, but all in all it's not quite the same thing."
"__MUSIC__ What makes it different?"
"__MUSIC__ Musically, it's a little simpler, and the improvisation factor is largely gone."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, yeah, I know that jazz is famous for improvisation."
"__MUSIC__ Big Band was basically jazz made more palatable for the masses."
"__MUSIC__ A pattern which has played out in music over and over throughout the years."
