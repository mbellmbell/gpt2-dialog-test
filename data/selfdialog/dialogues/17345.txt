"__MOVIES__ So I heard some news you're just going to love."
"__MOVIES__ Hit me with it."
"__MOVIES__ There's apparently a new trailer out for Pitch Perfect 3."
"__MOVIES__ You're kidding me."
"__MOVIES__ Nope, they made yet another one."
"__MOVIES__ Why?  This story is old.  Just let it go!"
"__MOVIES__ Sorry Elsa, they ain't letting go."
"__MOVIES__ They only did this because the second one make a lot of cash."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  And they are cheap to make."
"__MOVIES__ What's the premise of this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Not sure yet, haven't seen the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ I would guess a lot more scat jokes and fat jokes at Amy's expense."
"__MOVIES__ Probably.  It worked the first two times."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ All the original cast, they're all back again I believe."
"__MOVIES__ This just sounds dreadful.  I don't even want to watch the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ It's probably one of those movies you'll have to see though because everybody else will see it."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I just hate that I have to do that to remain socially relevant."
"__MOVIES__ You're a brave man."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  Buy my ticket for me, please."
