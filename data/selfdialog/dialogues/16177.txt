"__ROCK__ Hey man you like rock music I've been trying to find a good band to listen to."
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah, I love rock music. I take it you are looking for something more modern and not the classics right?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah. Don't get me wrong I love AC/DC, Iron Madien, and what not but I want something fresh."
"__ROCK__ I got to be honest with you, most of the rock bands of the 2000's except for a small few just didn't stand up to the oldies."
"__ROCK__ Which small few?"
"__ROCK__ Well you had system of a down, shine down, 30 seconds to mars, and maybe creed. Other than that I can't recommend any."
"__ROCK__ You see thats my exact problem. No one new has that rock sound that I love. It's all a different sound and most least unappealing."
"__ROCK__ I agree whole heartedly with you, I guess we will have to wait until a band brings the sound we like."
"__ROCK__ It doesn't seem like that is going to happen."
"__ROCK__ Have some faith, they have some good modern ock songs out there."
