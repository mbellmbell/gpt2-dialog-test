"__ACTION__ So, what are some of your favorite action movies?"
"__ACTION__ Well, I for sure have to mention the films of John Woo.  there's so many, it's hard to pick just one."
"__ACTION__ Oh, yeah, he's awesome!"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I liked The Killer, Hard Boiled, Face/Off, Hard Target, there's just so many cool scenes in each of them."
"__ACTION__ I've always like the whole 'guy with two guns' thing he does in each film"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, that's awesome.  Oh, and Mission Impossible 2 was good, although I'm told Cruise interfered a lot with the final cut of the film."
"__ACTION__ I liked that movie, although I did think that ending part was a little bit cheesy.  You know they way Ethan Hunt kicks the sand and the gun flys STRAIGHT up into his hand, like it was just levitating or something."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I admit, that part was a little over the top, but still, that's what you go to action movies for, right?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, true.  Oh, interesting not, do you know the hospital in The Killer is called the Scared Heart? I think it was supposed to be Sacred Heart, but someone must have goofed on that."
"__ACTION__ Oh, man, I never noticed that!  I gotta re-watch that film now!"
