"__MUSIC__ So what kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Punk and hardcore mostly, what about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Same! Can't you see my jacket with the Black Flag and Misfits patches?`"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, I noticed. But there aren't many great punk or hardcore bands still around making new music."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, its mostly just the old timers."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, there's a band called Pissed Jeans that is amazing, but bands like that are few and far between this days."
"__MUSIC__ I wish there would be another punk rock renaissance, it would be so great."
"__MUSIC__ It's unlikely to happen, kids today are too complacent and apathetic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, too much time spent face down looking at the smartphone."
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen any old school bands performing live recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I saw The Damned in Los Angeles in April."
"__MUSIC__ Damn, they are old! How'd they play?"
"__MUSIC__ They were still amazing! Dave Vanian can still sing his butt off!"
"__MUSIC__ I bet, I love the Machine Gun Etiquette album."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's an amazing record, as is the self-titled and the Black Album."
"__MUSIC__ Ah yes I forgot about the Black Album! I need to spin that one again soon."
"__MUSIC__ Who else do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh you know the usual- Black Flag, Misfits, Bad Religion, UK Subs, Ramones, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, although I would definitely add The Clash to that list!"
"__MUSIC__ Of course!"
