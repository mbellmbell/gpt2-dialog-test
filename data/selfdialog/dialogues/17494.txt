"__MOVIES__ I just watched 21 Jump Street."
"__MOVIES__ The movie or the TV show?"
"__MOVIES__ The movie."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good, a lot better than I expected."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I'm usually not a fan of the TV show movie adaptations."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they don't take themselves seriously and it's not heavy like the TV show, at all."
"__MOVIES__ So it's a comedy then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, very much so."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are the leads."
"__MOVIES__ I like Hill a lot. Seems like an odd combo though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they play that up quite a bit."
"__MOVIES__ So is it like the show where they go undercover into high school?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that parts the same."
"__MOVIES__ Both those guys seem a little old for high school."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed they are and that gets pointed out quite a bit."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty funny, think I might check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You should, it will provide a few chuckles."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I'm always on the lookout for something funny."
