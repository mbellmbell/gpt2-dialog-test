"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, what's up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not much, can't wait for NFL this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah me too. You're a Patriots fan, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes sir, we NFL champions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was a pretty amazing Superbowl. What do you say to everyone that says Patriots are cheaters?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, well they were not cheating in the Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am talking about the deflategate situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was totally fake. There wasn't any evidence of that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, I don't know what happened there. They were accused of deflating balls or something during important games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Something like that. But they denied the accusations. There was an investigation and everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think the investigation was very public."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it wasn't. How do you substantiate those claims?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if there are accusations of something that crazy, you can't think they just came out of thin air can you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that given the Patriots success, it is not unbelievable that others are jealous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha whatever, I just know a lot of my friends think they are cheaters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's assume they cheated. You can't deny Tom Brady and Bob Belichick's pure skill."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That I will agree with. But if they cheated their accomplishments are tainted, in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. I think they are the greatest NFL pair of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see if they win any more championships."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can assure you, they will, man."
