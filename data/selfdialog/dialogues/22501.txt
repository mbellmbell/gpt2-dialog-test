"__DISNEY__ DId you watch Disney's last Herbie movie?"
"__DISNEY__ The one with Lindsay Lohan?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Herbie Fully Loaded. I watched it recently for the first time and although it wasn't a really good movie overall, I had a lot of fun watching it."
"__DISNEY__ It did a decent job of paying homage to the original Herbie movies. I think some of the modern takes didn't really sit well with modern audiences that wanted more nostalgia from Disney for Herbie."
"__DISNEY__ I thought the special effects they did for Herbie was really cool. I don't know what long time Herbie fans expected."
"__DISNEY__ I can't speak for them but I remember wanting less of the teen drama and more Herbie!"
"__DISNEY__ More racing scenes would have been great, but I think they provided enough and the ones they did provide, were excellent!"
"__DISNEY__ Did you like Herbie's love interest? That other bug, the modern one."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was a little corny, but I didn't really mind it. I liked Lindsay in there too."
"__DISNEY__ She did a good job, Michael Keaton was her father remember? Overall it was fun but not one of those legendary memorial Disney films."
