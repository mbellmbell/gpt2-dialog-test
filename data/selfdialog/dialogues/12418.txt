"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the greatest NFL player of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a tough question."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For me it is Joe Montana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's a top 5 QB for sure but not the best player overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay so who would you pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would choose Mike Singletary ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's an intersting selection, why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because he was the key to the best NFL defense of all time and arguably the best NFL team of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to argue with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Buddy Ryan's system was built around his unique abilities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was an amazing defense and Payton and McMahon  gave them enough offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the team that most resembles them would have been the Baltimore Ravens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The linebacker position is realy key to a great defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but great middle linebackers are rare."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about best QBs? who is on your top 5 list?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll go with Montana, Unitas, Marino, Brady, and Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't argue with Brady after last season, but Manning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Manning is a lot like Marino, his best years were on poor teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, and your top ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has to be Joe Montana."
