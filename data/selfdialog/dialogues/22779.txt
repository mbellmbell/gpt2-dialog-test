"__DISNEY__ Did you cry when Mufasa died in The Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course I did, I think everyone did! That was the most tragic scene in movie history next to Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ You know I've never actually seen Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ You've never seen Bambi?! I thought every child was required to be traumatized by that movie."
"__DISNEY__ No for some reason that one got by me. I really want to see The Lion King the musical."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know, it's been running for a while with a lot of success."
"__DISNEY__ I loved that James Earl Jones played an African king the same way he did in Coming to America."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know, that was really fitting. He has the voice for it."
"__DISNEY__ That's for sure. I think there's a Frozen musical isn't there?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I've seen it and it's amazing. Just be prepared to have the songs in your head again for a while."
