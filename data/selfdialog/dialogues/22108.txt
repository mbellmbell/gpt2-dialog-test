"__DISNEY__ Have you seen any of the Toy Story movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I have seen them all. The third one was my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I liked the third one the best, too."
"__DISNEY__ The baby doll with the half open eye creeped me out."
"__DISNEY__ Same here, but I liked that he turned on Lottso at the end."
"__DISNEY__ Did you think the fire scene at the dump was too scary for kids?"
"__DISNEY__ A little bit. But I liked how the toys all held hands and came together as one."
"__DISNEY__ Bonnie was by far my favorite character. She is so cute!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree! So glad Andy picked her to keep all of his toys."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. It was a beautiful ending."
