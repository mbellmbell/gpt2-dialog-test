"__DISNEY__ What Disney movie would you like to watch?"
"__DISNEY__ We can watch Beauty and The Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I haven't seen that yet, was it good?"
"__DISNEY__ It was beautiful! I almost cried I was so moved by it."
"__DISNEY__ Wow. Who is your favorite character?"
"__DISNEY__ Belle, for sure. Emma Watson really grabbed that role and made it her own."
"__DISNEY__ I'd heard that she turned down La La Land, so she could do Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that."
"__DISNEY__ What's funnier is Ryan Gosling was offered the Beast role, but turned it down for La La Land."
"__DISNEY__ Oh wow, that's really something!"
