"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of Kevin Smith?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I like some films more than others but overall he's makes enjoyable flicks."
"__MOVIES__ What do you like about him?"
"__MOVIES__ He has this unique ability to make films that are sure to become cult hits. They have this raw 'independent' vibe, even though many of them have large budgets."
"__MOVIES__ What are you favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is probably Dogma. I think it is his most complete film."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed Red State."
"__MOVIES__ I see. You know, I enjoyed his older work more."
"__MOVIES__ Are you not a fan of horror and thrillers?"
"__MOVIES__ I like thrillers, but I think Smith's strength lies in dialogue and comedic situations."
"__MOVIES__ Well those occur in Tusk and Red State as well."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose you're right, but I think the thriller aspect draws attention from them."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough. I also enjoy Smith's older films. Clerks is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I also think Chasing Amy is very underrated."
"__MOVIES__ Chasing Amy is unique because it's kind of like a romantic comedy designed for a mostly male audience. A very bold idea."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. It's funny how he's able to make thought provoking films like Dogma and Chasing Amy, but also mindless laugh fests like Mall Rats and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."
"__MOVIES__ I can quote almost every line from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back!"
"__MOVIES__ Don't get me wrong, I love those films too. I even love Clerks 2!"
"__MOVIES__ I think we're just fan-boys at this point."
"__MOVIES__ Probably so."
