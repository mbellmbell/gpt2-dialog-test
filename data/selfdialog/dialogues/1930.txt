"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to think of some songs that have to do with dogs."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ My aunt is having a birthday party for her dog and wants to play dog music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. OK."
"__MUSIC__ I know it's weird, but she really loves her dog."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the first couple that pop into my mind are How Much is That Doggie in the Window and Who Let the Dogs Out."
"__MUSIC__ I know the second one, but not the first one."
"__MUSIC__ It's an older song by a singer names Patti Page."
"__MUSIC__ Any more ideas?"
"__MUSIC__ There's Hound Dog, Puppy Love and I'm Gonna Buy Me a Dog."
"__MUSIC__ I'll add those to my list. I was also thinking of using the song Old Yeller."
"__MUSIC__ From the movie?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and I also like The Puppy Song."
"__MUSIC__ Who sings that song?"
"__MUSIC__ Harry Nilsson."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know who he is."
"__MUSIC__ He was around in the 1970s."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think I'm off to a good start with my songs."
"__MUSIC__ I hope you enjoy the party."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks and thanks for helping me."
