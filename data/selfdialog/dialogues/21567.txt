"__DISNEY__ Who was the creepiest Disney villain?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd say it was the Witch Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
"__DISNEY__ 'Mirror mirror on the wall... who's the creepiest of them all?'"
"__DISNEY__ YOU are! You are!"
"__DISNEY__ Hehe, she was definitely freaky."
"__DISNEY__ And made a point of actually poisoning Snow White. That was nasty."
"__DISNEY__ Very true. But she was saved by a handsome price, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, in the end. I would have made more sense if the dwarves saved her."
"__DISNEY__ What were their names? Sleepy and Sneezy and Doc? I can't recall the rest."
"__DISNEY__ Something like that. Weird they didn't play a bigger part in saving her."
