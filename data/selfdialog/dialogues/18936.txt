"__MOVIES__ Are you going to be seeing the new Stephen King movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, doesn't it look good."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't look bad, but it's a remake."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but if you hadn't seen the original, don't you think this would be good?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually think this is one that might be better than the original."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't think the original was that good?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it, but then I read the book."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, after I read the book I realized there was so much more to the story."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I've never read the book."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the movie made it all about Pennywise, but Pennywise wasn't the real evil."
"__MOVIES__ What was?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember the name, but it's an evil that is in a lot of his books."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I read a lot of them have the same connections."
"__MOVIES__ The Pennywise thing shouldn't have overshadowed the main concept."
"__MOVIES__ So what do you think this movie will do differently?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it might actually go into that evil."
"__MOVIES__ What about Pennywise?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he will play a major part, but only a part."
