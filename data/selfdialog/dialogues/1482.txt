"__MUSIC__ So what is new in the music world for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I just got the new album by Lady Gaga named Joanne."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah how did you like it? Where all the songs on the album good or was it hit and miss."
"__MUSIC__ It was consistantly good and I like how she took a bit of a folk Americana aspect to many of the songs."
"__MUSIC__ Nice I have yet to sit down an listen to it but I herd that the new Katty Perry album was shit."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I herd that too, it was just weak and many of the songs not ever worth the time."
"__MUSIC__ That is wild to think because how popular she was in the past with her many EPs and top 40 hits."
"__MUSIC__ Yea like her song Lion, I really liked that song but just feel like she doesn't have the popularity she had in 2010"
"__MUSIC__ Do you know of the indie rock band Thao & The Get Down Stay Down?"
"__MUSIC__ No I have no idea who that is. Tell me about them."
"__MUSIC__ They are a band from San Francisco and released there debut album in 2008 with their most recent album being release in 2013."
"__MUSIC__ So they aren't that current, What sort of music do they perform?"
"__MUSIC__ They are very much the typical indie rock group with Thao Ngyen as the lead vocalist and guitarist."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like a band I could very well enjoy. What is your favorite album?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I would have to say the one released in 2008 under the name of We Brave Bee Stings and All."
"__MUSIC__ What an interesting title to an album. Where do they come up with these things."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, may that is the creative side of art, duh."
"__MUSIC__ When was the last time you went to a live show?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was the super indie show in a coffee show in San Francisco a few years back. What about you?"
