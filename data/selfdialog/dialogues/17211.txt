"__MOVIES__ Mark Walhburg is very talented , just watched 'Daddy's Home'"
"__MOVIES__ I seen that, he and Ferrell play well off each other."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, and Walhburg looks good on a bike!"
"__MOVIES__ hahaha no agruement there. Did you see the part where Ferrell tried to ride that motorcycle? Too funny."
"__MOVIES__ The look on Ferrell's face when dude arrives at the airport was priceless."
"__MOVIES__ If I had been him, in that role, I would have felt so ugly."
"__MOVIES__ Did Ferrell do a scene where he is naked at some point running. That is like his trademark."
"__MOVIES__ I can't remember, but he was good in the movie as well."
"__MOVIES__ Its a shame it didn't get more attention in the theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the trailers for 'daddy's Home 2'?"
"__MOVIES__ no, I didn't know they were doing a part 2 ."
"__MOVIES__ You will never guess what they did."
"__MOVIES__ What did they do?"
"__MOVIES__ The trailer shows where they guys' dads come for the holidays. And guess who they got to play the parts?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't even imagine ..."
"__MOVIES__ Mel Gibson is Walhburg's dad and John Lithgow from 3rd rock is Ferell's dad."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is an odd pairing, but could be really funny."
"__MOVIES__ John Lithgow is a hoot and a half in everything he is in."
"__MOVIES__ This is true, and with Ferrell I bet this one has even more physical comedy."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if they considered Steve Martin? He has always been grerat with physical comedy."
