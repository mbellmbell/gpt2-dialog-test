"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! Wasn't it great!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but I would have preferred they make it a little more unique?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved how close they stuck to the original story. What would you have liked to see?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, but it didn't have any surprises, even the songs were the same."
"__DISNEY__ They changed the wording of the songs some, but not a lot.  Don't you think it was good that they didn't completely change them?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess, I just wish it was a little more different than the cartoon."
"__DISNEY__ The cartoon version was one of my favorites when I was little so I was very happy with this one.  Will you buy it when it comes out on DVD?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I didn't like it enough to buy it."
"__DISNEY__ That's too bad, I can't wait to own it!"
