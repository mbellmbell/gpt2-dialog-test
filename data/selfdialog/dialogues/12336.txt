"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think is the greatest game in NFL history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a hard one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know!  There are so many great games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Recently, there were a lot of Brady and Manning games that were good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say the 1993 Monday Night Football Game at Mile High Stadium was the greatest?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was Kansas City versus Denver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Joe Montana versus John Elway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  The game was close the whole way through."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kansas City was down and then Montana led them back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then John Elway led the Broncos down the field to go ahead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then Montana with just over a minute led Kansas City the whole way down the field to win the game in the closing seconds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I didn't think that there was enough time left to do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was back when they didn't throw the ball all up and down the field like they do now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  Do you remember what the announcer said when Montana won the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do.  He said 'Lord take me now.  I've seen it all.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was classic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  It was a showdown between two legends."
