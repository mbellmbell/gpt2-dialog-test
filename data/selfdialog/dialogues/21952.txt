"__DISNEY__ Did you watch The Lion King when you were younger?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course I did. That was the first time I cried in a movie."
"__DISNEY__ Let me guess. The stampede scene made you cry?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that remains to be one of the saddest moments in movie history."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely. I felt so bad for little Simba."
"__DISNEY__ Timon and Pumbaa made it better though."
"__DISNEY__ I totally forgot about Timon and Pumbaa. I used to love them."
"__DISNEY__ Remember when they all ate bugs together?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that part grossed me out when I was younger."
"__DISNEY__ It was the opposite for me. It made me want to try it!"
