"__MOVIES__ Did you see Godzilla?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one? There's like 10."
"__MOVIES__ The new one with Bryan Cranston"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. Saw that when it came out."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I was a bit disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ Whys that?"
"__MOVIES__ The main draw for me was Bryan Cranston since I love breaking bad. But he was barely in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he didn't get much screen time at all."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. The only memorable scene was when he had to say bye to his wife."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the scene from the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ That's not the only reason I was disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ Why else?"
"__MOVIES__ Godzilla was barely in it either!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's why I didn't like it."
"__MOVIES__ I was hoping for tons of scenes of him destroying cities and fighting monsters."
"__MOVIES__ Same. Closest we got was when he was in the city after destroying the tea in or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the backstory about him was cool though."
"__MOVIES__ If they would have went into more detail about him, sure."
"__MOVIES__ I guess. Overall, just disappointing"
