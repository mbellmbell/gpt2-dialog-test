"__POP__ Who is your favorite Pop band?"
"__POP__ Well I know they are also considered rock but I would definitely choose Coldplay."
"__POP__ I really like Coldplay, yeah they are pop-rock but have done a lot of pop songs, as they are a very diverse band."
"__POP__ My recent favorites has to be 'just like this'."
"__POP__ I liked that song as well, but my favorite is 'hymn for the weekend'."
"__POP__ Both are great songs and I love how diverse they are as a band."
"__POP__ They are really diverse from their earlier work, to the more recent experimental rock and pop they have made some excellent music."
"__POP__ The GhostStories album had a different feeling to it but I enjoyed it all the same."
"__POP__ I think one of the things that makes them so diverse is their ability to collaborate with other great artists."
"__POP__ I agree, we even kinda pointed that out earlier with our favorites, being that 'just like this' was a collab with the chain-smokers and  'hymn for the weekend' was a collab with beyonce."
