"__LADY_GAGA__ I  miss Lady Gaga's earlier work."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her early work was good, but her new stuff isn't bad."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's not as good as her early stuff though."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What's your favorite early song?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Either Poker Face or Just Dance.  How bout you?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Are we talking first album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, Papparazi off that album is my favorite."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I will say though that I am glad she's done with the theatrics."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think that may just have to do with growing up a bit as well."
