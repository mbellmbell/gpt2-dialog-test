"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You say that NFL football is your favorite sport to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On television."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not in person?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's o.k. in person, but basketball would be my favorite to go to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why's that; isn't football exciting in person?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but there are too many delays--huddle times mostly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The no huddle offense has changed that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really--the quarterback mainly stands there looking over the defense and calling signals and it's not much faster, unless they are in hurry up mode."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And television?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Instant replay; now instead of sitting there watching nothing, you get to see the play again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And an expert commentator explaining what happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And John Madden getting excited over a lineman's block."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, Madden retired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know; I miss him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, instant replay has changed the game and made you appreciate the subtleties."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do have a problem with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I go to a game, I don't watch carefully, expecting to see it better on replay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, there is jumbotron."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's not the same as a television replay at home, and I even find myself waiting for replay at other events"
