"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What tackle would you take to anchor your line?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tackle?  I'd have to think about that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, don't take too long, the season will be here for before you know it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, I'm ready.  This might be controversial."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm ready for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd go with Tyron Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How is that controversial?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  I just thought you'd say somebody different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, Smith for sure.  He's still so young and seems like he's been in the league forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's nuts he's only 26."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He probably has another decade in front of him still."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys drafted him very young out of USC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only player who echoes him talent wise is Joe Thomas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thomas is so steady and consistent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And he's done it for a decade now.  Just day in and day out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It bites he's on a bad team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Browns have never had talent around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their line is getting better though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they made some good investments there, but Thomas will start regressing soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He needs a good RB to block for."
