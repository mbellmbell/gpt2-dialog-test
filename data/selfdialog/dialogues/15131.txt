"__ACTION__ Hey Tony, let's go to a movie tonight!"
"__ACTION__ Ok. What are you up for?"
"__ACTION__ An action movie!"
"__ACTION__ I do't know. There are so few good ones made anymore."
"__ACTION__ What are you talking about? There are tons of good action movies!"
"__ACTION__ There are tons of action movies, but few have really god character development or interesting plot."
"__ACTION__ What abut the Transformers? That was a good series!"
"__ACTION__ The first one was pretty good, but then Hollywood decided to make all those sequels..."
"__ACTION__ What's wrong with sequels?"
"__ACTION__ They are like new wives: A figment of self-delusion. You fool yourself to think that the next one will be better than the one you were able to get while you were in your prime!"
