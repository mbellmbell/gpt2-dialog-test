"__STAR_WARS__ As insanely popular as the Star Wars movies are, episode one: The Phantom Menace was not a well received film. Why do you think that is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Believe it or not, I don't think I have sat down and watched that entire movie. It just didn't really seem like that big of a must-see film to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see your point in that. I've seen it a couple of times and really don't think there is a ton going on."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was never a huge fan of the idea of seeing such a young Anakin. I understood what they were going for, but it just didn't do much for me."
"__STAR_WARS__ That being said, what kind of problems have you heard about that movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The big things I've heard that hurt the movie are the young actor who plays Anakin is said to have been very 'wooden' and the CGI looks bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those are both problems I've also heard and agree with. I also felt Qui-gon was killed pretty anti-climatically."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have watched that clip of YouTube. The fight scene wasn't bad, but his death came out no where to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed. I think long-time fans who have seen the original, maybe have known it was coming, but it still wasn't very strong."
"__STAR_WARS__ And if memory serves, we never see him again. Not even in a vision or flashback."
