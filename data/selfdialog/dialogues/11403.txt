"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only a little over a month before the NFL season starts. Are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am so excited. It seems like a really long time since the season ended."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I'm even looking forward to the pre-season games which are always bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha! I know what you mean. I'll be watching pre-season also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to be really improved this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't know. It sounds the the KC Chiefs are looking strong and maybe the Houston Texans since they got rid of Osweiler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I forgot about Osweiler. I wonder what he's doing now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's competing for a starting position with the Cleveland Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right. The Texans traded him and lost big bucks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and now the Browns are paying big bucks for a random quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder why they traded for him. He was so lousy last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because he came with a second round draft pick. I read that the Browns wanted the second rounder and Osweiler was just thrown in as an extra."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but why would they want to keep him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They put him on the market but no one was interested so they kept him on to see how he played before pre-season starts. They have to pay him so they may as well see what he can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully this will teach him some humility."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was his biggest problem. He thought he was better than what he was. People learn so he can too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they still have Robert Griffin III? He's gone, isn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they released him. I'm not sure if anyone picked him up. He's been hurt so much during his career, it's probably over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's too bad. Of him and Andrew Luck, I liked RG3 better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. I hope he heals up and plays again."
