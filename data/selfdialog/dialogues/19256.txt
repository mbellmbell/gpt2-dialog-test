"__MOVIES__ I was so sad to hear Robin William killed himself. He was one of the best actors ever."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I loved him in Good Will Hunting."
"__MOVIES__ That was a great movie. It really made you think about letting go of people you love and how you want to live your life."
"__MOVIES__ I loved it when Chuckie told Will if he came over in 20 years to watch a ball game and he was still there, he was going to kill him."
"__MOVIES__ I know and when he said, you got something none of the rest of us have."
"__MOVIES__ Chuckie was a good friend to Will, it is hard to know your friend is better than you and encourage them to be the best they can be."
"__MOVIES__ Especially knowing more than likely you are going to lose that friend to his new life."
"__MOVIES__ I like the part where Chuckie tells him you owe it to me, it would be an insult to us if you are still here in 20 years."
"__MOVIES__ I like the role Robin played to and when he told the story about his wife."
"__MOVIES__ He has something about him that makes you want to protect him."
"__MOVIES__ I have never seen him in a movie that I did not believe he was not that character."
"__MOVIES__ He was so good in Dead Poets Society in 1989."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that movie so much. What about Patch Adams?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, why do I ever get a doctor like that? I wouldn't mind getting a check up every now and then if the doctors acted like they were more caring."
"__MOVIES__ That's for sure. Did you see the movie Awakenings?"
"__MOVIES__ That movie was crazy. It was the first time I really thought maybe drugs can really help people with mental issues."
"__MOVIES__ Really, that's not surprising since you think eating natural foods can cure everything."
"__MOVIES__ Well it doesn't hurt anything. Sad thing is Mrs. Doubtfire is probably his most famous role."
"__MOVIES__ That was a good movie, don't you like it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I like it but he was in so many better ones."
