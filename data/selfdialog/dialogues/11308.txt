"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Buffalo Bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 7 and 9 last season, didnt make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but how do they look this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they didn't get any good draft pics."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did get Anquan Boldin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and he is a good wide reciever but a team needs more than just that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Hopefully it will bring up their stats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, after twelve interceptions last year they need him to work with the QB to reduce those numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll know in 90 or so days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, hopefully they are working on their blockers as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to get their qb up in to Winston class."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HA, i dont see that happening but thats the same problem the bucs have, good QB bad recievers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adolphus Washington needs to keep the rushers awah from their QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Adolphus was crushing it last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was but again, one or two people cant run an entire team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but every bit helps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think of that time Giants crushed them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They played at the old Tampa stadium then, right?"
