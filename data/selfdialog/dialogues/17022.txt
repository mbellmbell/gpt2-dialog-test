"__MOVIES__ Did you see the latest Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Rogue One, you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ That one, yes. The one with no stars or recognizable characters in the plot."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm guessing by your tone that you didn't care for it much."
"__MOVIES__ No, I can't say I cared for it much at all. I think it may have been the worst Star Wars movie yet."
"__MOVIES__ I can't agree with you there, bro. If you watch it without caring about the rest of the Star Wars movies, it's really a great flick."
"__MOVIES__ So what you're saying is it's a great movie that has nothing to do with Star Wars?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I just mean it's not directly connected to the main story you are used to by any major characters."
"__MOVIES__ Okay fine. But I still wasn't drawn into the movie in any case. I mean that movie before it, the one with the droid shaped like a ball, was pretty good, and it wasn't filled with familiarities."
"__MOVIES__ It was the Force Awakens, mister non-fan."
"__MOVIES__ I don't have to be a fan to appreciate a good movie. Maybe you being a fan clouds your judgement, though."
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm pretty sure you are just a Star Wars hater. Do you hate Star Trek, too?"
"__MOVIES__ I love Star Trek. Especially the Next Generation."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, you like TNG more than the original series?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was so much better. I assume you prefer the early crap?"
"__MOVIES__ Crap? Whoah, dude. You have just sinned and you must leave my house immediately."
"__MOVIES__ HAH! Yeah yeah, I get it, you love the original Star Trek."
"__MOVIES__ Dammit, Jim, I'm going to kill you."
"__MOVIES__ What about Deep Space Nine, though?"
"__MOVIES__ Scotty, beam him out of my face."
