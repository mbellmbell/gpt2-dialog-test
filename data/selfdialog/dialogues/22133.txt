"__DISNEY__ My daughter is addicted to Finding Dory. She requests that movie every Friday for movie night."
"__DISNEY__ I agree that it's a great movie. I love Hank. He is so funny!"
"__DISNEY__ At least she's gotten over her Frozen phase. I don't have to listen to 'Let It Go' a billion times anymore."
"__DISNEY__ I hear you. My daughter is now singing Moana songs instead. I guess it's still a refreshing change."
"__DISNEY__ What's the new Disney animated movie that's coming out this year?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's Coco. It's a Pixar film. I think Cars 3 is coming out this year too."
"__DISNEY__ Man, I can't keep track of them anymore. It's nice that Pixar is doing some original stuff."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I was getting a little worried that all they had left were sequels - Cars, Nemo, Monsters Inc."
"__DISNEY__ Those are all great movies for both kids and adults. Some jokes just go right over the kids' heads but the adults laugh."
"__DISNEY__ I think that's what makes those movies so popular. There's something for everyone."
