"__MUSIC__ Have you ever noticed how dying can make a musician more popular?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! After Leonard Cohen died,  a  song of his was featured on the first and last Saturday Night Live shows of the season."
"__MUSIC__ Must of got him new fans. Of course, it's a great song."
"__MUSIC__ Sure. But lots of living musicians write great stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's a wonder their managers don't do them in."
"__MUSIC__ But then they couldn't keep grinding out those hits."
"__MUSIC__ L. Cohen wrote great stuff all his life."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's strange. Poets, like he was, are supposed to peak in their twenties."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, maybe we just like him because he reminds us of our lost youth."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. But then there's all those songs about aging, like Closing Time."
"__MUSIC__ And divorce, like Tower of Song."
"__MUSIC__ Tower of Song's about more than divorce."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe for you it is. I'm still getting divorced."
"__MUSIC__ Well, keep istening to Leonard."
"__MUSIC__ I will. I listened to him alive, and I'll listen to  him now he's dead."
"__MUSIC__ A true fan."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. So are you. He was here for us, through all the phases of our lives."
"__MUSIC__ And now we're old, and his stuff is still here."
"__MUSIC__ Just like we're here for each other."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. Wanna listen to some music?"
