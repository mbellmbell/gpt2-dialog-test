"__FASHION__ So, what do you think about this summers fashion?"
"__FASHION__ Oh, i really like the fact that they're bringing back the off the shoulder looks."
"__FASHION__ Have you seen any of the new sandal trends?"
"__FASHION__ No, i haven't seen any of them yet.  What are the styles this year?"
"__FASHION__ Well, from what I've seen, they're bringing back the gladiator styles."
"__FASHION__ Really?  Like the small ankle high ones?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I've seen the small ankle ones plus the calf length."
"__FASHION__ Oh, i don't like those at all.  They look too busy when you're wearing them."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, if you're not careful with what you pair them with, you could really have a massive train wreck ensemble."
"__FASHION__ I prefer my Birkenstocks over any designer shoe anywhere."
"__FASHION__ Oh, don't you like the fact that the department stores are using actual plus sized models now?"
"__FASHION__ Yes!  Its beyond amazing that people in the upper echelons finally figured out that hardly anyone is a size zero."
"__FASHION__ I'm just glad that they're actually using a plus sized model, like she's a size 14-16."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, usually they call a gal who is a size 8-12 'plus size'.  This is hardly the case."
"__FASHION__ I really appreciate the fashion commercial spots that Target has out there.  They were the first company to use a real woman in their spot."
"__FASHION__ Kinda changes the way I see Target now.  They're doing very well for women nowadays."
"__FASHION__ Want to know what I miss the most?  The long flowing full pesant skirts."
"__FASHION__ Well, you can still wear them! Be your own fashon statement!"
"__FASHION__ Oh i plan on it, I'm just annoyed that I can't purchase any new ones."
"__FASHION__ Well, this summer hopefully will be full of awesome surprises with fun things to wear!"
