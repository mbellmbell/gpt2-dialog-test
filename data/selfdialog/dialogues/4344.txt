"__MUSIC__ I feel like you can't talk about metal without bringing up Slayer."
"__MUSIC__ That's hard to dispute. They're one of the best ever."
"__MUSIC__ Yup. Especially Reign in Blood."
"__MUSIC__ That album was an instant classic."
"__MUSIC__ With songs like Raining Blood and Angel of Death, you bet it was!"
"__MUSIC__ I actually have an older relative who bought the album when it came out."
"__MUSIC__ Now way. That's awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Not to mention that he still has the record to this day. He framed it and put it on his wall."
"__MUSIC__ That's so cool. I'll have to do something like that in the future."
"__MUSIC__ Enough about the past, though. What do you think of their newer albums?"
"__MUSIC__ They're still killing it even at their age."
"__MUSIC__ I wish I could say the same."
"__MUSIC__ You don't like their newer material?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. To me, it just doesn't feel the same."
"__MUSIC__ I loved Repentless. For them being as old as they are, I thought it sounded great."
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was alright. Again, it's just not the same to me."
"__MUSIC__ Is it because of Jeff's passing?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. That left a huge void in the band that I didn't see how they could possibly go on."
"__MUSIC__ I understand that feeling. You should still give them a chance, though."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. I just need to give it time to grow on me."
