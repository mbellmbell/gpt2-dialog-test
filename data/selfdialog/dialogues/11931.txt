"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What NFL division do you think is the toughest out of them all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to go with the AFC West as the strongest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's four teams in the division that could make the playoffs this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really think the Los Angeles Chargers are going to make the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thnk they'll be greatly improved from last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might be better but making the playoffs is a very bold prediction."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So which division do you think will be the strongest this coming year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going to go with the AFC South as the toughest division in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good choice, I think the AFC South is the very strong as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jacksonville kind of lowers the rating of the division but the rest of the teams are all going to be fighting for the division championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are think is going to win the AFC South in 2017?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My opinion is that the Indianapolis Colts will take it in 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think Andrew Luck is going to do this year for the Colts?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should have his usual numbers but I like Indianapolis' offensive line protecting Andrew Luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah not enough is said for a strong offensive line. The quarterback gets all the glory but the offensive line makes it all possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The thing I don't like about the Colts is their defense. Their defense was terrible last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The way I see it, they can't possibly be worse so if they're just slightly better, then the Colts have a good shot to win the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Colts don't win, who is your second choice to win the AFC South?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd probably go with Houston repeating as division champs."
