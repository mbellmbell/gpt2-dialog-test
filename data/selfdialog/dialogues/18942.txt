"__MOVIES__ Hey, So I just saw this movie and I think you´ll find very interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Really which one? What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It´s called Nerve. You can watch it now on Netflix. It´s about a dangerous online game."
"__MOVIES__ Online game? How could that be dangerous?"
"__MOVIES__ No seriously it is, you have to watch it to understand. It´s a kinda of truth or dare, but pretty only dares."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok, then I do understand, that could get pretty dangerous."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it but once you see it, I would like your opinion about it."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you want my opinion of it, if you said you already liked it?"
"__MOVIES__ Because I´m critical of movies and even though I liked it, some parts did not looked very real."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see. Don't worry then, I will see it this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Yes you should, it has very good young actors."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really, like whom?"
"__MOVIES__ Emma Roberts, Dave Franco."
"__MOVIES__ Emma Roberts? Isn´t that Julia Roberts niece?, I guess I will like it then."
"__MOVIES__ Yes you will. If you like this actress then, you should also see the movie We´re the Millers, it´s very funny."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know, I already saw it, plus I also love how Jennifer Aniston acts."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Is there any special movie you could also recommend of Jennifer Aniston?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes definitely, Mother´s Day, Just Go with it, The Bounty Hunter, Marley & Me.. there are many good ones."
"__MOVIES__ Which one do you recommend, and why?"
"__MOVIES__ Watch Marly & Me, if you love or like dogs, this one will sure make you cry."
