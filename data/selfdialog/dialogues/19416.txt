"__MOVIES__ I was chatting with my uncle about underrated movies the other day, and his answers really surprised me."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of movies was he talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for a while he was talking about Alphaville."
"__MOVIES__ Never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a French sci-fi film directed by Jean-Luc Godard."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's also kind of noirish. There's this city called Alphaville, and a secret agent is trying to destroy it."
"__MOVIES__ Destroy the whole city?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, a computer that controls everyone in the city. It's a dystopian noir sort of thing."
"__MOVIES__ Got it. That actually sounds pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ I think it would have more of a reputation over here if it wasn't a foreign language film."
"__MOVIES__ That does happen sometimes. Did he mention any others?"
"__MOVIES__ He mentioned a more recent Japanese film called 'Confessions'."
"__MOVIES__ What's that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ Two students at an elementary school murder their teacher's daughter, and she takes revenge on them."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds dark."
"__MOVIES__ It is. It's also shot in a really haunting series of blue tones. It's a strange movie."
"__MOVIES__ But it's worth watching?"
"__MOVIES__ They both are!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll add them to the list!"
