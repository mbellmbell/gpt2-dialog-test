"__FASHION__ Hi!  What are you doing today?"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure.  I have a bit of free time today."
"__FASHION__ Do you want to go shopping?"
"__FASHION__ Sure.  Where do you want to meet up?"
"__FASHION__ Let's meet at the mall.  I need a new dress."
"__FASHION__ Ok.  I'll see you there in about 20 minutes."
"__FASHION__ I'm glad you were able to meet me."
"__FASHION__ No problem.  I have nothing else to do."
"__FASHION__ Good, you can help me pick out a dress to wear to my cousin's wedding."
"__FASHION__ Oh, I love weddings."
"__FASHION__ Me too! This wedding should be much fun, but I feel I need a new fashionable dress to wear to the event."
"__FASHION__ I totally understand."
"__FASHION__ Let's go into this store.  I see some cute dresses."
"__FASHION__ How about this dress.  I like the soft material and it's strapless.  It will be perfect for the wedding."
"__FASHION__ I like the color and style, but I'm not fond of strapless dresses. Do you see anything that is cute, sleeveless, but not strapless."
"__FASHION__ Oh, this one is totally cute.  Do you like the stripes?"
"__FASHION__ I love the stripes!  This is it and they have my size."
"__FASHION__ Try it on!"
"__FASHION__ Too cute.  I'm getting this one, what do you think?"
"__FASHION__ I love it.  You'll be the best dressed at the wedding-besides the bride of course!"
