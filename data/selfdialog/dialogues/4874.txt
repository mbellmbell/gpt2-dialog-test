"__MUSIC__ Sometimes in the summer, when radio reception is good, I like to do what I used to do when i was a kid."
"__MUSIC__ I'm afraid to ask. And what's a radio?"
"__MUSIC__ Late at night, during summer vacation, I would lie in bed with earphones and slowly tune the radio from end to end."
"__MUSIC__ Trying to pick up far away, weird station?"
"__MUSIC__ Right. We lived in Los Angeles, and mostly you could get Texas stations and that's about as far away as you could get."
"__MUSIC__ Lot of country music, I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Glen Campbell's 'Wichita Lineman' had just come out. And Johnny Cash."
"__MUSIC__ 'Folsom Prison', 'Man In Black', 'A Boy Named Sue'? I remember those."
"__MUSIC__ When I worked in northern Wisconsin, I had a 1979 Chevy Malibu with an antenna built into the WINDSHIELD."
"__MUSIC__ It came from the factory like that? Could you hear any strange stations with that?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there was a tiny station in Manistique, Michigan, I think, WRPP. They came on at 4 am, with a ROOSTER crowing."
"__MUSIC__ What music did they play?"
"__MUSIC__ That's just it. It was a tiny station with a wide variety of old, obscure records lying around."
"__MUSIC__ They'd just reach over and grab something to fill the airtime?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, they were so square they were unbelievably hip and cutting edge. I'd never heard a lot of those sounds before."
"__MUSIC__ What songs did they play?"
"__MUSIC__ I heard 'Little Green Bag', 'Talk, Talk', 'My Little Red Book', 'Paper Tiger'. All kinds of obscure songs."
"__MUSIC__ Go on. What else? I think 'Paper Tiger' was a weird forgotten song from 1965."
"__MUSIC__ They'd play 'Beans In My Ears', probably the Serendipity Singers version, then a Sinatra song, then the 15 minute 'Here Comes The Sun' by Richie Havens!"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like a trip. I'd like to hear some old tapes from that station."
