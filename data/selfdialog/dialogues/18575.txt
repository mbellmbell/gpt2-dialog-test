"__MOVIES__ Hey did you see the titanic 2 movie trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ What? Titanic 2? How can there be Titanic 2? didn't the titanic sink in first movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I was also surprised when I heard it for the first time."
"__MOVIES__ So are you serious that there is titanic 2 coming?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure but I definitely see the trailer of titanic 2 and it was not fan made?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so did you get any idea about story of titanic 2 from the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, all I can see is that jack is coming back."
"__MOVIES__ What? seriously? Didn't he die in last movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it seems they are bringing him back. It seems like its going to be a love story between returned jack and rose."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds so absurd! I feel that this whole titanic 2 is a really bad idea."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I hope the producer and director is not stupid enough to actually make titanic 2."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they did make trailer of titanic 2, which means they are giving it a serious thought."
"__MOVIES__ That would be really foolish if they do actually make titanic 2."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know what's going on with directors and producers these days."
"__MOVIES__ I still can't believe they are actually thinking about making titanic 2!!"
"__MOVIES__ okay, too much about titanic 2. Let's talk about something else."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. so any new love story in theater?"
"__MOVIES__ As far as I know there isn't any going on in theater right now."
"__MOVIES__ That's strange. Let me guess, Is the theater flooded by superhero movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you guessed it right, It's superhero movies all over!"
