"__DISNEY__ What was the last Disney movie you saw?"
"__DISNEY__ I just saw Disney's Beauty and the Beast!"
"__DISNEY__ How did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ It was really good actually! I wasn't expecting much from it."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you say that?"
"__DISNEY__ Because I was a fan of the original animated version. So I didn't think it would transfer over that well."
"__DISNEY__ Yea? How did everything feel in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Honestly all the singing, and for the most part everything else was pretty spot on with the original. So it was really good."
"__DISNEY__ Is there anything you didn't like about the new movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Not really, I felt they did a fantastic job. All tho the beast did look a little out of place. He just didn't seem real enough."
