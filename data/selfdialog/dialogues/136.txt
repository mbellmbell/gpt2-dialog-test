"__MUSIC__ I had a really hard Guitar Lesson today!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, How so?"
"__MUSIC__ My teacher taught me a new fingering technique."
"__MUSIC__ Which one did you learn?"
"__MUSIC__ We worked on learning to slide my fingers down the strings after plucking to change the pitch higher or lower."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't think that was so hard."
"__MUSIC__ It is difficult to do accuratly when you are moving through a peice and need to move on to the next notes."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't the neck of your guitar have those lines to help you?"
"__MUSIC__ The fret marks? Yes it does but you need to press cleanly in the space so that the note plays true on the one long string vibration."
"__MUSIC__ Sort of like when you play a larger string instrument like the cello?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, if you don't move your fingers to the right places on the neck the end notes won't be true."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I understand now."
"__MUSIC__ It's also hard on your fingers to hold the string down and slide."
"__MUSIC__ I've seen some guitar players use metal tubes on their fingers to slide like that."
"__MUSIC__ That is another techniques that will play sliding cords but for individual notes you only use your bare fingers."
"__MUSIC__ Do your fingertip calluses help?"
"__MUSIC__ They do but it looks like I'll need to practice more to build them up a bit."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard those sliding notes and didn't know how they were done."
"__MUSIC__ It's a great technique to add to my playing."
"__MUSIC__ I look forward to hearing you play a whole peice!"
