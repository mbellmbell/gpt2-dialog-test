"__MUSIC__ Hi Madi, what are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, hi Wanda, I'm listening to 21 Pilots."
"__MUSIC__ 21 Pilots?  I haven't heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ What? I'm shocked that you haven't heard of them, they are amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ Really, can I listen?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, here are my headphones"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm...I have heard this before."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, what do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm really not that impressed?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I can't believe you said that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry, you must like them a lot."
"__MUSIC__ I do, they are my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I must be too old to enjoy them.  Ha ha"
"__MUSIC__ I do, it's impressive that there are only two members of the band?"
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Tyler plays most of the instruments and sings."
"__MUSIC__ What does the other guy do?"
"__MUSIC__ Josh plays the drums mainly."
"__MUSIC__ I bet the singer goes solo at some point then."
"__MUSIC__ I doubt it!  They're best friends!"
