"__MOVIES__ I saw a strange movie the other night."
"__MOVIES__ What was it called?"
"__MOVIES__ Americathon. It starred John Ritter and Harvey Korman."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that must be over 30 years old."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I think it was made in the late 70;s."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about."
"__MOVIES__ Basically that the US was going bankrupt and needed to borrow money from someone to save it."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, sounds interesting, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Well a Native American gives a loan of 400 billion dollars but wants it paid back in 30 days."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, how ironic."
"__MOVIES__ So they come up with an idea to have a telethon to save the country. There would be acts and people could donate money."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, that sounds really weird."
"__MOVIES__ It was weird. It ends up that people were so poor that they were all living in their cars and either biked or ran to work."
"__MOVIES__ They acted like that was normal?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. They could even watch tv in their cars which was funny since they were so poor."
"__MOVIES__ What was the telethon like."
"__MOVIES__ The acts were horrible. Lots of ventriloquists and singers."
"__MOVIES__ I guess people nowadays would find it dull?"
"__MOVIES__ It was not a good movie really. It was interesting in it's concept but..."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of stunk I guess is the best way to put it."
