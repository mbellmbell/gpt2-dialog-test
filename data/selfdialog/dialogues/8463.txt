"__BEATLES__ Do you like Beatle's music?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I do.  My favorite Beatles song is 'Hey Jude.'"
"__BEATLES__ Well, I know an interesting piece of trivia about that song.  Did you know that 'Hey Jude' was not the original title?"
"__BEATLES__ What?!  What was the title?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, Paul McCartney originally wrote it as a tribute to John Lennon's son, Julian.  So he called it 'Hey Jules.'"
"__BEATLES__ Wait a minute--I didn't know John Lennon had a kid back in those days!"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, he was married and had a son before the Beatles even became famous."
"__BEATLES__ So why did the song title get changed?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm not sure about that, but I remember reading that the lyrics changed before it was recorded and so the title changed."
"__BEATLES__ Okay, now I have to listen to that song again and see if I can pick up on the tribute part.  Thanks for the info!"
