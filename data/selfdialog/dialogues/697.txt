"__MUSIC__ Hey, you have to check out this new group I just discovered!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? What group?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Die Antwoord?"
"__MUSIC__ Can't say that I have. What genre of music do they do?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a weird fusion called zef."
"__MUSIC__ Zef? I've never heard of that. Are you sure you're not just making up words here?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I'm serious. They are a South African duo. And zef is basically a blend of dance rave music and rap."
"__MUSIC__ South African? How did you ever find out about these guys? You don't usually listen to foreign music."
"__MUSIC__ Someone showed me one of their music videos. At first, I was into it because the video was so trippy, but then I just thought the music was so catchy I wanted to hear more."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting, but to be honest I'm not a big fan of rap music."
"__MUSIC__ But you do like dance music right?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I do. I used to go to the Electric Daisy Carnival every year."
"__MUSIC__ Well then you should still definitely give Die Antwoord a listen. Like I said, they're actually a fusion of rave music with rap."
"__MUSIC__ Fine, if it'll get you to stop pestering me, I'll have a listen when I get a chance."
"__MUSIC__ Great! That's all I wanted."
"__MUSIC__ What track would you recommend I listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well you are a fan of Aphex Twin, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. So?"
"__MUSIC__ Then listen to 'Ugly Boy.' The music from that is sampled from Aphex Twin's 'Ageispolis.'"
"__MUSIC__ Really? Okay, I'll give that a try then."
