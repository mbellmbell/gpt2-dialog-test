"__BASEBALL__ Hey, what's your favorite Major League Baseball team?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm from Boston, so I love the Red Sox."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too! Did you watch last night's game?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure did. I'm glad they finally beat the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ They're still third in the division, but it's going to be close all year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it's a good thing the season is so long. Who's starting the game tomorrow?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think Chris Sale is pitching tomorrow."
"__BASEBALL__ Perfect, he's the best pitcher in the league right now."
"__BASEBALL__ He is, and the batting lineup is starting to get hot as well."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, can you believe that home-run that Mookie Betts hit?"
"__BASEBALL__ The ball must have went over 400 feet. Did it go out of the park?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think it did. What an incredible hit."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the stolen base in the 6th inning?"
"__BASEBALL__ I did! I wasn't sure it was possible for a person to run that fast."
"__BASEBALL__ Have you ever been to Fenway Park for a game?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but I'd definitely like to visit there, because it's one of the oldest stadiums in the league."
"__BASEBALL__ I went to a playoff game last year. I hope the Red Sox make the playoffs this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too, and I especially hope that the Yankees don't make the playoffs."
"__BASEBALL__ Here's my number, let's meet up to watch tomorrow night's game together?"
"__BASEBALL__ Thanks, I think the game's at 7. Go Red Sox!"
