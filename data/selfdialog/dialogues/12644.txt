"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking about the NFL uniforms and wondered how they were ranked as to best and worst."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting. What did you find out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One poll showed  Seattle Seahawks as the best and Jacksonville Jaguars the worst."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think those are both really boring uniforms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree but not as boring as Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They fit terrible and they look like the leftover candy from Halloween that you liked the least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow that's a heck of a description!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cleveland Browns are about on the same level they look like brown and orange candy corn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Green Bay and Pittsburgh Steelers uniforms. They make a statement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes those are good ones for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how expensive uniforms are?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The helmets cost around $1000 and I think the jersey is  about $200  and pants $100."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then you have all the other 'extras'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's ridiculous  when you start thinking about what they are charged from these sports companies."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah like 35-50 for a pair of socks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No wonder they charge so much for tickets"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everybody gouges everybody else because they know they can get away with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Vendors screwing the patrons with ridiculous vending prices and the stadiums screwing the vendors for primo spots to sell there wares or food."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah unless you are rich it's almost impossible to go to a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't give a crap about the common man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes  i wished they would make it more affordable for more people"
