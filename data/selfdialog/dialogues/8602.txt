"__BEATLES__ Who is the best Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm going to say Paul McCartney-- he contributed so much to the Beatles, and had a long career and good hits after."
"__BEATLES__ John Lennon is my favorite-- I love his songs, except Revolution 9.  That's not even really a song."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that song is awful.  It's probably the worst song ever, if you can even call it a song."
"__BEATLES__ All of the Beatles were really talented, even Ringo."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, Octopus' Garden and Don't Pass Me By are both really good songs."
"__BEATLES__ What about George Harrison?"
"__BEATLES__ Frank Sinatra called Something the greatest love song ever written.  Who am I to argue with ol' Blue Eyes?"
"__BEATLES__ No one-- that's who! What's your favorite Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ They're all really good, but I'm going to go with Abbey Road.  I love how the songs flow together."
