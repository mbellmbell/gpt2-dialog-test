"__MUSIC__ Do you like the Black Eyed Peas?"
"__MUSIC__ The band?  They are okay."
"__MUSIC__ Just okay?  I love them."
"__MUSIC__ I think they are okay and they have a way of incorporating music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what is it that you don't like?"
"__MUSIC__ They kind of sample too much."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, I've only heard sampling on one song."
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding?  They sample a lot."
"__MUSIC__ On what songs?"
"__MUSIC__ My Humps, Pump It, and Meet Me Halfway to start with."
"__MUSIC__ Really."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, even Fergie sampled a bit on her solo stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, have you ever listened to Fergalicious?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I thought it was original?"
"__MUSIC__ Not a lot of what they do is original."
"__MUSIC__ The way they incorporate it is, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm not arguing that.  They do use it in a very good way."
"__MUSIC__ But they aren't the most original group?"
"__MUSIC__ No."
