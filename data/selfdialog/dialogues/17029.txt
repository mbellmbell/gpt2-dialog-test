"__MOVIES__ What was the last movie you saw?"
"__MOVIES__ It was an old one, Anchors Aweigh, with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, do you like old movies then?"
"__MOVIES__ Some of them are really good, others, not so much.  But if you wanted to know the last movie I saw in a theater, it was Hidden Figures."
"__MOVIES__ Hidden Figures?  The title seems familiar, but I don't remember what it's about."
"__MOVIES__ It's about how black women were big contributors at NASA during the Space Race.  It was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, I remember now.  It was good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I read up a little bit on the history after watching and I wish it had been a little more accurate."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know how that goes in movies about true events, actual facts are more of a guideline and some of them just don't interest the writer or director or whoever."
"__MOVIES__ I guess, but they interest me.  I mean, Apollo 13 was pretty acurate and it was really exciting even though I knew what was going to happen."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah, but the reality was pretty dramatic anyway there and I bet they took some liberties."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure they did, but not that many, I don't think.  I just think that actual facts can be just as interesting as some things they do for dramatic license."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, I don't know, you liked Titanic, didn't you?  That had a ton of dramatic license."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I don't think it ever pretended otherwise.  And, of course, there are movies I love that you really have to suspend your disbelief for."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Like Speed.  Physics doesn't work like that, it really doesn't."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, come on, that bus could totally make that jump."
"__MOVIES__ No, it couldn't.  But that's okay, in that movie verse it could."
"__MOVIES__ So what you're saying is that sometimes you want movies to be as realistic as they can be and sometimes you want movies with only a passing nod at realism."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
