"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What teams do you think are going to the Super Bowl this year ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's going to be the Dolphins and the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think the Dolphins can beat out the Patriots to win their division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this is going to be the year they finally do it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't want to see the Patriots in the Super Bowl again, so I hope you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sick of seeing the Patriots in the Super Bowl also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've been in two of the last three Super Bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They won two of the last three Super Bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also have been in six Super Bowls since 2004."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, seven if you go back to 2002."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, that's right. I think they won five of those."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, five Super Bowl wins in the last fifteen years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is easier to win when you deflate the balls to your advantage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that does help a little."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I will have to cheer for the Dolphins real hard this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's no chance of anyone else in the AFC East knocking out the Pats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else is in the AFC East besides the Fins and the Pats ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bills and the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well you're right about that, no chance for those two teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe that's why the Patriots have been to the Super Bowl so many times lately."
