"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tyreek Hill is such an exciting young player!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see how many games he won for the Chiefs last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I know he had so many good games. The most memorable ones were against the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't he score 3 touchdowns in that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he did. He had a kick return for a touchdown, a rushing touchdown, and a receiving touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's so electric when he's returning kicks and out in the open field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's his speed and quickness. The guy is lightening fast, strong and just knows how to get open!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait to see what he's going to do this season with the Chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Chiefs are going to win 12 games and take the AFC West."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll finish with 11 or 12 wins but the Raiders will win that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tyreek Hill needs more touches on the offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's so explosive it would be a crime for Andy Reid their coach, to not put in more plays for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we'll see Tyreek featured in a lot of plays since they let Jamaal Charles go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right! I forgot the Bronco's picked up Jamaal Charles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a big pickup if Charles can stay healthy. He's too injury prone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Demaryius Thomas and Jamaal Charles on the same team, that sounds exciting on paper."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he Jamaal stays healthy it'll great for the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I agree. Their defense is top notch they just need their current offense to catch up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's going to come down to Trevor Siemian. If he steps up and improves the Denver Broncos will be dangerous next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will improve. He looked good last season for his rookie year and I think he'll only get better."
