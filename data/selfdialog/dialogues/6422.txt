"__STAR_WARS__ Do you know what one of my favorite scenes was from all of the Star Wars movies was?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't even know how you can choose, there was so many awesome scenes in that series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, one of the best, in my opinion, is the battle between Anakin and Obi Wan on Mustafar in 'Revenge of the Sith.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, that was an great scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ All of those choose Jedi flips and stuff over the lava was amazing!"
"__STAR_WARS__ And that scene really sets up the whole Anakin going bad thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was really sad when Obi Wan left Anakin. I always wished he had just taken him with him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know right. He shouldn't have left him there, with the Emperor coming and all."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was still a cool scene though, no matter the outcome."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, makes me want to watch that one again."
