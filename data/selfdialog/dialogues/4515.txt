"__MUSIC__ I miss Whitney Houston."
"__MUSIC__ Why you say that out the clear blue?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I was listening to that remix she did with George Michael last night."
"__MUSIC__ She did a song with George Michael? What's the name of it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called If I told You That. The song is fire and the video is even better."
"__MUSIC__ They made a video together?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man. It's set in this club and they both like talking to each other through the music."
"__MUSIC__ What you mean through the music?"
"__MUSIC__ Like each verse that each one sings is like they are talking to the other one. They friends but now they got feelings for each other."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I ever saw that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm telling you dude, that thing is hot. They in the club and then they hit the dance floor."
"__MUSIC__ Word?"
"__MUSIC__ They shut the dance floor down. Everybody in the club stops and just circled around watching them."
"__MUSIC__ That thing sound like it's the truth."
"__MUSIC__ It is. You can watch it on youtube."
"__MUSIC__ That's whats up."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah though, damn shame Whitney gone."
"__MUSIC__ You talking bout Whitney? BOTH of them are gone.."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I forgot that George Michael passed as well."
"__MUSIC__ Go add some of his music to your playlists. I'm definitely gone go download that video of him and Whitney you just told me about."
