"__MOVIES__ What kind of movies do you like to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ I love comedies.  I also love documentaries."
"__MOVIES__ Documentaries?  Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there are so many interesting stories to tell!  And now I have Netflix so I can watch a bunch of them."
"__MOVIES__ Documentaries always seem boring."
"__MOVIES__ There are plenty of good ones.  I really liked 13th."
"__MOVIES__ What was that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about how the 13th amendment allows prisons to use prisoners as slave labor."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't think that's a bad thing!"
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha.  Well, you should watch this.  It goes into how this targets black men."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ Modern-day slavery, basically."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I'd go that far..."
"__MOVIES__ Well, give this a look and see."
"__MOVIES__ I'll look if I have time."
"__MOVIES__ It's worth it.  It was directed by the same director who did Selma."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that either."
"__MOVIES__ Funny enough, neither have I."
"__MOVIES__ What??"
"__MOVIES__ I'm waiting for it to come to Netflix."
