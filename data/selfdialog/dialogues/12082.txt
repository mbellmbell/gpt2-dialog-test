"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder who had the most punt return TDs last year..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well. Things like punt return TDs are better if we look at the career records"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How come?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because it's a rare thing. We don't get it in every game, Some teams never even get one ina season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. That's a good piont. So who has the most punt return TD over the career?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Devin Hester who had 14 punt return TDs over between 2006-2016"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's amazing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ in 2007, he had 4 punt return TDs. That's like every third week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must have been amazing to watch"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, excepot he hasn't had one since 2014. See these are so rare, it's kinda pointless to talk about a season record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see your point. But season records are what we use to fantasy mostly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um, some people use average of the seasons for fantasy. Others even use bayesian networks. But football isn't very amenable for bayesian if you ask me"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We need way more data points, more than they keep."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many more pata points?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For Baeysian predictions to be reliable? probably millions"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We probably have millions of data points for NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but we need the right kind of data at those numbers. And we don't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even NFL doesn't give you enough data points? That's insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's just reality. It's just like financial market prediction. The agents are stochastic, and they often defy predictions"
