"__MUSIC__ I'm torn about my opinion on the Grateful Dead"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? How come?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think they are good, but I don't think they extraordinary like the Deadheads claim them to be."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't say you are torn, it sounds like you have a pretty solid opinion on them."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess I'm torn because sometimes I do like some of their solos but other times it can just drag on and go no where interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I agree, there is a lot of guitar noodling, and I don't like that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm also torn between whether I like their psychedelic stuff or more of their more folksy oriented material."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure where diehard fans fall on this spectrum"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it may be impossible to tear the psychedelic element away from the folksy oriented element, but most Deadheads like the Workingman's Dead and American Beauty material the best."
"__MUSIC__ And that is, what, folksy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, more traditional and has more straightforward folk without the psychedelic-oriented material."
"__MUSIC__ How else are you torn on them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm in the minority in that I tend to like their studio stuff better than listening to their live recordings."
"__MUSIC__ That, my friend, is definitely a minority opinion - don't let other people hear you say that - blasphemy!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know. I do like to listen to some of their recent live stuff of their most recent tours, but I do tend to listen to a lot of their studio albums more often."
"__MUSIC__ I think a lot of Deadheads feel they never quite could reach their potential in their studio efforts."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think that is common consensus, but the studio material tends to limit the soloing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you'd have 2 songs per album otherwise!"
"__MUSIC__ The Grateful Dead - you either love or hate 'em."
"__MUSIC__ And the reasons you may love 'em may differ between person to person."
