"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite song of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's amost impossible to answer. There are so many great songs."
"__MUSIC__ If you had to pick one, which would it be?"
"__MUSIC__ It might sound silly, but I might pick 'Tale as Old as Time', the song from the movie Beauty and the Beast. I love Disney music."
"__MUSIC__ That's a very pretty song, I agree."
"__MUSIC__ If we're not allowed to use Disney music, then I'd maybe say 'Kiss from a Rose' by Seal."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that's a great song too."
"__MUSIC__ I still watch the music video of that song on Youtube from time to time."
"__MUSIC__ Seal has a great voice, and that song in particular is outstanding."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song."
"__MUSIC__ I'd pick Sinnerman, by Nina Simone."
"__MUSIC__ Nina Simone had such an unusual voice."
"__MUSIC__ She was remarkable."
"__MUSIC__ My mother saw Nina Simone perform live. She said she was surprisingly funny, in her stage banter."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, that's not what I would have expected."
"__MUSIC__ She said the music was sublime, too."
"__MUSIC__ That, I would expect. I think today's music is missing a lot of what Nina Simone had."
"__MUSIC__ Which is what?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's maybe the integrity and authenticity of following your own path."
"__MUSIC__ It's true that a lot of music these days is more commerically generated."
