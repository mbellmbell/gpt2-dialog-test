"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Gone Baby Gone?"
"__MOVIES__ I caught it on TV once, but just part of it"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it in theater; I thought it was really good. I didn't guess the twist but you might, haha."
"__MOVIES__ I probably would."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it 'cause I didn't live here in Boston at the time and I missed home."
"__MOVIES__ I understand. It's interesting how many movies I've seen filmed here."
"__MOVIES__ In the movie ... this girl, this young girl, goes missing. At first, the cops think her mother did something to her ... but she didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me more."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not going to spoil it. You *have* to watch it with me."
"__MOVIES__ I knew you'd say that. Have you seen Mystic River? That one I actually saw in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Didn't get to see that in the theater, though."
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe we should watch that one tonight."
"__MOVIES__ That's about another missing girl, right?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's about a dead girl, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Oh."
"__MOVIES__ A murder mystery along with a lot of personal mysteries among the people trying to figure it out."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good."
"__MOVIES__ Have you read the book?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Gone Baby Gone I've read but not Mystic River."
"__MOVIES__ I recommend it."
