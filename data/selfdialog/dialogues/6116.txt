"__STAR_WARS__ I absolutely adore Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me, too! But I'm only into the first three."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you mean Episode 1, 2 and 3? Or do you mean the original Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean the original. I don't quite understand Lucas's story organization."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well the originals really were the classics."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, before they added all those annoying characters like Jar Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you get the re-releases on DVD?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have them, but I gotta say that I love my original VHS tapes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because they have the original special effects as opposed to the new ones."
