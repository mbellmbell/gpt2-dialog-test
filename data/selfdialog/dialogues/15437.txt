"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ My favorite is the Goblet of Fire. I love all of the action in the different tasks of that movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree, there is a lot of fun in that one. My favorite is the Prisoner of Azkaban - I like meeting Sirius Black and hearing his true story."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, that's a good one too! I love the relationship that develops between Harry and Sirius, but that mostly happens in later movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also really like the relationship between Harry and Sirius. It's fun to see Harry have a father-figure, or more like a fun uncle, in his life. What do you think about the way Sirius dies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sirius' death is so weird to me. I can never figure out exactly what happens to him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, that  was confusing to me, too. I don't like that it almost left the door open to him coming back, but he never did."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was definitely one of the more unique deaths in the movies. Who is your favorite character in the movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think my favorite character is Snape. His story is just so amazing. How about you?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love Neville - his transformation from the first movie to the last is so huge, and I love how his character evolves throughout the series."
