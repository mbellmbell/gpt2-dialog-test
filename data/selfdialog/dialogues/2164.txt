"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite 70s band?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a hard one. Talking Heads?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I didnt even know they were around in the 70s."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they started then. But most of their well known stuff is from the 80s, like Speaking in Tongues."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, so you like their more commercial stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I like both. Remain in Light is my favorite album of theirs."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard it, but I will check it out. I've seen Stop Making Sense though."
"__MUSIC__ That's a great concert documentary. So what's your favorite 70s band."
"__MUSIC__ Led Zeppelin!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, of course! Which album?"
"__MUSIC__ IV."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's a brilliant album. Jimmy Page is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I love Robert Plant's voice. It just takes me to another place."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not a huge Zeppelin fan but I will agree he has one of the best voices in rock."
"__MUSIC__ True. Who do you think currently has the best voice in music now?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's a hard one. How about Bjork?"
"__MUSIC__ Her voice is very distinctive."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah there is no mistaking her voice. How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't think of anyone now who even compares to Robert Plant or people who were big back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Janis Joplin. They dont make them like that any more!"
