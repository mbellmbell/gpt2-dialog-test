"__DISNEY__ I was listening to the radio today and heard that Disney costumes are the most popular halloween costumes these days."
"__DISNEY__ I believe it! Last year my boyfriend and I went as Meg and Hercules from Hercules!"
"__DISNEY__ What a small world, that is what my sister and her husband are doing this year! And their new baby will be dressed as Phil!"
"__DISNEY__ That is hilarious!"
"__DISNEY__ Come to think of it, it's been a while since I've seen a couple costume that isn't Disney! I know a lot of little girls always go as princesses."
"__DISNEY__ I agree! Especially since the new Beauty and the Beast movie came out, I think that will be a popular one this year."
"__DISNEY__ You're right, my little cousin has been demanding to get a Belle dress for Halloween and it's only June!"
"__DISNEY__ Hey, maybe I'll get a Belle dress and you can be Cogsworth or Lumiere!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh goodness! I think maybe you should have your husband dress as Beast and you can be Belle."
"__DISNEY__ If you aren't calling dibs on Cogsworth, I'll get my dog a costume!"
