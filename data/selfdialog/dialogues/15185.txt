"__HARRY_POTTER__ So who's your favorite Harry Potter character?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Severus Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What?! He was a nasty character who bullied Harry and his friends for years!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, but he was also trying to protect them even though the experience was extremely painful for him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, I know it wasn't easy, but did he have to be so mean?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry was a living, breathing reminder of everything he'd lost. You can't blame him for having negative feelings toward him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, maybe that's true."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Besides, he couldn't have been nice to Harry, even if he'd wanted to."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why do you say that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Because hating Harry, or at least pretending to, was a crucial part of maintaining his cover with Voldemort."
