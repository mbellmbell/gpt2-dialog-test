"__MOVIES__ Do you remember Robocop?"
"__MOVIES__ The remake or the original."
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking of the original ones."
"__MOVIES__ I do remember them.  Those weren't too bad really."
"__MOVIES__ It's funny how they viewed the future in the 80's."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the cars are definitely not too futuristic looking."
"__MOVIES__ I think they were old-school Ford sedans if I remember correctly."
"__MOVIES__ I think you're right."
"__MOVIES__ The movies were kind of gory, weren't they?"
"__MOVIES__ In parts.  He shoots a lot of people in them."
"__MOVIES__ Aside from that, it showed people getting hit by cars, torn apart."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, pretty gruesome stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the effects are pretty dated now."
"__MOVIES__ Especially the robots.  Very herky-jerky."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that was considered great at the time, but special effects have come a long way."
"__MOVIES__ Whatever happened to the main actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Peter Weller?  Couldn't tell you."
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't name another single movie he was ever in."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe he made enough from the originals to retire."
"__MOVIES__ Perhaps so.  I wish I had that much dough!"
