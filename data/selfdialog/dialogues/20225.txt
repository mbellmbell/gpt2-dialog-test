"__MOVIES__ Hey, what are you up to?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing much, watching a movie at the moment."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. What are you watching?"
"__MOVIES__ Currently I am watching through the Batman series."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting, which one are you on?"
"__MOVIES__ I am currently watching Batman Begins."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, those are the new ones. Have you seen the originals?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen the classics but I did watch through the 90's Batman movies."
"__MOVIES__ Those are actually some of my favorites but the new series is at the top for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Ya they are some of my favorites. I love how Christian Bale played the part."
"__MOVIES__ Ehh he was just OK in my book but overall I liked how the movie turned out."
"__MOVIES__ Ya Heath Ledger put on one of the best performances I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ Ya it's a shame that he died. It was too soon."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. I still wonder what actually happened surrounding his death."
"__MOVIES__ So do I but we will never know for sure."
"__MOVIES__ I think that overall there has never been a better joker."
"__MOVIES__ Well they all bring something different to the table but he played more twisted role."
"__MOVIES__ That's exactly why I liked him. That is the character I picture when I see the Joker in my mind."
"__MOVIES__ Well not all people like that sort of thing."
"__MOVIES__ To each their own. It's what makes this series one of my favorites."
