"__MUSIC__ How do you feel about rap music?"
"__MUSIC__ It's fine, but it's not my first choice of music if thats what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ What would you choose first?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really have a preference. As long as it sounds good."
"__MUSIC__ Then why do you feel rap isn't your first choice?"
"__MUSIC__ Mainly because theres not really a lot of good rap music out there."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well most of it is your general nonsense."
"__MUSIC__ Nonsense?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, No real topic, message or meaning. Its usually about money, getting drunk or high."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I can kind of see that, so you don't like any of those kinds of songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I'm not saying some of them aren't catchy but they don't really bring anything to the table aside from a good beat."
"__MUSIC__ Now that you mention it I don't think I can recall a good rap song that has some kind of message to it."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly thats why it's not really my thing. I think rock has a much better range of creative talent."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Who would you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much anybody. You have bands like Disturbed, and Metallica that have a great sound and depth to their songs."
"__MUSIC__ When you say depth to their music what would you consider."
"__MUSIC__ Well whether or not I can relate to the song, and if it covers a real life kind of topic."
"__MUSIC__ I think of it as if the song hits me emotionally more than having a story or something."
"__MUSIC__ Well if you think about it, it all boils down to the song getting to you emotionally. You just don't care how which is fine."
