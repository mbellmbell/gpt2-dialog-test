"__MUSIC__ I can't wait for the new Tool album."
"__MUSIC__ Me either.  Honestly, I'm not sure it's anything more than a rumor."
"__MUSIC__ You've got to be kidding.  A band with that kind of following would be foolish to turn down an opportunity like this."
"__MUSIC__ The suspense over a potential new album is quite high."
"__MUSIC__ It is.  They could probably charge triple the cost and still go multi-platinum."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely.  I hope they do make a new album."
"__MUSIC__ I have no doubt they will and I hope it's great."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but I wasn't fully impressed by their last album 10,000 Days."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It just didn't feel as epic as Lateralus or Aenima.  It was good though, just not epic."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right.  It might be hard to beat really good songs from Aenima, like Pushit."
"__MUSIC__ It will probably be hard to top the overall quality of an album like you find in Lateralus too."
"__MUSIC__ They've got their work cut out for them then."
"__MUSIC__ And the anticipation of their music is insane, rumors are flying around everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard a few of them, covering everything from immediate release to not going to happen."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard those too, but I'm sure they're going to release a quality album when it's ready."
"__MUSIC__ The majority of their previous music has been composed quite well so I'm sure we can expect more of the same."
"__MUSIC__ It's just hard to get through the rumors when the band is already so vague in everything they do."
"__MUSIC__ That's another thing I like about them.  It's more about the music than their image."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  No pictures of the band, no interviews, just quality composition and contributing artwork."
