"__MOVIES__ We need to decide on a movie for movie night."
"__MOVIES__ Right, how long do we have before people get here?"
"__MOVIES__ About twenty minutes. We need to hurry!"
"__MOVIES__ Okay. Then let's decide now. What are the options?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I've got copies of Jurassic Park, Mean Girls, and Lost in Translation."
"__MOVIES__ That's a really odd set of movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the TV doesn't hook up to a computer, and this is all I have DVDs of."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so which of those are you leaning."
"__MOVIES__ Well, my favorite of the three is Lost in Translation."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in that again? Scarlett Johansson?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Bill Murray. Sophia Coppola directed."
"__MOVIES__ Right, so should we go with that?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm just not sure it's a great group movie."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe funny would be better."
"__MOVIES__ Should we try Mean Girls then?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one is that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the one Tina Fey was in. With Lindsay Lohan."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a hilarious movie."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, let's go with this then."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like a great choice!"
