"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the two new Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I saw 'The Force Awakens and Rogue One'"
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought they were great.  They finally got back to basics."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, they were both better than the 3 prequels"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am excited about Luke Skywalker coming back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me to,  I hated we didn't see more of him in the first one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I am ready to see him kick some ass."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just think it's weird that he just decided to tell all his friends 'good luck' and disappeared."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hopefully they were do a good job explaining that in the next one."
