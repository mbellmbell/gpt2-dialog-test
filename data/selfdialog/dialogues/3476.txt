"__MUSIC__ I like the new Twenty One Pilots single."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ That one they did for the Suicide Squad movie. It's called Heathens."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, cool. Is it good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's got a night haunting background with a little beat thrown in."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like I'd like it. Have they put out any other new music?"
"__MUSIC__ They have! They did a cover of Cancer by My Chemical Romance."
"__MUSIC__ How's it sound?"
"__MUSIC__ I listened to Twenty One Pilots rendition of it first and loved it. But then listened to My Chemical Romance's and didn't like theirs."
"__MUSIC__ So they made it better?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, definitely. It sounds really sad. I love it."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, also, Twenty One Pilots did a studio session with MuteMath. They redid a few of their old songs."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds interesting. Who is MuteMath?"
"__MUSIC__ A small collaboration between Paul Meany and Darren King. You might like them too."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check them out. I never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Well, get the new Twenty One Pilots stuff I told you about and then check out MuteMath."
"__MUSIC__ I will definitely do that."
"__MUSIC__ We should go to a Twenty One Pilots concert together sometime."
"__MUSIC__ I'm down for that. Just let me know when and where!"
