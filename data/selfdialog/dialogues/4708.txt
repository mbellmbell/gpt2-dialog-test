"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to put together a Halloween playlist and I was wondering if you had any ideas."
"__MUSIC__ What do you have so far?"
"__MUSIC__ I have the theme from Ghostbusters, Witch Doctor, Monster Mash and Thriller."
"__MUSIC__ How about This is Halloween?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, from A nightmare Before Christmas."
"__MUSIC__ Time Warp would be a fun one."
"__MUSIC__ I totally forgot about that one. What else?"
"__MUSIC__ You might look into some Alice Cooper songs."
"__MUSIC__ Which ones do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Welcome to My Nightmare and I Love the Dead would be good choices."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check them out."
"__MUSIC__ Now, it's not exactly Halloween music, but the theme from The Exorcist is pretty creepy."
"__MUSIC__ I could use that and also use the Freddy Krueger them song."
"__MUSIC__ And you can't forget Purple People Eater."
"__MUSIC__ That's a classic!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think you have enough songs, yet?"
"__MUSIC__ I need just one more."
"__MUSIC__ You could use the theme from The Addams Family."
"__MUSIC__ Perfect. My list is complete."
"__MUSIC__ Glad I could help."
