"__BASEBALL__ When does Gleyber Torres get called up to the majors?"
"__BASEBALL__ Probably 2018."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? You don't think he gets the call sooner with his performance?"
"__BASEBALL__ There's not really a roster opening at the moment."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh come on, he's gotta be better than some of the bench guys."
"__BASEBALL__ He's in Double-A, it's not common to jump a guy up that quick to put him on the bench. It's a waste of money."
"__BASEBALL__ How will you know if it's a waste of money if he hasn't even played yet?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's an accounting and management issue. He's a controllable asset and you don't want to start his service clock where he becomes more expensive unless he can contribute."
"__BASEBALL__ Huh. But you have to expect some roster moves in terms of injuries and moves across the duration of the season."
"__BASEBALL__ If they compete and he really does well, I can possibly see him getting a September call-up but I wouldn't pencil it in as likely."
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees will need him in the playoffs."
"__BASEBALL__ Where is he going to play? They have Gregorius, Castro, Torreyes in the middle infield."
"__BASEBALL__ Like I said, things change over the course of the season."
"__BASEBALL__ Put it like this, would you rather have Torres for a whole extra year or for a few games off the bench in September."
"__BASEBALL__ I get your point, but it seems to me that you'd want all hands on deck for a playoff run."
"__BASEBALL__ You Yankees fans just want everybody on your team no matter what lol."
"__BASEBALL__ We want to win."
"__BASEBALL__ Yankees are actually back to building their team the right way with these young players. No need to rush everybody."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess  you're right. They've done a good job through trades and stuff."
"__BASEBALL__ I'd be more worried about pitching than adding another infielder to an embarrassment of riches."
