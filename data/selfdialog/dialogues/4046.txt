"__MUSIC__ Do you like to listen to music?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, who doesn't?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I mean are you an avid listener?"
"__MUSIC__ No, definitely not. I do like a lot of genres though."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Although I'd have to say 80s classic rock is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Who doesn't like that? Any favorites from that era?"
"__MUSIC__ There are so many good ones. Poison, Whitesnake, even The Who, and Bruce Springsteen."
"__MUSIC__ They are all a little different in style, but I'm with you. I like them all too."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Well my favorite in general is Springsteen. I can't get enough of his music."
"__MUSIC__ I really only stick to his 70s and 80s music. I don't care as much for the more recent albums."
"__MUSIC__ It does get a little more pop rock, but I'm in love with the album Magic."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't he do a really folk album in the 90s or 2000s?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he played with the Seeger Sessions and did all classic, and I mean really classic, folk songs."
"__MUSIC__ That is so odd. Give me Born to Run or Badlands over that."
"__MUSIC__ Badlands is probably my all time favorite Bruce song."
"__MUSIC__ There is just so much that came out of that era, from him and others, that is so good."
"__MUSIC__ Well, good enough to make a whole musical about it."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ The musical Rock of Ages only uses 80s rock for the songs."
