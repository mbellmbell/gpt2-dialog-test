"__MOVIES__ What was that movie that came out a few years ago with zombies?"
"__MOVIES__ There's been tons of those.  I need a bit more help."
"__MOVIES__ Okay.  It had the teenagers in it and the zombie did the narrative."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmmmm.  I think you're talking about Warm Bodies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what it was called.  That was a pleasant surprise.."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't expect much from it, but I would agree."
"__MOVIES__ It was a good humorous take on the genre.  Good performances from the leads."
"__MOVIES__ It had a quirky sense of humor to it.  The airport scenes were crafted well."
"__MOVIES__ There were some things I didn't like though."
"__MOVIES__ What in particular are you thinking of?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was kind of silly that the really dead zombies, the Bonies, were so fearsome."
"__MOVIES__ That was a bit odd."
"__MOVIES__ I don't see how skeletons can run or do anything when bones themselves aren't connected."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean how we have to have ligaments, muscles, etc?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  I know it's a zombie movie, but makes no sense."
"__MOVIES__ So are you saying it would have been more effective to have them more zombie-like?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ I can respect that.  Even though it's a zombie movie, there should still be some rules physically."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they should consult me on some of these movies."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know any producers, so you're on your own."
