"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, so you think the Falcons will be able to make it back to the super bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, in fact, I don't think they'll win the NFC south this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly I could see any team winning it this year, it will be the toughest division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, and now the Saints have Adrian Peterson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, they should be better, and don't forget about Carolina."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Cam Newton won't have another down year.  When he's good they should contend for a super bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your take on Tampa Bay?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're a young team, but should be better this year than last."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Given all that, I just don't think the falcons have it in them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, they lost Kyle Shanahan to San Francisco, do you think that will hurt them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do.  Matt Ryan was mediocre at best before he came along, and then with him he won the MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So if it's not the falcons repeating, who wins it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it will be the Patriots vs Green Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You still think Brady can play at a high level?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, and I think he wouldn't continue playing if he couldn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, he wants to win and I don't think he would play either if he couldn't continue winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And green bay will always be good with Aaron Rodgers.  They've lost a lot, but still have the pieces in place."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Should be another great season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm looking forward to the fall already."
