"__MOVIES__ I just saw the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh what did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the franchise has kind of played out to be honest. It wasn't super exciting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I feel like the Pirates movies have been coming out since I was in junior high school."
"__MOVIES__ They have! This is the fifth installment."
"__MOVIES__ Time to put it to rest."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. I am really excited for Dark Tower to come out though!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, what is that? I haven't heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's based on Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It comes out in August."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I used to really love Stephen King books. They really creep me out!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too! The Dark Tower series is his best work, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out. I'm trying to decide if I should see the new Baywatch."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is that the movie with Dwayne Johnson?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Its based on the old tv show."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, I actually don't think I've seen any of his other movies. He is so famous though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he is. I saw the Fast and Furious movie that he is in."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I think I've seen that one too. The original Fast and Furious is my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ I think it might be my favorite too. The original is always best!"
"__MOVIES__ The second and third ones are pretty good too."
