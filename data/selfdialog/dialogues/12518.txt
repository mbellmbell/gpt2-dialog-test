"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When do the NFL training camps start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are doing the OTA's right now and then camps start sometime in July after that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am going to try and make it out to see some of training camps this year.  Tickets are free."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Seahawks have their camp in Renton right on Lake Washington."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I went to the Cowboays training camp last year and it was cool to see Dak Prescott before he became the starter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I try to go to camp and maybe a preseason game.   Tickets are generally more affordable for preseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, tickets for regular season games have gotten so expensive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They go for hundreds of dollars a game here per ticket.  I can't afford that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should come out to see a game in Dallas sometime though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, the stadium there that Jerry Jones built looks incredible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they still having Thursday Night Football every week this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so.  I don't like Thursday night games either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL is so overexposed.   It used to be just Sunday and Monday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now it's 3, sometimes 4 days a week when they have those Saturday night games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not into the NFL games in London either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it.  Games have started at 6:30 AM on the west coast!   I'm not waking up for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's such a disadvantage for teams to have to travel to London anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL definitely wants to put a team there.  I don't get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's all about money for the NFL owners."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL says they care about fans, but how is a team having to give up a home game to play in London caring about fans."
