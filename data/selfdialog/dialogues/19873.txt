"__MOVIES__ You ever see Billy Madison?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did and I'm a fan of Adam Sandler."

"__MOVIES__ I thought it was good."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ He played a character who had no responsibility and was forced to turn his life around which he did quite well but in his own way."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I thought they played that out well."
"__MOVIES__ Plus he gets the girl in the end and that's always nice."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was cool how he went back to school through all the grades to have to prove himself and it shows what each grade and how kids mature."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought about it from the kids perspective."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what the kids thought shooting a movie with Adam Sandler."
"__MOVIES__ I bet they were happy I just hope he was nice to them."
"__MOVIES__ I hear he's actually an awesome guy in real life."
