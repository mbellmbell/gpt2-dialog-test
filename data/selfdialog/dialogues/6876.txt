"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course, but I like the old ones the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ The old movies made or the oldest storyline?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The older movies. The ones with Harrison Ford and Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea. I would have to agree. Although, the ones coming out now are doing pretty good in the box office."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed. But George Lucas made his name off of those old movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. They kind of messed up on those middle movies with Jar Jar Binks and the likes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. I am glad they are back to their winning ways."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. So many people love Star Wars. It is nice to see them do good movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep. And they make more money too."
