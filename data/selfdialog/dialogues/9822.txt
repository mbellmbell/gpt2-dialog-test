"__COMEDY__ Do you think today's comedies are as good as some classics?"
"__COMEDY__ What do you consider a classic comedy?"
"__COMEDY__ Stripes, Blazing Saddles, movies like those."
"__COMEDY__ I love both those movies, but times have changed and I prefer newer comedies, as well as ones from the 90's and 2000's."
"__COMEDY__ Do you like slapstick comedies or others?"
"__COMEDY__ I like any comedy. I was a huge fan of Sandler's early movies, especially Happy Gilmore."
"__COMEDY__ I liked that one too- the more over-the-top, the better for me."
"__COMEDY__ My new favorite is Kevin Hart. Just listening to his voice cracks me up most of the time."
"__COMEDY__ I love him too- at first it seemed like he was trying to be like Eddie Murphy, but found his own way. I love him and Ice Cube as a team."
"__COMEDY__ Similar to me with Chris Tucker years ago with the 'Rush Hour' movies. Just listening to him talk is worth the admission price."
