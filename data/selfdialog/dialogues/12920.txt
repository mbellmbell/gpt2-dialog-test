"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like the Arizona Cardinals this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but probably not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, what do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they have a good team, but they always seem to fail in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes that usually happens, but I think David Johnson is a great running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's good, and I like him in fantasy football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like Carson Palmer at quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not particularly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's very solid. Why don't you like him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he plays great in the regular season, but he folds in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That has been his weakness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's just not a clutch quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about their coaching staff?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's their strength I believe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Bruce Arians as a head coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he really is the mastermind behind that franchise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cardinals were never that good until he got there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a great hire, and I think he is the main reason for their success in recent years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I was a kid in the 1990's, that Cardinals franchise was terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that they were always in the basement of their division."
