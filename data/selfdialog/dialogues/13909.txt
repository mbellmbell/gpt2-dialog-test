"__BASKETBALL__ Wow dude did you see that Warriors Knicks game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Lol I bet the Warriors won by 60."
"__BASKETBALL__ Actually the Knicks were up for most of the game"
"__BASKETBALL__ On the Warriors?  Did their starters take the night off?"
"__BASKETBALL__ When I first looked at the score, I was thinking atleast 2 or 3 had to be resting but nah, only one was out with a strained hamstring."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Knicks actually played defense?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean it seemed better than their norm, but they just can't stop any ball penetration. It was mainly just the Warriors building a house with all those bricks."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hahaha"
"__BASKETBALL__ That one 7 footer for the Warriors missed 3 layups, was going full Moses Malone with the rebounds but missed 3 wide open chippies."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hes 7 foot tall just dunk it with two hands..."
"__BASKETBALL__ To make it worse the Knicks got the rebound threw it up the floor and got a 4 point play from a 3 in the corner."
"__BASKETBALL__ 4 point play?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah dude where you get fouled on a 3 and make it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, right...remember I'm still getting used to the 3 even being a thing as old as I am."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're so dumb..anyways..so the Warriors ended up coming back from a 16 point deficit in the 4th...the Knicks looked tired"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they have no bench, kind of their problem really."
"__BASKETBALL__ It was hard to watch kind of...was man against boys out there with the Warriors just making every shot they looked at."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know that feeling...they do that to my Bulls all the time."
"__BASKETBALL__ So the moral of the story...you can play above your talent level for a while...but the Knicks will always be the Knicks."
"__BASKETBALL__ I feel sad for New York."
