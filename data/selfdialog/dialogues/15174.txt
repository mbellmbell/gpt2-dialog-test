"__HARRY_POTTER__ There were some really small moments in the films that always got me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked when Mr. Weasly was so excited to ask Haryy questions."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And he was so happy, he just over looked the fact that Harry was more of less a famous guy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ When he asked ' What exactly is the purpose of a rubber ducky?', I crack up every time!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think he was one of the best. He always made the show feel lighter."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I loved when he just left the flying car sitting around. Like it was a normal machine."
