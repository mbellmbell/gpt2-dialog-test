"__BASKETBALL__ How about them Kings? Really got fleeced by the sixers?"
"__BASKETBALL__ How so? What happened?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, they traded Stauskas, picks, and pick swaps for nothing and It didn't work."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, they needed to clear space for free agents and they got none anyway."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, and now they have the 5th pick instead of the 3rd because of it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow, that could be a big difference."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, and they also lose a few pick."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, that will probably be a valuable one too. They always suck."
"__BASKETBALL__ Has Stauskas amounted to anything?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, hes a good player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Interesting. That sounds like a win for the Sixers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hinkie does it again.  The guy is good."
"__BASKETBALL__ Talk to me when the Sixers start winning."
"__BASKETBALL__ Listen, just trust the process."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, the process, huh? I'm trusting"
"__BASKETBALL__ Good! Theres a lot of good things going on in Philly."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know. They will start winning eventually."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe, but only if they can stay healthy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, thats still to be determined."
"__BASKETBALL__ It sure is, but only time will tell I g uess."
