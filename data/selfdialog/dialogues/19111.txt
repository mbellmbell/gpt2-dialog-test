"__MOVIES__ Did you ever get to go see Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't how was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was incredible! You really need to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought it looked really good."
"__MOVIES__ It totally was. I was hooked from beginning to end."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Hugh Jackman, of course and Patrick Stewart."
"__MOVIES__ Well of course."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't really a big billed cast, it had a lot of new comers."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. How did Patrick Stewart do with the aging parts?"
"__MOVIES__ It was so real, he looked like he was really wasting away to nothing."
"__MOVIES__ Was it CGI or a body double?"
"__MOVIES__ No! It was actually Patrick Stewart."
"__MOVIES__ For real?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! He lost 20 some pounds just to play the role."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a lot. He's not a big guy to begin with."
"__MOVIES__ I know, and at his age, that must have been hard."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure, its hard for young people to lose that much weight!"
"__MOVIES__ I read online that Hugh Jackman genuinely held Stewart in all the scenes of Wolverine carrying professor Xavier."
"__MOVIES__ That's really crazy. I can't wait to see it!"
