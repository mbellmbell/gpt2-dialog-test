"__BASEBALL__ The Phillies ended their 4 game losing streak last night."
"__BASEBALL__ I saw that. It's about time, they needed that win in the worst way."
"__BASEBALL__ They got a good pitching performance from Hellickson last night."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he really got into a groove after that 1st inning."
"__BASEBALL__ He retired 16 out of 17 batters at one point. He was feeling good out there."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he had started the year out so strong. He had posted a 1.80 ERA in April"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the Phillies need him to find that type of performance more consistently."
"__BASEBALL__ The guy is 5-1 this year, so they play pretty well when he is out there"
"__BASEBALL__ There is a little concern over him though because his back tightened up in the 6th inning."
"__BASEBALL__ Well it wouldn't be a Phillies game if everything went right"
"__BASEBALL__ The crazy thing is that it tightened up after he helped his own cause with an RBI double"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they have already said that this will not cause him to miss his next start."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I know, but it is still something to monitor going forward"
"__BASEBALL__ For sure. But this is the type of win that you need over another ballclub that's struggling."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the Pirates have their own slump going right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Well their ace Ivan Nova will be on the mound tomorrow."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he was the NL pitcher of the month in April"
"__BASEBALL__ True, but he has not won a game in May"
"__BASEBALL__ Baseball is a funny game that's how it works sometimes"
"__BASEBALL__ I agree, but I think the Pirates win tomorrow."
