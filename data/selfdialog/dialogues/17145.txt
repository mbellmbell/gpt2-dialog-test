"__MOVIES__ no i dont know what you mean ."
"__MOVIES__ oh you know the racist overtones to say it lightly that are in the movie are very offensive."
"__MOVIES__ ok but how is it racist if that how people really were back them."
"__MOVIES__ no i know what you mean, back then it racism was accepted it was the norm,. but now it is very racist by our politically correct standards."
"__MOVIES__ yes but i don't think its fair. the african americans in the movie were not portrayed in a really bad light."
"__MOVIES__ i think though if we continue to watch this type of movie it might make some white people think thats its ok to continue in this manner"
"__MOVIES__ yes i supposed that could be true."

"__MOVIES__ its funny she's a british girl and had to do a southern girls accent but clark refused to so a southern accent. it you listen he has no accent at all."
"__MOVIES__ hey that's right captain butler has no southern accent, i never thought about that."
"__MOVIES__ also clark had the original director removed because he thought he was a lady director."
"__MOVIES__ what does that mean lady director?"
"__MOVIES__ he was used to directing women movies, you know with female in the lead."
"__MOVIES__ who was the director and who came on as the new director ?"
"__MOVIES__ george cukor was the first director and victor fleming took over."
"__MOVIES__ wow i never knew that. the first director must not have been too different from the second one you can't tell in the movie where the perspective changes."
