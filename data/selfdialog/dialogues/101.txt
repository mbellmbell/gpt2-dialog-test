"__MUSIC__ You've got a pretty eclectic collection of music here! Do you have favorites, or do you listen to all of them?"
"__MUSIC__ I tend to gravitate toward classic rock, like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, The Who, Deep Purple, even some Traffic and Mountain."
"__MUSIC__ Who was in Traffic? I've never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, come on, you must have heard their music some time in your life. The group was headed up by Steve Winwood."
"__MUSIC__ No, you're mistaken. Wasn't that Blind Faith, with Eric Clapton?"
"__MUSIC__ No, Traffic was formed after Blind Faith broke up."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so where did Clapton go? Did he form his own group?"
"__MUSIC__ Well he sort of toured and did his own thing. You know, I think after all those years with Cream and Blind Faith, he decided to go study the Blues."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I remember when he came out with 'Crossroads'. Great tunes, man."
"__MUSIC__ No.no that was later. he did that single 'After Midnight', now that was a great song."
"__MUSIC__ So you like Cream too? I love 'Dark Room', and 'The Rainbow Has a Mustache'."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm into the sound of Jack Bruce. What a voice that guy had, for a little man."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously, but didn't he pay the bass? That's so unusual for a bass player to lead a group"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, frankly only one other group with a lead singer who played the bass comes to mind, and that was The Police."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I can think of even more! How about Gene Simmons, of KISS, and Greg Lake, of Emerson, Lake and Palmer?"
"__MUSIC__ You're right, I forgot a really important one: Paul McCartney! He had the lead sometimes with the Beatles, and then later in Wings!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, so much great music there. Could it be that bass players are greatest musicians?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, come on! What about drummer lead singers, like Phil Collins, of Genesis, Don Henley, of The Eagles, and Levon Helm of The Band?"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, okay, you're right. But you have to admit, those bands are few and far between."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but they were so awesome, some of the best in the music business. That's a hard thing to top!"
