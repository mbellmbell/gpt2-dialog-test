"__MUSIC__ Do you want to go see Rush with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Rush?! I didn't know they were still touring."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're doing a 15 city run this summer."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, totally, I'd love to go."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, cool. It should be a really good time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, for sure. How'd you find out about the show?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been poking around online and trying to find all the older bands I listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Like which ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Rush, for one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I gathered that."
"__MUSIC__ I also looked up Iron Maiden, The Who, The Pixies, and a few more."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty cool, are all of them touring this summer."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they are."
"__MUSIC__ Are you trying to go to all of those shows."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, I have been working lots of overtime to save money."
"__MUSIC__ I knew you loved concerts, but I didn't realize it was this intense."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I haven't always been this enthusiastic about making sure I go to concerts."
"__MUSIC__ What changed?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, after all those celebrities and musicians died last year, I decided that if I want to see someone live, I need to just do it. No more waiting arou"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's actually a really good idea!"
