"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think was the best defense in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say one of the Steelers 1970's teams. But, I wasn't around when those defenses played."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would definitely agree. They had many Hall of Famers on that roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jack Ham, Lambert, Mean Joe Greene. Yes, they were a great bunch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the best defense you have seen since watching football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 2000 Baltimore Ravens and it isn't even close."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That defense was insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It definitely was. It was so insane that they went 5 games without scoring a touchdown, and won 3 games during that stretch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they really go 3 and 2 without scoring a touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did. I believe that was when the coaching staff made the switch at quarterback to Trent Dilfer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who was the quarterback in there before the switch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tony Banks, I believe. He was atrocious as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember him. He was pretty bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That offense was inept at best. Amazing that a team could have that bad of an offense and still win the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Goes to show you how good that defense really was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It wasn't a very young defense either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, it wasn't. Ray Lewis was a lot younger, but they had veterans all over that defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was so happy to see Rod Woodson get a Super Bowl ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy had a great career and he deserved to be a part of that special team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely did. He's still a Steeler at heart, though."
