"__STAR_WARS__ What did you like about Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably Baze's gun to be honest. That thing was incredible."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it had no kick and was a straight shooter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I'm surprised they didn't use it more often."
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite part was the theory that Baze and Chirrut"
"__STAR_WARS__ What's the theory?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well apparently some people speculate that they are actually in a relationship."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah their mannerisms suggested that they were very close or more than close friends."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah in an interview the director said the Star Wars universe is very open and there are many different types of people."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm glad that they're progressive."
