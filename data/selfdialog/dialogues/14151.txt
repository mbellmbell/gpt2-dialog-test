"__HORROR__ Do you like the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movies?"
"__HORROR__ I do, I was always more of a 'Halloween' person though."
"__HORROR__ So you like 'Freddy vs Jason'?"
"__HORROR__ I haven't seen it actually. Is it good?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, it's alright. It's not as good as the individual franchise movies, though."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, 'Nightmare on Elm Street' has I think more movies than 'Halloween'?"
"__HORROR__ I'm not sure - there's loads of both movies though."
"__HORROR__ They're classics. They don't make horror movies like that anymore."
"__HORROR__ No way. I was so scared of going to sleep as a kid."
"__HORROR__ Me too! Freddy Krueger was such a terrifying character!"
