"__STAR_WARS__ When did the very first Star Wars movie come out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, you know that the very first one was actually episode 4, don't you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah!  I had forgotten about that.  It was the middle trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes--and to answer your question, it came out in 1977."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see it in the theater?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I did.  It was an amazing experience!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favorite character from the first set of movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke Skywalker, of course."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess he was kind of the underdog that came into his own by the end of the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he really ended up saving the day at the end."
