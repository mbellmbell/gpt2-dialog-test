"__MUSIC__ Did you hear they just found some previous unreleased Thelonius Monk soundtrack to a French film?"
"__MUSIC__ No, where did they find them?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure but it's this old film called Les liaisons Dangereues done in the 1960's."
"__MUSIC__ Ah man! That is crazy. Did they say where it's been all this time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can't wait to hear it I love his music. I think it's going to be released soon."
"__MUSIC__ It must have gotten lost and forgotten in the archives."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love the way he uses off beat and tones in his music."
"__MUSIC__ Is it supposed to be just like the other stuff he did?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was commissioned by the director of the film, but I guess it got lost through the years."
"__MUSIC__ How much music is there?"
"__MUSIC__ I hear it's going be released as a 2 LP deluxe box set."
"__MUSIC__ Man, that is a lot of music to have been lost for so long."
"__MUSIC__ It should be exciting. You've heard of Blue Monk haven't you? It's one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I have. I like it too. I think is the second most recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington."
"__MUSIC__ Really, I really thought Miles Davis would have recorded more than both of them."
"__MUSIC__ No Ellington was probably the most recorded of all time. Coming in around a 1000+ works."
"__MUSIC__ Really, he's not really one of my favorites. I'm more into Miles, Monk, and Bird."
"__MUSIC__ Bird, you mean Charlie Parker?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the dude was sick with a sax."
"__MUSIC__ I know he was the ultimate cool."
