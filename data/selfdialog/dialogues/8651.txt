"__BEATLES__ Who's your favorite Beattle?"
"__BEATLES__ Probably George Harrison. Why do you ask?"
"__BEATLES__ Because my mother in law is a hige beattles fan and i really want to impress her. I need to get to know as much as the Beattles as possible, so i can get those brownie points."
"__BEATLES__ Well okay, i can try to help you out as much as I can. My mom is a Beattles freak as well. She could tell you anything you need to know about them."
"__BEATLES__ Would you be willing to go to a Beattles concert with me and my inlaws?"
"__BEATLES__ Maybe, we will see. I think they're all either retired or not living right now. The only one who isn't retired is the main Beattle."
"__BEATLES__ Okay we can do that. As soon as I get the money we can all go, can't wait to see the Beattle live and in action"
"__BEATLES__ Alright, i would love to hear 'She Loves You' live and in action at a concert."
"__BEATLES__ I bought all of their songs!"
"__BEATLES__ That's all i have in my house is Beattles and Bobby Brown vinyl records all up in my house. we can play them on my record stereo."
