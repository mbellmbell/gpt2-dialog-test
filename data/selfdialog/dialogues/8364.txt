"__POP__ I've been thinking about Elvis Presley recently.  do you think he was over-rated, or do you think he deserved all the attention he got?"
"__POP__ Well, when you consider that he was a singer who was certainly unique, and that he also appeared in movies, i would say he deserved everything he got.  he was one of a kind; a once in a lifetime superstar."
"__POP__ I know what you mean.  it's hard to believe it's been 40 years since he died.  I'll never forget that day."
"__POP__ I'm a little too young to remember his death, but i do know it made millions of people very sad.  He had fans all over the world."
"__POP__ The thing about Elvis is that when it looked like his career might have been over, in the late 1960s, he made a great come back."
"__POP__ That's for sure.  One of my brothers still has the Elvis album that he recorded live in Hawaii; i think that was a big part of the come-back."
"__POP__ And his mega-hit  'In the Ghetto' made a lot of the younger folks, who hadn't been big Elvis fans, take notice."
"__POP__ Wow i had totally forgot that song.  When i think of his comeback, i think more of the super song 'Suspicious Minds.'"
"__POP__ Oh, what a great song, i still find myself humming that song once in a while.  Always nice to talk about Elvis; a true legend."
"__POP__ Legend is a word used too loosely, but in Presley's case it's true...he was and still is a legend.  his music lives on."
