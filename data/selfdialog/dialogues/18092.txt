"__MOVIES__ Did you get to see Manchester By the Sea?"
"__MOVIES__ I was a little hesitant due to some of the things I heard about Casey Affleck."
"__MOVIES__ I read about that too. Maybe he's not the greatest guy, but he sure can act."
"__MOVIES__ So, you thought highly of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! It's one of those films you could watch a hundred times and see something different every time."
"__MOVIES__ What's Casey Affleck like in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ He's like the guy next to you at the gas station, but someone who can actually portray that person."
"__MOVIES__ So a very normal guy?"
"__MOVIES__ For sure. No movie magic going on here with the character's personality or his persona."
"__MOVIES__ I think it must actually be harder to play a normal person than a glamorous celebrity."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. That type of acting requires so much more nuance."
"__MOVIES__ Michelle Williams is in Manchester By the Sea, right? I think she's such a talented actor."
"__MOVIES__ And she was incredible in Manchester By the Sea."
"__MOVIES__ What's her character like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I wish she had more screen time. She's actually not in the film too much. She plays Affleck's character's ex-wife."
"__MOVIES__ She speaks in an Boston accent doesn't she?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she and Affleck both do. And they nail it. I think that's one of the best parts of the film."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe not the prettiest accent to listen to, but necessary for the geography."
"__MOVIES__ Even if Casey Affleck might be a questionable person, I'd say it's still worth watching the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I got my Woody Allen goggles ready to go."
