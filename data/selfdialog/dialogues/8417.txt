"__BEATLES__ I know you're probably too young, but do you know anything about the Beetles?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, my parents used to listen to their songs when I was a kid."
"__BEATLES__ Did you like their songs?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I remember liking a few of them a lot."
"__BEATLES__ Like which ones?"
"__BEATLES__ 'Let it Be' and 'Hey Jude' I liked a lot."
"__BEATLES__ I liked those too, but I got sick of hearing them on the radio a lot. So I mostly like the ones that weren't as popular."
"__BEATLES__ Oh really? Like which ones?"
"__BEATLES__ When my sisters and I were little, we used to love the song 'Anna'. I don't think that one ever got any air play on the radio."
"__BEATLES__ The good songs usually don't."
