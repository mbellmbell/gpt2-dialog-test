"__MUSIC__ Do you like Bruno Mars?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to really dislike that 'Grenade' song. He has a good voice, though."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard anything he's released recently?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't really like his older stuff so I have pretty much ignored it."
"__MUSIC__ You have to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Why? Is it good?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if you'd like it or not, but it's just funny how different it is from his old songs."
"__MUSIC__ Different in what way?"
"__MUSIC__ It's seriously like a flashback to funkadelic music of the past."
"__MUSIC__ What a weird decision on his part. That's cool though."
"__MUSIC__ It kind of sounds like Parliament."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'm definitely interested in checking it out now."
"__MUSIC__ If you do, listen to the song '24K Magic'."
"__MUSIC__ That just sounds like a funkadelic song title."
"__MUSIC__ Watch the video along with it. The whole thing is like a blast from the past."
"__MUSIC__ It's actually cool he's changing it up a bit."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, music needs fresh ideas like that."
"__MUSIC__ I honestly think he needed it too. He was a bit one-dimensional before."
"__MUSIC__ Combine a really unique style with a really talented voice and it's going to be great."
"__MUSIC__ I have to agree. A lot of artists have the voice, but don't stand out enough."
