"__MOVIES__ Seen any good movies this summer?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've seen a few so far."
"__MOVIES__ What's been the best one you've seen this summer?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing has really blown my mind, but I'd probably have to go with Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I saw that one. Pretty solid."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, 'pretty solid' is a good way to describe it."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of those movies that you have a good time watching, but it doesn't really stick with you."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. I would definitely see part 3 though if they make one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, they'll make one. Those movies are making way too much money to not keep making them."
"__MOVIES__ What have you seen this summer that you've liked?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Wonder Woman the other night; it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. Yeah, I want to see that one."
"__MOVIES__ You have to wonder when people will burn out on the superhero thing."
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, apparently."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like we're just on the edge of oversaturation."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're definitely getting into some lesser known superheroes."
"__MOVIES__ Who knows though, maybe the lesser known superheroes will inject some freshness into that genre."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that, since most people aren't already familiar with the story."
"__MOVIES__ Right. You can only reboot Spider Man so many times."
"__MOVIES__ Haha! Yeah, maybe you're right."
