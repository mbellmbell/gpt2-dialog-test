"__STAR_WARS__ Hey man, how do you weigh in on the Han shot first deal?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Eh, I don't really like talking about that stuff. Lucas kinda ruined a New Hope for me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why? because he changed it around?"
"__STAR_WARS__ it's not just turned around. Making Greedo shoot first took away a lot of Han's coolness."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why does it matter so much? Doesn't it make him more of a good guy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No! Han isn't a good guy in the first place. He's a scoundrel!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't think it was that big a deal and I thought it was good to make him a little nicer."
"__STAR_WARS__ You are killing me, nice? Han isn't nice. He's supposed to be a wild west cowboy type."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, his best friends are a princess, a dog man and a magic boy, how much of a tough guy should he really be?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't I can ever watch star wars with you again."
