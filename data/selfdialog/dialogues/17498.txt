"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean Star Wars: The Force Awakens or Rogue One: A Star Wars Story?"
"__MOVIES__ I meant Rogue One: A Star Wars story."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have seen it, it was fantastic!"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it too!  I wasn't sure about the idea of a Star Wars movie that is not part of the main 'episodes.'"
"__MOVIES__ I agree, there was a high chance that it wouldn't be a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ I did really miss the presence of lightsabers, but there was great action overall."
"__MOVIES__ The movie was definitely different, but overall good."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think this success can continue?"
"__MOVIES__ I hope so!  I am really looking forward to the Han Solo movie."
"__MOVIES__ They are making a movie just about Han Solo?"
"__MOVIES__ They are!  It is a prequel about his back story?"
"__MOVIES__ Who is playing the character of Han Solo?"
"__MOVIES__ A relatively unknown actor named Alden Ehrenreich."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, are any big name actors in the film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Donald Glover is playing the role of Lando Calrissian."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is really exciting I like him!"
"__MOVIES__ He is a great actor, he is also a musician under the name Childish Gambino."
"__MOVIES__ Of course, I know that!  But I think he is a better actor than a musician."
"__MOVIES__ Well, he should be great in a Star Wars movie!"
