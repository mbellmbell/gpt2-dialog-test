"__MUSIC__ Are you listening to classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, from a composer named Frederic Chopin."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of him but it sounds good."
"__MUSIC__ He's good, but I don't think he got much recognition during his lifetime."
"__MUSIC__ People didn't like his music?"
"__MUSIC__ Much of his work is very short compared to other compositions at the time."
"__MUSIC__ Short like modern music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I like to think that he was actually ahead of his time."
"__MUSIC__ What's the name of the song you're listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Prelude Op. 28 Number 4."
"__MUSIC__ Prelude?  Seems like a strange name."
"__MUSIC__ As I said, much of his work is very short compared to other artists."
"__MUSIC__ So what is it a prelude to?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think anything, they're just a set of short songs that he wrote."
"__MUSIC__ And that's why you think he was ahead of his time?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, because instead of creating huge orchestrated pieces, he simply wrote smaller, varying pieces."
"__MUSIC__ That's definitely not very common among classical artists."
"__MUSIC__ Right, most of the work people hear about is very long and in depth like Mozart's symphonies."
"__MUSIC__ I might take the time to investigate some of Chopin's preludes, this one sounds really good."
"__MUSIC__ There's several of them.  I can let you have a listen to the few that I have."
