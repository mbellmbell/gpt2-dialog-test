"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you ever seen any of the Fast & Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, they are awesome action films. I love Vin Diesel."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ And I really admire how they do their car stunts live, they don't just lay back and do the whole thing with CGI."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It takes a lot of effort to do movies the old fashioned way, with special effects and stunts on the set. Props to them for that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, I saw an interview with the cast, and they were really proud of what they achieved on set."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I didn't know how they were going to handle Paul Walker's death, may he rest in peace."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, as I watched that last film he was in, I kept waiting for the character to get killed off."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I absolutely loved that they fashioned a happy ending for him, and he didn't die, he just kind of rode off into the sunset with his family."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree, that was the best possible ending for that character, and a terrific sendoff for Paul Walker."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I didn't expect it, and it is one of my favorite endings of any film. It gave me chills."
