"__MOVIES__ What do you think about actors like Jim Carrey and Eddie Murphy kind of stopping being good?"
"__MOVIES__ It bums me out honestly, Bruce Almighty was Jim Carrey's last real good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Wow has it been that long since he made a good film?"
"__MOVIES__ It really has, I guess Yes, Man can be considered alright but it's just Liar Liar again."
"__MOVIES__ True, it's a shame to see old comedians fall low."
"__MOVIES__ Although I think he was pretty good in Kickass."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow I forgot he was in that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah him and Nicolas Cage had great roles in those films."
"__MOVIES__ That's something nice to think about, actors who show up in unexpected ways."
"__MOVIES__ Oh like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god I think that's one of the best examples."
"__MOVIES__ Right, I couldn't believe it was him when someone told me."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wait you didn't realize off the bat it was him?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, I was in the theater and thought the character was great and had no idea."
"__MOVIES__ That's such a great surprise then."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed it is, one of the highlights of a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think Tropic Thunder is a classic comedy, Stiller and company did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ They did, Robert Downey Jr. played a great part."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I almost forgot about his black face role, hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah pushed the right buttons while towing a fine line."
