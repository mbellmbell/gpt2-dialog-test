"__DISNEY__ What's your all time favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that's a tough one...I guess I'd have to say The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I would have thought you'd be more of a Disney princess fan."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I am, but the Lion King is probably my all time favorite movie. It's a masterpiece!"
"__DISNEY__ Mine too! There are so many powerful moments. Like when Simba sees his father in the sky, or when Nala and Simba finally reunite."
"__DISNEY__ So true. My favorite part is when Simba is with Timon and Pumba though. It's so whimsical and takes away from the pain you feel for Simba after he loses his Dad."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I hated Scar for that. And for locking up Zazu. And pretty much everything. Scar was the worst!"
"__DISNEY__ He really was but in the best possible way. He's the type of villain you love to hate."
"__DISNEY__ I have it on DVD, you should come over and watch this weekend."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely! We can have a sing-along! I can't wait!"
