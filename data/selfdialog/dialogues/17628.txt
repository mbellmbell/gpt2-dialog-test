"__MOVIES__ I just saw Boss Baby."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not very good at all.  My kids were disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ Why was it so bad?"
"__MOVIES__ It just felt like the script was so workshopped and had so many overdone pop culture references."
"__MOVIES__ I don't like when they do that. Who was in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It starred Alec Baldwin, who played the baby."
"__MOVIES__ Wow I'm surprised. Usually his movies are great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I was surprised too."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Lisa Kudrow in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she played Baldwin's mom."
"__MOVIES__ Was there anything good about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was silly and did not really teach any lessons, which my kids loved, but I like when there's a greater message."
"__MOVIES__ I can understand that, especially because you want your kids to learn something."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, but I suppose not everything can teach our kids."
"__MOVIES__ My kids were asking to see it, but I guess I won't take them now."
"__MOVIES__ You can take them, they will probably enjoy it; it's just a little rough for parents."
"__MOVIES__ I'll ask if them if they want to go this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Let me know what they think."
"__MOVIES__ I will!"
