"__BASEBALL__ I think that steroids in baseball were the greatest thing to happen."
"__BASEBALL__ What, wait? Why?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, there were a ton of home runs, all mammoth."
"__BASEBALL__ You think home runs are the best play in baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Of course! No one wants to watch a 1-0 strikeout fest."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, some old people do. But they're old, so what do they know?"
"__BASEBALL__ That was unnecessary. Anyway, they also got attendance to skyrocket."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I've noticed that too, and that it's gone down since steroids were made illegal."
"__BASEBALL__ People like seeing home runs, and catching them. They love the home run derby."
"__BASEBALL__ True. But what about them being role models?"
"__BASEBALL__ They aren't role models unless they declare themselves to be."
"__BASEBALL__ But kids will blindly follow people they look up to."
"__BASEBALL__ That's a result of bad parenting. It's their job to say 'Don't take steroids.'"
"__BASEBALL__ You've clearly never been a parent."
"__BASEBALL__ That's ... apparent, ha! So what do you think should happen to those who use steroids in MLB?"
"__BASEBALL__ They should be suspended."
"__BASEBALL__ Why, it's their bodies! They can do what they want."
"__BASEBALL__ Because it gives them a CLEAR advantage that others cannot have."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they shouldn't be illegal in the first place."
"__BASEBALL__ We'll have to disagree on this."
