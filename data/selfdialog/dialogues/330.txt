"__MUSIC__ Do you like Fall Out Boy?"
"__MUSIC__ I did back when I was in middle school. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ They just came out with a new single and I was wondering if you'd heard it."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't realize they were still putting out new music."
"__MUSIC__ They just released a new song called Champion."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have a new album coming out too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they have a new album coming out in September."
"__MUSIC__ What is the title of the album going to be?"
"__MUSIC__ The album is titled Mania."
"__MUSIC__ How long has it been since they last put out a record?"
"__MUSIC__ Not that long. Their last album was called American Beauty/American Psycho and that was released in 2015."
"__MUSIC__ That's so weird. I really had it in my head for some reason that they'd broken up."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they did go on a hiatus for a few years."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that must be why. I'm excited I was wrong!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah their newer music since starting back up again has been pretty good. Their sound is evolving I think."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. It's great watching bands grow creatively over time."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. And Patrick Stump and Pete Wentz still make a pretty good songwriting team."
"__MUSIC__ Have any of their new songs been as good as their original stuff, do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ There hasn't been anything quite as iconic as From Under the Cork Tree, but it's all pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I'm going to go listen to Champion."
