"__DISNEY__ Did you see the Beauty and the Beast film with Emma Watson?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I saw it in theaters. It's out on DVD now."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think Emma Watson was the best actress to play Belle."
"__DISNEY__ She was a bit meek in the role, but it is a hard role to fill."
"__DISNEY__ Dan Stevens was phenomenal as the beast. Great actor."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. He did a great job with the role, even though he was a computer graphic character for most of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Most of the film had to be. I guess that is the hardest part about making an animated movie live-action."
"__DISNEY__ With all the talking objects like Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts, it is a wonder they even attempted to film it. Technology today made it possible."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder what Disney movie they will attempt to film next."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they film Sleeping Beauty. That film is one of my favorites."
