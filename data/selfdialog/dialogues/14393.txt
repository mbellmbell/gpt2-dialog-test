"__HORROR__ What is a really scary movie we could watch?"
"__HORROR__ I really liked Paranormal Activity. It was so creepy."
"__HORROR__ That's the one about the demon that follows the couple."
"__HORROR__ Yes. I think those types of movies are so much scarier than bad guy movies."
"__HORROR__ Why?"
"__HORROR__ Well, a bad guy you can get rid of. An evil ghost though, well, that's a lot harder."
"__HORROR__ What about Mike Myers? He kept coming back."
"__HORROR__ True."
"__HORROR__ I think I'd just rather not be hunted by anything, ghost or human."
"__HORROR__ I totally agree!"
