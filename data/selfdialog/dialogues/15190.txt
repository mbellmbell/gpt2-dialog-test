"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, I just saw the whole Harry Potter series, again, for the second time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think the second time round?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ There was a lot of deep stuff I missed the first time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Like what?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, for one that Luna can see the ghost horses only those whom have seen death can."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yep, shows she has seen some awful things."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Then it went on to show her life at home, her dad seemed off."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that is what made her complex. She was more than just a kid, she had seen a lot of death and sadness."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But she still kept the sort of sad but happy tone to herself."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it was meant to show that even young people can grown from despair, it changes them, but they can still be happy in their selves."
