"__DISNEY__ Did you hear that Disney is making a fourth Toy Story movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I hadn't heard that. When is it coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ It'll be in theaters next July I think."
"__DISNEY__ How long has it been since the last movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Toy Story 3 came out in 2010 I think."
"__DISNEY__ Seven years seems like a long time to go between sequels."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but I think an even longer period passed between when Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3 came out."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. Do you think it's a good idea for them to make another sequel?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure. I thought Toy Story 3 wrapped up the franchise pretty well so I'm surprised they're doing another one."
"__DISNEY__ I'm surprised too. I hope it's good but I guess we'll just have to wait and see."
