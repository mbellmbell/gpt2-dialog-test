"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Almost time for the NFL season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Indeed! Training camp starts soon, doesn't it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, July 22nd. And the first preseason game is August 3rd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When does the regular season start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ September 7th. First game of the season is the Chiefs at the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That should be a good game. The Chiefs have been surprisingly good the last few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they went 12-4 last season. Lost the divisional playoff to the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Packers fan. Who do they play week 1?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're at home vs the Seahawks for their first game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I have hated the Seahawks ever since the Fail Mary game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which was that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a 2012 Packers-Seahawks game played with the replacement refs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, right! They didn't call pass interference so the Seahawks won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. The thought of that game still makes my blood boil a bit!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's understandable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This week one Giants at Cowboys game should be interesting too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I am so curious to see how the Cowboys do this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, putting all their chips on Dak Prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope for their sake he doesn't get a case of the sophomore slumps!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he does, you can bet Tony Romo will be laughing all the way to the bank."
