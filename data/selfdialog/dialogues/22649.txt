"__DISNEY__ Which is your favorite of the three Toy Story movies?"
"__DISNEY__ My favorite is the original, for sure. I love the scenes when Buzz and Woody are at Sid's house."
"__DISNEY__ I like the tea party scene when Buzz says 'I am Mrs. Nesbitt!' Like he's brainwashed or something!"
"__DISNEY__ Which is your favorite of the three movies?"
"__DISNEY__ My favorite is Toy Story 2, because I like Jessie and Bullseye a lot."
"__DISNEY__ I like all of the Al's Toy Barn scenes."
"__DISNEY__ Even though Al was sort of a bad guy in the movie, his store did look like a lot of fun!"
"__DISNEY__ The song that Jessie sings is so sad, though!"
"__DISNEY__ It is. At least she ended up with a happy family that loves her."
"__DISNEY__ Much better than being forced to ship off to a museum and never be played with!"
