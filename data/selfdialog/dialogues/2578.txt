"__MUSIC__ I'm so excited I get to see Rhett and Link in person in December!!"
"__MUSIC__ Who are they? Some kind of band?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, yeah, sort of. They're going to be performing some of their music."
"__MUSIC__ What does that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they're a YouTube comedy duo that do a lot of music, so they're going to do that and sketches at their show."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Like I said, it's comedy, but they sing a lot of different genres like pop, rap, country, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like quite the variety."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and their songs are so funny! My favourite one is about being afraid of the dark."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, okay. What else do they sing about?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so many things. Belly buttons, best friends, bbq, even water tabs!"
"__MUSIC__ ...How do you make a song about water tabs?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's a pretend break up song because no one ever wants to use the water dispensing tab at a restaurant."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that's kinda weird. How long have they been doing this?"
"__MUSIC__ They've been creating music online since 2007, but they've been best friends since they met in 1st grade--over thirty years ago."
"__MUSIC__ That's a long time! So can they actually sing, or do they autotune it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they actually sing really well. Their harmonies are really great."
"__MUSIC__ Impressive. Where did you say I'd find them?"
"__MUSIC__ On their YouTube channels, RhettandLink and Good Mythical Morning, and also on Google Play."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, I know what I'm listening to this afternoon!"
