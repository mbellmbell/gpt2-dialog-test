"__MOVIES__ Hey dude, have you seen any of the Avengers movies that have come out?"
"__MOVIES__ I only saw the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it at all?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was fairly good, but it felt a little cliche."
"__MOVIES__ What? I don't think it was cliche at all."
"__MOVIES__ You don't think it was just another superhero movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was but it had all of the big superheros."
"__MOVIES__ That part was cool, but other than that I think the movie felt a little stale."
"__MOVIES__ Nah I think the action was awesome. I love Iron Man."
"__MOVIES__ His character was funny at least, and I like the actor that plays him."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I think he fit's the character pretty well."
"__MOVIES__ Something I didn't like was how heavily they relied on animation."
"__MOVIES__ Animation is the future though, it looks so good."
"__MOVIES__ I think when they do a lot of animation like they did in this movie, the quality of it starts to slip."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, I don't think so at all. There were a lot of very pretty animated scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Some of them were definitely enjoyable to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I like the big fight scene they had at the end."
"__MOVIES__ That was fun, but that's probably the best part of the whole movie."
"__MOVIES__ You can say what you want, but that movie was great and it had all my favorite characters."
"__MOVIES__ I just think it could have been better directed and had a better story."
