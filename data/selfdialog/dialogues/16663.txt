"__MOVIES__ What do you think are some of the worst movie remakes?"
"__MOVIES__ I think one of the worst was Ben Hur."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that really bombed. It didn't even earn back the production cost."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the original Fantastic Four, but couldn't stand the remake."
"__MOVIES__ One I saw that was a waste of time was Footloose."
"__MOVIES__ What didn't you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was too much like the original. I expected something different."
"__MOVIES__ I heard the remake of Conan the Barbarian was pretty bed."
"__MOVIES__ You just don't mess with Arnold Schwarzenegger movies."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see the remake to Clash of the Titans, but a friend of mine did and thought it was pretty bad."
"__MOVIES__ I think some movies are classics and shouldn't be messed with."
"__MOVIES__ There is a remake coming out, though that I think will be good."
"__MOVIES__ What movie is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Jumanji.."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked that one, although I don't think the sequel was that good."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they do something different enough to make it interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yes or otherwise it will end up like all of the over remake flops."
"__MOVIES__ I already know part of the storyline is different."
"__MOVIES__ I guess we'll find out when it gets released."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so."
