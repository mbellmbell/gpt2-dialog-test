"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you think about the Luke Hobbs character?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wait, who's that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He's Dwayne Johnson's character in the Fast & Furious series."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, right. I like him."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I do, too. I just felt like they threw him in there too suddenly."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's true. He just kind of appeared for Fast Five."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Without any story to carry over, either."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, I'm not sure if you remember this or not."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What's that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Tokyo Drift, chronologically, comes way after any of the others, so by that point, Hobbs was already introduced to the team."
