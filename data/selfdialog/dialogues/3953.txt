"__MUSIC__ It's funny how some songs sound better playing on old, poor fidelity equipment."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I had fond memories of hearing Dionne Warwick's songs on the radio back in 1968."
"__MUSIC__ On a car radio? AM radio, mono, not stereo, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Dionne Warwick had some big hits back then, like 'Do You Know The Way To San Jose', and a lot of others."
"__MUSIC__ Right, right.  And I had fond memories of hearing them all on a crummy quality car radio back then."
"__MUSIC__ So which songs didn't hold up for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I got 'The Very Best of Dionne Warwick', and hadn't heard some of the songs in years."
"__MUSIC__ I remember hearing 'Walk On By' a couple of weeks ago, and it still sounded good."
"__MUSIC__ Almost all of them sounded great with my headphones on, except one song."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Trains And Boats And Planes'. It sounded fine, years ago, on cheap audio equipment."
"__MUSIC__ Did it sound too old-fashioned or corny or sappy or maybe depressing, like her '(Theme From) Valley Of The Dolls'?"
"__MUSIC__ No, no. I still loved the song, but there was one feature in the way the song was recorded that ruined it for me."
"__MUSIC__ What was it? There's a lot of songs ruined by too much high cymbal-playing or muddy bass..."
"__MUSIC__ It was an awful wah-wah pedal off to one side of the song! It sounded like an elephant sneezing. For the whole song."
"__MUSIC__ Could you get rid of it by turning down the treble or something?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I even tried running the song through some noise reduction software to get rid of that awful, disturbing sound."
"__MUSIC__ You've got me wanting to listen to that song now just so I can hear what you're talking about."
