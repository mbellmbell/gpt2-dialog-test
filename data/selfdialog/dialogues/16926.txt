"__MOVIES__ Hey! Did you see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I did! It was awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree. I didn't think it could be better than the first, but it might actually be!"
"__MOVIES__ For sure! What were your favorite parts?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, it is really hard to say for sure. I of course loved any scenes with Rocket Raccoon and Groot."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! They are the best! I couldn't get enough of Baby Groot!"
"__MOVIES__ I know I know! And wasn't Yondu great too?"
"__MOVIES__ He was! You know, I really wanted to dislike his character because of some of things he did in the last movie, but he completed redeemed himself in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree; he ended up being a hero and one of my favorite characters!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! And that 'I'm Mary Poppins y'all!' line was incredible!"
"__MOVIES__ You're right! It might have been the best line of the whole movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I couldn't stop laughing. Where do you think the story might lead next?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure; there are so many things they could do for Guardians 3...not to mention how this movie might fit into the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"__MOVIES__ For sure! I think for Guardians 3 they are definitely going to introduce Adam Warlock, especially after what we saw in Guardians 2!"
"__MOVIES__ I hope so! That would be great! I really liked how they also showed the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' in the post-credit scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I know! It was a great bonus!"
"__MOVIES__ I might actually go see it again! I wonder if, on a second viewing, I might even catch something I missed?"
"__MOVIES__ I am with you; I would love to see it again! I bet there totally some Easter Eggs we didn't see the first time!"
"__MOVIES__ For sure! I can't wait to see it again now that I think about. You want to tag along?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, sounds great! Let's go!"
