"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So, listen to any rap hip/hop lately?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Actually, I just got done watching the new video for XO TOUR Llif3 by Lil Uzi Vert."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, what did you think?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The video is freaking WEIRD, man.  The whole is like a single gif picture of this guy (I presume the artist) driving in his car with a red and blue gradient pattern where the window would be."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ A gif?  What do you mean?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, the whole thing is like a cartoon with just four or five frames of animation looped endlessly while he's singing. I think it's intentional badly drawn as part of the 'style'."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, they call that 'Stylistic Suck' on the TV Tropes website."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, didn't know that.. haven't to look that up.  Anyway, I don't know, the song itself is okay, I guess.  I'm biased though, it's not really my type of music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, to each is own."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Another thing that bugs me about the image though is they've got a badly drawn nose ring coming out of the guy's nostrils, but it looks to me like he's got a runny nose!"
