"__THRILLER__ Do you like the 'Taken' movies?"
"__THRILLER__ I loved the first Taken movie.  I did not see the others."
"__THRILLER__ Liam Neeson is such an imposing character as Bryan."
"__THRILLER__ His 'I will find you' monologue is one of my all-time favorites in all movies."
"__THRILLER__ It was so well done.  That makes it all the more disappointing that the sequels were so weak."
"__THRILLER__ Did Pierre Morel direct the other two as well?"
"__THRILLER__ No.  Taken 2 and 3 were directed by Olivier Megaton."
"__THRILLER__ I see.  I wish they just stopped at the first one, since it was so good as a standalone."
"__THRILLER__ Did you know there was a Taken television series too?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes I did.  I didn't find it fun, but it was renewed by NBC for a second season."
