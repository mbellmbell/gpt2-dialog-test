"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what is your favorite sport if you had to pick one?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say football would probably be my choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like the NFL or college football the best?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love them both, but I would pick the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the NFL myself. My family and I are huge New York Giant fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool, I love the Broncos personally."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet you sure enjoyed that run that Peyton Manning took them on, huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Peyton and I am really glad that we were able to sign him. However, it was our defense that finally won us a Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that was a pretty gifted defense that you guys had assembled the season before last."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that Von Miller really got us that Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he was very dominant and still is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he is the best player in the league right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is kind of hard to argue to be honest with you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being a Giants fan, you know all about Superbowl victories, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it has been a while at this point. I just wish we could get one more and I would be happy for a while!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the pieces are there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I know Eli Manning can get the job done. We have some other great talents as well; I am just not sure about the coaching right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean there. Tom Coughlin is not walking through that door anytime soon!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish he was still the coach to be honest. I know he had some bad years, but he would have fixed things!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I mean he did win two Superbowls."
