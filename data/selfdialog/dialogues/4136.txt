"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Madonna?"
"__MUSIC__ I liked some of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ I liked some of them, too."
"__MUSIC__ I really didn't care for her as a person."
"__MUSIC__ She has done a good job staying relevant for 30 plus years."
"__MUSIC__ Has she really?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she has.  She's always trying to reinvent herself."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think some of these have been for the better."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ At a certain point just act your age.  She is in her late 50s."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but she still looks good for being that old."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think she has ever really looked good."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, come on.  She was pretty attractive in the 80s and 90s."
"__MUSIC__ She wasn't bad look, but she was no beauty queen either."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's why her music was so good because she wasn't a beauty queen."
"__MUSIC__ I do think it helped add some emotion to her songs."
"__MUSIC__ She lived a life before becoming super famous."
"__MUSIC__ I think that helps artist.  To have some life experience before writing and singing songs."
"__MUSIC__ So if you had to give Madonna an overall score for her music.  What would you give her?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, she's first ballot hall of fame.  She's an icon, no doubt."
