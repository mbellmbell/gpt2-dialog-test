"__MOVIES__ I can't wait for the next Star Wars movie to come out!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought the last one was terrible!"
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like seeing Leia and Luke and Han again?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, no, I meant the most recent one."
"__MOVIES__ Rogue One?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that one! It was awful."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, first off, that's a prequel, so the next movie won't have to do with that one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that explains why none of the normal characters were in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah yeah, no, this next one's going to be about Rey and Luke. Didn't you see the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I just wasn't paying that much attention since I disliked Rogue One so much."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Rogue One was fantastic myself; why didn't you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I just thought there was way too much death, it was so sad at the end."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, it kinda had to happen that way so that the rest of the series could play out the way it did, but I guess I thought the craftsmanship was good."
"__MOVIES__ It did have a nice tone, but couldn't they have let just one person survive?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it wasn't really that kind of film. This was more of a war movie than anything Star Wars has done before, so."
"__MOVIES__ I'm just used to the old style where it's more light and fun."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't think the new one will have as much death in it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know when it comes out?"
"__MOVIES__ Sometime in December, I think."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, then I'll wait for reviews and see if it sounds like it's worth the ticket."
