"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the 49ers this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might be better or not.  You really can't tell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they made one move that they should have done years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the offensive line has been horrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They finally made a move to plug all the holes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kap was running for his life the last couple of years.  Them not fixing the line was a clear message."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The niners have been on cruise control for a few years now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They made a change at head coach again.  Wonder if this one will stick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really screwed up when they got rid of Harbaugh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they got a new coach again and it will be interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is not like he has to do anything special.  He just has to be better than last year, which is not saying much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have totally changed over the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The free agent moves and the draft seems like an upgrade from the past teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, some of the problems were clear."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is a brand new year, but niner fans are not going to get their hopes up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  It has been a downward decline ever since Coach Harbaugh left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The new quarterbacks are just a bunch of place holders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the Shanahan offense, they might not need to be that good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they don't have to be great. The expectations are going to be low."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some niner fans are going to believe the hype out of the gate."
