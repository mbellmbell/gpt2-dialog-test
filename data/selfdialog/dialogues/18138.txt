"__MOVIES__ What do you think is the better series Harry Potter or Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm.  They're both great but for different reasons."
"__MOVIES__ You mean how Star Wars is more intense.  It's just strap in from the first second."
"__MOVIES__ And how Harry Potter is more fun."
"__MOVIES__ So I guess it depends on what mood I'm in.  The first 5 Harry Potter movies Hogwarts seems like a fun place."
"__MOVIES__ And most of Star Wars the Galaxy seems pretty bad.  Especially on Tattoine."
"__MOVIES__ So which was the best of each franchise?"
"__MOVIES__ Empire for Star Wars, and Half Blood Prince for Harry Potter."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, those were awesome movies."
"__MOVIES__ Although out of those two, I think Empire Strikes back was way better."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe better but not a lot better."
"__MOVIES__ Well there was the big reveal at the end of Empire."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but many of us knew that before we saw it."
"__MOVIES__ So you're saying the Dumpledore death was more of a surprise?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying."
"__MOVIES__ However Empire was more ground breaking."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was, just as much as the original movie."
"__MOVIES__ And it showed why Vader is the baddest bad guy who ever graced the silver screen."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Voldy was bad."
"__MOVIES__ But he was no Vader."
