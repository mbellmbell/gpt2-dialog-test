"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HAHA. I got that reference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah going back to the good old days of football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the days that we had John Madden to talk about cankles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to be cheering for the Bears this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, especially now that they got rid of Jay Cutler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know it is about time that they got rid of that dead weight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He just needed to know when to throw the ball away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, that made it so he got picked off way too often and his arm went from an asset to a liability."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did have a great arm which we could see in some flashes of greatness, but that is all they were flashes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and his personality was horrible for the team, fans, and the media."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that is why you got the smoking Jay Cutler meme."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also liked when Martellis Bennett Trashed him on the ESPN interview last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was great, but he not only trashed Jay, but the whole organization."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And it really showed that the whole organization needs a shake up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree starting from the top lets get some new owners in there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ownership and do great things for an organization look at the ricketts and the Cubs. Great turn around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they should buy the Bears as well and get the McCasky's out of their. They do not care and just know they are going to make money if they win or lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right I guess this is going to be another year where I probably do not watch football because Da Bears will suck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You and me both brother. it will be another disappointing year in Chicago."
