"__MOVIES__ I went to the movies last weekend and saw Gardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"
"__MOVIES__ I really loved the first one, so what did you think about Vol. 2?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was better than the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Really? How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It seemed to flesh out the stories of some of the other chracters and made you understand what was going on in the first one a bit better."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I got it so it actually made volume one more enjoyable as well?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is exactly it."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ I went back and watched the first guardians movie after seeing volume two."
"__MOVIES__ Could you tell more about the story sequence?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually understood more about Starlord's father."
"__MOVIES__ He plays a pretty big part of his life right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, in vol two it goes into more detail about his father's relationship with his mother."
"__MOVIES__ This sounds great."
"__MOVIES__ It really was and I also thought that this one had more humor."
"__MOVIES__ I had heard it was funny."
"__MOVIES__ I hadn't heard much about it before going to the movies."
"__MOVIES__ I will have to go and check this out."
"__MOVIES__ I left wanting to go back and watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I know I will need to go see it then."
