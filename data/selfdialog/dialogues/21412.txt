"__THRILLER__ So, to me the greatest thriller of all time was Silence of the Lambs."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I loved that movie!  Especially Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter."
"__THRILLER__ He was awesome.  Crazily enough, he's so memorable even though he's only in like twenty minutes of the entire movie."
"__THRILLER__ But you know what I find kind of interesting about that movie?"
"__THRILLER__ What's that?"
"__THRILLER__ It won an Academy Award for best movie of the year, but what's interesting is they labelled it as a 'thriller' instead of a horror film."
"__THRILLER__ So, you think it should have been labelled a horror film?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, of course.  It has a guy going around killing wearing so he can wear their skin.  Yeah, that sounds like horror movie to me."
"__THRILLER__ Why do you think they called it a thriller though?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, cause horror movies in general aren't popular with the Hollywood Elite.  They're considered 'low art' by many."
