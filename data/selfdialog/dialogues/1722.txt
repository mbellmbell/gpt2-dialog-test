"__MUSIC__ Do you like that song 'Applause' by Lady Gaga?"
"__MUSIC__ Which one is that? How does it go?"
"__MUSIC__ 'I live for the applause, applause, applause. I live for the applause-plause...'"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think I've heard it."
"__MUSIC__ It is a really good song."
"__MUSIC__ I'll look it up. Do you have any other suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ Look up 'My House' by Flo Rida."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard that one, actually."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of it?"
"__MUSIC__ It is very catchy, but I don't know if it's my cup of tea."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's just that Flo Rida is a cheesy pop artist."
"__MUSIC__ 'My House' is very much a musical masterpiece as much as it is a commercial hit."
"__MUSIC__ There must be something I'm missing, then."
"__MUSIC__ When you get the chance, listen to it again. This time, let the song change you."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds a little dramatic."
"__MUSIC__ You have no idea how much idea I love this song."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have any other suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ How about 'My Confessions' by Usher?"
"__MUSIC__ Now I know you're joking!"
