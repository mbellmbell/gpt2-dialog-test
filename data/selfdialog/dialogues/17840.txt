"__MOVIES__ What kind of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like horror movies or thrillers."
"__MOVIES__ Me too!  What is your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the old Nightmare on Elm Streets."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! There is something about those older movies that nobody can seem to recreate."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I know they redid Nightmare on Elm Street and spin offs like Freddy vs. Jason, but they just aren't the same."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  You can't beat the originals.  Halloween is another good one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I love that one.  I like how when the did revamp it, they still included Jamie Lee Curtis."
"__MOVIES__ That was pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ I don't mind the newer remakes of the movies, but they will never be as good as the originals."
"__MOVIES__ What original horror movie would you want to recreate?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it would be cool to redo Friday the Thirteenth."
"__MOVIES__ Oh it would be!  I loved those movies when I was a kid.  Who would you cast as Jason?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a good question....I'm not really sure."
"__MOVIES__ That would be tough to cast that role.  Do you like comedies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do. I love anything with Will Ferrell.  He's a riot!"
"__MOVIES__ I like him in Step Brothers."
"__MOVIES__ I really like Zach Effron and The Rock too.  They're so funny together."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they are!  I can't wait to see them in Baywatch."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah...that should be coming out soon.  I'm not missing that one!"
