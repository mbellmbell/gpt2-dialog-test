"__ACTION__ John Wick 2 is a beautifully shot film."
"__ACTION__ You're not kidding. Tons of wide shots."
"__ACTION__ Right. Yeah. Great choreography."
"__ACTION__ And the editing."
"__ACTION__ The editing is particularly impressive in that there are actually a lot of long takes."
"__ACTION__ None of that crappy two second shot lengths like in a lot of action films."
"__ACTION__ Sure,  Quantum of Solace feels so long be cause it has about a  million edits in it."
"__ACTION__ It's the shortest James Bond film, but it feels like the longest."
"__ACTION__ And that's why John Wick 2 feels so great. The action is very fluid and not chopped up."
"__ACTION__ It means you can appreciate things like the pencil scene."
