"__HORROR__ So, do you think of a lot of the modern horror films coming out?"
"__HORROR__ I don't know, I don't really care for too many of them."
"__HORROR__ Why not?"
"__HORROR__ Seems like most of them these days are just pointless jump scares.  to me, jump scares are NOT horror, it's just a cheap trick anyone can do."
"__HORROR__ Ahhh... like Paranormal Activity."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, exactly... and what tare they up to on those now, like fifty or something?"
"__HORROR__ Well, what I don't are all these remakes of GOOD horror films."
"__HORROR__ Oh, tell me about.. like The Thing?  What the hell?  All that crappy CGI."
"__HORROR__ Actually, I think that was supposed to be a prequel to the original."
"__HORROR__ Well, either way, it sucked."
