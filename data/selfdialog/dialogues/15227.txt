"__HARRY_POTTER__ So I finally saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Finally! I mean, really, it was about time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was so great. It really brought the books to life for me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it is interesting how the movies started so light and blissful and got so dark before culminating in Deathly Hallows."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, it is like the movie content matured with the age of the actors."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, did you like the older or newer movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is a tough question."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How so?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked them all, but for different reasons."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess I cannot really pick a favorite either."
