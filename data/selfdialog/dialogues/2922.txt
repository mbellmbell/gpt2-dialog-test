"__MUSIC__ Well this is awesome I am listening to 311. I love them1"
"__MUSIC__ They are ok I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ My  husband used to be in a 311 Tribute band so he is playing live in the living room right now while he's listening to a video playlist on t.v."
"__MUSIC__ How cool that would make it a gazilion times better to hear it live."
"__MUSIC__ He toured around with this band in the southeast for about a year and I went to quite a few out of town gigs and the ones in town as well."
"__MUSIC__ How fun! Did you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes it was a blast! 311 fans are fun energy."
"__MUSIC__ Have you been to 311 concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes several in Atlanta. The I took my son and my boy friend/future husband to Memphis for 311 day. Their birthdays are son 3/8 and husband 3/10."
"__MUSIC__ How nice of you1"
"__MUSIC__ Oh it was so much fun! The concert was over 5 hrs long and we stood and danced at our seats for just about the whole time."
"__MUSIC__ I like them and Sublime. They are very similar."
"__MUSIC__ Good vibes from 311 music. The words as well as the instrumental part."
"__MUSIC__ The last time I went to 311 I took my son's girlfriend/future wife with us to the concert. She enjoyed it after Snoop Dog got off stage."
"__MUSIC__ What was Snoop Dog doing there?"
"__MUSIC__ He was opening for them. I was excited to get to see him but it was really crappy."
"__MUSIC__ Wow what did he do that left such a bad feeling?"
"__MUSIC__ It was just to crass of a show to go with 311's laid back vibe. It was very abrasive."
"__MUSIC__ Can't win them all"
"__MUSIC__ True so true. See you later at the party!"
