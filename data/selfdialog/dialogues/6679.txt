"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, what was one of the biggest shocks in Stars Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean by biggest shock?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, the most shocking or unexpected revealation in the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the whole 'Luke, I am your Father' was a doozy when you first learned it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was definitley not something you'd see coming."
"__STAR_WARS__ Them there's the whole Luke and Leia are brother and sister thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, don't remind me, makes the whole kiss on Hoth a bit akward."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, goes from ' You lucky so and so' to ' I hear banjos, run!'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Other than that, I can't think of any more real shocking revealtions."
"__STAR_WARS__ Neither can I, since with the prequels we all knew where we were going in the end."
