"__BEATLES__ Hey, are you a Beatles fan?"
"__BEATLES__ Not really. I think their music is too old. I know about Love me Do and the old-sounding stuff."
"__BEATLES__ I don't think it's old-sounding! I like the later psychedelic stuff like Helter Skelter."
"__BEATLES__ I'm actually into more 90's music."
"__BEATLES__ I see. Do you like Oasis?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, definitely!"
"__BEATLES__ Well, they are really into the Beatles, and you can hear the influence in their music."
"__BEATLES__ Really? Maybe I should give them a try. What album do you recommend?"
"__BEATLES__ I'd start with the classic Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and then Rubber Soul."
"__BEATLES__ My sister has Rubber Soul on CD. I'll give it a try."
