"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what do you think of the Detroit Lions this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I think it may be the same old Lions again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think they might actually have a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A chance for what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe making it into the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, I guess you can always dream about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they certainly won't ever be able to top their season in 2008 where they went 0-16."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully that's not a performance they will ever want to repeat!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, now that they have Martha Ford at the head of the organization, we will need to see what happens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their record wasn't too bad this past year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, 9-7."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certainly got them into the playoffs as a wild card!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read somewhere that most of the other pro sports teams in Michigan aren't doing well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True!  It's kind of sad when the Lions are our best chance to get into the NFL playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are many people who still keep up hope.  The Lions seem to be getting their roar back again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they just hired some new folks to change up their logo and marketing. Maybe that will help!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I certainly hope so, I hope that with the refresh, they will be able to continue to look forward."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At the very least, it won't hurt them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We definitely need to break the streak and go to the Super Bowl this coming year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, 60 years of no Super Bowl is definitely enough!"
