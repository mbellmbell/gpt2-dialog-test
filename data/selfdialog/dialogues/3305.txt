"__MUSIC__ Who are you listening to right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I've got an old Luke Bryan CD playing."
"__MUSIC__ I liked some of his stuff, but his newer stuff seems a lot less country."
"__MUSIC__ I think you could say that about all country music in general."
"__MUSIC__ I guess so, it seems like pop and country are getting closer and closer every year."
"__MUSIC__ You don't like the crossover? Too much of a purist?"
"__MUSIC__ I think there is value in both, but what is Kid Rock doing making country music, or Nelly?"
"__MUSIC__ I think its great that its becoming more popular, everybody loves trucks and cowboy boots."
"__MUSIC__ There used to be more to country than trucks and girls and boots."
"__MUSIC__ I think at its core, country was always about those things."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know that I agree. There is that old saying about what you get if you play a country song backwards."
"__MUSIC__ Your dog, truck, and house back? That's exactly what I'm saying."
"__MUSIC__ I think there used to be more emotion in country. It was more about the feelings and lifestyle than just the boots."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but there's barely any country in some country music."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if it gets any moer country than 'Drinkin beer and Wastin Bullets'."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know that song."
"__MUSIC__ It's an older Luke Bryan. It's about deer hunting."
"__MUSIC__ Well that is pretty country, but its still recreational. It's not living off the land."
"__MUSIC__ Um, deer are off the land. And if you get one, you get to eat it."
"__MUSIC__ I just think country used to be about homesteads and heartbreak, not one night stands and hangovers."
