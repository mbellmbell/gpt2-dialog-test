"__HORROR__ What's your favorite way to watch horror movies?"
"__HORROR__ Alone, on my computer, in the dark, with digital headphones on."
"__HORROR__ Sheesh, that's specific. Why?"
"__HORROR__ It's the best possible way!"
"__HORROR__ How so?"
"__HORROR__ It's the best atmosphere: by yourself and the sound really comes through."
"__HORROR__ I love it in theaters."
"__HORROR__ Why?"
"__HORROR__ The audience is awesome and it's on a huge screen"
"__HORROR__ That's why I can't: if there are teens there they egg each other on and talk the whole time. Irritating."
