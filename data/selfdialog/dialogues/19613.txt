"__MOVIES__ I just saw the movie The Equalizer with Denzel Washington. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ YES! I love that movie and love most of Denzel's movies. I really liked The Bone Collector."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that one. Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Angelina Jolie and Queen Latifah. It's a thriller and really good."
"__MOVIES__ I like Angelina Jolie. Have you seen Salt?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's one of my favorites of hers. Wanted was good, too."
"__MOVIES__ Loved Wanted! Have you seen Maleficent?"
"__MOVIES__ Several times. I really liked it. She's a good actress."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean?"
"__MOVIES__ No, and I doubt I will see it. I didn't even see the last one. I got kind of tired of them, to tell you the truth."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it. It was just okay. More of the same but I still like Jack Sparrow."
"__MOVIES__ i remember the first time seeing Pirates. I thought Jack Sparrow was hilarious. It got old after awhile. Do you like Keanu Reeves?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I love Keanu. I see all of his movies."
"__MOVIES__ I loved John Wick but I haven't seen the sequel yet. I'm going to see it in the next week or two."
"__MOVIES__ You are going to love John Wick 2. I didn't think it would be as good as the first one but it was."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see it but I like to wait until it's been there for weeks to see a movie. That way I almost have the theater to myself."
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha, I do the same thing. I sit on the opposite side of the theater from anyone else. I'll probably go see The Mummy next week."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I'll see The Mummy but I'm looking forward to the other Universal Monster movies. Like Jekyll & Hyde and Bride of Frankenstein."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder who is going to star in those movies. Do you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Russell Crowe is going to be Dr. Jekyll and I think they're trying to get Angelina Jolie for The Bride. Sounds like two good ones if they do them."
