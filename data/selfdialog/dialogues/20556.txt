"__MOVIES__ DUUUUDE!! Have you seen the movie Tusk?"
"__MOVIES__ No? What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's directed by Kevin Smith. And it's insane."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ This dude turns another dude into a fraking walrus, man."
"__MOVIES__ A walrus? Like the animal?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, bruh. It's intense. But it's by Smith so it's funny too."
"__MOVIES__ Funny? How is getting turned into an animal funny?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, just the dialouge. Plus, Johnny Depp is in."
"__MOVIES__ Depp? No kidding. I like him."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. Depp. And Justin Long. And some other really cool cats."
"__MOVIES__ I might just have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You should, man. I have to warn you though. It's pretty gory."
"__MOVIES__ Gory like the saw movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Kinda. It just messes with your mind."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe Smith did a movie like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Especially since he does the Jay and Silent Bob stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Fraking stoner. I love the guy."
"__MOVIES__ Me, too. He's the best"
"__MOVIES__ Totally agree."
