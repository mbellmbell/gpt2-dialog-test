"__ACTION__ Have you seen any of Steven Seagal's movies."
"__ACTION__ Yes, I have seen all his older ones."
"__ACTION__ Why not the new ones."
"__ACTION__ His new ones are pretty low budget B movie face, His 80s and 90s stuff is the best."
"__ACTION__ Which ones are good."
"__ACTION__ Under Siege was one of his best. He is pretty much the only guy free on an Aircraft Carrier and he has to save everyone else."
"__ACTION__ That sounds cool. Wasn't there a sequel."
"__ACTION__ Yes, It was set on a train. It was pretty good too. Eric Bogosian was great as the villain."
"__ACTION__ I will check those out. Any others you would recommend?"
"__ACTION__ Hard to Kill was good, so was Out for Justice. They have lots of action!"
