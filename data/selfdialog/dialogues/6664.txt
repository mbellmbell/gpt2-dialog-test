"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of Boba Fett?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Honestly I think he's overrated."
"__STAR_WARS__ Come on! He's an amazing character."
"__STAR_WARS__ But he barely even speaks!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe I'm a sucker for the strong, silent type. You have to admit his armor was cool though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I will give you that. What did you think of his backstory from Attack of the Clones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was okay, I guess. Not what I was expecting, for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would have been fun to see Boba in Revenge of the Sith, to give more backstory and develop the character."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, but that movie was already full. Where would they have put him in?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right; I'm not sure."
