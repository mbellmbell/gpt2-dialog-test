"__ACTION__ Did you get a chance to see Wonder Woman yet?"
"__ACTION__ Certainly did.  I was surprised by it."
"__ACTION__ How so?"
"__ACTION__ It was much better than I anticipated.  I especially liked the war scene where she ran through the middle."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, that was a very emotional scene and very well-directed."
"__ACTION__ Gal Gadot played the character perfectly throughout."
"__ACTION__ It helps that she's pretty easy on the eyes."
"__ACTION__ That's an understatement.  She's beautiful."
"__ACTION__ I will probably end up seeing it again next week.  Want to go?"
"__ACTION__ Sure.  Let's plan a time."
