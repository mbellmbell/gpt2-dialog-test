"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think there's a certain age where footballer's are just too old to play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately yes, because as you age, you tend to suffer injuries more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read about an ex NFL player who is 48 and attempting a comeback in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would someone want to play when they are past their prime?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His name is Todd Marinovich, he played for the LA Avengers over a decade ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why did he leave football in the first place?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's had substance abuse problems all his life."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drugs really ruin an athlete's career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He originally signed with the Raiders, but was cut before starting from failing drug tests."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know why athletes do drugs when they know how strict the testing is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was arrested just last year over a public scene where he had drugs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what makes him think he should try and play football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He says he's clean now, and since recovery has changed his life, he thinks it would have that same positive effect on his football playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where is he going to play football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's competing for a job with the SoCal Coyotes. They are part of the World Developmental Football League."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has to compete for a job huh? I bet there will be a lot of younger less riskier competitors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It said he will be drug tested every week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe so, but the long term affects of being a drug user are hard on the body."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He supposedly does talks at schools and stuff about how dangerous drugs are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be more likely to listen to someone though that has been clean a long time, rahter than someone who used a long time and has only been clean a year."
