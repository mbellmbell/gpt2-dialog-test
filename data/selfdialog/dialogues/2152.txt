"__MUSIC__ I'm always looking for new music."
"__MUSIC__ Any particular genres?"
"__MUSIC__ Electronic these days. I know rock pretty well, but am always curious about EDM."
"__MUSIC__ How about techno?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I like the overall sound. Did that start out a German thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Not technically, actually. It originated in the Detroit area."
"__MUSIC__ What?! It seems like all that stuff owes something to Kraftwerk."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, it does, but the guys that started it were into them. That's why."
"__MUSIC__ Detroit? Wow, I'd never have guessed. Whereabouts?"
"__MUSIC__ These were mostly guys in the black suburbs of the city. Ones that could afford synthesizers."
"__MUSIC__ I see., but how did they end up with this sound?"
"__MUSIC__ They were into some electro-funk, too, like Parliament Funkadelic's more electronic stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That explains something. It is a bit bassier than some of Kraftwerk's stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. That 'colder' sound reflected the factory automation, which they were protesting."
"__MUSIC__ Over people losing jobs to machines?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It really did have a dystopian sci-fi element to it in the early days when this all came out."
"__MUSIC__ That's one of the bigger shocks I've had learning about music. Crazy."
"__MUSIC__ I was surprised myself. I associate Detroit with all kinds of important music, but wasn't expecting Techno."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess that's what keeps stuff interesting--all the surprises here and there."
"__MUSIC__ Can't argue with that."
