"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie The Great Wall?"
"__MOVIES__ No, is it for tourists?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it is a story about 1000 years ago, on why the Great Wall was built."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, why was it built?"
"__MOVIES__ The story has two guys from Europe that reaches the wall after just surviving an attack by wild animals."
"__MOVIES__ Was it brutal?"
"__MOVIES__ Very, they also described an ancient dragon that has been showing up every once in a while and kills many people."
"__MOVIES__ A flying Dragon?"
"__MOVIES__ No, because the wall would be useless. These dragons would climb the walls and attack the defenders and then the cities around them."
"__MOVIES__ What does the European guys have to do with it?"
"__MOVIES__ At first the Europeans were made prisoners, but were able to save some guards and get freedom."
"__MOVIES__ Did they kill the dragons?"
"__MOVIES__ Some were killed but the Europeans had skills and the Chinese were able to use their skill and finally win."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of skills?"
"__MOVIES__ One of them (Matt Damon) was very good with bow and arrows. The other was good with a sword."
"__MOVIES__ How did they kill the dragons?"
"__MOVIES__ You should see the movie because it has grace, art and poise when fighting the dragons."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds good."
"__MOVIES__ Has a little love story in it too."
"__MOVIES__ I gotta see that."
