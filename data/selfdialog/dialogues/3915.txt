"__MUSIC__ Do you think it is harder to find good music these days?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I hadn't really thought about it. What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I just feel like it all sounds the same pop with hip-hop influences."
"__MUSIC__ Well, then I'd say you aren't looking in the right place! There's a lot of great alternative music right now."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really. I guess I'm not familiar with that genre."
"__MUSIC__ I really like Cold War Kids, but you have Modest Mouse, Kings of Leon, Cage the Elephant, and so many more!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard of none of them!"
"__MUSIC__ I found most of them on Youtube."
"__MUSIC__ How did you find them?"
"__MUSIC__ I started with the song First by Cold War Kids and Youtube automatically made me a playlist of songs like it."
"__MUSIC__ That's a nice feature."
"__MUSIC__ It really is. I found so much music I wouldn't have known about otherwise, like Twenty-One Pilots."
"__MUSIC__ Now them, I've heard of. I don't think I could tell you any of their songs though."
"__MUSIC__ Well, a lot of people know the song Heathens because it was in Suicide Squad, but their other stuff is as good or better."
"__MUSIC__ So if you like that type of music do you like that folk/alternative sound too."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! So much. I love Mumford and Sons, Of Monsters and Men, and the Civil Wars."
"__MUSIC__ I know Mumford and Sons but not the others."
"__MUSIC__ The Civil Wars was a duo, but unfortunately they broke up."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad."
"__MUSIC__ It is because their voices together were hauntingly beautiful."
