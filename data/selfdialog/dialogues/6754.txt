"__STAR_WARS__ You know who would make really cool jedi knights?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jay and Silent Bob?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, they would be the coolest dudes in the galaxy. Cooler than Han."
"__STAR_WARS__ You got that idea from their movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh shucks, you're right. Forgot about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is a good idea though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Silent Bob would look really cool all cloaked up with a light saber."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, I mean the dude already wears a trenchcoat all the time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now Jay would have to be the jedi stricken between the light and the dark side of the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Most definitely, he'd play that fringe type of character, unpredictable and exciting yet torn with a good heart."
