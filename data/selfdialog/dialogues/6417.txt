"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I think he's a neat character I can explain further but I think Chewie is a vital part to his personality."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I can't imagine Han WIthout Chewie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Since you brought it up do you think of Han?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he's a really neat character, he's in short a space cowboy in a highly advanced universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ Never thought of him like a cowboy but I guess if you put a hat on him he would."
"__STAR_WARS__ Answer me this, did Han shoot first?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes that was obvious."
"__STAR_WARS__ No he didn't."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes he did."
