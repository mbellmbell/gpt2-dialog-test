"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos need to step up this year...man, do I want to see them go to the Superbowl again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I absolutely hear that!  Gone are the days of John Elway, but we can always hope a miracle happens and Denver's QB manifests this season with a fraction of Elway's powers, my friend!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if we just have an exciting season will make it worth it...it has been a long time since I viewed a Broncos game that might be deemed boring, one-sided or unsurprsing..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it!  Not a year goes by that the match-ups don't seem fresh..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, even with all the advance technology, player and game data and statistics, etc., at our fingertips, the game still just boils down to the physical game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you planning on seeing any Broncos games if they play here against Dallas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah...I seriously don't want to have my spleen ripped through my nose by disgruntled Cowboys fans!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  Were you ever at a game where the Cowboys lost to the visiting team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Twice.  Once, when the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cowboys, and another when it was actually the Broncos who totally stomped the Cowboys' score-wise...I was chased, both times, by unhappy, inebriated. sore-losing Cowboys fans who were displeased with my choice of fan-wear: a Denver Broncos jersey, of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow!  How'd you get out alive from Cowboys stadium both times?  Ha ha ha!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The first time, I essentially sprinted in terror until I reached my car and locked the doors!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the second time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel a little guilty about it...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guilty?   What in the heck for...?!  Tell me!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, okay.  Yeah, the second time  I was at a game the Cowboys lost, my 'escape strategy' was swapping out my Steelers jersey with a Cowboys jersey in a stall in the men's restroom."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, you've got to be kidding!  You didn't!  Betrayal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, look, seriously...  Am I proud of it?  No.  But when it became apparent the Cowboys weren't going to pull off a tie, much less a score of any kind in the 'not-humiliating' category, I wasn't taking any chances...!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahahaaaa!  You coward...!  Who DOES that in 2017, during NFL season?  Disloyal fan!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't give me a hard time.  Lets watch some NFL Summer Camp footage, huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gimme a beer and the remote, buddy ol' pal!"
