"__MOVIES__ Do you like movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course.  Why what's up?"
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't but I heard it was good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was definitely a great movie.  Surprisingly a real tearjerker too."
"__MOVIES__ No way, really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I don't want to spoil it for you so I won't say anymore.  But you should see it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I plan to.  Hugh Jackman is such a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  You'd never think that Wolverine is the same person as the guy in Les Mis."
"__MOVIES__ Right?  He's so versatile.  I love Patrick Stewart too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he plays an awesome Professor X.  Very believable.  Personally, my favorite character is Famke Janssen's Jean Grey."
"__MOVIES__ She did an incredible job.  I loved her as the witch in Hansel and Gretel: Witchhunters too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah!  That movie got such bad reviews, but I thought it was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ It was.  It was totally underrated.  She and Jeremy Renner were fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really enjoyed that movie.  I thought it was a lot of fun to watch and an interesting twist on the original."
"__MOVIES__ It was.  i really don't know why the reviews were so poor.  It's not like it was as bad as Suicide Squad."
"__MOVIES__ UGH!  What a terrible movie.  Totally overhyped."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the plot was awful, there was no character development, and the story moved way too fast."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they need to stop messing up Batman movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right?!"
