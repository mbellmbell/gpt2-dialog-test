"__DISNEY__ Have you watched the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I went and saw it when it was first released in the theaters. It was one of my favorite Disney movies growing up."
"__DISNEY__ Mine too, I always liked Belle because she was smart and brave. She wasn't the typical damsel in distress."
"__DISNEY__ Belle is a great character. I felt bad for her that she had to constantly reject Gaston and he would never get the hint."
"__DISNEY__ He was an interesting character. What a narcissist! I liked Gaston's sidekick  LeFou too."
"__DISNEY__ I think Emma Thompson did a terrific job as Belle. I didn't know she could sing so well."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. The special effects were fantastic as well. I brought my niece to see the movie and she was nervous that the Best wouldn't find true love in time before the final petal fell from the rose."
"__DISNEY__ That's so cute. Was she happy when Belle and the Beast ended up together at the end?"
"__DISNEY__ She was ecstatic and she liked seeing all the Beast's servants turn back into people after being objects for so long."
"__DISNEY__ I love happy endings."
