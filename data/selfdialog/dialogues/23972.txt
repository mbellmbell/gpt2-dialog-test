"__SUPERHERO__ What did you think of the last Captain America movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought it was a lot better than I anticipated it would be."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea I really liked it. It had so many characters in it!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, they are really ramping it up. The next one will probably be the last."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh that's too bad. Captain America is a really cool character."
"__SUPERHERO__ They make him way too strong in the movie though."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think he is supposed to be that strong, he's captain America!"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, he shouldn't be able to fight Iron Man like that."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh yea, I guess that's true."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh well, they still did a great job with the movie."
