"__DISNEY__ I just downloaded the Mulan soundtrack on my phone and I'm so excited!"
"__DISNEY__ Gosh, I haven't heard that music in forever!"
"__DISNEY__ Neither had I, until I babysat my neighbor's daughter. We watched the movie and now I can't stop singing it!"
"__DISNEY__ The dragon was my favorite, what was his name?"
"__DISNEY__ Mushu! He was so funny!"
"__DISNEY__ That's the one! 'Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow!'"
"__DISNEY__ I'm going on a road trip with my sisters and I thought that the soundtrack would be great for driving music!"
"__DISNEY__ It totally would! You guys are gonna be singing your hearts out the whole drive!"
"__DISNEY__ My favorite song is 'Reflection,' even though it's kind of sad. How about you?"
"__DISNEY__ I like 'I'll make a man out of you!'"
