"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a tough question to answer."
"__MUSIC__ Let's start with something easier: what are your top 3 genres of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say Alternative, Rap, and Reggae."
"__MUSIC__ If you had to live without one of those genres which would it be?"
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to think about but I would say Rap. Mainly because it is just poetry over music."
"__MUSIC__ So your two favorites are Alternative and Reggae?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes those are my two favorites."
"__MUSIC__ I think we can limit this further. Would you choose Alternative over Reggae?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes because it encompasses more of the music I like. There is Alternative Rock, Alternative Dance, Alternative Hip Hop, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Nice so we have limited it to one genre. What is your favorite Alternative artist?"
"__MUSIC__ I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers!"
"__MUSIC__ They are one of my favorites as well! What is your favorite song by them?"
