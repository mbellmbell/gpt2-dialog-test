"__SUPERHERO__ Everyone gets bogged down in the Superman versus Batman thing!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I know. It's overdone."
"__SUPERHERO__ To me, even more interesting is Batman versus Batman!"
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, this story has been told over and over. Who did it best?"
"__SUPERHERO__ You mean who's story is best or who did Batman best?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Both! But, feel free to give either one a try."
"__SUPERHERO__ Okay, the best Batman is definitely in the original television series."
"__SUPERHERO__ No way! Adam West was so 'camp' with it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know! That's why I love it."
