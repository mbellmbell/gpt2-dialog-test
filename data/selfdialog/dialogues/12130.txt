"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This might be the final season we see Larry Fitzgerald and Carson Palmer play together for the Arizona Cardinals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope Carson can last and make it through this season injury free. I know Larry is an ironman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they'll retire after the season is over or sign with another team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope they retire with the Arizona Cardinals. I'm oldschool in my thinking of wanting my favorite franchise players to retire with the team that they spent their career with."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be fantastic to see Larry retire as a Cardinal. I couldn't imagine him in another team's uniform."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Larry Fitzgerald is the best wide receiver in the Cardinals franchise history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't debate that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see them going out big this season. If healthy, they should be able to take the NFC West."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think the Seahawks will give them a run?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I definitely think the Seahawks will be a big challenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just want to see the Cardinals fully healthy this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had one of the best defenses in the league before injuries took their toll on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mathieu is going to be back stronger and better than ever. I can't wait to see him knock wide receivers and running backs down across the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That defense was so intimidating a few seasons ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see it again. This is the year the Cardinals make it back to the Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't that be great to see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be fantastic. Larry Fitzgerald would go out on top finally winning a Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were so close in one of the best Superbowls I can remember back in Superbowl 43."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That 2008 season was such a memorable season. To come up 27-23, was so heart breaking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still have nightmares of that Superbowl loss. This season we make up for it though!"
