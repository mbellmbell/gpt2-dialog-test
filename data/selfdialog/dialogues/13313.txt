"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Since the NFL season was coming up, I randomly had a question come to mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Terrell Owens was snubbed of the Hall of Fame?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly yes. His stats match up with the greats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't he top three in Touchdown receptions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Number 2 or 3. I think Moss is 3, while he was number 2."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you not put that in the hall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not only that, but he had over 1000 catches and 15000 receiving yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The man was a freak of nature."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He proved that during the Eagles Superbowl run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't he break his ankle late in the season and still was amazing in the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't even get how he did it. His documentary showed he was hobbling mightily like a week before that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And people want to say he has no heart and is only about himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't be selfish if you are running on an ankle that is basically on the brink of breaking at any second and still trying your hardest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That game would have been a Pats blowout for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a shame him and McNabb Loathed each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like every team, but the Cowboys hated him. For the most part"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a big mouth. The man talked too much, but my goodness he backed up that talk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Back on the overall topic even Polian said he shouldn't be in, because he was a team killer. Like come on man attitude isn't a tangible thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The hall is about what did on the field not off of it. Even if he did spike a ball right on the Dallas Cowboys' star."
