"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so pumped they're moving soon!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I think that's still a few years away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Two if I remember correctly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aren't they building a brand new stadium?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, it's going to be off the strip I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, just off the big freeway that runs through Vegas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think it's cool that we'll have a sports team within a two hour drive from here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If anything, it will be good to see fans be able to travel to their games in a more affordable fashion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, so glad the owners approved their move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Funny thing is Oakland deserves better.  They were pretty good last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Carr may have been the most improved player in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Him getting hurt was a killer for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their offense totally dropped off with him out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They didn't do jack in the playoffs because of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is disappointing as they could have competed with the Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Mack on their defense.  Just a force off the edge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's probably a top five edge rusher in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Top five?  Gotta be higher than that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might be top two or three, but there's tons of quality at that position."
