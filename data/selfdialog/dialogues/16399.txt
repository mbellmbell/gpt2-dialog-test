"__ROCK__ So are you a big fan of Jimi Hendrix?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I have all his studio albums. Not the live stuff, though."
"__ROCK__ There are a lot of bootlegs and lost recordings of live shows that have come out."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, it's almost like the Grateful Dead, huh? Hippies love collecting live shows."
"__ROCK__ Hendrix in the studio was pretty fascinating, though."
"__ROCK__ I know. If you listen to 'Third Stone from the Sun' there's a lot of experimental stuff going on."
"__ROCK__ Backwards tapes, stereo panning, probably an attempt to reproduce what it sounded like to be on drugs."
"__ROCK__ You mean like auditory hallucinations? Maybe."
"__ROCK__ But there are a lot of artists who created a bunch of self-indulgent noise and put it on tape, like the Red Krayola."
"__ROCK__ True! Hendrix was gifted as a pop songwriter, and that made all the difference."
