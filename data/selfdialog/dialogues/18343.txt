"__MOVIES__ Let's play a game:  I'll name an actor, and you name the best movie they've appeared in."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, start."
"__MOVIES__ Robert De Niro?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, coming out with the big guns, huh?  So many good ones-- Deer Hunter, Godfather part 2, but I liked him best in Goodfellas."
"__MOVIES__ Al Pacino?"
"__MOVIES__ Another toughie-- love Glengarry Glenross, love Scent of a Woman, but I'm gonna go with ...And Justice for All."
"__MOVIES__ Patrick Swayze?"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, believe it or not, tough call between Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse."
"__MOVIES__ Peter Weller?"
"__MOVIES__ Robocop, duh."
"__MOVIES__ Tom Hanks?"
"__MOVIES__ He's been in everything, and he's generally excellent, but I'm gonna say Forrest Gump."
"__MOVIES__ Naomi Watts?"
"__MOVIES__ Ah, you know she's my favorite actress.  Mullholland Drive-- she blew me away."
"__MOVIES__ Kurt Russell?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like him a lot in Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2, but definitely the Thing.  I need to rewatch the Thing soon."
"__MOVIES__ Liam Neeson?"
"__MOVIES__ He's great-- he trained Batman and Obi-Wan.  I'm going to say I liked him best in Taken."
"__MOVIES__ Jack Nicholson?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, he's been awesome in so many things.  I loved him as the Joker in Tim Burton's Batman, but he really shined in the Shining.  Pun totally intended."
