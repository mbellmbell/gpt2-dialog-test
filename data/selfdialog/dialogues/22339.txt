"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney and Pixar movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved Ratatouille."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, how come that's your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ Everything in it is so pretty!"
"__DISNEY__ It makes me want to visit France, for sure. Even if I eat food cooked by a rat chef."
"__DISNEY__ Hey, Remy was a great cook!"
"__DISNEY__ I know! He really impressed the food critic."
"__DISNEY__ I was so nervous for them during that scene, but it turned out alright after all."
"__DISNEY__ I felt bad for Remy that his family wasn't very nice to him."
"__DISNEY__ That worked out, too, though, because they ended up supporting him when he needed it!"
