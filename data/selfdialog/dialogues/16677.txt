"__MOVIES__ You've seriously never seen The Music Man?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Ew, I don't do musicals."
"__MOVIES__ But it's a classic!"
"__MOVIES__ I especially don't do classic musicals."
"__MOVIES__ You need to see it if only so you can understand when I say pool is trouble."
"__MOVIES__ We'll see. Musicals are usually boring."
"__MOVIES__ But this musical has cons, deceit, moral decay and corrupt youth!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm slightly interested."
"__MOVIES__ It's actually one of those musicals that seems like it could be more modern than it is."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, it's like... a lot of actors in musicals seem sappy and corny but Robert Preston, who plays the lead role, almost seems to be playing his role ironically or in a very self-aware way if that makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't sound too bad. Is he handsome?"
"__MOVIES__ Relatively. You'll be happy to know there are librarians and love interests."
"__MOVIES__ You know I'm all about the librarians. Does the librarian get their own song?"
"__MOVIES__ Indeed she does. My favourite song from the movie is 'trouble' though."
"__MOVIES__ Is it about pool?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about pool and so much more. It really explains the whole premise of the movie in that song."
"__MOVIES__ That it's about pool?"
"__MOVIES__ That's just one part of it. It explains how Robert Preston uses pool for his scheme. You really just have to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ I'll watch it and if I don't like it, no bothering me about musicals ever again."
