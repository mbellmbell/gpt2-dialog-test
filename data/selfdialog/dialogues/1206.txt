"__MUSIC__ When someone approaches you with their mixed tape how do you feel?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean their amatuer music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't had it happen to me in years but when it did happen to me I felt pretty bad for them."
"__MUSIC__ How come? DId you turn them down or tell them something mean?"
"__MUSIC__ No not at all."
"__MUSIC__ Then why did you feel bad for them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well Ifelt guilty because I had zero interest in their music or listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ That's not really something to feel bad about in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Well I look at it this way. I put myself in the other person's shoes and I'd hate to be ignored without being given a chance."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I guess you can empathize with them but that doesn't mean they don't deserve to get rejected."
"__MUSIC__ What makes you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they aren't really advertising to specific people. They are just asking people at random to listen to their stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah so what?"
"__MUSIC__ They could be asking someone who has zero interest in their music taste. So they have no choice but to be rejected."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I understand you now. That actaully makes me feel better about turning that down."
"__MUSIC__ I mean we turn down professional musicians too if you think about it."
"__MUSIC__ We do?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know you don't like Lady Gaga and I've tried getting you to listen to her before and you've turned down her music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah thats true."
