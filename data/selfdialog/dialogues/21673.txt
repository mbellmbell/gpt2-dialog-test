"__DISNEY__ So, what's your favourite Disney movie then?"
"__DISNEY__ Mine would probably have to be Lilo and Stitch."
"__DISNEY__ I like that one too! Why is it your favourite?"
"__DISNEY__ I really love aliens and Stitch is so cute! Which one is your favourite?"
"__DISNEY__ Gotta go for The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ A classic - do you just like the songs or does the story do something special for you?"
"__DISNEY__ A bit of both really - I mean, who doesn't like 'Hakuna Matata'"
"__DISNEY__ So true. When Mufasa dies at the start, so sad."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, really heart-wrenching moment. Bring tears to my eyes everytime."
"__DISNEY__ Same here."
