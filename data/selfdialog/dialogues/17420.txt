"__MOVIES__ Have you noticed that TV shows turned into movies are not doing very well these days?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm surprised Baywatch did so poorly."
"__MOVIES__ I know, especially with having the Rock in it."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention Efron from the High School Musical movies. I thought they wold be a bigger draw."
"__MOVIES__ I know. The TV series was so popular."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe because too many other big movies came out at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales opened on the same weekend as Baywatch."
"__MOVIES__ That probably made a difference."
"__MOVIES__ You know what else bombed?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ The Chips movie."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know a Chips movie came out. When was it released?"
"__MOVIES__ It came out in March."
"__MOVIES__ I had no idea they even made that series into a movie."
"__MOVIES__ It only made around twenty five million worldwide."
"__MOVIES__ That's nothing!"
"__MOVIES__ It came out one week afetr Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Well that could explain it."
"__MOVIES__ Seems like timing could be really important as to how well a movie does."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and both of these movies had bad timing."
