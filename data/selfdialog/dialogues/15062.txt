"__ACTION__ Would you say that Robocop is a satirical action film?"
"__ACTION__ Absolutely. It satirizes the culture of consumerism and greed in America."
"__ACTION__ Yeah that seemed really evident in the way ridiculous commercials were placed into the film at intervals."
"__ACTION__ The commercials were pretty funny as well."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I especially enjoyed the commercial for the 6000-SUX."
"__ACTION__ That was a good one. Did you think they made good use of violence?"
"__ACTION__ Sometimes it felt unnecessary, but I think overall it added to the commentary on American culture."
"__ACTION__ How do you mean?"
"__ACTION__ Well, I think in a way the audience is meant to feel shame for enjoying the ultra violence depicted on screen."
"__ACTION__ That is an interesting take."
