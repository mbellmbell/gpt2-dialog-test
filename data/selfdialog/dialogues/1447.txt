"__MUSIC__ Have you ever played that game Songburst?"
"__MUSIC__ Where you have to guess the lyrics of a song? I've heard of it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's just funny to realize you didn't know the true lyrics of songs you sing a lot."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Like in one song the lyrics were 'you and me endlessly'."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds pretty straight forward."
"__MUSIC__ And my friend guess 'you and me and Leslie'."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Who's Leslie?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what we wanted to know!"
"__MUSIC__ I actually used to think that 'put me in coach' song was about a plane flight."
"__MUSIC__ That's hilarious. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I guess I thought the guy was really frugal or something."
"__MUSIC__ But the other lyrics make it clear it's about baseball."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I guess I never really listened closely to the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ And that's kind of what I meant when I said it was funny to find out how many lyrics we don't actually know."
"__MUSIC__ It's true. There have been some songs I've bopped along to and been shocked when I really paid attention."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, like that song Pumped Up Kicks."
"__MUSIC__ Perfect example. It's a great beat, but..."
"__MUSIC__ A pretty horrifying subject."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. I guess the moral is to really listen to the lyrics."
