"__MUSIC__ Hey, I'm going to put some music on. What would you like to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Something mellow. Do you have any Brazilian music?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. I have Caetano Veloso. How about that?"
"__MUSIC__ Great! Is it one of his most recent albums?"
"__MUSIC__ No. It's a greatest hits. Tons of good songs in there."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I actually am not following him closely anymore. I did when I was younger though."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I loved him. What about Gilberto Gil?"
"__MUSIC__ Him too. Classic Brazilian master."
"__MUSIC__ But I really like younger Brazilian musicians too. Like Marisa Monte, Chico Cesar, Carlinhos Brown etc."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! I love that album Tribalistas that Monte and Brown did together."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes! One of my favorite albums for a long time. Id' listen to it every day."
"__MUSIC__ I just learned it's actually a Christmas music album, although I would have never been able to tell."
"__MUSIC__ I know. So much cooler than the Christmas music I have to listen to when I'm at my mom's for the Holidays."
"__MUSIC__ I used to love Chico Buarque as well, speaking about Brazilian musicians."
"__MUSIC__ I know him less, but I've seen his name on compilations."
"__MUSIC__ He used to be a huge star in Brazil. And like many of them back then had to go in exile."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. Caetano and his sister did that as well. What was her name again?"
"__MUSIC__ Maria Bethania."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! That's it! I used to listen to her albums too."
"__MUSIC__ What a voice she has, so deep and soulful."
