"__MUSIC__ Do you ever teach music theory with musicals?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! We have to keep it relevant to the students. They don't all care about Montiverdi."
"__MUSIC__ Which are your favorites to use?"
"__MUSIC__ It's hard because there's so much offensive stuff that can get me in trouble."
"__MUSIC__ So, which?"
"__MUSIC__ The Music Man, West Side Story, and The Book of Mormon."
"__MUSIC__ The Book of Mormon, seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, of course!"
"__MUSIC__ How'd you get away with that? It's super offensive!"
"__MUSIC__ They love it, actually, and I'm able to find plenty of excerpts that are innocent."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Turn it off' is a great example, I just cut it short before the crap about spousal abuse."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's rough."
"__MUSIC__ What's that song a good example of?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a perfect example of a viio7/ii."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, all the voice-leading is correct with proper resolutions!"
"__MUSIC__ Can you hear everything, or is it kind of in the background?"
"__MUSIC__ With the instrumentation, it's pretty obvious."
"__MUSIC__ Nice! I'll have to look into it."
