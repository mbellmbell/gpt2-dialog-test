"__MUSIC__ Hey, what good music have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of old Snoop Dogg.  Things like Doggystyle and Tha Doggfather."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, those were impeccable albums!  True classics."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know it.  I can't believe he's been around so long."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I thought his Death Row albums were better than his No Limit albums."
"__MUSIC__ True, but don't discount what he did with No Limit!  Those were some amazing beats."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you're right.  Especially No Limit Top Dogg.  But I still thought his older stuff had a better, more classic sound."
"__MUSIC__ Well it probably had more of his unique West coast sound, the one that Dre produced."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  Did you know he released a reggae album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, are you serious?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he called himself Snoop Lion.  He became rastafarian after a trip to Jamaica."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's fascinating.  I never heard that."
"__MUSIC__ Yup!  It was called Reincarnated."
"__MUSIC__ I know he released Coolaid in 2016 which was a solo album."
"__MUSIC__ I never heard anything off that one.  I haven't even heard of it actually."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Neva Left is his newest album which was just released a few months ago."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, have you heard it?"
"__MUSIC__ I heard a few songs off it.  I wasn't overly impressed to be honest with you."
"__MUSIC__ I think Beautiful was the last new song of his I heard that I really liked."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was a great song for sure."
