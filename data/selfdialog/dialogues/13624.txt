"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the Best QB in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm.  I'm going with Brady because of that comeback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good choice, although I think he's a little over the hill and Rodgers or Ryan might be better now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they're all lights out.  I can see either one of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Ryan hasn't done it year in and year out though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you.  Last year he was boss, but Rodgers every year is awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know who's not elite but overlooked?  Stafford."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man heck yeah.  He always has good numbers but his team can't seem to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not consistently at least.  Plus us seems to make bad decisions in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That seems to be the same for lots of guys.  Like Andy Dalton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, Dalton is really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had an off year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know who's over rated?  Flaco."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes!  He's what I would call above average."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same with Wilson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, good enough to stay, but can't carry a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not like Rodgers, or Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Eli too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I knew you would say that you Giants fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have to remind you every once in a while."
