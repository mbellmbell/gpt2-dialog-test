"__MUSIC__ Do you want to go with me to see the Drum Corps International Championship this summer?"
"__MUSIC__ What is Drum Corps International?"
"__MUSIC__ It is an organization that promotes music through professional Drum and Bugle Corps performances."
"__MUSIC__ What is a Drum and Bugle Corps? You mean like an old fashioned marching band?"
"__MUSIC__ It is a group of young musicians who compete in a series of tournaments around the country. They are similar to marching bands but they don't have a woodwind section."
"__MUSIC__ Do they just play music or do they march too?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually they have a field show that is very similar to a marching band half time show. It's very exciting."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds interesting. How do the musicians get into the groups?"
"__MUSIC__ They audition by sending in a recording of their playing and if they are asked to come audition in person it's a big honor."
"__MUSIC__ Does New Mexico have a Drum Corps?"
"__MUSIC__ No, only some states have them. California actually has several."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so we have to go to another state to hear the competition?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they travel around the country and put on exhibition shows at different stadiums. The closest exhibition to us is in Albuquerque."
"__MUSIC__ An exhibition isn't a judged show is it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, there are several regional shows where the Corps are professionally ranked. The closest one to New Mexico is in San Antonio, Texas."
"__MUSIC__ How far is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's about twelve hours away, but it's totally worth the trip. The music is outstanding and the field show is choreographed like a dance."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds awesome! How many Corps will compete in San Antonio?"
"__MUSIC__ This year there are twenty three Corps attending. The show is at the Alamodome on Saturday July 22nd."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'm game. Let's plan to go!"
