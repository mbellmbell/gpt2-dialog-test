"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your opinion on the Dallas Cowboy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ehh, I like them, though there are some people who just hate their guts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't understand why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's probably because of the stigma of them being arrogant and such."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really see that in them, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither. Seem to me they are very genuine and great players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Tony Romo, it's really unfortunate that he's plagued with injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I feel really bad when he was injured in preseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But hey, if he wasn't injured, we wouldn't have never found Dak Prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! He was so good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love watching him play, such great arm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And his running back too. Ezekiel is very explosive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just wish we had a better defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we do though. We drafted a lot for our defense. After this year, I think we can be very good on both side of the fields."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let hope so. I wish we can have JJ Watt on our team though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yes, I love watching him play. Such great plays and concentration."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too bad, he's a player for our rivalry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha but the Texans are not really good, let hope he'll switch teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All this football talk makes me want the season to come already."
