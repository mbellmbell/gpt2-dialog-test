"__MOVIES__ Hey did you ever see the movie Cujo?"
"__MOVIES__ The Steven King movie?  Yeah it was really scary."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one.  The one with the dog."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  It really freaked me out!"
"__MOVIES__ It came out back in 1983 didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I know it's really old.  I'm not sure of the exact date."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's right.  What kind of dog was Cujo?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he was a St. Bernard wasn't he?  I remember he seemed huge."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's been awhile since I saw it.  Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I remember Dee Wallace but I can't remember anyone else."
"__MOVIES__ That came out around the same time as Pet Semetary didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure.  I remember watching Christine."
"__MOVIES__ Was that the one about the haunted car?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was actually pretty stupid.  I think it came out in 1983 also."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't John Carpenter direct it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think that's right.  I just didn't think it was very scary."
"__MOVIES__ No, Cujo was definitely scarier to me."
"__MOVIES__ Well Cujo could actually happen.  Christine was a bit of a stretch."
"__MOVIES__ You can say that again.  I do get scared of freaky dogs."
"__MOVIES__ I don't like them either.  Not after watching Cujo."
