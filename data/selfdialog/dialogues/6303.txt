"__STAR_WARS__ I read the other day that a lot of the structure of Star Wars was based Akira Kurosawa movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ What are those?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Old samurai flicks. But once you see them, it totally makes sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like, Luke losing his home and having to fight is a plot point in a lot of samurai movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm. Interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ And they do fight with swords, despite being in space and having guns."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, lightsabers are basically lasers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but it still reminds me of a sword."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see that."
