"__STAR_WARS__ Remember that sand creature in the original STAR WARS?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, they were really scary."
"__STAR_WARS__ Their heads were all wrapped up."
"__STAR_WARS__ And their eyes where through those round metal things."
"__STAR_WARS__ They made strange noises."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was scary when they attacked Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the tore off C3-PO's arm!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Fortunately Ben Kenoby showed up to help Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like it was meant to be."
"__STAR_WARS__ And they the arm back on."
