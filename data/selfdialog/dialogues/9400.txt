"__BASEBALL__ What did you think of the Red Sox off-season moves?"
"__BASEBALL__ I thought they were okay, but not great."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree.  What moves did you like?"
"__BASEBALL__ I liked how we got Chris Sale to help the rotation."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too.  He is a stud."
"__BASEBALL__ I also like how we got Thornburg for the bullpen."
"__BASEBALL__ Agree, good move.  Did we give up too much?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not really.  Moncada is young and supposed to be great, but you never know."
"__BASEBALL__ I would have rather kept him and gotten rid of Castillo."
"__BASEBALL__ Totally.  He has proven to be a bust."
"__BASEBALL__ I wish we had gotten more power to replace Ortiz."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too.  Encarnacion would have been great."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree.  Moreland is okay, but nowhere near the power."
"__BASEBALL__ And we already had Hanley at first base."
"__BASEBALL__ I know.  I would have preferred getting a decent third baseman."
"__BASEBALL__ Tell me about it.  Sandoval is not the answer."
"__BASEBALL__ No, he was a bust.  And Holt is good, but not for everyday."
"__BASEBALL__ Right, he's a great utility man.  Maybe we can make a trade during the season."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, go back to the White Sox and get Frazier for third base and Quintana for the rotation."
"__BASEBALL__ I'd be happy to give them Sandoval, Allen Craig, a minor leaguer and some cash.  They can have Swihart too.  He's a bust."
