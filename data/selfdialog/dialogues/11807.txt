"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After watching last year's Super Bowl, it got me thinking. What is the biggest choke job in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There were plenty of them. I do think that the Super Bowl last year was definitely the biggest choke job ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would agree even though it's the most recent in memory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. How are you up 28-3 in the 3rd quarter and lose?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not very easily. The odds of that happening were so astronomical that it's insane that it did happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots had to play perfect ball in the last quarter and a half and they did. Atlanta certainly helped them out a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Atlanta's defense was so tired by the fourth quarter that you could just see it coming."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Surprising they were that exhausted with all of the training players do these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Doesn't help that New England continually runs the hurry up offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It certainly doesn't. Still can't believe the Falcons blew that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. What other choke jobs come to mind?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certainly the Bills coming back from 35-3 down in the 3rd quarter in 1993."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is the ultimate deficit overcome and probably the biggest choke job until last year's Super Bowl, considering the stage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certainly. There were other large deficits overcome. I could think of the 49ers and Giants playoff game in 2002."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jeff Garcia comeback. I remember that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember when the field goal was botched and they pulled that guy down and nothing was called."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the holder that got pulled down, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure. Either the holder or an offensive lineman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That should have been pass interference, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe so. Who knows what the exact rule is when the offensive lineman is an eligible or ineligible receiver. I would think it should have been."
