"__THRILLER__ Can you believe we used to get scared at movies like Halloween and Carrie?"
"__THRILLER__ I know. It seems so ridiculous now."
"__THRILLER__ When I flip through the channels and see one of those old ones on, I just laugh at the thought of ever being scared of one of those films."
"__THRILLER__ I remember growing up watching, The Birds."
"__THRILLER__ Oh gosh, me too. I haven't seen it in years."
"__THRILLER__ It terrified me. I couldn't stand the scene where the birds are flying at them and they're trying to run away."
"__THRILLER__ I bet if we watched it today, it wouldn't be nearly as scary as it was then."
"__THRILLER__ I'm sure you're right."
"__THRILLER__ I haven't seen any recent thriller movies. They all look really dumb to me."
"__THRILLER__ That's probably what our parents said back when we were kids about the ones we went to see."
