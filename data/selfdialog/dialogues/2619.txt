"__MUSIC__ well well most of this music these days are pure garbage, i stick to some particular artist."
"__MUSIC__ artist like?"
"__MUSIC__ say weekend, future,t-pain"
"__MUSIC__ t-pain? never knew you were a t-pain fan, cos i am as well"
"__MUSIC__ oh really ? i love his songs,my all time best is still 'bartender'"
"__MUSIC__ of course bartender was a big it but 'sprung' gave him the limelight."
"__MUSIC__ true that was the song Akon heard that made him signed t-pain to konvict music."
"__MUSIC__ talking about Akon whats up with him , haven't dropped any music of late"
"__MUSIC__ that's right,i think the last time i heard him on an interview he said he was taking a break off music."
"__MUSIC__ wow really? he such a good singer and i still bump to 'belly dancer'."
"__MUSIC__ 'belly dancer' wasn't really my favourite akon's song , i would rather say 'so beautiful'  is."
"__MUSIC__ hehe so beautiful is a classic tune i also love as well."
"__MUSIC__ i loved kardinal official part on the song."
"__MUSIC__ i think all three actually did justice to that song."
"__MUSIC__ in between where about is Kardinal Official?"
"__MUSIC__ really don't know much about his recent activities though he is no longer with Konvict music."
"__MUSIC__ yeah that was long ago before he even dropped 'shake it'."
"__MUSIC__ oh 'shake it' that song just didn't sound right  for me."
"__MUSIC__ yeah true,it was a poor effort, didn't even make top 100 on billboard."
"__MUSIC__ he's lost his touch i suppose."
