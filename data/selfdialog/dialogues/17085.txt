"__MOVIES__ It like cult classic films."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Like Rocky Horror, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, sure. Or like Reefer Madness, even though that's sort of different."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, oh, or Shock Treatment. That was an attempt to try to cash in on the cult success of Rocky Horror, but it didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Huh, I guess that makes it a real cult classic film then."
"__MOVIES__ A cult-classic even among cult-classics."
"__MOVIES__ Heavy Metal is a good cult-classic too, though more mainstream."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if we're talking animation then I'd throw Akira in, too. But it's definitely mainstream now."
"__MOVIES__ I'd suggest Fritz the Cat, but I guess it's sort of well known, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the sequel was a big failure, so it might count."
"__MOVIES__ You know, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was made to be a cult film from the start."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What's the point in that?"
"__MOVIES__ That was just the kind of movie they wanted to make. They didn't make it that way for financial reasons."
"__MOVIES__ It must've made some sort of impression though, I mean, they even made video games of it like ten or fifteen years later."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, it's definitely fondly, and not so fondly remembered now."
"__MOVIES__ For the most part, only well liked cult-films are remembered. You never hear about the ones that didn't real badly and forgotten."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like your Shock Treatment example? But you remember it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm one of the few. Most people don't remember the real cult, cult-classics."
"__MOVIES__ Most people don't remember art-house films either."
"__MOVIES__ Truthfully, I don't think there's much of a difference between the two; Art-house or cult-classics. Often they're both weird for the sake of weird."
