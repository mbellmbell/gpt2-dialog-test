"__DISNEY__ I thought I cried hard for Lilo and Stitch, but the kids and I watched Bambi today..."
"__DISNEY__ Oh goodness yes.  That one is a heart breaker."
"__DISNEY__ I went and chopped onions, so the kids would think that was why I was crying."
"__DISNEY__ Did it work?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but now I don't know what to do with this huge pile of chopped onions."
"__DISNEY__ I remember when my mom took me to see Bambi for the first time.  I tried to be cool and not cry."
"__DISNEY__ When it was re-released in theaters?  My parents took me too."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't want to go because it was, you know, a kids movie.  I was 12, and figured I was too grown up."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, at 12 I thought I was too grown up for Disney too.  But here we are, fully grown, and still watching Disney."
"__DISNEY__ Right! Not only watching Disney, by choice, but loving it too."
