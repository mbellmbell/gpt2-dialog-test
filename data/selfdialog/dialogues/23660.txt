"__DISNEY__ What's the next Disney movie to come out?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I have no idea."
"__DISNEY__ I feel like they're always making a sequal or a redo."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed, well they did just release Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, they also remade Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Have you seen either?"
"__DISNEY__ Nope, I wanted to see Moana though."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, me too. I haven't seen either."
"__DISNEY__ I would rather see a new movie than a remake, you know?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that makes sense."
