"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who's the worst team in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The very worst team?  I don't know, NFL is funny that way sometimes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you can say a team in the preseason, but it seems like the worst teams always do a bit better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And some good teams really shoot themselves?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  All about staying healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to pick a team to get #1 next year, I would go with the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are a straight mess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably have the worst stable of QB's in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's their starter, isn't it Geno Smith?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, he's on some other team now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I remember, it's Josh McNown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that is pretty bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've drafted some guys too.  I think a few picks the last few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they took the guy out of Penn State a couple years go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hackenburg I think.  They're hoping he can be something for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever the case might be, that's a team in disarray."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like I said, probably the worst team in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If so, at least they'll be able to do something with the high pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Provided they don't blow it!"
