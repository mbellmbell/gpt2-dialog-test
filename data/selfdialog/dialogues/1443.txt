"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite Michael Jackson song?"
"__MUSIC__ Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough."
"__MUSIC__ So does that mean that you're more of a fan of his earlier stuff then?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, my favorite Michael Jackson music comes from his work through Bad."
"__MUSIC__ While I love Jackson's earlier work, my favorite Michael Jackson song is probably Black or White."
"__MUSIC__ That song was really good, but I wouldn't even put it in my top five."
"__MUSIC__ Really? What would you list as your top five Michael Jackson songs then?"
"__MUSIC__ Aside from Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, I'd have to say Billie Jean, Beat It, P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing), and The Way You Make Me Feel."
"__MUSIC__ All great songs, although for someone who likes his earlier solo stuff, I'm surprised that you didn't pick Thriller."
"__MUSIC__ I thought that Thriller was an amazing music video, but it's pretty mediocre as a single."
"__MUSIC__ Fair point. As you can see from previous choice of Black or White, I tend to give weight to the strength of the music video in evaluating Michael Jackson singles."
"__MUSIC__ I can tell. I just think that music videos should not be used to evaluate the quality of the song."
"__MUSIC__ The thing is that especially with 1980s music, I tend to associate singles very closely with their videos. Remember, this was the time that MTV was starting."
"__MUSIC__ I understand your point, but my favorite artists from the 1980s like Prince and Bruce Springsteen generally had pretty weak music videos."
"__MUSIC__ They did have fairly mundane music videos, with the notable exception of Prince's Kiss."
"__MUSIC__ Great video, annoying song."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. I am much more of a Purple Rain fan."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! What's your favorite song from that album?"
"__MUSIC__ When Doves Cry."
"__MUSIC__ Solid choice, although I prefer Let's Go Crazy."
