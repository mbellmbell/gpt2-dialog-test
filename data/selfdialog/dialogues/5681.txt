"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I gotta say, I've only gotten partway through it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is it boring for you? There's so much going on!"
"__STAR_WARS__ But I'm not engaged. The girl is cute and spunky, of course, but this is not my Star Wars, I'm not emotionally involved."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is there any character you like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The little rolling robot cutie is the most engaging character to me. There, I said it, the robot is the best character."
"__STAR_WARS__ That doesn't say much for anyone else."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, someone was smart enough to put Donnie Yen in the cast. He is absolutely amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he was awesome in the Ip Man movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ So I'll see the rest of the movie just to see him."
