"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ oh yes I did! It was absolutely amazing, and the songs and the special effects were awesome."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I thought so too! I saw it in the theater when it first came out."
"__DISNEY__ I think I will buy the DVD now that it's out. I really liked the part where Lumiere was singing 'Be Our Guest'."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! That part of the movie was my absolute favorite also."
"__DISNEY__ Belle's dress was beautiful too. If I ever have a little girl I would totally do a Beauty and the Beast theme nursery."
"__DISNEY__ That would be nice. You could always do a Beauty and the Beast theme wedding?!"
"__DISNEY__ Hey good point, I never thought of that. That would make a really nice classy theme, I love everything about that Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, well when we meet the man of our dreams, lets have a double wedding. A Beauty and the Beast theme, in front of the Disney Castle."
"__DISNEY__ I'd go for that. Yes I saw they do weddings now in front of the Disney Castle in Florida, and Beauty and the Beast would be a perfect theme!"
