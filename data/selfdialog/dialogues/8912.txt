"__BEATLES__ The best part of those Rocky movies was the music!"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, yeah?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah! First, you got the theme from Rocky, which everyone sings."
"__BEATLES__ 'Gonna fly now. Flying high now...'"
"__BEATLES__ That's right!  And then you got, 'Eye of the tiger.'"
"__BEATLES__ 'It's the eye of the tiger.'"
"__BEATLES__ And 'Living in America...'"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah! Hey, what about Bealtles music?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't think so...Not unless Rocky's girlfriend was Penny Lane..."
"__BEATLES__ Or one of 'All the lonely people.'"
