"__MOVIES__ Did you see the Oscars last night?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but I hadn't seen one movie on that list."
"__MOVIES__ They don't always give it to the best actor, I always wonder what motivates them to select a winner"
"__MOVIES__ Weren't you surprised years ago when they selected Marissa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh God, that was a funny movie!  She was great in that!"
"__MOVIES__ It was really unusual because it was a comedy and she was virtually unknown at that point."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, her performance was perfect!  I get mesmerized watching the tiny nuances in her movements and accent."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the actors were both from the east coast?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess but she doesn't talk that way normally."
"__MOVIES__ Who ever did costumes on that movie hit her outfits right on the nail."
"__MOVIES__ Ha Ha, that skin tight body suit with the flowers all over that!  Who wears something like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Mona Lisa Vito!  (laughing)"
"__MOVIES__ You remember the judge?  The guy that was Herman Munster?"
"__MOVIES__ That was him?  I knew I remembered seeing that face!  I just didn't put two and two together."
"__MOVIES__ What's a Yute?!"
"__MOVIES__ TWO YUTES!  (Laughing)"
"__MOVIES__ That was such a funny movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know Joe Pecsi just won the Oscar for Goodfellas during making Vinny?"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Wow!  That was a good film too!  What a different role!"
"__MOVIES__ I think both of those movies were great!"
