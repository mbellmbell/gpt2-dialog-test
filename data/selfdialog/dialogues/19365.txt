"__MOVIES__ Have you heard about the new Tupac movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard about it, but I'll wait until it comes to DVD."
"__MOVIES__ You aren't interested in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's probably an interesting story, but there are people saying the story is off."
"__MOVIES__ Like it's not true?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess it's overly glamorized."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that sucks."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you can't really trust Hollywood with true stories."
"__MOVIES__ I guess not.  I was just excited for this."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I kind of was at first, but after reading articles, I don't know."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I might think twice."
"__MOVIES__ It might be a good movie regardless."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'll think about it."
"__MOVIES__ Who plays Tupac anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know the name of the guy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think I remember reading his name somewhere, but it didn't ring a bell."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if he was a good actor."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  They either got him for his acting skills or because he resembled Tupac."
"__MOVIES__ I did notice that he looked a good bit like him."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe that had a good bit to do with casting then."
