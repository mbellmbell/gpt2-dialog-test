"__ICEHOCKEY__ Next Tuesday night, you going?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You know it! I wouldn't miss it for anything."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, me too. I might have to move a few thing around but i'll be there."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What did you think about that new goalie tonight?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who, Bradshaw?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hmm, not bad. That one stop was amazing though."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that was unbelievable right? I still don't even know how he blocked that puck."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It really gives me hope for the season though."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, me too. I wasn't so sure about him until that moment. But now..."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Exactly! Can't wait for Tuesday and see what other tricks he's got up his sleeve."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How many more games are left this season anyway?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Um, seven I think. No eight, yeah eight games."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hopefully Morgan will be back soon. Can't believe that ankle injury is taking so long to heal."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know right. We could really use him against the Sabers in three weeks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No kidding, right, he's our best scorer. Hopefully he'll be back before that game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You renewing your season tickets this year?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Without a doubt, win or lose, i'm a fan for life."
