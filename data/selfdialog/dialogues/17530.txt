"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, that is a difficult question to answer, but if you insist then I might say Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven."
"__MOVIES__ What do you like about that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the juxtaposition of a good guy (Clint) doing bad things for a good cause, or for multiple good causes?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean 'multiple good causes?'"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Clint was a bounty hunter, who typically killed people who needed killing. And he did so in order to support his family."
"__MOVIES__ So what was bad about what he did?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, as he might say, there ain't nothing like killing a man. In one line he says he's killed men, women, children, and just about anything that walks or crawls."
"__MOVIES__ Is there a lot of violence in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The violence is limited to typical gunfights and shootouts. There is some blood but almost no gore."
"__MOVIES__ Besides Clint Eastwood, are there any other notable actors or actresses in Unforgiven?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes there are. At least two other famous actors are in the movie, but their names escape me at the moment."
"__MOVIES__ What else do you like about Unforgiven?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like the comedic elements in the movie. There are comedic elements woven throughout the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Which comedic elements do you best recall?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I remember a kid coming to Clint and asking to be his assassination partner, except that this kid has horrible eyesight, which is important for a gunfighter."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is also funny when the kid tries to brag about how many people he's 'kilt' and Clint basically laughs at him."
"__MOVIES__ Are there other funny parts?"
"__MOVIES__ There are few moments when the topic of sex is brought up and the dialogue is quite funny."
