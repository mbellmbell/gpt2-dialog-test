"__MUSIC__ Hey there!  I was just going to ask you if you've heard of Skylar Grey?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't!  Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my God, I love Skylar Grey!  She's my favorite vocalist and she also plays piano."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, awesome!  What type of music does she play?"
"__MUSIC__ She mostly plays singer/song writer music but recently she does some Pop music too."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I think I'll check her out!"
"__MUSIC__ You should!  You should check out a video on youtube that she did, it's not a professional music video, it was shot in a motel apparently."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, a motel?  Is is a low budget thing or something?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure.  I head that Marilyn Manson actually recorded it and she sings a few of her songs mashed together."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I like some of Manson's music.  I'm not completely into it but I can respect it."
"__MUSIC__ I do think you'll like Skylar Grey though, she wrote that popular song that Rhianna sings 'Love the Way You Lie'."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, seriously?  I love that song!  That was written by Skylar Grey?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep!  One of the many reasons that I love her.  She writes her own music and even has written many popular songs preformed by others."
"__MUSIC__ I will check her out then, maybe you could send me some of her youtube videos!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, sure!  I will definitely do that when I get home!"
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, man!  I am always looking for new music to listen to!  I'm interested in Skylar Grey now, you have piked my interest."
"__MUSIC__ You can't go wrong with her music, there is a song for nearly all occasions and all moods."
"__MUSIC__ You know I need music like that. I need to feel what I'm listening to and be in the mood for certain music."
"__MUSIC__ You'll absolutely find something worth your while.  You could also check out music she released in her real name, Holly Brooke."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?  Her name isn't Skylar?"
