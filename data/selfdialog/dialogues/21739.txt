"__DISNEY__ Did you see The Princess and the Frog?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, a few years ago when I was babysitting my little cousin."
"__DISNEY__ What'd you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I loved it."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. Probably the best songs of any Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ And it's cool that there's a black princess for little girls to look up to."
"__DISNEY__ The set of New Orleans was kind of perfect, right?"
"__DISNEY__ So right. The jazz, the Cajun culture...all so cool."
"__DISNEY__ And I definitely cried when the firefly's light went out."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. At least he's with Evangeline now."
