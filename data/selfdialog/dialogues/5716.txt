"__STAR_WARS__ who is the strongest sith?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would go with darth vader. He is the ultimate sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose that is true."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think darth maul is cool and pretty great but nothing compares to vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about the emperor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He is more of a figure head with great powers but vader is the stronger weapon."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting take Vader as a weapon."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well did the emperor just use him more or less?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose that is a good point."
"__STAR_WARS__ A very true fact if you ask me."
