"__BEATLES__ Do you remember the first time you heard the beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, on the radio in 1964."
"__BEATLES__ Me, too. I heard 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'."
"__BEATLES__ That was a good one, but I like 'She Loves Me' better."
"__BEATLES__ The music from their movie 'Hard Day's Night' was pretty good, too."
"__BEATLES__ I thought it was a step backwards--or at least it was not innovative."
"__BEATLES__ Surely not as much as the 'Sgt. Pepper's' album."
"__BEATLES__ I still listen to that album at least once a month."
"__BEATLES__ I think the 'White Album' was the strangest album they made."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, 'No. 9' was beyond belief....."
