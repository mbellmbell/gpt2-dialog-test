"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new King Kong movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one, Skull Island?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, that's the one, have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's alright. Nothing special. I like the one from the early 2000s more."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Jack Black?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that one had a better story. This one just focuses on Samuel L. Jackson's character and the ending was just strange."
"__MOVIES__ The one from the 2000s was really long though. I got bored of it halfway through the movie."
"__MOVIES__ But the cinematics for that movie at the time were great. Skull Island looks like it was developed using a playstation 2."
"__MOVIES__ Really its that bad?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the CG in the movie is pretty bad."
"__MOVIES__ So what's good about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The action scenes were pretty good and they made Kong a good character."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, interesting. I like action scenes involving giants."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it was funny too. It had that guy from Step Brothers with Will Farrel."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, John C. Reilly. I like that guy, he's funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was pretty funny in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Any other actors in there?"
"__MOVIES__ Tom Hiddleston. He's good as usual but nothing spectcular."
"__MOVIES__ He's the one in the Avengers right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Loki."
