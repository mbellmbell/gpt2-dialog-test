"__MOVIES__ Hey what's your favorite superhero movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man that's really tough, there are so many. I'm going to have to say Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ Good choice! You're right there are a lot, but I'd say that mine has probably got to be Iron Man three."
"__MOVIES__ Tony Stark is pretty awesome. I really love the dialogue that Joss Whedon gave him in the original Avengers."
"__MOVIES__ Joss whedon is such an amazing director. I love everything he's ever done."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I was sad that he didn't direct the sequels, but I understand what he was saying about just being tired."
"__MOVIES__ Do you a favorite Marvel superhero? Mine is obviously Iron Man."
"__MOVIES__ I've got to say mine is Thor. I mean you just can't beat that guy, he's amazing."
"__MOVIES__ He certainly is one of the more overpowered characters. I liked that they cast Natalie Portman in his movies."
"__MOVIES__ That was a solid choice. What's your favorite movie that she's been in?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I haven't seen a ton of her movies, but she was in Star Wars so I guess I've got to say that."
"__MOVIES__ Those were the worst Star Wars movies though, to be fair."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but the brand and the lore alone makes it awesome, regardless of how terrible the directing was."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's one of the few properties that can say that. Fans got mad, but ultimately still went to theaters to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Good special effects can do that for you. Just like at every Michael Bay movie ever made."
"__MOVIES__ Explosions, explosions, explosions! There's a new Transformers out but I don't even know if I want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh why not? I think I might."
"__MOVIES__ Well there are so many of them out already. It's just starting to get a little old."
"__MOVIES__ You've got a good point. And I hated what he did to the Ninja Turtles."
"__MOVIES__ Stop ruining our childhood Michael Bay! Go back to Director's school!"
