"__MOVIES__ What was that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a Tarrentino movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, was that one of the one's that was released as the double feature?"
"__MOVIES__ It might have been.  I only saw this film from it though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I think I saw both of them."
"__MOVIES__ Well, this is the one with the car."
"__MOVIES__ It had Kurt Russell, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was the crazy man in the car."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought it was him."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It started off kind of slow for me."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it when it picked up though?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah!  It was a nailbiter!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I freaked out when he was chasing that second group of girls."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I honestly thought he'd get at least one of them."
"__MOVIES__ I think he thought that too."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it didn't work out too well for him though."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that ending."
