"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL season is almost here!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait. Should be a good year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have the Raiders to win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, my money is on the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots run is over. They got away from what made them great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you figure that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their bread and butter was taking third stringers from another team and making them a star."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have done that plenty of times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but this year they went and signed star players during free agency. Messed up their mojo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but Brady is still their."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady is a product of the system. He is good but their are alot of players that would be good in that system."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well how are you picking the Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, they were almost there last year until Carr broke his leg."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, him going down hurt them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they added players on offense that only makes them better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Beastmode is washed up. He has been out a year and didn't do anything his last year in Seattle because he was hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has a year of rest and my personal oppinion is the last year in Seattle had more to do with not handing him the ball at the 1 yard line than injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We shall see. I will say after the Patriots, the Raiders probably have the best shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders play the Pats in Mexico this year. That could be for the AFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Should be a good game."
