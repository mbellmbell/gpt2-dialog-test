"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, I can't hardly wait until football season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah! College football looks great, but NFL should be even better!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the teams in Los Angeles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the Rams and the Chargers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah! That's really interesting how the Chargers ended up moving to LA too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know that LA fans really care about either of the NFL teams in their city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean? Everyone likes NFL football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ LA already has two great football teams. UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that's college ball, and it's different from NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I really don't think LA fans want one team, much less two crowding up their city even further."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, what's the point of going to a game in Carson if it's going to take you half a day sitting in traffic to get there and get home?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus it's such a small stadium. I know they're going to build a new one in the future, but it's a soccer stadium as is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what was your favorite thing about last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite thing? The fact that the Patriots showed everyone that they were boss, and that 'deflate-gate' was all nonsense!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean by that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I feel like ESPN just wanted to crucify Tom Brady. By winning the superbowl, even with his beginning of the season suspension, he just proved to everyone that he really is the best quarterback in the league, playing on the best team in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they almost got beat!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but they came back from being down two scoring drives to win! It's like running the boston marathon, never give up!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, dude. Nice talking to you. When the season starts up, I'm coming over!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just bring the beer!"
