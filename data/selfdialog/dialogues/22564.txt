"__DISNEY__ Did you know Up came out eight year ago?"
"__DISNEY__ Really, man time goes by quick."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I watched the opening scene again yesterday and it still makes me cry."
"__DISNEY__ Oh man don't remind me. I can't believe Ellie died that was too much."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I felt way too many feelings. Thought it was just going to be a fun adventure movie."
"__DISNEY__ Boy, you were wrong. Although the rest of the film is really funny."
"__DISNEY__ It's also so cute."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I love the dog. What's he called."
"__DISNEY__ Dug."
"__DISNEY__ Or is it Doug?"
