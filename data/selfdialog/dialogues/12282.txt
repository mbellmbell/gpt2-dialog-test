"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has the league ever had this many good receivers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like it's a very deep group of players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could probably make a case for 4 or 5 guys being the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not sure it would go that high, but there's some great ones for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, so who's your #1?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a breakout year last year and he's uncoverable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok.  And who is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Julio Jones.  He was outstanding last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can buy that.  Probably his best year ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It helps that Matt Ryan had his best year so Jones was able to capitalize."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's just so big, I mean how do you cover that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's kind of the problem that they used to have with Calvin Johnson in his prime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might give the edge to Antonio Brown there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Over Julio?  Nah, but he'd probably be my #2."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody runs routes like Brown and his speed burns everyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like Julio does the same, but is four inches taller."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brown is more quick.  He jumps in his cuts much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whereas Jones is probably the better red zone target."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All I'm saying is I'm throwing a hail mary, it's going to Brown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And for me, Julio's grabbing that sucker in traffic."
