"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen a movie called Chronicle? It's a superhero movie but it's not typical."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I've seen it and I love it. I loved the build up of their powers and how much chemistry the guys had together."
"__SUPERHERO__ What was your favorite part of the movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ It would have to be when they were joking around at the store, scaring people and moving cars."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes that was hilarious. My favorite part was when the did the magic show and no one had a clue they were doing real magic."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh yes that was classic. That's something I would have totally done if I were them."
"__SUPERHERO__ The scene where all three of the guys were flying was pretty cool too, until they were knocked out of the sky by an airplane."
"__SUPERHERO__ I would have been scared to death being up there in the first place!"
"__SUPERHERO__ You're right, they were definitely brave. The character Andrew was destined to become a villain. You could see that early."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes and I felt so bad for him though. He'd been through a lot and was still going through it. I doubt he would have turned evil had he not been mistreated so."
