"__DISNEY__ Hey you look like Elsa from Frozen in that blue dress!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh sure, I just need a long blonde braid."
"__DISNEY__ So if you're Elsa, does that make me Olaf?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh no way! You're lots smarter than Olaf!"
"__DISNEY__ At least I'm trustworthy, so Hans."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah Hans was a traitor!"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe I should go to the costume store and dress like Anna."
"__DISNEY__ Oh sure. ' cause I've always wanted a sister!"
"__DISNEY__ So I guess that leaves us Sven?"
"__DISNEY__ Well he is the most cuddly character!"
