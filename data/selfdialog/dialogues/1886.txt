"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that U2 is coming to town?"
"__MUSIC__ Really, when?"
"__MUSIC__ July I think. I might have to go."
"__MUSIC__ I went to their last show here a few years back."
"__MUSIC__ How was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Beyond amazing. Quite a performance for basically all of downtown."
"__MUSIC__ This one is a commemoration of the Joshua Tree."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it's been 30 years now, huh? Wow."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. The only bummer is I guess they're not doing any of their other songs."
"__MUSIC__ Probably not. But that album is worth it in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, mine too. In fact 'With or Without You' is probably my favorite song of theirs."
"__MUSIC__ That's definitely at the top of my list too."
"__MUSIC__ Also 'Where the Streets Have No Name'."
"__MUSIC__ And 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For'."
"__MUSIC__ All classics."
"__MUSIC__ I would like to hear 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'd say that's another classic."
"__MUSIC__ Different album though. Boo."
"__MUSIC__ I guess we should just be happy they're coming."
"__MUSIC__ True. I'll be even happier if I can get my hands on some affordable tickets."
