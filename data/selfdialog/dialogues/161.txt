"__MUSIC__ Who is your absolute favorite music artist?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a hard question... probably Shania Twain."
"__MUSIC__ Shania is the best! Did you know she is on tour right now?"
"__MUSIC__ No way! I thought she only played in Vegas now."
"__MUSIC__ Nope, she has a summer tour going on right now."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to check that out! She is the best."
"__MUSIC__ She really is. I miss country music from the 1990s and early 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ So do I. Country music has really gone down hill in the past five years or so."
"__MUSIC__ So I assume you aren't a big Florida Georgia line fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not. Their music is not actually country!"
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. Have you heard their new song God, Your Mama, and Me?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't. Tell me about it."
"__MUSIC__ Its from their Dig Your Roots album. It features the Backstreet Boys."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I do love the Backstreet Boys! I don't know how I feel about them teaming up with Florida Georgia Line though."
"__MUSIC__ You should check it out. Have you heard the new Brad Paisley song Last Time For Everything?"
"__MUSIC__ I have! Brad Paisley is awesome."
"__MUSIC__ My first concert was his summer tour in 2010."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I bet it was great. I've heard he is fantastic live."
"__MUSIC__ He definitely is. The opener was Darius Rucker, another great singer."
"__MUSIC__ I love Darius! He is very underrated in country music."
