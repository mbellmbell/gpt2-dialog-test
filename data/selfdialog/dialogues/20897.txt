"__THRILLER__ Any recommendations on a good thriller I can watch with my girlfriend this weekend?"
"__THRILLER__ Hm, I don't know. Maybe Black Swan."
"__THRILLER__ What's that about?"
"__THRILLER__ It's about a ballet dancer who has 'performance anxieties' and loses her mind. Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are in it."
"__THRILLER__ Oh I like those actresses, but I'm not sure I wanna watch a ballerina thriller. My girlfriend might like it, though."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that's why I recommended that one. How about one of the Batman movies?"
"__THRILLER__ She's seen all of those. I want to watch something more like Fight Club, but she has seen that too."
"__THRILLER__ How about Inception?"
"__THRILLER__ I that's a good movie! I'm not sure she has seen that one, but I know she will like it."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah Leonardo DiCaprio is actually pretty good in it. If she doesn't like that one, you can try watching Gone Girl."
