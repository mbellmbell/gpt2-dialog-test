"__BASEBALL__ I had to help out last night at the kids baseball practice."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah, how did that go?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was exhausting!"
"__BASEBALL__ What?  Did you have to play with them?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not really, but I was chasing balls and everything else!"
"__BASEBALL__ Shouldn't the kids have chased the balls?"
"__BASEBALL__ I thought they would have, but the coaches were trying to teach them how to properly throw and needed someone to shag the balls."
"__BASEBALL__ And that was you?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  And seven year old kids really can't throw."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, hopefully the practice helped."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I'm hoping.  Their first game is next week."
"__BASEBALL__ Are the kids excited?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, for sure.  But half of them really can't hit the ball."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, have they ever played before?"
"__BASEBALL__ Most of them have to an extent, but this is the first year in this league for most of them."
"__BASEBALL__ So they can't hit a pitched ball."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly.  Next practice will be focusing on hitting I think."
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds like you guys need it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah.  I might take mine down to the batting cages."
"__BASEBALL__ That always worked for us growing up."
