"__BEATLES__ Did the Beatles music have as big an impact as we think?"
"__BEATLES__ This is a good question because I have heard both sides."
"__BEATLES__ I mean I think some of the songs like Help have really made an impact on people."
"__BEATLES__ Right but what did it do."
"__BEATLES__ I think their music told people it was OK to be different."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah but wasnt there already different music?"
"__BEATLES__ This is what I struggle with."
"__BEATLES__ I think their music has a lasting impact in that it showed how to vary four chords."
"__BEATLES__ But what about what they did for the globe."
"__BEATLES__ They just made it known you can live a lavish lifestyle and still write good songs."
