"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you coming over Wednesday?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL Supplemental Draft!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like anything is going to happen. There were a total of ZERO Picks last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but I love the hype."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bingham's a decent DL, but I wouldn't give up one of next year's picks for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Marques Rogers? He was a serious threat RB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly - WAS. He was ineligible in 2016. Taking a whole year off makes that just too risky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think the Titans did by taking Adoree Jackson with the 18th Pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Point taken."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously, a 5' 10' CB?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but he plays offense too. Not a bad Pick in my mind. Besides, I'd rather take someone steady like that than a Wild Card."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Conley. I wouldn't take someone with his criminal past unless I had to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Off-Field drama can detract from a player's value, but the Raiders really need someone like Gareon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They would've done just as well with Jabrill Peppers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he's too slow. He's got good size, but isn't quick enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He ran the 40 in 4.46!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The speed that counts is during a play - He doesn't react."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well now it sounds like you"
