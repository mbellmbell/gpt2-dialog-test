"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Man, SZA is really blowing up right now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I remember when she was sort of underground."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but she did those tracks with Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper on Z."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ After that everybody knew about her. You don't get names like that and stay underground."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, you don't. I think it's nice that she's finally getting some recognition."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ For sure. She's got a voice on her. Ice Moon is still in my top 10 favorite songs right now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And that dropped forever ago."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but it's classic. So is Babylon."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ See, I like that track more without the Kendrick Lamar verse. I think it cuts into her flow."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't think you'll get anyone to agree with you on that, man."
