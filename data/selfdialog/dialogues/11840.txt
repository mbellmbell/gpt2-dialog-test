"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dez Bryant is going to tear the league up this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Doubtful in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, your opinion is your opinion.  Trust me, the X will get thrown up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It feels like Dez has been in the league forever yet there's still tons of receivers better than him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In some cases of the game maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In all cases I would say."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're crazy.  He's got awesome hands."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he drops a lot of passes, led the league a few years back I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't remember that.  His hands are huge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he's not very fast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's plenty fast enough.  Look at how many touchdowns he scores."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone can score if they are wide open."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And how do you think he gets that wide open?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because defenses are keying on Beasley and Witten all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's crazy talk.  You obviously don't watch any games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've seen enough to know he's overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't take anyone else over him in the red zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're obviously not thinking hard enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking plenty hard.  He's the best red zone receiver in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Laughable, but whatever you say."
