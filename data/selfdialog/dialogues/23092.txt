"__DISNEY__ Back when I was an ESL teacher, I used to use clips from Disney movies to help the kids learn English."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds like a lot of fun! How would you do it."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I'd find a clip that related to the lesson somehow. Or we'd talk about the lyrics in a song."
"__DISNEY__ What movies did you use?"
"__DISNEY__ I only had copies of Beauty and the Beast and Hercules, so mostly those two."
"__DISNEY__ I bet the kids would've liked something newer!"
"__DISNEY__ Probably! But they still got a kick out of roleplaying."
"__DISNEY__ You had them act out the scenes?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, right after watching them. It was fun!"
"__DISNEY__ I bet!"
