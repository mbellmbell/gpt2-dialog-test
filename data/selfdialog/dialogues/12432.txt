"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When does football season start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football goes all year long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean the business of football goes all year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happens offseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's see. February there are regional combines.  March is free agency. April is the draft of course."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, the draft, that is important isn't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it is.  The draft process is what keeps the league competitive and allows the league to have parity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Parity? What does that mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It means that any given team can win on any given Sunday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it means the Cleveland Browns are as good as the New England Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not exactly. What it really means is that the Browns will get the most help from the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So that they can be better in the future?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, the best teams will, in theory, become worse and the worse teams will become better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how long does it take?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The truth is, it can take many years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So there really is no parity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not in a given season, but overall, free agency and the draft keep teams competitive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So that means, that sometime in the far off future, a team will beat the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly."
