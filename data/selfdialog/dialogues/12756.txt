"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the passer rating doesn't account for the team efforts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's as they say. it's a passer rating. Not a rating of a performance as the quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is absolutely no difference between the two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the distinction is that to rate a passer on HIS efforts alone is different from rating the plays of quarterback ina game.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, there is absolutely no difference between the two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yes there is, we're only interested in the efforts of the passer. how his team pass protects, or how the receivers holds on to the ball isn't a passer rating"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's such a nonsense. Of course all that has to be reflected on the passer rating"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it shouldn't. What you're talking about is more like offense rating, which we can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What method do you use for fantasy? Ideally what would you like to see?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would like to see the total offense rating as well as the passer rating, but over time against each matchups. But that doesn't really work since the teams evolve and change their offensive cooridators"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ New coordinators, new approaches, so the performances will be different?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Excatly. It's back to that whole stochastic nature of the agents performing the tasks. There is no way to predict, but we can extrapolate the trends"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ if you can't predict, there is no point in looking for the trends."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh contraire. Trends give us, at least, some insights into how the game will unfold, not 100% at a time, but very often"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I guess nothing in life is 100%."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it will be cool to have s number like that against the each matchups."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ESPN analysts do have numbers like that, and that's how they calculate the pecentage win for each matchups. And often they're wrong"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Stochastic agents again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got it."
