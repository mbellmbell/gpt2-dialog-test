"__BEATLES__ Doc, I have a terrible ringing in my ears. Can you help me?"
"__BEATLES__ It depends..."
"__BEATLES__ It depends on what?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, you have to understand that the human condition is complicated."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah..."
"__BEATLES__ And health is a delicate balance between strength and weakness, light and dark, and joy and sorrow."
"__BEATLES__ What are you saying Doc?"
"__BEATLES__ I can't help you unless you take those headphones off."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, sure! Hey, it stopped!"
"__BEATLES__ What were you listening to, 'Ring My Bell' by the Anita Ward?"
