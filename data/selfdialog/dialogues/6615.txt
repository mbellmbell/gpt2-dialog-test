"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have any theories on who Supreme Leader Snoke actually is in the new 'Star Wars' trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have no clue.  Weren't there rumors about it being Jar Jar Binks?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think those were more jokes than actual rumors."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a relief to hear.  What are some of the main theories?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well there is one that Snoke is actually Darth Plagueis."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wasn't that the name of the Emperor's master, mentioned in the prequel series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it was."
"__STAR_WARS__ But how would Darth Plagueis have survived if Palpatine said he was killed?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point.  It is just a rumor I heard."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I like that rumor way more than the Jar Jar Binks one!"
