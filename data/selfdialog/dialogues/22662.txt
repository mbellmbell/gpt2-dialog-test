"__DISNEY__ I love how complex Disney movies are getting."
"__DISNEY__ I think complexity was always present.  But now it's evolving."
"__DISNEY__ That is what I meant.  Take the movie 'Inside Out,' for instance."
"__DISNEY__ I thoroughly enjoyed that film."
"__DISNEY__ The whole thing was an allegory for puberty and growing up in the world."
"__DISNEY__ I never looked at it that way, but you're right."
"__DISNEY__ The voice acting was also spot on."
"__DISNEY__ Who were some of the actors and actresses?"
"__DISNEY__ Amy Poehler and Bill Hader were two of the main voices."
