"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just finished Prisoner of Azkaban, have you read it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it's one of my favorites."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, so what did you think of Sirius?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like him quite a bit, but he's a bit odd. What do you mean?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, the Harry/Sirius dynamic is a bit, strange."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I think it would be that way with any nephew and uncle who have never really met (except when Harry was a baby)."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True, I guess I just thought it seemed sudden."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It really was, but still it's essential to the story."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just really hate Snape and how smug and haughty he was the entire time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, Sirius definitely didn't deserve that."
