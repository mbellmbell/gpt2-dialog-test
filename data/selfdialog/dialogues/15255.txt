"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just rewatched the last Harry Potter movie. It was pretty good again."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? I've only seen it once."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, when it first came out I some how missed it. It would have been great to see it at the theater."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's where I saw it. Those movies need to be seen on the big screen. You can really get sense of all the special effects."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I love how they do animals. The dragon scene is amazing. I actually was feeling sympathetic for the CG dragon!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know! Poor dragon."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's such a great scene when burst through the roof of Gringots Bank and takes to air with out heros hanging on..."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, that is one of my favorites too. Exactly what I imagined."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I see new details every time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too. There always seems to be some little gem that missed before and it's so great. Love those movies."
