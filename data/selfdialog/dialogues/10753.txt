"__FASHION__ Have you noticed all the colorful leggings at the lake?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah. It's like all at once everybody suddenly got tired of black tights."
"__FASHION__ I liked throwing on my black leggings and going for a run. I didn't have to think about it."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I see your point. But buying new exercise wear can be motivating too."
"__FASHION__ Yeah. You notice how good you look from all that exercise."
"__FASHION__ I'm not just exercising to look good. It's good for me!"
"__FASHION__ Sure. Of course. But it's nice to look good too."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, you're right. And I guess leggings with a pattern would distract people from noticing some of my lumps and bumps too."
"__FASHION__ Yeah. Fabletics and Amazon both have leggings with absolutely blinding patterns."
"__FASHION__ Of course, some patterns actually make you look wider. Like horizontal stripes."
"__FASHION__ You're joking? They actually sell those?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah. I don't know who buys them."
"__FASHION__ Blind people, maybe."
"__FASHION__ Really, really skinny blind people."
"__FASHION__ And of course compression leggings hold you in really well."
"__FASHION__ They do. I'm going to wear compression leggings with polka dots, once I lose five more  pounds."
"__FASHION__ You look fine now."
"__FASHION__ Maybe in leggings I do."
"__FASHION__ We both do. We're the queens of the lake."
"__FASHION__ Coming soon in brilliant living color."
