"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Star Wars Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I thought it was great!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it gave a lot of information about what happens between the third and fourth movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I always wondered how they randomly got the entire plans for the death star."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it leaps and bounds better in terms of cgi and production value?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it looks way better than the first ones that came out in the 70's and 80's."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like the new ones kind of stray away form the original ones though in terms of storytelling."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's a consequence of Lucas films being sold to Disney. It's meant to appeal to a wider audience."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the one before it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I thought the story telling is bad and I hated the director JJ Abrams."
"__MOVIES__ You thought he messed up the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was too nostalgic and it was kinda cheesy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh RIP I really liked it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I wasn't a big fan."
"__MOVIES__ Oh well at least they have a multiple movie deal and there's more to come out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I'm really looking forward to those."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know what direction their heading in now?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think it's supposed to be about the fall of the empire and we figure out who the new Jedi's are."
"__MOVIES__ Looking forward to it!"
"__MOVIES__ We should watch it together."
