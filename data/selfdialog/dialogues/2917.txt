"__MUSIC__ Have you ever seen the extended version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy."
"__MUSIC__ Of course! I own both versions."
"__MUSIC__ Which music is better?"
"__MUSIC__ They're the same, dude."
"__MUSIC__ No, they're not."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are. How are they not?"
"__MUSIC__ Howard Shore wrote the music for the extended versions, and they were edited for the released version in theaters."
"__MUSIC__ So he wrote 4.5 hours of music to only have it be 3?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, thanks to production who thinks we can't handle long movies."
"__MUSIC__ So, what difference does that make?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, shore is like Wagner."
"__MUSIC__ He uses leitmotifs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and he even says which is which in his writings."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, and?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the music makes far more sense when played in the extended version as everything is in its right place."
"__MUSIC__ Were they basically plucking themes out of thin air and putting them into the score?"
"__MUSIC__ Essentially."
"__MUSIC__ Know what's crazy, then?"
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ The music still works, it's still beautiful, and it fits. Even when it's not what he intended."
