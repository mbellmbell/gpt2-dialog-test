"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if the Patriots will be able to hold their title this coming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it, they've got big egos now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really wish the Packers could make it to the SuperBowl again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's been a while, but I think they still hold a record number of titles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cool.  What commentators do you listen do for game-day coverage?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't, I usually watch the games on mute while I get some homework done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did you actually watch when the Patriots beat the Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, went to a local sports bar to watch the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You like Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's a great player, but he doesn't seem too bright."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think being smart is a requirement for playing in the NHL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, some of the other Hall of Famers aren't working with a full deck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think Tom Brady is in the Hall of Fame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not yet.  But I bet he will be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, he'll probably be the most notable Patriot in the NHL Hall of Fame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There was Troy Brown back in 2007."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll tell you though, I'm really not a fan of the Patriot's uniform colors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How come?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just expect more stars and stripes for a team that calls themselves Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, I think that would be distracting on the field."
