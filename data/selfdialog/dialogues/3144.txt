"__MUSIC__ Oh, I wondered who that was.  It sounded so familiar."
"__MUSIC__ What CD did you have by them?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember, but I'm sure it was from the late 90s or early 2000s."

"__MUSIC__ Yeah, around then.  They had some fun music."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite song by them?"

"__MUSIC__ I liked the line where he says 'I just made you say underwear.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah,  They were pretty quirky."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but that's why they were perfect for doing 'The Big Bang Theory.'  They are pretty nerdy."

"__MUSIC__ I think I might have to look them up again."
