"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think of the Packers this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really excited. The new tight ends are going to make the offense unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I completely agree. Martellus Bennett is an animal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah! And don't forget about Lance Kendricks either!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I really liked him when he played for the Wisconsin Badgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup! And he's been sneaky good in St. Louis and Los Angeles the last few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and that was with terrible quarterbacks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. Imagine what he is going to do with Aaron Rogers instead of Jared Goff! Ha!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. Once you come to think about it, he's not all that different than Jared Cook was last year. Comes from a bad QB situation and is athletic as heck!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man you are getting me excited. Teams are not going to be able to defend the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. Like I think Bennett is superior to JerMichael Finley and remember what the offense was like with him? This is going to be awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Packers were even unstoppable last year with Jared Cook, who was not even as good as Finley."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rodgers is so good when he has a TE to stretch the field in the middle. It just opens up Jordy even more as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, if we have a running game, we could set offensive records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Totally. And between Montgomery and the three rookies, I think we'll be completely fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I cant believe Lacy left to go to Seattle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can. He probably was angry at Mike McCarthy for always caring about his weight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well didn't you see the rumors he was approaching 270 from Bob McGinn of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel? The Seahawks even put a weight provision in his contract."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. Has he had to weigh in for the Seahawks yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. He's passed them so far, but that was the same last year when he was with the Pack."
