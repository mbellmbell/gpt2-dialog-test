"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of the Star Wars prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Episodes one through Three, or the chronological sequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ A bit confusing, I know, but Episode one through Three."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they do not get the credit they deserve, I liked them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I did too, I thought the plot played well."
"__STAR_WARS__ It did. It showed a back story into the rise of Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ From a lowly Anakin, on the sand planet to all and powerful."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. It showed both his rise and the start of his fall, very complex."
"__STAR_WARS__ You did not think it was contrived at all?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, it was mean to be what it was. A story into the past, of the movies at least."
