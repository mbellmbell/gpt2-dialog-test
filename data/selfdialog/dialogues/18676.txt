"__MOVIES__ Which were better: Vincent Price's serious movies, or his siller ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think there's always such a clear distinction."
"__MOVIES__ House of Wax, House of Usher, House on Haunted Hill: all of the house movies he played a serious role."
"__MOVIES__ And most of the doctor movies were played for laughs: The Abominable Dr. Phibes, Dr. Phibes Rises Again...."
"__MOVIES__ And Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine, and Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs. He certainly played a lot of doctors."
"__MOVIES__ The Ten Commandments and Confessions of an Opium Eater were meant to be serious."
"__MOVIES__ Then there's the flat out silly movies: Master of the World, City in the Sea, and Beach Party,"
"__MOVIES__ You can't lump all those in together. Master of the World and City in the Sea he wasn't playing for laughs, they were just silly scripts. Beach Party was just for fun though."
"__MOVIES__ The Last Man on Earth and The Conqueror Worm were meant to be serious."
"__MOVIES__ Although the Last Man on Earth was vastly better."
"__MOVIES__ Then there's the Poe movies, those were all serious: The Masque of the Red Death, the Pit and the Pendulum, The Raven...."
"__MOVIES__ If you think the Raven was serious then you haven't seen it. The Raven was strictly played for laughs."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, okay. Madhouse: that was one of the house movies that wasn't meant to be all that serious."
"__MOVIES__ And Edward Scissorhands. He wasn't going for laughs in that one, even if everyone else seemed to be."
"__MOVIES__ True. The Fly and the Return of the Fly, those were meant to be serious."
"__MOVIES__ And gross."
"__MOVIES__ The Tingler and the Bat, those were silly..."
"__MOVIES__ No, they weren't meant to be silly. They were meant to be sensational: they used gags to scare the audience. But they were intended to scare, not be silly."
"__MOVIES__ The Haunted Palace, that was another serious one."
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie. The look on his face at the end is priceless."
