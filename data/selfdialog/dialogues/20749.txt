"__THRILLER__ It is Friday night! I am in the mood to see a good thriller movie!"
"__THRILLER__ Oh geez! You know how I feel about thriller movies."
"__THRILLER__ I know! I love watching you jump during the scariest part of the movie."
"__THRILLER__ Well, don't let me hold the popcorn this time. What do you want to see?"
"__THRILLER__ How do you feel about Annabelle; Creation?"
"__THRILLER__ I have never seen any of the Annabelle movies because they're too creepy."
"__THRILLER__ Annabelle is one of my favorite thriller genres within the last five years."
"__THRILLER__ How about we see a romantic comedy?"
"__THRILLER__ No thanks. If you see a thriller movie with me tonight, I will see a romantic comedy with you next time around."
