"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to the new Kendrick Lamar album yet?"
"__MUSIC__ My friend showed me a few songs. What's your favorite song on the album?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like the song, 'LOYALTY. FEAT. RIHANNA.'"
"__MUSIC__ Let me guess. The song features Rihanna?"
"__MUSIC__ [sarcastically] How'd you know?"
"__MUSIC__ There are a few other guest artists featured, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Believe it or not, U2 is on one song."
"__MUSIC__ Kendrick Lamar and U2? What do you think of that song?"
"__MUSIC__ The two styles actually come together well. U2's always been political, as is Kendrick Lamar."
"__MUSIC__ What are they talking about in the song?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot about the state of America--our current politicians, race relations, wealth divisions, and more."
"__MUSIC__ Not just party music, is it?"
"__MUSIC__ No way! Kendrick Lamar wants to express very relevant topics through his music."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that the album's at the top of the Billboard chart."
"__MUSIC__ All fourteen of the songs on the album are in the top 100!"
"__MUSIC__ The whole album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, the whole album!"
"__MUSIC__ He deserves this success. Usually music that popular is just silly and shallow!"
"__MUSIC__ Don't get me started on Miley Cyrus' 'Malibu.'"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, we're not going there."
