"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like the new jerseys that Nike makes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I preferred the old ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, there isn't much of a difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Nike ones have those awful gloss stripes around the collar."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think I know what you mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I prefer the old jerseys because they looked cleaner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally, I wish there was just more differences when it came to jerseys when it switches brands."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought the old ones were fine. I don't know why they changed them"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's because Nike offered more money to sponsor the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes sense, considering that Nike is the biggest sports company in the world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That kind of makes it even worse. Shouldn't they then know how to make a good jersey."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the quality of the jerseys are top quality."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, in terms of how the jerseys look."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some people do like them. Some don't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm one of those that don't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally, I was never going to buy one anyway, so it doesn't matter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did buy one, and I can tell you that they aren't designed that great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they perform well on the field, that's the only design players care about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's something I'll never find out."
