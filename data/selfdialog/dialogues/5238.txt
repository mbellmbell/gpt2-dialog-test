"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How many of The Fast and the Furious movies have you seen?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ All of them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you think of The Rock's character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ i really like him, I think he brought a much needed outside element to the movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How so?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well they already had big name stars, but they didnt really have that cop presence since Brian became part of the team."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I see, so you think he legitimized it a little?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I do. I think he added credibility to a franchise quickly losing it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think you'e right, he fights well too."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, i liked how they incorporated some of his WWE stuff in there too."
