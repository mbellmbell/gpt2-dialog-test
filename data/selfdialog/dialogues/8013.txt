"__POP__ Hey did you watch the music awards this week?"
"__POP__ No,  I forgot,  who preformed,  anyone good?"
"__POP__ Yeah,  Katy Perry and Taylor swift were on."
"__POP__ That's cool,  I used to like Katy Perry. I kissed a girl was really catchy."
"__POP__ Yeah,  I like her more now,  she's a bit more theatrical,  kind of like lady gaga."
"__POP__ Lady gaga is weird but she has a great voice.  I love one million reasons."
"__POP__ Yeah that song is great,  what other songs of hers do you like?"
"__POP__ I really like poker face,  it's super catchy."
"__POP__ That song always reminds me of LMFAO and I don't know why."
"__POP__ I don't either,  they are nothing like lady gaga."
