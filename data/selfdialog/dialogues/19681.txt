"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the Twilight series?"
"__MOVIES__ Overall, or just the first movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one first?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually liked it. I thought it had a good direction, and was stunning in scenery."
"__MOVIES__ Really? You liked the way the plot went? I did not."
"__MOVIES__ No, not so much the plot I did like the real feel of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was rubbish. I did like the story line in the second one though."
"__MOVIES__ I did too, I thought it had more structure but not the third."
"__MOVIES__ No, that was confusing. I like the editing though."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, it looked really pretty. I hated the sparkle scene."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, me too. Killed it unlike the last one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the last one was actually good, in my mind at least."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the action. I think they got a new director for those ones."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they made it better. Did you like the plot of the last movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I mean to an extent. Could of been better."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. I hated the whole creepy baby."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the baby really threw me off the movies as a whole."
"__MOVIES__ So, which was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one I think and you?"
"__MOVIES__ The last one."
