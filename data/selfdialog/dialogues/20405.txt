"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Transformers movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I have, I watched it this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I will say that it was easier to understand what was happening this time."
"__MOVIES__ That's it?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much. It wasn't very good. It's really just marketted towards little kids now."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's why they put that nickelodeon girl in it."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. She served no purpose. The plot was dumb, Optimus Prime turned into a bad guy in less than 30 seconds."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they only have so much time to create plot during the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Not this movie, it was like 3 and a half hours long and it was torture."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, that sounds horrible!"
"__MOVIES__ It kind of was. I fell asleep twice, and still didn't miss anything."
"__MOVIES__ It was that boring huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I mean they tired. Lots of big robots, lots of explosions. But nothing new."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I hear they are already doing another one."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't doubt that for a second."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe the next one will be better."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully I never find out. I'm waiting for Pacific Rim 2 to come out."
"__MOVIES__ Yea that was a much better movie than Transformers."
"__MOVIES__ It is, but they are taking way too long to make another one."
