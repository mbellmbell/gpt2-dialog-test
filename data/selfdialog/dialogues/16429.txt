"__ROCK__ What bands have you been into recently?"
"__ROCK__ Not too much new but I've been really getting into older Alice In Chains stuff."
"__ROCK__ Yes, I haven't listened to them in a while but they were really good. It's too bad about their singer dying."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, Layne Staley had an amazing voice. Jerry Cantrell is still keeping them going and they got a new singer who also sounds really good."
"__ROCK__ I wish I could have seen them in concert back when they were in their prime."
"__ROCK__ Definitely so. They are still touring but it's not the same as seeing them back when they were at their best."
"__ROCK__ Out of all the bands that came out of Seattle, Alice In Chains was probably the best."
"__ROCK__ That's a matter of opinion. There were a lot of good bands from that city in the day but yeah, they're up there for sure."
"__ROCK__ What's your favorite Alice In Chains song?"
"__ROCK__ That's tough to say but right now I have been listen to the song Would a lot so I'd say that one. Ask me again in a week and I'll probably have a different favorite."
