"__DISNEY__ I want to go to Neverland."
"__DISNEY__ Neverland? As in Peter Pan's home?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course! I want to be Wendy."
"__DISNEY__ Now that you mention it, I do too."
"__DISNEY__ Except I'd never leave. Who would leave that place?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, there's no reason to grow up. It's awful."
"__DISNEY__ Peter had it right. Peter and Tinkerbell."
"__DISNEY__ Tinkerbell is my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Wendy is such a wet blanket. Peter is better off without her."
"__DISNEY__ Poor Wendy! She's not that bad."
