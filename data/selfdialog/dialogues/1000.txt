"__MUSIC__ what do you think about Lady GAGA"
"__MUSIC__ ummm i think it depends on whitch lady gaga you are talking about"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean witch one there is only one"
"__MUSIC__ When i hear Lady gaga i think of 2 you have the bare bones lady gaga who can outsing almost anyone and then you have the gimmick artistwho does stuff just for shock factor"
"__MUSIC__ But why would you seperate the two tho artists are allowed to have diffrent sides to them you dont have to be one thing"
"__MUSIC__ I separate them because the gimmick one doesnt seem to really be her it seems forced"
"__MUSIC__ I think when she first came out she really didnt know what she wanted to be as a pop artist when your young your just trying to find yourself but i dont think it was fake tho"
"__MUSIC__ I dont think it was find herself as much as it was created by her team to seperate herself from the other pop acts that was out at that time"
"__MUSIC__ you think that was all created by her team"
"__MUSIC__ yea i do but that doesnt take away from the fact that she can truely sing to me"
"__MUSIC__ did you listen to her Joanne album"
"__MUSIC__ yes and i found it to be more of her trueself without all the gimmicks so she must of grew tired of them"
"__MUSIC__ Or because thats like her 5th album she just grew up as we all do and change nobody stays the same"
"__MUSIC__ regardless it sounds more like her now imagine if that would of been her 1st album do you think she would of blew up like she did"
"__MUSIC__ Your asking if her 5th album would of been her 1st would she be as famous as she is now?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes that is what im asking"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I think she would because she is very talented."
"__MUSIC__ Stop it there is no way there is nothing on that album that would of stood out for the long term it would of flopped"
"__MUSIC__ I disagree with that i like that album"
"__MUSIC__ No she would of just faded into the backround because joanne sounds nothing like The Fame Monster"
