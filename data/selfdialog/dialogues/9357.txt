"__BASEBALL__ Will the Yankees ever be good again"
"__BASEBALL__ I think very shortly"
"__BASEBALL__ How good will they be?"
"__BASEBALL__ They have one of the best farm systems in baseball"
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think theyll ever go back to the old way of doing things?"
"__BASEBALL__ Like signing overpriced free agents?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that way"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I think baseball has changed"
"__BASEBALL__ In what respect"
"__BASEBALL__ Most teams hoard their talent"
"__BASEBALL__ So you wont see them sign those guys"
"__BASEBALL__ Those kind of guys arent hitting the market anymore"
"__BASEBALL__ But what about a team that has a surplus at a position"
"__BASEBALL__ You do have those but that will be in trades"
"__BASEBALL__ Will their farm system ever run out?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure theyll trade those guys away"
"__BASEBALL__ Interesting. I cant see them standing pat"
"__BASEBALL__ Either can I, but theyll use it as a farm system"
"__BASEBALL__ I bet Steinbrenner is rolling in his grave"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh you know he is"
