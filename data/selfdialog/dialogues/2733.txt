"__MUSIC__ Hey, turn on the radio. Justmake sure it's not that country garbage you listen to,"
"__MUSIC__ Why are you always hating on country? It has a lot to offer its listeners."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like what. It's just songs about losing your woman, truck, or dog."
"__MUSIC__ Some of the most pupular muscians today started out in country."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, right. Like who."
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift ans Shania Twain to name a few."
"__MUSIC__ OK, but they got out of country. That proves it not good music if even its stars want out of the genre when they get popular."
"__MUSIC__ Acutally, there are a few singers who went into country music after hitting it big."
"__MUSIC__ No way! That's not true."
"__MUSIC__ Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish went into country after his pop success."
"__MUSIC__ Bet you can't name anymore."
"__MUSIC__ You're going to lose your money making bets like that. Some more artists who went country are Nelly, Bret Michaels of Poison, Tina Turner, and Cyndi Lauper."
"__MUSIC__ Glad that I didn't wager any extra money, but I am still not convinced. You're going to have to make a stronger argument than that."
"__MUSIC__ Country is easy listening. You don't have to worry about offending anyone if you want to sing the lyrics out loud."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's true. What other reasons do you have?"
"__MUSIC__ I know you said that it's all about heartbreak over trucks, dogd, and women, but at least that's real emotion. It's not about trivial things like sneakers or cars."
"__MUSIC__ I never thought about it that way."
"__MUSIC__ And it can be the perfect party music. Some of those heartbreak songs are fast paced, and they are the perfect summer party songs."
"__MUSIC__ Still not convinced. Give me one more reason."
"__MUSIC__ As a woman, you should be proud of a genre that has elevated women so high up in the industry. The most popular and profitable singers in the genre are almost ALL women"
