"__MOVIES__ So if I'm going to do this John Carpenter thing, where do I start? Do I just do them in sequence?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, you could. Lay 'em out on a graph, and the general trend is that the later they get the worse they get."
"__MOVIES__ What do I really need to hit, then? The Thing, presumably; Halloween..."
"__MOVIES__ Those are highlights, right. Funny thing is, you're going to think of horror, but Carpenter has done just about every genre in the book, often one right after another."
"__MOVIES__ Is his non-horror stuff... good, at all?"
"__MOVIES__ Some of it! You need to understand that every movie he's done, with few exceptions, has been painfully underfunded and produced under crippling creative conditions."
"__MOVIES__ One of those situations, huh. Like Orson Welles, Terry Gilliam?"
"__MOVIES__ More so, if you can believe it. He had a period where Hollywood considered him potentially bankable, but even then his interesting stuff was mostly independent and scraped together out of dirt and spit."
"__MOVIES__ Dude, I'm already sold. Just give me some names and explain."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so Halloween and The Thing you know; those are just all-time classics of cinema. Classics of Carpenter can get a little weirder -- like, say, Big Trouble in Little China."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard of that. I... don't know what it is."
"__MOVIES__ Even if you watch it five times, you won't be much the wiser. Kurt Russell is a truck driver who stumbles into a magical cult in San Francisco's Chinatown and satirically Joe Americas all over the place."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds... interesting. He Joe Americas around, you say."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, he puts on an intentionally dubious drawl and acts like the dumb older brother of Ash from Evil Dead. And gets hit a lot by people smarter and more skilled than he."
"__MOVIES__ So it's kind of a weird satire of American action movies?"
"__MOVIES__ That's exactly what it is. And it's gleeful about how utterly dumb it is."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a change from The Thing, yes. Kurt Russell aside. Is he basically to Carpenter what Johnny Depp is to Tim Burton?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. And Carpenter's equivalent to Burton's Danny Elfman is, uh, John Carpenter. His scores are like his films: no-budget, absurdly simple, yet fascinating and effective."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't expect the Orson Welles analogy to go so far. So he's a real, genuine auteur then."
"__MOVIES__ There's no other obvious box to stick him in, so I'd say very much yes."
