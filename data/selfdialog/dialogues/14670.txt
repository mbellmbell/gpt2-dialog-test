"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi there! How's it going?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm pretty good, how about you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Great! I've had the last couple days off from work."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's awesome, have you been up to anything fun?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ My boyfriend and I went to a concert last week in the city."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, cool. Which one?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ We saw Adele live. It was amazing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow, that's awesome, I heard she's not going to be touring much anymore."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know! We had a chance to get the tickets, and couldn't pass it up."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Were the seats expensive?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ummm, we probably paid more than we should have."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good seats though?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, definitely! About 10 rows back from the front."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm so jealous! Did she sing 'Hello'?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes! Pretty much all of her songs that you've heard on the radio, and some new stuff that I didn't recognize."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That sounds so cool. I wish I could've gone too!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Are there any concerts you wanted to see this summer?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm big into country music, so maybe one of those tours when they come to town."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That'd be awesome, you should let me know if you're going to buy tickets!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Will do! It was great catching up with you!"
