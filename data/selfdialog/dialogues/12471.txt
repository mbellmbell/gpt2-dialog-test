"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a football fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I worry about the long term health consequences of football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you're not playing, just watching!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable about supporting the sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What sort of health consequences?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Doctors and scientists have suggested that repeated small head injuries can be detrimental to players, leading to painful mental and physical symptoms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's called chronic traumatic encephalopathy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you know about this?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's been in the news a lot recently. There was also a Hollywood dramatization of some of the early findings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I had heard rumblings but had no idea it was so serious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it is. Though I still follow the sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard not to!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is. And there are so few things that don't involve someone getting hurt or exploited at some level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sad but true. At least players are usually well compensated at the NFL level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Though they also have relatively little freedom to move about as they please."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. Sometimes teams seem to think they own the players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It begins in college-- players are workers and deserve to be compensated as such."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I agree with that. It's like a waiting game-- if you make it out of college the NFL will reward you if you are good enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And hopefully your health won't be sacrificed."
