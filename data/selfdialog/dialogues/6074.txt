"__STAR_WARS__ Remember the end of the STAR WARS original movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like when they were trying to destroy the DEATH STAR?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's it. It was intense."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was crazy with all the space ships flying all around."
"__STAR_WARS__ And they would get shot and burn up."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader's space ship looked different."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it looked mean like him."
"__STAR_WARS__ And then Luke used the FORCE!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think he could have shot into that hole without the FORCE."
"__STAR_WARS__ Bye, bye DEATH STAR."
