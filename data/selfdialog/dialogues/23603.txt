"__DISNEY__ Me and the kids watched Aladdin yesterday. I forgot how much I love that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah!  I loved that one as a kid!"
"__DISNEY__ It's still great as an adult, but you definitely notice different things."
"__DISNEY__ Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Abu is a pain in the butt!  It's because of him the chamber closed, and he didn't want to share with the street kids."
"__DISNEY__ I never thought of that!  Were the songs still as good?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!  My kids have been singing them all day today."
"__DISNEY__ 'A whole new world'!  Haha, I used to sing that constantly as a kid.  Must have driven my Mom nuts!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too!  Now I know how my Mom felt.  They're driving me nuts!"
"__DISNEY__ Would you mind if I borrow it?  I'd love to watch it again."
