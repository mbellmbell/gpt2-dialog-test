"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you like the Colts this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kind of mixed on them to be honest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  Seems like they could break out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To me, they've been a disappointment as of late."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember thinking a few years ago that they would be perennial contenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but Andrew Luck is a bit overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like everyone slotted him to be the best thing since white bread."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did, but he's arguably not even a top ten QB in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they just gave him too much credit to fast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's got some good receivers though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  I love me some TY Hilton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That dude is a jitterbug for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they have speed on the opposite side too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that guy who played at Miami."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Phillip Dorsett is his name.  Arguably the fastest pair of receivers in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't their defense suspect though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not the greatest.  I think they signed a lot of free agents this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do like Vontae Davis though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, a bit of a down year last year, but a good player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They stole that guy from Miami."
