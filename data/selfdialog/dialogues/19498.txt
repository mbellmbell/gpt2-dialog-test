"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Central Intelligence?"
"__MOVIES__ No, who is in that?"
"__MOVIES__ The rock and Kevin Hart."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, maybe I have. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the one where the Rock and Kevin Hart went to highschool together and they meet up again as adults."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I remember watching the previews."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you should definitely go see it, it's great."
"__MOVIES__ I don't have time for movies, just tell me about it."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, well back in highschool Kevin Hart was the super cool kid, and The Rock was the fat loser that everyone bullied."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I can see where this is going."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, but Kevin Hart was the only one that was friends with the Rock."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, go on."
"__MOVIES__ Well 20 years later, Kevin Hart is stuck at a boring job that he hates when suddenly the Rock contacts him with a new name and asks him if he wants to hang out."
"__MOVIES__ But really, The Rock is a spy right?"
"__MOVIES__ Right, and the Rock is trying to get some information out of Kevin Hart because of the kind of work he does."
"__MOVIES__ This doesn't sound very funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yea but it really is. Every scene is full of humor."
"__MOVIES__ So the two of them are essentially enemies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, kind of, but really deep down they are best friends, and in the end they work together."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok, it sounds pretty good."
