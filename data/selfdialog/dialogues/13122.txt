"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best team in the NFC East this upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding me? You have to be joking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just pulling your leg. No way the Eagles even make the playoffs this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't go that far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would. Carson Wentz is a dud. He can not carry that team to a winning record much less the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You may be right. He looked inconsistent last season. So who do you really think is the best in the NFC East?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone paying attention knows it's the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys? Really? Aren't they all rookies?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they are a young team but they have some real talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did watch some of there games and have to admit they looked pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are trending up and I only expect the team to be better this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to agree but what about the Giants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are always a threat every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli Manning is getting old but their offense has the ability to win games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas really had no answer for them last season and expect more of the same this upcoming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Dallas can beat the Giants at all this upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I predict that they will split the games with each team winning one a piece."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Close games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure! There will be no blow outs in either of the two match-ups."
