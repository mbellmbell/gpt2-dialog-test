"__DISNEY__ Have you heard that they are making a Broadway musical of Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that's great! I love Broadway musicals!"
"__DISNEY__ I hope they add more songs. I love the ones that are there already, of course, especially 'Let It Go.'"
"__DISNEY__ I think my favorite is 'For the First Time in Forever.'"
"__DISNEY__ It's interesting, though. I wonder if the Elsa they choose will be able to top Idina Menzel."
"__DISNEY__ Or Kristen Bell? But I didn't even know that she could sing before she played Anna."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder how they will do the parts with Sven talking with Kristoff."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, obviously they won't use a live animal, but a costume for a person, maybe?"
"__DISNEY__ And would Olaf be a costume or a puppet?"
"__DISNEY__ Because of his size, I think a puppet might work better, but who knows?"
