"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Ed Sheeran album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't, but my sister bought it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, it's great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's what she said too."
"__MUSIC__ Did she say anything else about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really.  I didn't really pay attention though, because she's a big Ed Sheeran fan anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, don't you like his music?"
"__MUSIC__ I've liked all his music I've heard on the radio.  I've just never sat down and listened to a whole album."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song by him?"
"__MUSIC__ Definately not tha one that everyone uses for their wedding song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, 'Thinking Out Loud?'  Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just overplayed.  I got tired of hearing it at every wedding I went to."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see.  The song wasn't bad though."
"__MUSIC__ No, not the first two hundred times I heard it."
"__MUSIC__ So what is your favorite then?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I like 'Don't' the best.  Either that or maybe 'Photograph.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I liked those too."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't 'Don't' based on a true experience?"
"__MUSIC__ It supposedly was.  Some other artist."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so he writes songs about girls kind of like Taylor Swift writes about her exes."
