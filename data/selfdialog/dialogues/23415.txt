"__DISNEY__ Who is your favorite Disney princess?"
"__DISNEY__ Snow White is my favorite. She is the fairest of them all!"
"__DISNEY__ I am not a Snow White fan. Do you just like her, or are you a fan of the movie as well?"
"__DISNEY__ The movie is one of my favorites. Why don't you like her?"
"__DISNEY__ She's ok but I don't like her singing voice. I do like how she treats the dwarfs though."
"__DISNEY__ That is a shame, I love her singing voice. Let me ask you: who is your favorite Disney princess?"
"__DISNEY__ I would have to say Pocahontas, though I know she isn't exactly a princess."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I love Pocahontas!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah she is a really neat character. I like the princesses that aren't so 'damsel in distress.'"
"__DISNEY__ I love the Colors of the Wind!"
