"__DISNEY__ Have you watched Moana?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! It was cute, but I thought it was a little inapproapriate."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, really? Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it glamorizes tattoos and exposes children to them at such an early age."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I saw most of the male characters had tattoos, but they were tribal and part of their culture."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. It still isn't something I want my kid looking at and wanting to get."
"__DISNEY__ I understand. You can probably just tell your kid that some culture norms are different and even though they have tattoos in theirs, doesn't mean it's acceptable in yours."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I'll just tell my kids to not get any funny ideas and stick to the movie plot. Which was excellent, by the way."
"__DISNEY__ I know, I love how wacky the demigod Maui was!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I particularly loved that he resembled Dwayne Johnson so much, my favorite actor!"
