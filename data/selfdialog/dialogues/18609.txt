"__MOVIES__ Hey you! What's crackin?"
"__MOVIES__ Funny you should mention that, Kraken that is, as the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie is."
"__MOVIES__ Is what?"
"__MOVIES__ Kraken... as in release the Kraken! Nevermind."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! Haha! I never really watched those movies after the first one."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame. They're really good."
"__MOVIES__ That's what everyone keeps saying. It must be true if they're on their sixth film."
"__MOVIES__ Dead Men Tell No Tales is actually the fifth one, but I think Joachim RÃ¸nning hinted that the sixth may be the final chapter."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll check it out whenever it's truly done... if that ever happens. You know how I like to binge watch things."
"__MOVIES__ Haha I'm the same way normally, but I make the exception for Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ Normally I'm the same way with the latest Marvel movie, but as chaotic as life has been I did catch Doctor Strange until dvd and at this rate won't see Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 until it hits the dollar theater sadly."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame. What's taking you so long to see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Waiting on another friend slash crush thing. Things are... complicated between us so not sure if we're still on for more movie dates at the moment."
"__MOVIES__ That sucks. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I have no doubt. Like hell I'm missing it or Spider-Man Homecoming."
"__MOVIES__ Spider-Man Homecoming looks sick! Not a fan of the young Peter Parker, but Tom Holland nailed it in Captain America: Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ I agree completely - he's the whole reason all my doubt's went out the window & I'm seeing it opening night. Still wish we had Andrew Garfield though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he made a great older Peter Parker. And Emma Stone was the perfect Gwen Stacy."
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't agree more, and I have such a total celebrity crush on Emma."
"__MOVIES__ You would. I'm more into Eliza Dushku myself."
