"__STAR_WARS__ I think Rogue One was a great example of taking an obscure but vital reference in A New Hope and turning it into a dynamite action film."
"__STAR_WARS__ I disagree. I think in filming Rogue One they were straining for plot ideas."
"__STAR_WARS__ But just think of it: it's the archetypical story of a group of misfits who sacrifice themselves for high ideals."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to admit that you're right about that. And Jyn certainly makes a compelling character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course. She's the classic hero figure who finds her calling and sacrifices everything else to fulfil it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but I don't like the ending. It's too harsh; Everyone gets killed."
"__STAR_WARS__ They make the ultimate sacrifice. What's wrong with that? And isn't it awesome at the end that the story ties in to giving the Deathstar plans to Princess Lia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was nice to tie it in to A New Hope in that way. But the way they used CGI to simulate Carrie Fisher didn't work well."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. For me too that kind of spoiled that final scene. But I have to look at it in perspective. They did the best they could."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they did. At least it did successfully link this movie to the series."
