"__MOVIES__ Did you see that a new Frozen movie is finally coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but not until November of 2019!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, that really seems like a long time to wait."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like people will have forgotten about it by then."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know. It became quite the cultural phenomenon."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I think the songs are really what did it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Disney hadn't produced anything like that with great songs in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ I think they realized that they should go back to that which is why we got Moana."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I haven't seen that one yet."
"__MOVIES__ It is really good! And another one that incoporates songs throughout the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard one - something about the water."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is How Far I'll Go."
"__MOVIES__ That's it! I really like that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the movie has a lot of really great songs in it."
"__MOVIES__ As much as I like Disney remaking the classic movies as live action, I think it's great that they've started to go back to the musical format but with new movies."
"__MOVIES__ Clearly audiences like it to! It seems to be a winning formula for them."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Do they have anything like that coming out next year?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. I think it is mostly remakes and sequels."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad. I like those too, but it is nice to see something really original."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely agree!"
