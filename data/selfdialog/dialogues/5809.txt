"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was absolutely terrible."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you serious? I thought it was great."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ugh, the plot line was so slow, I couldn't stand it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, but there were many plot holes filled from previous movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They explained why the Death Star had the one gleaming imperfection which caused it to explode."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, but the movie itself was only good for the last 20 minutes or so."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess if you;re only in it for the action."
"__STAR_WARS__ When there are Jedi's and the Force, of course I'm in it for the action!"
