"__MUSIC__ Do you like music?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure! Although I have no favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Really. How do you know what you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess a lot depends on my mood."
"__MUSIC__ That's odd isn't it? Most people have a favorite don't they? Color, pet, movie?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if it's odd but I wouldn't say I'm the only one like this."
"__MUSIC__ What else tells you, 'This is a good song.'"
"__MUSIC__ Well, this may be the same as mood but something about the song just 'hits' me of connects. Could be any genre."
"__MUSIC__ Even Punk?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, even though I'm well past 'Punk' there have been some Punk songs which had a nice sound."
"__MUSIC__ What about the other genres? Elevator music?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. I've learned about historical music via some of the music of other centuries. Pachelbel's Cannon comes to mind."
"__MUSIC__ Lyrics or melody?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely the melody. And even the way certain musicians vary the same song make it better."
"__MUSIC__ Don't the lyrics have a purpose?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes no. Sometimes I learn the lyrics as an after thought. Sometimes I can follow along almost subliminally. Sometimes lyrics make the song."
"__MUSIC__ So there's no rhyme or reason to your musical interest?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever liked a song and then not so much?"
"__MUSIC__ Tom Petty, American Girl I think. Great melody then goes completely elsewhere."
