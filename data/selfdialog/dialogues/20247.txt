"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the last Terminator movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have. I've got mixed feelings about it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess I'm just too much of a fan of the first two movies. The girl didn't work for me as the newest terminator robot."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I kind of liked her."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose it's just me. She was all right, but I would prefer to see a guy."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it was too hard for them to come up with yet another guy robot who would be cool. Instead of 'same old, same old,' you know."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you are saying. They had to think of something new, so they introduced a girl terminator."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. So, what else did you find disappointing?"
"__MOVIES__ John Connor. Yet another actor to play John Connor??"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I thought of that, too. Why not cast the same kid who played John in Terminator 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. He'd be the right age by now."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Unless they had offered him the part and he declined, they should have hired him."
"__MOVIES__ Other than that... It was a decent movie, I suppose. Arnold was good."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I enjoyed seeing him as the robot again. He's getting old though."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Probably the last time he's doing it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if they want to keep it realistic, as least to some extent, the terminator shouldn't age, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course. Even now, if you compare him in the first movie and in the last, there's a big difference."
"__MOVIES__ Very noticeable, yes. I suppose most fans will be forgiving of that though."
"__MOVIES__ I know I am."
