"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like listening to Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes.  I think she is so talented.  I would love to see her in concert."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I couldn't believe how well she did at the Superbowl halftime show.  That was super entertaining."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I didn't realize those were all drones that were flying through the air at the beginning of it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm guessing she had something to do with the planning of that whole performance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Probably.  She's so original.  Can you imagine wearing a meat dress."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think that's kind of disgusting, but leave it to her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I have to say that I like to try and sing along with her when I hear her song 'Poker Face'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I imagine you look pretty weird driving in a car singing that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, I only do it when there is nobody around.  Otherwise I would probably look like I'm having a seizure or something."
