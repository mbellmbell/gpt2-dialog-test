"__MUSIC__ You were in marching band, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ How did you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ I hated it passionately, for the most part."
"__MUSIC__ Why? I know you hate a lot of things, though."
"__MUSIC__ I never wanted to do it, but it got me out of the house and sort of socializing."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't you enjoy the shows?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. We once were marching in a Halloween parade and kids threw candy into my sousaphone bell."
"__MUSIC__ Hahahahah, I'm sorry!"
"__MUSIC__ Wish I smacked them with it, or used them as a mute."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like the game experience?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of. I enjoyed playing in the band in the stands, but on the field there was too much multitasking."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ And you know high schoolers. They suck at nearly everything."
"__MUSIC__ That's harsh."
"__MUSIC__ Go watch high school marching bands. Terrible."
"__MUSIC__ You're getting a bit bitter. Tell me something nice about it."
"__MUSIC__ After each home game, we'd go out and get pizza at Valley Pizza until late at night."
"__MUSIC__ Well, at least there's that!"
"__MUSIC__ Gotta love putting calories back on after a long day on the field."
