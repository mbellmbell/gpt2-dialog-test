"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you think the Patriots can repeat this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! Tom Brady is getting too old, he's going to break down eventually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They say that every year and it never happens, now he's got more weapons"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what Aaron Rodgers and the Packers? Talk about weapons"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady now has Brandin Cooks, that's going to a really hard combo to stop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fine, my dark horse though are the Ravens"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?? Joe Flacco? No way"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've got Jeremy Maclin now, finally a good reciever for him to throw to, plus a bunch of other targets"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, bet the Ravens go 8-8, miss the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that Baltimore defense is intense. Although they have to get by the Steelers twice"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Antonio Brown is dangerous. Who do you have for the worst team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cleveland Browns, like every year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking the same thing. Whose the team that comes out of nowhere to almost win it all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Oakland Raiders"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah! Derek Carr and that huge contract? Why not"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah finally a good team from California"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean Los Angeles now has the Rams and Chargers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but neither of them will do anything, plus the 49ers are terrible"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes San Francisco is the second worst team in the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should resign Colin Kapernick"
