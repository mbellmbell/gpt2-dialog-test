"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to Kpop music?"
"__MUSIC__ Kpop - is that like that singer PSY who did Gangnam Style?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think PSY got a billion views on YouTube for that, some outrageously high number."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favortie Kpop group?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I love this pop duo named TVXQ. They are legends in South Korea and most of Asia."
"__MUSIC__ Why are they so popular?"
"__MUSIC__ Usually Kpop boy bands are made up of beautiful boys with very little talent. Mostly they serve as fantasy boyfriends for their fans."
"__MUSIC__ What about TVXQ?"
"__MUSIC__ They did that, sure, but they were also one of the most talented group of singers ever put together by any of the South Korean entertainment companies."
"__MUSIC__ Pretty faces and good voices too?"
"__MUSIC__ Plus Kpop boy bands dance while they sing, and TVXQ had great choreography. They really took South Korea by storm."
"__MUSIC__ So I'm guessing they're still popular?"
"__MUSIC__ Not as much with the teenagers who are the Kpop demographic, but there are a lot of girls/women who have grown older with TVXQ and are solid fans."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about them?"
"__MUSIC__ I originally loved their sound - they were originally a 5 man group and their a cappella singing was extraordinary. Plus I loved to watch them dance."
"__MUSIC__ What happened to the 5?"
"__MUSIC__ 3 of them bailed from the group because they wanted more money. The two that are left are now the duo TVXQ, and they are in many ways better than the original 5."
"__MUSIC__ Should I check them out?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, they have a ton of YouTube music videos that you can sample. Watch 'Mirotic' to see the 5 man group and 'Keep Your Head Down' to see the duo."
"__MUSIC__ I'll take a loot at them, thanks!"
