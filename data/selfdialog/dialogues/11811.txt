"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The next NFL football season is coming up; what did you think of last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought that there were some nice surprises. What did you think of the NFC champonship game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Boy, looked like the Falcons had no competition and ran with the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, those Packers just threw away a possible miracle comeback on two occasions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did you like the playoff situation for the NFC South?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was hoping that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers would have made it in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, you like the Buccaneers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yes, been a fan since 1998."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For real? Why the Buccaneers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, they once had a spectacular defense and they appeared to be collecting themselves last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh...ok? The Buccaneers had a good defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh sure. I may be a little ancient with my statement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't remember Tampa Bay ever being a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they earned my respect during the 1999 NFC championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, how so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I can remember transferring from a college in Lakeland, FL to a college in St. Louis that year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, didn't the NFC championship have the Rams and Buccaneers facing each other?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and I'd just started attending a school in St. Louis. There were lots of mouthy St. Louis fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, I can imagine; sorry for the disruption, but, the Buccaneers actually earned your respect than?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, believe it or not, word went around that students would get an individual pizza for every touchdown that the Rams beat the Buccaneers by. I was nervously watching the championship game. One the first play, the Buccaneers got an interception. I was so happy that I fell asleep until some point in the 3rd quarter. I can remember that the Buccaneers had shut the Rams down and were up 6 to 0. The stadium was a eco silence with disappointed Rams fans. That stadium silence is what than fill me with respect for the Buccaneers. After the game, even though the Buccaneers lost, there were no pizzas to give."
