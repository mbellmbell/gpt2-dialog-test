"__STAR_WARS__ Be honest, were you pulling for Anakin even though you knew how he would end up?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh for sure, who couldn't pull for a kid?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. He just becomes so evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well yes, he does, but he is still important."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I know, you have to evil in a movie about good and evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well yes, but he is important because he Luke and Leia's dad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I guess if that never happened the whole story would be very different."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. But he comes around in the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love that scene. I just wish they had more time together."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I think there is a lot that he could have learned from him. At least who is mother was."
