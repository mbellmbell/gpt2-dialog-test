"__BEATLES__ You know what's funny? I just realized I'm listening to the same music my parents listened to at my age."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah, what's that?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm really getting into The Beatles. I just listened to the whole Sergeant Pepper album."
"__BEATLES__ Hasn't that been voted the greatest album all time by some of those Rolling Stone type magazines?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm not sure, but it's hard to believe this album is 50 years old. It somehow still feels fresh and new."
"__BEATLES__ Some of the songs seem a bit dated to me, but others like 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' sound like an indie band could have made it in the past 5 years."
"__BEATLES__ It's really amazing. Think about the TV from 50 years ago. It was all black and white and doesn't hold up at all today."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, The Beatles are timeless, I'll give you that."
"__BEATLES__ Not to mention how influential they are. Whether other bands give them credit directly or not, they were trailblazers."
"__BEATLES__ They were revolutionary. It's easy to think of them always being there, but they had to create this music that became the foundation for so much later music we love now."
