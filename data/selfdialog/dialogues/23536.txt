"__DISNEY__ Have you ever seen The Princess Diaries?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I have. I was Anne Hathaway's first movie wasn't it?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so. She was really funny in it."
"__DISNEY__ I loved the makeover scene."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, before her makeover it was so convincing that she was average looking."
"__DISNEY__ She's definitely not average looking."
"__DISNEY__ They made a sequel to it but I didn't like it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the whole concept of forcing her to marry someone put me off."
"__DISNEY__ She found a good guy in the end though."
"__DISNEY__ Only through luck. I liked the guy she was with in the first movie but they totally got rid of him for Chris Pine."
