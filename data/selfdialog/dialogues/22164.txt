"__DISNEY__ Whats your favorite Disney movie of all time?"
"__DISNEY__ If I had to answer I would say none of them."
"__DISNEY__ What?!?!?! How can you like NO Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ They all have the same ending and its boringly predictable."
"__DISNEY__ That's what people love about them, they have happy endings!"
"__DISNEY__ It is precisely what I don't like about them."
"__DISNEY__ Well what would you do then?"
"__DISNEY__ I would have the Beast kill Belle and then you can have a sequel."
"__DISNEY__ That's....horrible."
"__DISNEY__ No, that's marketing."
