"__DISNEY__ I thought Lindsay Lohan was in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ She was in the remake in 1998 but I don't think she was as good as Hallie Mills was."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't see the first one but I thought Lindsay was pretty good."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she was good but Hallie made me want to have a twin sister."
