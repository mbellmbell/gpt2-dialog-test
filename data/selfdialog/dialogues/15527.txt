"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hi, I’m going to a costume party with the theme of Harry Potter movies, so I need to come up with something."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Did you want to go as person or as an object?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wanted to maybe go as one of the female staff as I am a mature lady."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Could you pull off a Professor Sprout outfit?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I am a mature lady who is not thin so we have the same body type.  What do you suggest?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Professor Sprout’s costume in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” has a brown robe made up of burlap-style material, but almost any graduation gown that isn’t black could be dyed brown."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What else would I need for that costume?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She has lots of greenery poking out of her collar, wand, and hat top and such. You could use probably any combo of dried or fresh or silk plants and flowers."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She also wear gardening gloves, and if you are going for her look in the first movie must have large earmuffs."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Weren't they funny colored, like maybe pink?"
