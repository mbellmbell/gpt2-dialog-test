"__BEATLES__ When I was in Japan, it seemed like every convenience store was playing Yesterday."
"__BEATLES__ Huh, the Beatles' song?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like the song."
"__BEATLES__ It's not my favorite."
"__BEATLES__ Sure, but it's still a good song."
"__BEATLES__ I just don't really like McCartney as a singer."
"__BEATLES__ That's surprising to me. It's my favorite song on Help!"
"__BEATLES__ Well, it's definitely the most famous."
"__BEATLES__ Anyway, it was just weird to hear it so often in a foreign country."
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles really are popular all over the world!"
