"__DISNEY__ Which was your favorite Disney movie from when you were a kid?"
"__DISNEY__ It would have to be Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ Don't tell me, you couldn't get enough of Genie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, between Robin WIlliams vocie and humor and the magic he was always a hoot."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but the guy who did Genie's voice in Return of Jaffar was pretty good too."
"__DISNEY__ True, and I loved the little Rambo reference when he tries to fight Jafar, even though I didn't get it at first."
"__DISNEY__ Plenty of pop culture references and shape shifting always made Genie funny."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, shame about Robin Wiliams, though"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely, the world lost a great talent with his death."
"__DISNEY__ That is very true."
