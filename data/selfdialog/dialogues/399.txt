"__MUSIC__ Who's your least favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ Nickelback!"
"__MUSIC__ No, that doesn't count. Everyone hate's Nickelback."
"__MUSIC__ Touche. Then I'd say Muse."
"__MUSIC__ Awww snap. Yeah they suck. What ever happened to them?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably everyone collectively realized what we already knew- that they're horrible."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't they release like an electronic album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I think so. There was that one song I heard over and over and over again."
"__MUSIC__ The 'm-m-m-mad mad mad' one?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was called 'Madness'. Brilliant. Just beautiful stuff Muse."
"__MUSIC__ True art. Did you like any of their early stuff though?"
"__MUSIC__ Well... now that I think about it... nope."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, no. They're horrible."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like they were aiming to be U2 or something, I don't even know. It's like they heard 'Vertigo' one time and decided that's what every song was gonna feel like."
"__MUSIC__ Kinda, yeah. Or maybe they were contemporaries of Radiohead and were trying to ride their success wave."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. Either way, I just downright hate 'em."
"__MUSIC__ And so our musical taste remains identical."
"__MUSIC__ It does"
"__MUSIC__ One day we'll disagree about a band."
"__MUSIC__ Probably not."
