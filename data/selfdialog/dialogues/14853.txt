"__ACTION__ Have you seen 'Snatched' with Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn?"
"__ACTION__ Yes, it was kind of stupid. Goldie Hawn was not funny."
"__ACTION__ I didn't think so either.  But Amy was good."
"__ACTION__ Yes, i like the way she runs around telling the kidnappers off."
"__ACTION__ And they kept getting caught too."
"__ACTION__ Why were they out in the jungle anyways?"
"__ACTION__ She met that guy who was showing her around."
"__ACTION__ Oh yeah and he was in on the kidnapping in the first place."
"__ACTION__ Thats the guy she slept with and danced with."
"__ACTION__ At the end it was ok when mom and daughter hugged. Otherwise it was a stupid movie."
