"__LADY_GAGA__ You know what I don't understand about Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No. I personally don't know much about her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, she has a pretty voice but she often doesn't display it. She sometimes sings with this mannish voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Like in Poker Face?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly. Songs like You and I display her pretty voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I haven't heard that one."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's on her Born This Way album. I'll play it for you."
"__LADY_GAGA__ OK. Then I can hear what you mean."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I wish she'd sing the good way all the time."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Madonna does something like this too. I have the same thought about her."
