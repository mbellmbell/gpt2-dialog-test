"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know of any new rules or changes for the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't heard of any yet.  Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was just hoping they haven't messed with it. I like the games the way they are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too.  i do have to admit though, that I like the change about kicking field goals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that did turn out to be a good one.  I had heard that they may want to do away with kicking all together though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that too and I hope they don't.  Kicking is an important part of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be like doing away with punts.  You have to punt and have a return."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what makes the game interesting. You wait to see if the guy can run it all the way back or not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True! So kicking is exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is!  What did you think of the female referree they had last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought she would be just a publicity stunt but I did see her try and break up a fight once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was surprising!  I thought she'd be to 'cheerleader like' to do something like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Basically she just did her job and didn't make a deal about being a woman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, she did.  I wonder if the NFL will ever have a woman head coach!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not for a long, long time!  More women have to get involved with watching the games first!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't coach what you don't know.  You have me thinking about rules and stuff and there's a lot to learn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL looks pretty simplistic but it's really not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish the NFL would lower ticket prices to the games while we are talking about changes and stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh me too!  It's way better to just watch on tv!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you watch on tv you can see more emotions of the players."
