"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it a lot. I really got me excited about the Star Wars universe again after being very disappointed in the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see it in the theaters when it came out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it came out around Christmas time so I took a younger relative to see it as part of a Christmas gift. We had a lot of fun."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you think the story was too similar to A New Hope? That's a major complaint."
"__STAR_WARS__ That didn't bother me too much honestly. Stars Wars is already a pretty simple and basic story and that's the charm of it."
"__STAR_WARS__ So who's the better villain, Kylo Ren or Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well we've only seen Kylo Ren in one movie so far so it's not something I can compare yet. They're both good in their own ways though and one isn't better than the other."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was great to see Han Solo again after all these years."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was awesome seeing Harrison Ford really get back into that role. He really nailed all the Han Solo mannerisms and really seemed to enjoy playing him again."
