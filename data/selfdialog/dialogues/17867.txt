"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Arrival yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I saw it last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ It was a trip wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I'm still trying to figure out what happened."
"__MOVIES__ Wanna hear my theory?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely!"
"__MOVIES__ I think as she lives through the present, her mind or consciousness basically time travels to other times in her life."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'm still a little confused."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, say it's 5pm and she's with the aliens, at 6pm, her consciousness is no longer there but in the future with her daughter. 7pm she's back."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! So all of those moments where she seems lost in thought? That's where she goes in her mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, almost like astral projection but through time, not just space."
"__MOVIES__ That's very interesting! The guy who came up with that must be a genius!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, right? It kinda reminds me of Interstellar."
"__MOVIES__ Man, I was so upset when that one alien died."
"__MOVIES__ Yea my wife actually cried during that part."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Mine did too!"
"__MOVIES__ It was really sad though."
"__MOVIES__ I got chills during the part with the Chinese guy."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I did too. It was a deep movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think I need to see it again now after hearing your theory! It might make more sense to me."
