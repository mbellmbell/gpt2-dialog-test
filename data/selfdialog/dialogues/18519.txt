"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Allied?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was ok. There were a lot of cool elements, but it was not as good as I expected."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I wanted more of a fun, spy type of thriller. It was that in the beginning, but the second act just turned into a melodramatic love story."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can see that. It was kind of a downer, Hallmark ending."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I wanted Marion Cotillard's character to not be the bad guy in the end. Or at least if she was, that she be a cooler character."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I could have done without the whole part where she had a baby and their family life. That was boring."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I just wanted more action. There were some cool visuals, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I liked the party scene where the the plane came crashing towards the house. The tracking shot in the party was good, too."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Robert Zemeckis alwasy does cool shots like that. I like his atmosphere."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it reminded me a little bit of What Lies Beneath."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was a good movie. Marion Cotillard was really good in it, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. She's great in whatever she does. Brad Pitt was good, but kind of wooden."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. He looked like he was melting during the whole movie."
"__MOVIES__ Lol. Yes, he's starting to show his age. Still hot, though."
"__MOVIES__ Totally. I think he could have showed some more intensity and range in the part."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. He didn't have a lot of good material to work with though...with dialogue, anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. The character was written in kind of a flat way."
"__MOVIES__ The love scene in the car was good."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Very passionate."
