"__HARRY_POTTER__ You don't like Hedwig? Are you serious?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well she's kind of useless."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She's literally the cutest animal in the entire show."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Cute doesn't equal useful though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True, but she delivers his letters and brings presents from his friends..."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And other things, yes. But still she's useless."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You are really going to need to explain yourself better."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She just doesn't do much, I mean Hermione's cat does more than Hedwig."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Crookshanks? If you mean being an overall menace, then sure you're right."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hedwig just didn't do much for me, I was sad she died in the last movie though."
