"__ROCK__ Were the Ramones and The Clash big at your school?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, there were a few kids really in to them. Most of the people I knew were more in to U2, REM, The Alarm."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, those bands are good too. I was in to them too. I even liked a little B-52s."
"__ROCK__ I totally forgot about them. Talk about a blast from the past."
"__ROCK__ Yeah it was either those kind of alternative bands or classic rock bands...I remember there was Eagles resurgence."
"__ROCK__ Eeew, really? Hair bands were big...think Bon Jovi."
"__ROCK__ Yuck, I've never been a fan. I can't deal with guys that use more hairspray than I do."
"__ROCK__ Ha! True. I guess I've always kind of like the alternative groups. I was into Nirvana and Pearl Jam when they made it to east coast."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, me too. We've grown up with some really great music."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I can't stomach some of this new stuff. Guess I'm getting old."
