"__COMEDY__ i think AFI's top comedy list is rigged"
"__COMEDY__ How do you figure that?"
"__COMEDY__ I don't like most of the films that's in the top ten."
"__COMEDY__ That doesn't make IT rigged. Just makes you a bad movie fan"
"__COMEDY__ i don't think so. I am a very average movie fan. if I like a movie, it's likely others will too"
"__COMEDY__ Then why don't you like most the films in the top ten out of the 100 picked by the AFI?"
"__COMEDY__ I think of all the top 10 comedy picked by the AFI, the airplane is the best one. And they ranked it at 10th place"
"__COMEDY__ You're choosing the airplane over Dr Strangelove? That's just wrong man."
"__COMEDY__ Dr. Strangelove sucked."
"__COMEDY__ That's it. I'm out. I'm not talking to you anymore. I'm going to unfriend on facebook and ignore you for the rest of your life."
