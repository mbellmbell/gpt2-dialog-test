"__MOVIES__ Oh, I am so disappointed that Beauty and the Beast is no longer in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't see it?"
"__MOVIES__ No! And I was so excited to see Emma Watson as Belle!"
"__MOVIES__ Hermione as Belle does make perfect sense, doesn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ It really, really does. Do you know when the movie comes out on DVD?"
"__MOVIES__ At the beginning of June, I think."
"__MOVIES__ That's not too far away! Want to watch it with me when it comes out?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! You know I'm a sucker for Disney movies."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Moana yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, though I have been planning to."
"__MOVIES__ I have the DVD at my house. Are you free for a movie night at my place?"
"__MOVIES__ Let me check my schedule."
"__MOVIES__ What's the verdict?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm free! Are there any other movies you want me to bring?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm... The Cinderella remake was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I'll bring my copy."
"__MOVIES__ I also have several anime movies that I want to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Miyzaki films?"
"__MOVIES__ Some of them! Ponyo is Miyazaki, but I also have a Fullmetal Alchemist movie I want to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it's going to be a fun night!"
