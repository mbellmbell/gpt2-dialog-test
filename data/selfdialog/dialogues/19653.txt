"__MOVIES__ What do you consider to be the best movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a tough one. But I'd have to choose Taxi Driver."
"__MOVIES__ Really? And why that film?"
"__MOVIES__ It's pulp story told in the most beautiful way."
"__MOVIES__ I always thought it was overly violent."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the beauty is in the violence. It's in the grit of the city and the pain of the characters."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a brutal look into the mind of a man who is not quite right, in a city that's not quite right."
"__MOVIES__ Did you David Hinkley, the guy who shot Reagan was obsessed with Jodie Foster in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that."
"__MOVIES__ He actually tried to find her at the time, but couldn't get close enough to her..."
"__MOVIES__ So instead he tried to kill the president, to impress her."
"__MOVIES__ The way Travis does in Taxi Driver."
"__MOVIES__ Crazy. The movie has some other great characters as well. Albert Brooks... Peter Boyle."
"__MOVIES__ I read that the guy who sells Travis all the weapons was actually a bit of a drug dealer at the time, so that's why he's so realisitic."
"__MOVIES__ So what do you think about the end? Do you think he actually did all those things?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think it's all what he HOPED would happen. I think he either died or is jail."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what I think too. The now from Iris's parents at the end is written in Travis's handwriting, so it makes you think it's something he's created."
"__MOVIES__ And, of course, there's the famous 'you talking to me?' scene. One of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. It's one of the most iconic scenes in cinema."
