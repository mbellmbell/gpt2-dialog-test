"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the Pro Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's a total waste of time"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I hate that game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just a way for the NFL to make more money"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and it's dangerous for the players"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they get hurt in the pro bowl then they definitely will regret playing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That just takes money out of their pocket"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's a stupid concept"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do like the idea of having an all star team though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and most other sports teams have it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, if a player goes to the pro bowl, it increases their worth when it comes to signing contracts"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, many times teams decide how good someone is by how many pro bowls they've been to"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I can see it both ways"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think it's heavily skewed towards the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without a doubt, the league always gets their money!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I usually do watch the game though because its one of the last of the year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it always signals an end to the season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's kind of a farewell game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose it's not all that bad then, I will give it another chance"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I will too!"
