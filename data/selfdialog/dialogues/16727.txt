"__MOVIES__ Did you hear they're coming out with a new Mary Poppins movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Another remake? Disney is on a rampage."
"__MOVIES__ This one looks good though, at least from the little bit they've shown."
"__MOVIES__ The original is so good, though. Why redo it?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know but as I understand it, it's not a remake but a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of hard considering Julie Andrews is a lot older now."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the character is still young so they cast Emily Blunt in the title role."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, she's really great in musicals. I didn't care for 'Into the Woods' but I liked her."
"__MOVIES__ I did, too. Plus I like her in other things. I think she'll do great. I heard Julie Andrews approves of her in the role."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if Julie Andrews has given her seal of approval then it's worth a look."
"__MOVIES__ You'll like this then: Dick Van Dyke has a role."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow! Then I'll definitely go see it. The same character?"
"__MOVIES__ Sort of. He's not the chimney sweep, but he's the old banker's son."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he did play the old banker. I forgot about that."
"__MOVIES__ Angela Lansbury is in it, too."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's already a pretty impressive cast."
"__MOVIES__ Colin Firth and Meryl Streep also have big roles."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'm convinced. When does it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Next year, in December."
"__MOVIES__ That's a long wait, but I'm sure it'll be worth it."
