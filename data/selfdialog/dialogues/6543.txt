"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely the Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, why's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved the twists and turns. My favorite scene was when Han saw Vader and was about to shoot."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's definitely a great moment. My favorite would have to be the original Star Wars though."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's a classic; you can't go wrong."
"__STAR_WARS__ The storyline is so well done. Plus, I loved 'Ben' Kenobi. He's my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ah, if I had to pick I would go for the Han/Chewbacca duo."
"__STAR_WARS__ They have an amazing rapport, that's for sure. Poor Chewie, he never got his medal."
"__STAR_WARS__ We can only hope someone gave it to him later!"
