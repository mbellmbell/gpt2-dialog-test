"__BASKETBALL__ I think the NBA season should be cut to 50 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ It would be more exciting."
"__BASKETBALL__ And maybe cut the playoffs in half."
"__BASKETBALL__ Thats alot of missed revenue."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well some teams that make it have a record under 500."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but cutting the playoff teams in half doesnt fix that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure it does, eliminate the first round."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why not have everyone make it at that point?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well that renders the regular season useless."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, you would still need it for seeding purposes."
"__BASKETBALL__ I dont think you need it for that, you need it to make money to pay salaries."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well salaries would take a dip but why would the owners care about that"
"__BASKETBALL__ Their revenues would be cut in half."
"__BASKETBALL__ OK so keep the playoffs the same but cut the regular season down?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Thats what I am saying."
"__BASKETBALL__ I just dont see how they would lose that money and be OK with it."
"__BASKETBALL__ The problem is you know the playoffs are set by February."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not true, the bottom teams are always scraping."
"__BASKETBALL__ I would like a playoff format where the best teams get byes. Its only fair."
"__BASKETBALL__ This isnt football, that makes no sense."
