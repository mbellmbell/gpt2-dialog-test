"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a fan of the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course! I watch every Sunday in the fall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the team you follow?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really have a particular team, I just like the game. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Patriots fan through and through."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Must be real difficult to like a winning team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they've been my favorite since before they started this new era. Drew Bledsoe was still the quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, fair enough. So last year's Super Bowl must have been awesome for you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, not at first. I was a little depressed when the score was 28-3."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can imagine. But it was the Falcons' fans depressed at the end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's for sure. I really have never seen anything like it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seemed like a combination of the Patriots being really good and the Falcons just melting down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and an unwillingess to change the game plan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Falcons were always an offense with a lot of passing, but they didn't need to do that at the end of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right. Because they were almost in field goal range."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. So if they would've just run a few times, they probably would've won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not that you are complaining though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course not. I got to celebrate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And so did the Pats!"
