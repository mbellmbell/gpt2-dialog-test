"__MUSIC__ What was the first 'real' record or album you  got?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by 'real'?"
"__MUSIC__ Like, not a children's music or a movie soundtrack, things like that."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I understand what you mean now."
"__MUSIC__ The first album that adults also listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I think it was Billy Joel. 'We Didn't Start the Fire'."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I remember that song."
"__MUSIC__ I am not even sure if that's what the album was called. But that was the hot song on it, and that's why I got the album."
"__MUSIC__ That was the one where he just basically rattles off a list of stuff that happened in US history, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep! As a nerdy young kid, that really appealed to me."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, that's funny. Did you only listen to that song, or did you listen to the whole thing."
"__MUSIC__ At first, I only listened to that song, but eventually I listened to the whole album."
"__MUSIC__ And are you a Billy Joel fan to this day?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't listen to his music at all, actually."
"__MUSIC__ So I guess you got your fill of his music at a young age."
"__MUSIC__ Apparently. I bet listening to those songs would bring back some nostalgia, though."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure. I can't even remember my first real album."
"__MUSIC__ I'm surprised. My first one was graven into my memory."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, it was probably something my older sister gave to me."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I guess it's a different thing being an oldest child like me versus being a younger one like you."
