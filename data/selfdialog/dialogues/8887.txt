"__BEATLES__ I have an unpopular opinion about the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ What is it?"
"__BEATLES__ I think they are one of the most overrated groups of all time."
"__BEATLES__ Well, it might surprise you, but I agree with you."
"__BEATLES__ Their early stuff is good, solid early 1960s rock-and-roll--I want to hold your hand, She loves You--"
"__BEATLES__ --twist and shout, Love Me Do--"
"__BEATLES__ Exactly. And then a few years later, it gets more complex but takes on a melancholy I can't stand, and it's not really rock--"
"__BEATLES__ You mean like Eleanor Rigby?"
"__BEATLES__ Yep. And then within a few years of starting they're putting out nonsense like I am the Walrus."
"__BEATLES__ And then 'Revolution Number 9.' Garbage."
