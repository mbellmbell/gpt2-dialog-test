"__MUSIC__ I'm really starting to appreciate Kander and Ebb."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Who. They're a songwriting duo that does musical theatre."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Have they done anything I'd know?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen Chicago? The musical, not the city."
"__MUSIC__ I did. That was the movie with Catherine Zeta-Jones in it, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. There have been a few versions but that's the most recent."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that when it came out. Really dark."
"__MUSIC__ It is, and the music was never my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked the music."
"__MUSIC__ It's not really my style I guess, but I've been listening to more of their songs lately."
"__MUSIC__ And you're changing your mind?"
"__MUSIC__ Somewhat. I still don't like the music in Chicago but a lot of their other shows have good songs in them."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, what makes them different?"
"__MUSIC__ There's this song 'Yes' from a musical about elderly people stealing coats. The song is just incredibly cheerful!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't remember Chicago being cheerful."
"__MUSIC__ This song totally is. A lot of their music is, all about living life and loving the city and stuff like that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Then why is the dark and gloomy show the one I know songs from?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe people like being gloomy?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe! I'm glad it's not all like that though."
