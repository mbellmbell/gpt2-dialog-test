"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to modern classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ What would you consider modern?"
"__MUSIC__ It's basically the latter half of the 20th century to the present."
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean stuff like Phillip Glass?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a good example. Phillip Glass is a minimalist."
"__MUSIC__ I like Philip Glass, but I don't know what a minimalist is."
"__MUSIC__ Are you interested in a brief explanation?"
"__MUSIC__ I suppose so."
"__MUSIC__ Minimalist composers like Philip Glass and Steven Reich tend to take short musical ideas and patterns and repeat them throughout the piece."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds kind of like house music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, house music can have a simplistic repetitive nature to it, so in that regard it is similar. The overall effect is not like night club music though."
"__MUSIC__ I see. What makes it different than dance music?"
"__MUSIC__ The goal of creating a musical composition, if you are a 'serious' composer, is to accomplish some type of profound aesthetic that has never been done before."
"__MUSIC__ So it's like creating something important that contributes to advancing the field of music, rather than just pleasing an audience."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good way of summing it up."
"__MUSIC__ What are some minimalist compositions that you would suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ I particularly like Koyaanisqatsi by Phillip Glass. It's actually the first of a trio of compositions."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure if I've heard that. It's sounds vaguely familiar."
"__MUSIC__ Part of it was used in the film score of the movie 'The Watchmen.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I liked that movie, although it was kind of weird."
