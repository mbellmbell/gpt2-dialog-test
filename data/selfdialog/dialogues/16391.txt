"__ROCK__ I saw a cute story online about Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters."
"__ROCK__ I love Foo Fighters. What happened?"
"__ROCK__ Apparently he has an 8 year old daughter who takes after him and wanted to learn to play the drums."
"__ROCK__ Not surprising. I think kids inherit things like musical ability."
"__ROCK__ He was playing a gig in Iceland and called her onstage to play the drums for a song."
"__ROCK__ That is funny! What did she play?"
"__ROCK__ She played drums for the song 'We Will Rock You' while the rest of the band played along."
"__ROCK__ Oh how cute. Was she any good?"
"__ROCK__ Apparently so. The crowd supposedly loved her."
"__ROCK__ Maybe she'll join the band when she gets bigger like Eddie Van Halen's son joined Van Halen."
