"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, do you want to join my NFL Fantasy Football League?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea!  I can't wait for the season to start!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When is your Fantasy draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be in mid-August, I'll send you an email invite when we have the date settled."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good!  Who are you liking this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers are the best pics for QB?  What do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, definitely Rodgers for sure!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I'm a die-hard Texan, I hope JJ Watt can keep it together this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed!  He's the best DE in the league if he can stay free of injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the Jags this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I'm from Jacksonville so I have a soft spot for the Jaguars but I honestly don't have much hope for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea but they did pick up Ramsey, I think he will be a solid player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea I think so too, Myles Jack was also a good pick-up for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jack is good, I just worry about him with injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, if he stays healthy though he should be solid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still don't see them getting anywhere near the Super Bowl though, they just can't seem to hold it together for an entire season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately I have to agree with you, some major changes have to happen in Jacksonville for them to ever get to a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'll let you know about the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks man, looking forward to it!"
