"__STAR_WARS__ I'm impressed at the amount of merchandise that Star Wars has pumped out all these years."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm a pretty big fan of the video games."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you a fan of the films at all?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really, but I really like the way the lore has translated to video games. It fits extremely well."
"__STAR_WARS__ I kind of agree. I just wish there was some more resemblance to the films."
"__STAR_WARS__ So basically movie tie-in games?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, basically that. That's just me, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Movie tie-ins generally aren't very good, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Still, an Empire Strikes Back game never hurt anyone."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but you might be disappointed after playing it."
