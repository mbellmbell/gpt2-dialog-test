"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Titans are stacking up on their receiving corp."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got Corey Davis AND Taywan Taylor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Taywan was great at WKU. He amassed over 1730 yards his last year. Mariota should be able to target him pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have just 3541 pass yardage with someone as accurate as Mariota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He needs WRs and TEs. Which is why they're stacking up the receivers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tenessee is actually not that bad from passing TD standpoint."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're 8th in the league with 29 pass TDs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a respectable number"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. But Green Bay, man. 40 passing TDs. That's insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers is a passer. And he has Nelson and Adams who are both about the same in abilities"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Randall Cobb was such a disappointment last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh. I played him in fantasy way too much. Regret it so much"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was expensive too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. Never again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We need to get preseason data for the rookies."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not gonna help much anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course it will, it show cases the rookies"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they neve really show off what they can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's not the point, just seeing how they interact with the team says a lot about their potential."
