"__MUSIC__ Okay, give a typical day of music listening."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I might start out listening to Big and RIch, or Trace Atkins."
"__MUSIC__ All right, a little bit country, then I presume you go a little rock."
"__MUSIC__ Bad joke, Donny and Marie, but yes. I might switch to Rob Zombie or Metallica."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of a one 180 turn, have a lot of rough days?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I just go with my own musical flow."
"__MUSIC__ Uh, huh. I has no idead what you mean by that."
