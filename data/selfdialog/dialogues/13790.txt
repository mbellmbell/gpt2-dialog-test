"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think either the Cavs or Warriors will go 16-0 during this postseason?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's possible, but I don't think it's likely."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't, either. But, if you had to choose one of the two to go undefeated, who would it be?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'd probably go with the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Even with LeBron James playing as well as he has been?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't get me wrong. I don't think either team will go undefeated, but the Warriors do have Durrant."
"__BASKETBALL__ They didn't even sweep the Cavs during the regular season!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I think the postseason is much different than the regular season."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. Of the two teams that are still left besides the Cavs and Warriors, which one do you think has the best chance of upsetting things and making it to the finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Celtics, I think."
"__BASKETBALL__ You really don't think the Cavs are all that good!"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's not that. It's just that the Cavs are up 2-0 while Golden State are up 3-0 over the Spurs and it's easier to overcome a two game deficit than a three-game hole."
"__BASKETBALL__ I get that. I would love to see the Warriors lose four straight, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Because you hate Golden State?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Less that then the fact that I really like San Antonio."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I would like to see LeBron face the Spurs again."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he'd win this time because Duncan's gone and the team is old."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. It wouldn't be the same."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it would make for a good narrative on ESPN, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ha! That is probably exactly what would happen."
