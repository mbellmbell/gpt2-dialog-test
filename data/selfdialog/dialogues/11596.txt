"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where are the boys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The are outside playing football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's about right. It's halftime of the Texan-Patriot game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. They raced outside screaming, 'I want to be the Texans...you can be the Patriots!'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the tradition. Every halftime, my Dad used to take my brother and I outside to throw the ball around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why don't you go out and play with them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because of the other tradition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was when we would come back inside after playing football.  Fall in upstate New York was cold and wet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You guessed it!  We would come back in the house all muddy and grass-stained, dripping wet, with mud on our shoes, pants, shirts...you name it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the tradition?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, the tradition was driving our Mom crazy!  Just like we ran outside screaming to play, upon our return inside she would run around screaming, and chase us off of the furniture and into the showers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must have been crazy!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I missed the third quarter of more games that way than I can remember!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go ahead. Play with the boys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you sure?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, go ahead. And I promise I won't scream when you come back inside the house all muddy!"
