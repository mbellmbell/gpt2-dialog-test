"__STAR_WARS__ Which of the original Star Wars trilogy was your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I definitely think Empire Strikes back was my favorite because it was so dark."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked that about Empire Strikes back too. The way it didn't have a happy ending."
"__STAR_WARS__ The reveal of Vader as being Luke's father was astonishing. I remember seeing that and was simply shocked."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it was such a defining moment in the Star Wars Trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you enjoy Return of the Jedi more than Star Wars though?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would rank the trilogy as Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and then Star Wars. It's not to say Star Wars was bad it was more of a set up."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think a lot of people ranked Star Wars over Return of the Jedi because they didn't like the Ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's ridiculous the Ewoks were cute and so cool. They helped the rebellion fight during that whole battle of Endor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I'm not disagreeing just mentioning what most people think of the ranking of the series. I loved the Ewoks too. We need to see them return in future Star Wars!"
