"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yesterday I watched Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah? What'd you think?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I couldn't believe the ending! I never thought that Dumbledore was going to die."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Isn't that part wild? I think Dumbledore had it planned the entire time though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He must have a lot of faith in Harry if he can get killed and know that things are going to work out."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah. Throughout the whole series all he's really said though is to trust Harry, so he must know what he's doing."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also liked how we're introduced to the concept of Horcruxes in this movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Remind me again what a Horcrux is?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's when you split your soul into pieces to try to live forever, so even if your body dies your soul lives on and you can come back to life."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh that's right. Voldemort split his soul into seven parts, if I remember correctly."
