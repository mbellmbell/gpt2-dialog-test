"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think is the worst team in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without a doubt it must be the Cleveland Browns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I was thinking also"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They haven't done anything noticeable in years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember some seasons where they didn't even win a single game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just terrible"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It must be hard to be a cleveland fan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know a few, thankfully they have one of the best basketball teams in the NBA"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that must make them feel a little better"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the jaguars are a close second worse"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I totally agree, they've been about as good as the browns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are starting to show promise though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their quarterback is starting to do good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Blake Bortles has a lot of potential"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that team will improve over the next few years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but not superbowl material"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey but you never know, anything could happen"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those two teams are definitely not winning that anytime soon"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to agree with that for the most part"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I still like to cheer for the underdog"
