"__THRILLER__ I see Netflix has added a couple of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies."
"__THRILLER__ I'm really glad, I think it's past due."
"__THRILLER__ Are you a fan?"
"__THRILLER__ I am, I'm a big fan especially of the first one. It's kind of nostalgic for me cause I remember watching it as a young kid and being enthralled, even though I had recurring nightmares about Freddy Kreuger."
"__THRILLER__ That's kind of ironic. And I'm surprised your parents let you watch it."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I remember seeing it at like 7 years old! I'm surprised cause I didn't remember the nudity and other stuff that was in it until I rewatched it again recently."
"__THRILLER__ 'other stuff' like Robert Englund."
"__THRILLER__ He did a fantastic job portraying Freddy!"
"__THRILLER__ Hence giving you nightmares."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, but I forgive him. I'm really glad he, Heather Langenkamp and Wes Craven got to come back and play themselves in New Nightmare."
