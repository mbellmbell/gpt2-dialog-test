"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite album by the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ It's so hard to choose, but I think I have it narrowed down to Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"
"__BEATLES__ Those are both great ones to choose from. I definitely like the later albums more than the earlier ones."
"__BEATLES__ I agree, but I do still like listening to their early work sometimes, like Help!, for a change of pace."
"__BEATLES__ True, but the music seems so much more original and stylistically developed in the later works. I like the direction John Lennon took with the songs he wrote after about 1965."
"__BEATLES__ I am more partial to Paul McCartney's songs."
"__BEATLES__ Don't get me wrong, he has some awesome contributions as well. I don't think they would have made it so far without his voice."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, and the whole Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band concept was his idea, I believe,"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I think that's true. I read an article about the origin of that album concept before."
"__BEATLES__ I think it was also ranked by some magazine as the top album of all time."
