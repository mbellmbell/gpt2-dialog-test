"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the real to life Cinderella with Lily James and Cate Blanchett?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't. When did it come out?"
"__DISNEY__ It was released in 2015. If you liked the animated Cinderella, you should check it out."
"__DISNEY__ I will have to! I love the animated Cinderella by Disney."
"__DISNEY__ Me too."
"__DISNEY__ Can't believe it came out in 1950. Seems so long ago."
"__DISNEY__ It does. Who's your favorite character?"
"__DISNEY__ I love Cinderella of course, but I also love the mice!"
"__DISNEY__ They really are cute. Gus is especially a favorite of mine. I like how his shirt is too tight!"
"__DISNEY__ He's adorable! I couldn't stand the black cat Lucifer. What a jerk!"
