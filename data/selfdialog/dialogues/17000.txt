"__MOVIES__ So...Batman movies, what do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean the Michael Keaton 'I'm Batman' movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah those and then the all the other ones as well."
"__MOVIES__ I liked Michael Keaton. I wish he would've done more."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of went off the cliff once he left."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there were so many iterations."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Val Kilmer and George Clooney."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, George Clooney! Wasn't that the infamous nipple batsuit."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man I forgot about that one. Yikes!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those were really bad."
"__MOVIES__ And then along came Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a good roboot"
"__MOVIES__ Especially the Joker one with Heath Ledger."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was good, but I also like Jack Nicholson as the joker."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Jack Nicholson?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, for some reason I like the cartoonish factor of his portrayal."
"__MOVIES__ Ummm...I guess if you say so. I still think Ledger was better."
"__MOVIES__ But there was no Prince music at the museum!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my...Prince RIP."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Prince RIP."
