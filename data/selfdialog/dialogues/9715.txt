"__COMEDY__ Hey, do you like romantic comedies?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, I love them?! What are your favorites?"
"__COMEDY__ I really like the ones from the 1990's and early 2000's. Like How to Lose a Guy in 10 days."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yea, that one was great. I really love Matthew Mcconaughey."
"__COMEDY__ Oh man, me too! He is so hot. Have you seen him in Failure to Launch?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, I did. But I'm not a big fan of Sarah Jessica Parker."
"__COMEDY__ Me neither, but I really liked that Bradley Cooper was in it."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, I forgot he was! He is also a cutie."
"__COMEDY__ Except I didn't like his character in the Hangover."
"__COMEDY__ Yea, that one he was kind of annoying in."
