"__MUSIC__ Hey girl, what's up?"
"__MUSIC__ Not much. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm just sitting here thinking about some of the greatest country artists of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Wow that is a tough one. There is so many to consider."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but I would have to say the top one would have to be George Jones."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he is good but I would not say that he is the top one of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Who would you go with?"
"__MUSIC__ No doubt it would be Kenny Rogers."
"__MUSIC__ No way. Just think about all the songs he did with Tammy Wynette."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah those songs with her are good but the ones he did by himself just do no compare to the ones by Kenny Rogers."
"__MUSIC__ What songs are you referring to by Kenny Rogers?"
"__MUSIC__ Lady, The Gambler, We've Got Tonight, and of course his version of I Will Always Love You."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'll give it to you those are some good songs but George Jones is at the top of that hill."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of his biggest hits?"
"__MUSIC__ White Lightning, She Thinks I Still Care, Why Baby Why, and and of course Hello Darlin."
"__MUSIC__ I must say that Hello Darlin is probably his greatest song but I still don't think that it tops Kenny Rogers' top song."
"__MUSIC__ I guess they both have their good and bad songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but I would still go with Kenny Rogers being the best."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to keep George Jones as my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ This is just one argument that will never get settled."
