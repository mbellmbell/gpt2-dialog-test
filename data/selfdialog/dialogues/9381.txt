"__BASEBALL__ I am not sure but have you seen the current trades going  on in the MLB they are insane."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah i doubt some of those trades are good."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you have doubts regarding those trades?"
"__BASEBALL__ The trades just seem one way and they are getting some shitty pitchers."
"__BASEBALL__ I think i disagree the pitcher the braves got is going to be a legend one of these days?"
"__BASEBALL__ Who is the pitcher you are talking about?"
"__BASEBALL__ One of the pitchers is Jim Johnson."
"__BASEBALL__ I do not think i have heard of him might be why i view them all as bad."
"__BASEBALL__ He is really good he is like a flying bullet and he will help the Braves win."
"__BASEBALL__ I am not really a fan of the braves i have never really watched them."
"__BASEBALL__ You should give them a chance and watch them they are a good team."
"__BASEBALL__ I might if i get time but they probally play during a game i want to watch."
"__BASEBALL__ Well you can record games with your DVR and you can watch it later."
"__BASEBALL__ That sounds pretty easy do you know when their next game is?"
"__BASEBALL__ Their next game is on Monday night not to far off."
"__BASEBALL__ That is a day i would be busy then  so i will have to record their game."
"__BASEBALL__ I promise you will not regret it the whole team is amazing. Their batters can hit anything."
"__BASEBALL__ We will see i am not so sure about that. But I want to look into the current trades though as i want to follow them you plan to follow?"
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely i want to get all the info on the newcomers and who is going around."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that is true it is best to keep up to date with all that."
