"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ He invented the iPhone and the Mac and the iPod."
"__MOVIES__ No, you're nuts. He's more like a designer than an engineer."
"__MOVIES__ Who cares, he and some guy started a billion dollar business in their garage."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you care?"
"__MOVIES__ I want to start my own business and be rich like Jobs."
"__MOVIES__ You watched the whole movie yet you know nothing about him."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I do, he like meditated with monks and fought with IBM and Microisoft and he created Pixar."
"__MOVIES__ He didn't create Pixar, he bought it."
"__MOVIES__ that's what I love about him, all the other guys do the work while he yells at them."
"__MOVIES__ That's what you learned from his movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you hook up with smart guys and let them do the work."
"__MOVIES__ The way you let your lab partner do all the work in science class?"
"__MOVIES__ See, I'm already getting smarter."
"__MOVIES__ The difference between you and Steve Jobs is that he was good at something."
"__MOVIES__ See you later, I'm going to watch that documenary again."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
