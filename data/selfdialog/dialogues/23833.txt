"__SUPERHERO__ My favorite superhero in the Avengers movie is the Hulk."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh me too! I love what's his face . . ."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ruffalo, Mark Ruffalo"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes! Ruffalo! He's so much better than Edward Norton was, in The Incredible Hulk."
"__SUPERHERO__ Although, Norton wasn't too horrible."
"__SUPERHERO__ No, he wasn't. But Ruffalo brings more deep feeling to the part."
"__SUPERHERO__ And - this is probably silly - but he looks more likely to turn into the Hulk."
"__SUPERHERO__ Not as slim as Norton?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Exactly. In some ways, he's more like Eric Bana in Hulk."
"__SUPERHERO__ When was that made? 2003?"
