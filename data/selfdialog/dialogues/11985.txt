"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All I know is that I am expecting a great year for football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, there should be lots of excitement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Lots of teams could really make some noise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, what do you think about the Steelers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really have a team, but they can't seem to get over the hump."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well they always get so far, but never far enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it seems like they stop short every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they do, but the definitely have some playmakers. They should win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, as long as those playmakers can actually stay on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Bell sure has a hard time doing that it seems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they have a strong passing game though and they are really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Big Ben has always been a talent when he is on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, when he is on the field is an accurate statement. He has to prove that he can be more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well he takes a lot of hits."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they have to do a better job of protecting him. Thats for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! Thats something that they have been unable to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they have. Its tough to win without protecting the quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well if they can start to do that, they can win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that is really important."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but they still may not be better than the Patriots."
