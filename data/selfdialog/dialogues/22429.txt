"__DISNEY__ I have a question about Peter Pan the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Go for it."
"__DISNEY__ What is the physics behind pixie dust?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean how does it work?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, like how does a physical material give one weightlessness in order to fly?"
"__DISNEY__ Bro, you're asking the wrong person here. I failed physics."
"__DISNEY__ And Tinker Bell. That pixie dust just keeps coming off of her forever!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, so what?"
"__DISNEY__ It never runs out! How is that possible?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's time we watch that movie again and find out."
