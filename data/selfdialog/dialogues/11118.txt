"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear the Saints signed Adrian Peterson this morning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude yes!! Like holy cow, I would have never expected AP to be Saint."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's insane. From the looks of it he seems like he is very healthy rite now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know and the Saints aquired him for cheap too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much was his contract for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a 2 year $7 millon dollar deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did the Saints give him a signing bonus too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. AP is going to get a $2.5 millon signing bonus."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Saints actually made a decent deal for once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I literally was thinking the same thing when the news broke!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like Mark Ingram is going to have stiff competiton this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not entirely sure what role Adrian Peterson is going to have in the backfield, the Saints are already stacked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I'm guessing Sean Payton is going to use AP in a smiliar role to like what Darren Sproles was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Our offense is going to be unstoppable if that's the case."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Reminds me a lot of the 2009 Saints team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah I wouldn't go that far, we still don't have a defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but a very good offense like ours can pick up the slack left by defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess. But turnovers are always a huge problem for us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I feel like we could have won way more games last season if it wasn't for turnovers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My point exactly. You can't win games like if you're turning over the ball like we did."
