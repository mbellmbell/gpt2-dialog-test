"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga's music completely illustrates the sad state of American pop music today."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Why's that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you ever heard of Stefani Germanotta?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No.  Who's that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's Lady Gaga's real name."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, she studied music academically in New York and was working professionally as a pianist and singer before she was even old enough to drive."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wow."
"__LADY_GAGA__ But, being talented wasn't good enough for her to become a famous singer.  She had to put on meat dresses and masks and sing like a robot for anyone to take her seriously."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You're right.  American pop music is pretty sad."
