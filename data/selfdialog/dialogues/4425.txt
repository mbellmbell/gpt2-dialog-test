"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Katy Perry?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't care much for her early works."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Its just too bubble gum , You know lots of color and sweetness that gets old quick."
"__MUSIC__ hahaha good one, never heard it described like that."
"__MUSIC__ I do like some of her work, however."
"__MUSIC__ What are your favorite songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like 'Wide Awake'. She wrote it after she and husband Russell Brandt broke up."
"__MUSIC__ I heard he had cheated on her."
"__MUSIC__ He did, he was dianoised with a sex addiction shortly after they married."
"__MUSIC__ That explains the video for that song then."
"__MUSIC__ I thought so. She had lost her innocence of childhood and the believe in fairy tales after her prince destoryed her."
"__MUSIC__ Ok I wondered how the monster in the mirror played in, she had to face the darkness inside herself, but face it with the bravery of a child that had to tell the boogie man to go away!"
"__MUSIC__ That is how i  took it."
"__MUSIC__ I like her song 'Roar' , have you heard it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, its ok, a lil too pro feminist for me."
"__MUSIC__ I dont understand..."
"__MUSIC__ For me, the song was again too cartoonish, both in lyric and video, for the message it wanted to send."
"__MUSIC__ I think she does that because her audience is typically younger."
"__MUSIC__ I get that, but the whole candy/ acid trip theme is creepy to me."
