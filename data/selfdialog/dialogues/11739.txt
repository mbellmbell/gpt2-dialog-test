"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football!!!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the season can't get here soon enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear ya, I wish my Detroit Lions had a chance but you know how they are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a rough one man, they always suck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup I know, once in my lifetime it would be cool to see them win it all, but I'm not holding my breath."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well my Packers are looking good this year, we got a shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah their pretty good every year, I don't know how those fans sit outside in that frozen tundra."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough, but we love it! Who do you think will win it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard not to say the Patriots, they are like a machine and I think Brady and Belichick want one more before they retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I hear ya, but I don't think they repeat. I think Seattle or Green Bay win it all this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being a Michigan man, I would like to see Brady get one more and retire"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys might also make some noise this year, They looked good last year, and this year should be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Romo was pissed when Prescott took over, but he is a better QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ezekiel Elliott is a real good back also. They are pretty solid overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You doing any fantasy this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm on Fanduel, so good to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright side bet with my Lions and your Packers. Case of beer for whoever wins our head to heads, no points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're on, get ready to send me some of that good Founder's beer buddy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lol. yeah good luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go pack!!!!!"
