"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you get around to listening to the Lady Gaga album that came out last year?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ You know I haven't really listened to her since the 'Bad Romance' days."
"__LADY_GAGA__ The new CD is definitely worth a listen! She's got a powerhouse of a voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Are there any standout tracks?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ There's a beautiful ballad type song, 'Million Reasons.' But I do admit it's not quite up to the level of her older music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ How do you think she's maturing as an artist?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's more restrained now, I think. Maybe a little less flashy? The huskiness of her voice comes through more now."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her earlier music added a lot of distractions to her voice. I think I'd like this style more."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think so, too! Also check out the track, 'A-YO.' That's a fun dancing song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Could always use a good song to wake up to in the morning!"
