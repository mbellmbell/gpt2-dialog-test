"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the movie, 'Interstellar'?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it last year, on the big screen. I went alone, because my husband wasn't into it., and I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in that? I remember a leading man..."
"__MOVIES__ That was Matthew McConaughey. At the time, he was the number one leading man in movies."
"__MOVIES__ At the time? What does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well ever since he won an Oscar, and said that 'he was his own hero,' people have thought him a little crazy."
"__MOVIES__ But he still got a leading man role - how was he in 'Interstellar'?"
"__MOVIES__ He was fabulous. He had some very demanding moments, like having to cry on camera, and performing as a sort of 'stunt pilot astronaut'."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, leading men aside, how was the movie itself?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really thought-provoking, especially about black holes, and time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it was serious science fiction?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it did it with a feeling of realism that I haven't seen in a long time. Not since '2001', by Kubrick."
"__MOVIES__ But what about the other actors? I heard Matt Damon was in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was pretty good as a bad guy, but the whole 'fight out on another planet' was hokey."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Anne Hathaway in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she was...the love interest."
"__MOVIES__ You said that with some disgust!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I found her character's innocence, love and destiny theories, and general attitude to be pretty contrite and false."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, gosh, it sounds like she ruined the movie for you."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all. She just 'interrupted' the flow of sci-fi. I can handle that."
