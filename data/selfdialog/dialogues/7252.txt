"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you heard Lady Gaga's latest album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, I kind of tuned out after 'Born This Way'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Some of the new stuff is pretty good, particularly 'Million Reasons'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That sounds familiar - I might have heard that one before."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga sang it at the Super Bowl, and it did pretty good on the charts after that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's right, I remember seeing that performance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That said, I'm still waiting for the dance-oriented, 'weirdo' version of Gaga to return."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's been several years since 'Just Dance', 'Paparazzi', and 'Bad Romance'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know, and since then she's dueted with Tony Bennett and has become almost too 'normal'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree, I think her songwriting is strong enough to stand on its own but I gravitate more to songs that aren't really straightforward."
