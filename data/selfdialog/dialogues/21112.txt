"__THRILLER__ Have you seen any new thriller movies lately?"
"__THRILLER__ I have! I saw 47 Meters Down."
"__THRILLER__ What did you think?"
"__THRILLER__ It was very interesting.  But I will say that it didn't make me jump off my seat."
"__THRILLER__ Typical shark movie?"
"__THRILLER__ Just a little bit! Mandy Moore did great but the story line was just a little off."
"__THRILLER__ What makes you say that?"
"__THRILLER__ For once, who would want to go to shark-infested waters when you're on vacation? I could be sipping on martinis on the beach all day."
"__THRILLER__ I'm on your boat all the way."
"__THRILLER__ I don't know, I just didn't really like it."
