"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to much of Michael Jackson's music?"
"__MUSIC__ Quite a bit.    Which era are you interested in?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, lets start with the later, more popular material."
"__MUSIC__ OK.     His biggest album was probably Thriller."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard that album.    How many copies did it sell?"
"__MUSIC__ The number I've seen is nearly 100 million, but that may be an overstatement."
"__MUSIC__ 100 million?     How is that possible?"
"__MUSIC__ CDs and records used to sell a lot more copies than they do these days."
"__MUSIC__ Really?     I saw that all it takes is 100000 copies to be a hit these days."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that is true, particularly since streaming has taken over the industry."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.     What else should I know about Michael Jackson?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he and his brothers sang together as the Jackson 5."
"__MUSIC__ Really?       Which one was he?     I've seen clips on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ He was the youngest - the kid who was out in front."
"__MUSIC__ Amazing.    Which is that real popular song from them?"
"__MUSIC__ You are probably thinking of A-B-C."
"__MUSIC__ That is right.       I also saw some movie he was in, do you know it?"
"__MUSIC__ He was in a couple of movies.      You are probably thinking of the Wiz."
"__MUSIC__ That is the one.     An African American version of the Wizard of Oz."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely!    All singing and all dancing!"
