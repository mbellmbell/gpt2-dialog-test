"__ACTION__ Which of the Expendables movies was your favorite?"
"__ACTION__ Oh man, I really like them. I love that throwback style."
"__ACTION__ I'm partial to the second."
"__ACTION__ Me too, it had so many giddy catchphrase moments."
"__ACTION__ What about the third?"
"__ACTION__ It seemed a bit unnecessary."
"__ACTION__ Wait, which was the one with Stone Cold Steve Austin?"
"__ACTION__ That's the original."
"__ACTION__ Ahh, thanks, it's been a while."
"__ACTION__ Not sure why they had him as being the big bodyguard. All things considered, he's not THAT big."
