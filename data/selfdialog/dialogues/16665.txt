"__MOVIES__ Hey. Do you like prison movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Prison movies? You mean true crime stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ No. I mean a drama.  Like what you would see in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ I'm a huge action fan."
"__MOVIES__ I think you'd like an older film by the name of The Shawshank Redemption."
"__MOVIES__ I dunno.  That doesn't sound very appealing to me."
"__MOVIES__ It was nominated for a boat load of Oscars in 1994."
"__MOVIES__ What?  Get out of here. No way."
"__MOVIES__ It actually lost out best picture to Forrest Gump."
"__MOVIES__ Forrest Gump. I remember that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  They came out the same year."
"__MOVIES__ Funny.  I don't remember this Shawshank movie."
"__MOVIES__ There are a lot of others like you who didn't either.  Do you like Stephen King?"
"__MOVIES__ I love Stephen King.  His books are my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ The Shawshank Redemption is based on one of his novellas."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked most of his movies."
"__MOVIES__ Shawshank only got more and more popular years later."
"__MOVIES__ It must have been like a cult movie or something."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you could say that."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out some time."
