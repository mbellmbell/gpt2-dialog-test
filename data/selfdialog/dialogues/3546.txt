"__MUSIC__ So have you chosen a song for your wedding dance yet?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I'm still undecided. I was thinking 'Chasing Cars' by Snow Patrol, but I don't think that will work."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Because my fiancé hates it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, probably not the best choice then. What about Ed Sheeran?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. I mean, I really like his voice, but I'm not that familiar with his stuff."
"__MUSIC__ He's got a great song called 'Thinking out Loud'. It's about staying in love as you grow old together."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds perfect!"
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of 'Perfect', that's the title of a song from his latest album. That one might work, too."
"__MUSIC__ Is it a romantic love song? Because that's what I'm looking for."
"__MUSIC__ It's very romantic."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check both of those out."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, didn't you say you were into R&B and hip-hop?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, especially Beyoncé and Rihanna."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you use one of their songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Which one are you thinking?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Stay' by Rihanna?"
"__MUSIC__ I like that one. It's a little too sad, though."
"__MUSIC__ True. How about 'Halo' by Beyoncé then?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's perfect!"
