"__THRILLER__ Hey look, When A Stranger Calls is coming on tonight."
"__THRILLER__ Which one?"
"__THRILLER__ There's more than one?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah! There was that old one from the 1979 and then there was a sequel and then they remade it in 2006."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I didn't know that. It looks like the newer one is on."
"__THRILLER__ Okay. I didn't think it was as good as the original personally but it has its own merit."
"__THRILLER__ I've seen this one before and thought it was pretty good, suspenseful and scary without too many jump scares."
"__THRILLER__ Me too, I think it has sufficient build up and the music was a good choice for it."
"__THRILLER__ But it doesn't beat the original for you?"
"__THRILLER__ It really can't compare to the original, though I like them both just the same."
