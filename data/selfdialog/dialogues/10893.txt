"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Oakland Raiders moving to Las Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it sucks, and that type of move is a huge reason why I'm largely turned off to the sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the NFL really thumbs its nose at its fan base when it uproots a team from a devoted community like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the San Francisco 49ers are also in the Bay Area, no?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but fans typically pick a favorite - Cubs vs. White Sox, Yankees vs. Mets, and 49ers vs. Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But don't you think Las Vegas is a big enough market to support a team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so, because Las Vegas' population at any given time is made up largely of tourists."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, wouldn't tourists come out to watch a football game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, because they are not loyal followers of the home team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you heard whether the Raiders will substantially change their uniform following the move?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't heard, but I would expect so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder what stadium they will play in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My guess it will be a new stadium built with taxpayer dollars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that sounds like a total racket."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It certainly does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is almost as if any city willing to tax their residents to pay for a stadium can poach an NFL team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it does, and just goes to demonstrate that the NFL is really a corporate business, not fun and sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This isn't the first time the Raiders has moved is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so, but I don't recall all of the history off the top of my head."
