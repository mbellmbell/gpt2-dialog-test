"__MOVIES__ Is there a specific movie that you never get tired of watching?"
"__MOVIES__ When I was a kid, we used to watch the Three Amigos over and over. We thought it was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ That was pretty funny, something to watch after a scary movie to help you fall asleep."
"__MOVIES__ I remember watching it after sitting through An American Werewolf in London.  Without something like Three Amigos to watch, I never would have fallen asleep."
"__MOVIES__ After watching A Nightmare on Elm Street, I remember watching The Breakfast Club to help me fall asleep."
"__MOVIES__ I saw The Breakfast Club just recently. It had a group of actors who were part of a group called The Brat Pack."
"__MOVIES__ I remember them, young actors at the time.  Some of them, like Demi Moore hit it big in the entertainment business."
"__MOVIES__ I think I can remember them all; Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy."
"__MOVIES__ They made some good movies. The one that sticks out the most to me is St. Elmo's fire."
"__MOVIES__ St. Elmo's fire was directed by Joel Schumacher. He's the guy that directed Flatliners."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard there's another Flatliners coming out in the near future, going to star Nina Dobrev and Ellen Page."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if it will be as good as the original. Seeing a lot of remakes lately that aren't very good."
"__MOVIES__ Just saw the remake of Red Dawn, definitely prefer the original."
"__MOVIES__ The original Red Dawn, with Patrick Swayze, that's a classic."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite Patrick Swayze movie is Roadhouse. I've heard rumors there is a remake in the works."
"__MOVIES__ Every time I hear about Roadhouse, it makes me think of Sam Elliott. He is starring in a series now called The Ranch. I hope he has a chance to make some more good movies."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite Sam Elliott movie is The Shadow Riders. Did you know that Sam Elliott married his costar in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Her name is Katharine Ross. Haven't seen her in much recently, she starred opposite Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate."
"__MOVIES__ I first remember seeing her in Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid. I wonder if she kept in touch with her costars in that movie, Paul Newman and Robert Redford."
"__MOVIES__ Paul Newman was one of my favorite actors of all time. I've heard they're going to use his voice in the upcoming Cars 3."
