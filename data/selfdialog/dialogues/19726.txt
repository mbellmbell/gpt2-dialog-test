"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favorite Rocky movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the second one the most."
"__MOVIES__ Really, why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's shot very similar to the first one and he actually wins in the end."
"__MOVIES__ The opening scene of Rocky II is sorta gory."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know. They are both laid out in the hospital beaten practically to death."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember Apollo saying there ain't gonna be a rematch in the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was in the 15th round. Rocky says I don't want one."
"__MOVIES__ I don't blame him for not wanting one."
"__MOVIES__ I don't either but both dudes changed their minds."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite character in the Rocky movies was Paulie."
"__MOVIES__ I liked him too. He was some working class stiff that liked to drink."
"__MOVIES__ He really liked to drink and he ran his mouth off all the time."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, but he was funny sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ It's cool how before every fight Paulie and Rocky are cracking jokes."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, it's very realistic. That's probably the best way to deal with nervous tension."
"__MOVIES__ Which fight was the best?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. They were all good."
"__MOVIES__ The second match versus Clubber was the shortest."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, if Rocky didn't dispatch him quick then he would have been 'dead meat sucka.'"
