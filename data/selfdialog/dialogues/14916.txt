"__ACTION__ Do you like the Alien movie franchise?"
"__ACTION__ I love the Alien movies. Ridley Scott is a genius."
"__ACTION__ I agree with that, and Sigourney Weaver is great as Ripley."
"__ACTION__ Those to me are some of the scariest movies of all time."
"__ACTION__ No arguments there. I had no idea Prometheus was a prequel for the Alien movies."
"__ACTION__ It was? I've never even seen Prometheus."
"__ACTION__ Oh you've gotta see it, it's a great movie. Let's you know what happened before the original Alien."
"__ACTION__ Wow I've got to make it a point to see that one. Have you seen Alien Covenant?"
"__ACTION__ The brand new one? Not yet but I heard it wasn't that great."
"__ACTION__ I don't like taking others' opinions for movies but I think I'll give it a try."
