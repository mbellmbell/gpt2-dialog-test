"__DISNEY__ Have you seen all the Toy Story movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I have, but I don't remember the most recent ones as well."
"__DISNEY__ I've been rewatching them with my neices and nephews. They're entranced."
"__DISNEY__ I remember being like that when it first came out. I used to love Jessie, but what was Woody's horse named?"
"__DISNEY__ Bullseye. I remember being like that too! And being afraid of Sid. I don't remember the more recent ones as well."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe we've just gotten too old."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think so, Andy's grown up with us, and I love that it's something I can share with the younger generations."
"__DISNEY__ I do still love the first few movies. Maybe I'll give the more recent one's another shot."
"__DISNEY__ Let's watch them together! Have a marathon."
"__DISNEY__ I'm in."
