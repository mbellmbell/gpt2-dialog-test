"__MUSIC__ Are you a Beatles fan?"
"__MUSIC__ I was a huge fan in the 60s, and I listened to their albums over and over, memorizing every word."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see them in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No--my mom and sister went to see them, but by them I was into Bob Dylan."
"__MUSIC__ Really? You switched from the Beatles to Dylan?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I had a boyfriend who thought Bob Dylan was amazing, so I kinda did it for that reason, but I do think Dylan is an amaing songwriter."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see Dylan in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I did, when I was 14. And after the concert I got the paper cup from the stage that he drank from. I was so excited!"
"__MUSIC__ Did you buy his records?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course--I had all of them. My parents, especially my mother, couldn't stand his voice and complained to me to keep the volume down."
"__MUSIC__ Why did your boyfriend like him so much?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was the lyrics...somehow they had special meaning to my boyfriend. He never talked about it, though."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know his real name?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, it's Rpbert Zimmerman. And I think he's from Hibbing, Minnesota."
"__MUSIC__ He acts kinda strange at times. I saw him on TV live and he looked like he was in a trance."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that, too. I attribute that to his distaste for fame and all the attention he got and still gets. I don't think he likes it."
"__MUSIC__ He's a true poet, there's no doubt."
"__MUSIC__ That and more. He spoke for a generation. Blowin' in the Wind is an incredible song."
"__MUSIC__ And my favorite is Positively 4th Street."
"__MUSIC__ I still remember the words to Maggie's Farm."
