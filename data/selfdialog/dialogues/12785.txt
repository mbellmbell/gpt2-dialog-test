"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite NFL running back of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are so many including Walter Payton and Eric Dickerson but I'd have to go with Barry Sanders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he played on such a lousy team and never made it to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's part of what makes him so great.  If Sanders had played behing a decent offensive line the sky would have been the limt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think made him so good.  He was all that big or fast compared to some others."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true but he had the ability to avoid tackles, which is why he never got seriously hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean.  I can recall Sanders making some moves that made very good linebackers look silly as they tried to tackle him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus he had a low center of gravity with enormous thighs that made him hard to bring down if you could catch him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's such a shame that he left the Lions the way that he did.  Really left a bad taste with the fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I could kind of see his point.  He looked around and saw the Lions going noplace and still was healthy so figured he'd get out on top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he could have broken more records had he stayed just another year or two like Emmett Smith's record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was another thing about Barry that I admired.  He did not have a big ego and personal records didn't matter to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  I remember whenever he scored a touchdown - and he scored plenty - he would just casually flip the ball to the ref."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah - no dancing or showing off from him at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He figured when he scored a touchdown he was just doing his job, which is refreshing compared to some of the show-offs today."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was widely respected by the defensive players in the league who went up against him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's for sure.  Trying to tackle him was like trying to catch lightning in a bottle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember during his first season during an exhibition game against the New York Giants, their great linebacker Harry Carson predicted that 'No. 20 is going to be a great back.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Carson was a veteran and all-star linebacker who knew what he was talking about when it came to running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right. He knew a lot more than any sportswriter or coach or fan because he was out there on the field making the tackles."
