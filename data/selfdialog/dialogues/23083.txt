"__DISNEY__ What did you think of Zootopia?"
"__DISNEY__ I really liked it! It seemed different from a lot of Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ It was a change to have a modern story rather than something fairy-tale."
"__DISNEY__ Well, all the characters are animals, so it's not super-realistic."
"__DISNEY__ No, but it seemed like it was about modern life."
"__DISNEY__ I really liked Judy's determination to become a police officer even though people doubted her."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and it was fun watching her deal with criminals even though she's a little bunny."
"__DISNEY__ And the animation was spectacular."
"__DISNEY__ I know, the city looks so wild, with all the different areas for different animals!"
"__DISNEY__ I'd love to see Disney do something else in this style. Maybe we'll get a sequel?"
