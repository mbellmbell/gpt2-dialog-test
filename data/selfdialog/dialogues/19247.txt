"__MOVIES__ Want to hear something crazy?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure."
"__MOVIES__ My wife has never seen the Goonies!"
"__MOVIES__ What! That's unacceptable."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I said!"
"__MOVIES__ What kind of person has never seen the Goonies?"
"__MOVIES__ Right?! She also hasn't seen Top Gun!"
"__MOVIES__ The single greatest movie of our lifetime and she hasn't seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope.  Looks like we're going to be binge watching some classics this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Top Gun is so good, how has she never watched it?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, she was more into other movies I guess, or TV shows."
"__MOVIES__ Still. Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer killed it in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I think it may be Tom Cruise's best movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to have to agree with you on that, but Mission Impossible is a close second."
"__MOVIES__ Can't argue with that, Jerry Maguire has to be third then."
"__MOVIES__ I liked Jerry Maguire, but I'm going to go with Risky Business for number 3."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot all about that movie!  I'm adding it to the list, the wife probably hasn't seen that either."
"__MOVIES__ Did you want to get together one of these weekends and binge watch some Tom Cruise?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm down."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, let me know when you can do it."
