"__MOVIES__ Hey what's your favorite scary movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it's not that one."
"__MOVIES__ What's wrong with Scream?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing it's just not my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Ok mister kill joy, what's yours then."
"__MOVIES__ No one does it better than Kruger."
"__MOVIES__ Oh please, Freddy four knives is your go to, how about one this millennium?"
"__MOVIES__ The nightmare is ever lasting, and by the way they had a remake in this millennium."
"__MOVIES__ Remakes don't count for favorites, completely discredits the spirit."
"__MOVIES__ Good point, but Dream killer beats psycho 'Teenager.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but everyone knew who Freddy was in every movie, Scream gave plot twists in all 4 changing the origins with each."
"__MOVIES__ Look if you're throwing out my remake, then you don't get to count the 4th Scream."
"__MOVIES__ Why shouldn't I include it? It's a continuation not a re-imagination."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't saying that on grounds of semantics, but on merit of film."
"__MOVIES__ The last scream totally holds up to the trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ Firstly, Randy would disagree with you on that one, and character veto is final veto."
"__MOVIES__ That is really low, anyway what's second."
"__MOVIES__ Second is that the killer was found out, not killed, it was a nice conversation in the kitchen then oh yeah by the way I'm getting arrested now."
"__MOVIES__ It kept the same dynamic alive as the first one, tribute negates cliche."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but bad doesn't negate bad. It's out of the running."
