"__HARRY_POTTER__ Where did all the food come from at the banquets?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it was just magic."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, wait, I remember.  House elves cook it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No they don't.  I remember Dumbledore just waving his wand and it appearing."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, no, see, the elves made it, Dumbledore just made it visible."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That doesn't make any sense.  The elves could just bring it up."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But maybe it was easier to just use magic to bring it up vs. the elves doing it physically."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They're house elves, they're used to hard work."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ One thing's for sure, I would eat a ton at one of those."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too!"
