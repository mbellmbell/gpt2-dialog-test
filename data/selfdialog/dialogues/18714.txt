"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure yet. I'm kinda burnt out on super hero movies."
"__MOVIES__ But this one has really good reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? Where did you see that?"
"__MOVIES__ On Rotten Tomatoes. It's currently rated at 95%."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! That is surprising. I know the last few DC movies haven't been great."
"__MOVIES__ Sadly, that's true. I'm a big DC fan, but Marvel has been killing it in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ The Marvel movies are pretty great."
"__MOVIES__ Warner Brothers just promoted Geoff Johns, one of DC's best writers to the head of DC's film division."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. How do you think that will go?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the results are already showing. Wonder Woman seems to be much higher quality than the last two movies."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Suicide Squad. It was amusing, but pretty average."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I still think it was better than the critics said, though."
"__MOVIES__ How did you feel about Batman Vs. Superman?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much how I felt about Suicide Squad. It was not great, but way better than the critics indicated."
"__MOVIES__ That's fair. I wonder if the critics were a little biased, comparing it to Marvel movies in their mind."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's only natural to do that, since Marvel has done such a great job, but I feel that each movie should be reviewed on it's own merits."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Not everything should be a competition."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm going to see Wonder Woman tonight at 8pm, if you want to go."
"__MOVIES__ I'll check my schedule and let you know."
