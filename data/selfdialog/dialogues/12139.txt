"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you feel that the NFL is still the best pro sport out there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is no doubt about it in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How long have you been watching the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have probably been watching for nearly fifty years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is about how long my dad has been watching as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have had the opportunity to watch some great football in my day, that is for certain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My dad and me always argue about the best NFL defense of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You guys sound like me and my two sons now. Who do you think had the best defense ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that the 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the best defense of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were really good, but I have to disagree with you on that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think had the best defense of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be the 1976 Pittsburgh Steelers. Hands down!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was that the Steel Curtain defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure was! I have still never seen a defense like that in my life."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is who my dad says was the best defense ever!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He must be a smart man! At one point that season, they went twenty two straight quarters without giving up a touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is actually a pretty amazing stat. That Buccaneers team was loaded with talent though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Trust me, they would not even touch that 76' Steeler defense!.It was amazing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Tom Brady could put up some points against them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not even if he had Jerry Rice and Randy Moss to throw to!"
