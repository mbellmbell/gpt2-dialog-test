"__DISNEY__ What was the last Disney movie you've seen."
"__DISNEY__ Huh, well I saw that live action Beauty and the Beast movie the other day."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah! With Emma Watson, how was it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well I've never seen the animated film, but I really enjoyed it. And it was so star studded."
"__DISNEY__ Who's in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well for one, Ian McKellen. Also Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor, and Emma Thompson."
"__DISNEY__ Woah, that's a lot of the great british actors, and obviously Emma Watson to boot! I gotta see it!"
"__DISNEY__ I really would, and also Josh Gad is always a plus in any movie."
"__DISNEY__ You're so right, Frozen would have been unbearable without Count Olaf!"
"__DISNEY__ Hahahaha wrong series my friend! He was just Olaf the snowman."
