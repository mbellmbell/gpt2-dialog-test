"__MUSIC__ No there is no revenue to make them"
"__MUSIC__ Youtube charges for ads"
"__MUSIC__ Right and they get it, the artist does not release it to YouTube"
"__MUSIC__ Why doesnt an artist prevent the video from getting to YouTube unless they get a cut of the ad revenue?"
"__MUSIC__ I think thats a model that more musicians may take."
"__MUSIC__ What about the artists that can afford to be like that."
"__MUSIC__ They have to adapt just like everyone else."
"__MUSIC__ But why do you think they dont do huge videos anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ There really is no reason to do them like that."
"__MUSIC__ I dont think you are wrong I just dont think you are right either."
"__MUSIC__ Sure it is, people dont watch MTV anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but the artists werent getting money from them either."
"__MUSIC__ I still think a YouTube video shouldnt be a mini movie."
"__MUSIC__ YouTube or MTV, the mediums are essentially the same."
"__MUSIC__ Except alot of musicians arent featured on MTV but can be YouTube stars."

"__MUSIC__ As long as they are talked about."
"__MUSIC__ I think its a poor attitude"
"__MUSIC__ Its the direction of the industry"
