"__MOVIES__ If you had to pick a movie that you did not mind watching again and again what would that be?"
"__MOVIES__ That's an interesting question because I don't really like to rewatch movies too often."
"__MOVIES__ I do on occasion, depends on the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I would have to agree with you there."
"__MOVIES__ So what do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to have to say 'Get Out.'"
"__MOVIES__ That was such a crazy movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I watched it with my husband and then with family."
"__MOVIES__ Were you confused at all?"
"__MOVIES__ A little bit the first time I watched it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too but it didn't take too long to catch on."
"__MOVIES__ I really thought that the girlfriend was not in on it."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't either! I thought her family forced her to be apart of their scheme."
"__MOVIES__ The grandma and grandpa threw me for a loop towards the end."
"__MOVIES__ I know that was really crazy!"
"__MOVIES__ He shouldn't have stopped the car."
"__MOVIES__ No way. He could have escaped a lot easier."
"__MOVIES__ Thankfully his friend came to help him."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I was afraid it was the cops."
"__MOVIES__ I was relieved it wasn't."
