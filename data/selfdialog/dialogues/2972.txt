"__MUSIC__ Let's do a random music discussion."
"__MUSIC__ How's that work?"
"__MUSIC__ Open your iTunes to your general library."
"__MUSIC__ Got it."
"__MUSIC__ Now, scroll up and down a bunch of times with your eyes closed. Then, select a song and tell me what it is."
"__MUSIC__ I got 'Courante' by Jim Self."
"__MUSIC__ Umm, what is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a movement for tuba solo."
"__MUSIC__ Can you go again?"
"__MUSIC__ No, this was your thing. Now, discuss."
"__MUSIC__ Okay.. what is a courante?"
"__MUSIC__ A courante is one of the many movements of a standard Baroque dance suite."
"__MUSIC__ What are the other movements?"
"__MUSIC__ Courante, Sarabande, Jig, Bour√©e, air, gavotte, allemande. Sarabande is the most well-known."
"__MUSIC__ So what are the musical characteristics of a Courante? What will I hear if I listen to this?"
"__MUSIC__ It's in triple meter, and is very stately and serious."
"__MUSIC__ Triple meter?"
"__MUSIC__ That just means three beats, like in 'America the Beautiful'"
"__MUSIC__ And how is it serious?"
"__MUSIC__ There's a big rhythmic emphasis on all of the beats per measure, with some ornamentation between the downbeats. So there's always a grounding."
