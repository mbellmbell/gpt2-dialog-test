"__DISNEY__ You know how they made a live action version of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, what about it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I was thinking that since they've already made a live adaption for Cinderella as well, why not also make one for Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I would love to see that."
"__DISNEY__ This would be a great opportunity to cast some lesser known but equally talented Asian actors and actresses."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think that all of the casting members should be able to sing? I mean, the live version could turn into another musical."
"__DISNEY__ Honestly, I'd prefer it if the producers could change up the story a bit and add a some twist to it. Like they could focus more on recreating the characters and story instead of trying to replicate the Disney version."
"__DISNEY__ I can see that. People might compare it to the original."
"__DISNEY__ It's not just that. If people wanted to see an exact replica of it, they'd go see the Disney version."
"__DISNEY__ True."
