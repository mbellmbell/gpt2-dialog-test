"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite song from Sgt. Pepper?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm not really familiar with that album. What's its most popular song?"
"__BEATLES__ Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah! I know that one. Elton John did a good cover a that song."
"__BEATLES__ Well I prefer the original version better, but Elton's version is pretty good too."
"__BEATLES__ I heard that the album was re-released recently."
"__BEATLES__ Yes. It's a 2 CD version of the album; one of the CDs has alternate versions of the songs."
"__BEATLES__ Are you going to buy it?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm not sure; I'd like to listen to a few of the alternate takes first and then decide whether to buy it or not."
"__BEATLES__ That's a good idea, because the CDs are probably over twenty dollars."
