"__MUSIC__ I don't like the new Linkin Park single."
"__MUSIC__ Which one is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Heavy. It's a duet with Kiiara. But I think it sounds too poppy."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard of it. What makes you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Linkin Park is traditionally a rock band with hip hop influences. This is a bit away from their normal work."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. It may be just that they are trying to keep up and stay relevant with other artists."
"__MUSIC__ It has a lot of melody in the song. No screaming. No cursing. No crunchy guitar riffs."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, but does it really need all those?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, maybe not."
"__MUSIC__ Have you given the single a listen and just actually listened to it without bias?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I guess I haven't."
"__MUSIC__ It's perfectly alright to be a fan of an artist and not like a direction they take."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you're right."
"__MUSIC__ But don't let others' opinions of the music change your opinion before you give a real chance."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. I'm going to listen to it again right now."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't we listen together?"
"__MUSIC__ Alright. You know I do kind of like this. It's melodic and sad."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Linkin Park has a tendency to go the angry side of things but this is a nice change."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I think I'm going to buy the new album and give all the new tracks a chance."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good. I think I'll do the same."
