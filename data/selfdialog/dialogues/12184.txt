"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like the Panthers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No not really. They aren't a popular team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean, they are probably one of the worst teams of the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their stats for last year were sort of bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they lose about eight games last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh huh I think they only won about five"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that is - I mean is it the coaching or what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously the coaching and bad draft picks. The skills of the players have alot to do with it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are their draft picks this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They signed about eight new players. But best draft choices would have to be Moton and McCaffrey"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We have yet to see what they will do for the team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They may need to draft a new coach too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think Cam Newton gets the job done?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could do better !"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Really I mean eight losses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What strategies do you think he needs to employ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His players need to be much  stronger on the offensive"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Truly and reviewing tapings from last years games might help a little more"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just may."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The fault doesn't only lie with the coach though."
