"__MOVIES__ Do you like monster movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they're okay, but it's not my favorite genre.  How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I was always a huge fan.  Particularly kaiju movies."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like Godzilla?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  Anything with giant monsters is good to me."
"__MOVIES__ I did like 'Cloverfield.'"
"__MOVIES__ That was good.  And an interesting American take on the genre."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the American 'Godzilla' movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I like the Japanese ones better.  The Matthew Broderick one was a mess."
"__MOVIES__ The writing was really bad.  Dialogue didn't make sense."
"__MOVIES__ I think the Bryan Cranston one from a few years ago was better."
"__MOVIES__ That said, he only came out in the first 20 minutes or so."
"__MOVIES__ True.  They definitely marketed the movie to be Bryan Cranston vs. Godzilla, and they kill off his character immediately."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about King Kong?"
"__MOVIES__ The most recent one?  That was very entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it too.  Plus they're setting the stage for a monster cinematic universe."
"__MOVIES__ That could have potential to be huge, no pun intended."
"__MOVIES__ Is Pacific Rim in the same universe?"
"__MOVIES__ Not to my knowledge, though that's a spin-off I'd fully support."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  That was a cool movie."
