"__MOVIES__ Whats your favorite Tarantino movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I have just rewatched the hateful eight twice and am still finding new pieces i absolutely believe are a result of Tarantino genius."
"__MOVIES__ Inglourious Basterds. I think it's the height of both his dialogue and his characters."
"__MOVIES__ I'm in the midst of watching all the Tarantino movies and so far Basterds is my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ The action, suspense, and dialouge is flawless, but not quiet as quotable as Pulp Fiction."
"__MOVIES__ Not a very quotable movie. But it has some of the most tense scenes. It is top 2 with Reservoir Dogs for me."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, I loved Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino is great at suspense and tension which seems to be a motif in his movies."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Tense scenes and dialogue are probably his two calling cards."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen it at least four times, and the bar scene still gets my heart racing."
"__MOVIES__ My second favorite Tarantino movie is Jackie Brown."
"__MOVIES__ It's not the most innovative script."
"__MOVIES__ I keep singing that song in my head every since man."
"__MOVIES__ It's his film that's most like a film and not a series of interesting scenes."
"__MOVIES__ He should work from pulp novels more. It wasn't my favorite when I first saw it but it is now, it's aged well and It's probably Jackson's best performance too."
"__MOVIES__ I like Jackie Brown the best."
"__MOVIES__ I'm tired of all the thick layers of irony and alternate reality in his new movies and I wish he would do something simple like that again."
"__MOVIES__ It's his film that's most like a film, not a series of interesting scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Id love if he worked from pulp novels again it suits him and its aged very well."
"__MOVIES__ I so agree."
"__MOVIES__ I'd put Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction as equal top."
