"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Chris Cornell died?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I heard. I don't really know much about him or his music though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my God. How do you know know about Chris Cornell? He is only one of the best rock musicians of our generation."
"__MUSIC__ What was so great about him?"
"__MUSIC__ He was only one of the architects of the grunge movement. Maybe you remember that song from when we were younger called 'Blackhole Sun?'"
"__MUSIC__ That song was everywhere! That was him? I didn't know that. I love that song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was the band that he was in called Soundgarden. And do you remember the song 'Cochise?'"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the one with all the mechanical gear songs building to that awesome creshendo of heavy hitting rock? I love that beat. I really rocked out to that!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was him, too. The man was a genius."
"__MUSIC__ What group was that? Was that Soundgarden?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that was his more recent group, Audioslave."
"__MUSIC__ What other hits did they have?"
"__MUSIC__ That song 'Show me how to Live' was also theirs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I liked that one too."
"__MUSIC__ You know, he wasn't just in bands. He was also a pretty prolific solo artist. He recorded a theme for a James Bond movie called 'You Know my Name'"
"__MUSIC__ That was the theme of Casino Royale, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Good movie, even better soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I guess I like Cornell's music more than I thought. I'm going to have to go back and listen to some more of his stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I've been immersing myself in his music lately. It is so sad that there won't be any more hits from such a great artist. The man will always be a legend in the world of rock."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but at least we have such a large bank of his hits to enjoy. That powerhouse voice will live on forever."
