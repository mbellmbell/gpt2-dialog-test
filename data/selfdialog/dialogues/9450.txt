"__BASEBALL__ What's the funniest thing you've ever seen at a baseball game?"
"__BASEBALL__ I absolutely lose it when people go out of their way to get a foul ball or a home run, and suffer the consequences."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, when a ball lands in their awful beer or their food and it explodes, I laugh my butt off."
"__BASEBALL__ One thing I love to see never happens during the game, but something we learn about after the fact."
"__BASEBALL__ What's that?"
"__BASEBALL__ When they have the kiss cam on, and one person in a couple is caught cheating on their partner."
"__BASEBALL__ That's sick."
"__BASEBALL__ Why?"
"__BASEBALL__ You're enjoying people's personal affairs being ruined."
"__BASEBALL__ They deserved it. They went into public and cheated in an area where their faces are broadcast."
"__BASEBALL__ Anyway, have you ever caught a home run?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, sort of."
"__BASEBALL__ Sort of? How do you not know? Did you confuse it with ... how do you not get it?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was during batting practice at the Reds game. I went down during the last batter, and he hit it right at me."
"__BASEBALL__ You caught it?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and I reached over a little kid to get it, caught it in my hand with no glove, to impress my girlfriend."
"__BASEBALL__ You took a ball from a kid?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I caught the ball instead of the kid catching it."
"__BASEBALL__ Taking a home run from a child is pretty much the worst thing anyone can do at a baseball stadium"
"__BASEBALL__ No, not really. This kid will have another 80 years to catch a foul ball or home run. I have limited time. I don't care about that kid."
