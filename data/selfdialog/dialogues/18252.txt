"__MOVIES__ Do you like Vietnam war movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I love them! Do you have a favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Difficult to pick, but I guess 'Apocalypse Now'. You?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe 'Full Metal Jacket', for me. It is difficult, though."
"__MOVIES__ That's unusual - I know a lot of people don't care much for the second half of that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that too, but I love it. I'm a big Kubrick fan, though."
"__MOVIES__ You've seen 'Apocalypse Now', yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh of course, dozens of times. Incredible movie. Martin Sheen does an amazing job."
"__MOVIES__ That opening scene where he cuts his hand after punching the mirror is real."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know that!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he was actually drunk and the director just let him do whatever he wants and filmed it."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's why the emotion feels so raw - because it is."
"__MOVIES__ Marlon Brando is so scary in it too."
"__MOVIES__ I remember how little time he's actually in that movie, and yet he's so ominous."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, his presence just looms over the whole movie like a ghost."
"__MOVIES__ Which, correct me if I'm wrong, was the intention?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe so, yes. Martin Sheen's character is given the assignment right at the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ I still remember that creepy audio of Brandov when they give him the assignment?"
"__MOVIES__ About a snail crawling along a razorblade? Yes! Such a great script."
"__MOVIES__ Incredible script. So much of it became instantly quotable and iconic!"
