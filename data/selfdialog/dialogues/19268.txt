"__MOVIES__ You know what's on tonight? Check it out, 'Avatar'."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the one about the blue-skinned people with the tails? Who's in that again?"
"__MOVIES__ Uhm, Sigorney Weaver, Sam Worthington, and Zoe Saldana. You want to watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! I love the beginning of it, when Worthington learns about the forest. Those cool spinning plant-things are fun."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I like the ultraviolet feel of the plants, and those cool flying dragons they use are great!"
"__MOVIES__ Jarhead Clan, hah! It's funny that they like to incorporate the Marines, even out in space."
"__MOVIES__ Why were they trying get the planet again? Some kind of ore, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they had this need for the stuff for raw power, and that tree that the blue people lived in was right on top of a giant deposit of it."
"__MOVIES__ But the ore was really the life-stuff that came from the tree and the people and their connection with it, right?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I think so. what did you think about that telepathic stuff with the plants and animals?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it, especially when they took their tails and attached their nerve fibers to things. Sort of like when Spock from Star Trek did a mind-meld."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, only a little more physical. What er the people of the planet called?"
"__MOVIES__ The Na'vi. I wish I could be one of them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, to be able to have a tail like that and jump from tree to tree, and ride on dragons, that would be so cool!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you see that they started a park in Disneyland about 'Avatar'? it's named after the planet..."
"__MOVIES__ Pandora was the name of the planet. I'd love to go there, but I figure it's kind of for kids."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, they teach you the Na'vi language and stuff, and give you a little flying dragon to play with."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding? Those were called flying banshee. I'd love one of those to play with."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but you'd have to find the one that wants to kill you and master it before you could ride it!"
"__MOVIES__ Hum, that would be a little frustrating and dangerous, wouldn't it? Hah, let's just watch it, turn it on!"
