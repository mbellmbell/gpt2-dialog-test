"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone asks about favorite teams, but what I want to know is what is your most despised NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally, I really can't stand the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like that's a common response to that question.  Why don't you like them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like them because of their known history of cheating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they were cleared the last time something like that happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they were cleared.  Usually when someone receives a punishment it's because they did something wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good point.  I'm not much of a Tom Brady fan myself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's another reason I don't like the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of people like him, but something about him just makes me very suspicious of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed.  I do think Bill Belichick is one of the best coaches in the game right now though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though there's been accusations of play stealing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even with that I think he's one of the best coaches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Sean Payton?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone that offers a reward for injuries in a game like this should be banned from the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There have been a few incidents of obvious intent to injure in the last few seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there's a difference between losing control of emotion on the play field and offering players compensation for causing injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ever since that incident I've completely hated Sean Payton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you feel the same way about Drew Brees?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think he's a decent enough person and definitely a good enough player."
