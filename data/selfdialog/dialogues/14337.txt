"__HORROR__ What's your pick for most underrated horror film?"
"__HORROR__ That's really tough and there's a few I would consider, how about Nightmare On Elm Street 4?"
"__HORROR__ Not a bad choice at all, one of the stronger sequels."
"__HORROR__ Agreed fully it's not up to par with part 3, or New Nightmare, but feel it's the best aside from those two."
"__HORROR__ One things for sure, it tramples all over The Dream Child or Freddy's dead."
"__HORROR__ Yeah those two were pretty bad, as was part 2."
"__HORROR__ Part 2 would actually be among my most disappointing films. They had a such a classic character and they follow up the first film with that?"
"__HORROR__ Thankfully they recovered and came out with Dream Warriors next."
"__HORROR__ Great point, I do love that movie and it was a really nice touch when Nancy came back."
"__HORROR__ Yeah but at the end when Freddy killed her? Excruciating to watch."
