"__MOVIES__ Do you have any favorite actors?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd definitely say that Will Smith is up there."
"__MOVIES__ For me, too! What movie of his is your favorite."
"__MOVIES__ If it's not the Bad Boys series, it's definitely the Men in Black series."
"__MOVIES__ The Men in Black movies are always a fun watch."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! The dynamic between Smith's and Tommy Lee Jones' characters makes for some classic comedy bits."
"__MOVIES__ Same for Bad Boys, really."
"__MOVIES__ True. He and Martin Lawrence have such great chemistry in that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I can possibly get through Bad Boys II without at least cracking a smile, it's so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ He's got some other great movies out there, too. I'm personally a huge fan of Hancock."
"__MOVIES__ I also liked that movie. A different take on a superhero, and Smith's acting was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ I also really liked Shark Tale."
"__MOVIES__ That's a kids' movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Not true. It's a great family movie with great voice acting in it by Smith and so many other great actors."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I was just kidding! Back to his movies, though, I also really liked Independence Day."
"__MOVIES__ For what it was, it was a solid film."
"__MOVIES__ For the time, the special effects were amazing."
"__MOVIES__ This is true, but it's not like it was that long ago."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. The late 90s were fairly recent."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and a lot of movies with great special effects were coming out then."
