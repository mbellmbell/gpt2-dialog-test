"__MUSIC__ Has anyone heard the newest Nine Inch Nails album?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean Year Zero? That was so long ago."
"__MUSIC__ No, there is a new album released online only. It is only a few songs, I guess, and only available via download."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. No, I'm not a big enough fan to look for their stuff too hard."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's pretty decent. Seems more mainstream than some of the other stuff. Do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ They're okay. I thought they were done making music other than for movies."
"__MUSIC__ I guess not. It seems they may even be touring again. Have you heard anything about that?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I saw that they were going to perform in a festival in California somewhere."
"__MUSIC__ Really? What festival?"
"__MUSIC__ The FYV Fest in LA."
"__MUSIC__ I knew they were playing a festival in Sacramento in October. When is this one?"
"__MUSIC__ The FYV fest is in July. The 23rd."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know how much tickets cost?"
"__MUSIC__ It depends. I got a weekend pass for $329"
"__MUSIC__ How much for just the one day?"
"__MUSIC__ Like a hundred bucks."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. Do you know how long they are going to be on?"
"__MUSIC__ No idea."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite NIN album?"
"__MUSIC__ The Downward Spiral."
