"__MUSIC__ Did you know that a new Tool album is going to be released soon?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I heard something about that. Tool is great."
"__MUSIC__ Yes they are."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know what other bands sound like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you like Tool, you should probably try listening to A Perfect Circle."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard them. They have the same lead vocalist as Tool, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes: Maynard James Keenan."
"__MUSIC__ He's a good vocalist. How would you compare A Perfect Circle to Tool?"
"__MUSIC__ Their sound is not quite as loud and heavy as Tool, but I think the rhythm and melodies are almost identical in character."
"__MUSIC__ What about the drummer? Tool has a great drummer also."
"__MUSIC__ The drummer for A Perfect Circle sounds pretty similar in style. At times you might think you're listening to Tool."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to give them a try. What other bands sound like Tool?"
"__MUSIC__ There is another band that sounds a lot like them. They're called Soen."
"__MUSIC__ Are they good?"
"__MUSIC__ They're okay. They seem like they're trying to be a Tool clone, but the songs are still pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. I've never heard of it, so I'm guessing it's kind of obscure."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think many people have heard of Soen. Another group that Tool fans like is Porcupine Tree."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them. I would say they're similar to Radio Head."
"__MUSIC__ The vocalist is similar to Radio Head's. The instrumentals, in my opinion, can get more similar to heavy metal at times than Radio Head."
"__MUSIC__ That's true."
