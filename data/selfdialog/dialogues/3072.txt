"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Alt-J's latest new album?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean Relaxer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that one."
"__MUSIC__ Not yet but I have a few songs on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like each song on this album that I have heard is trying something different."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I feel like some are taking bigger risks than others."
"__MUSIC__ So far my  favorite tracks are In Cold Blood, Deadcrush and Adeline."
"__MUSIC__ Those are the only ones you have heard, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep."
"__MUSIC__ I hate to say it, but I only like the three singles, too."
"__MUSIC__ The rest isn't very good?"
"__MUSIC__ No. Not in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that is kind of disappointing  after loving An Awesome Wave and This Is All Yours so much."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me about it. I was really excited for this album after hearing the singles."
"__MUSIC__ But once you bought the album?"
"__MUSIC__ But then......first minute is a recorder intro.  And the rest wasn't great either."
"__MUSIC__ I had high hopes for this album."
"__MUSIC__ So disappointed. Maybe it'll take a few listens to grow on me but my initial opinion was that it didn't fit in at all."
"__MUSIC__ Guess I won't be buying the album."
