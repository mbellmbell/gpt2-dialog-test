"__DISNEY__ What kind of Disney movies do you like?"
"__DISNEY__ I grew up on their animated films. I saw all their live action movies in the 60s too, but those are pretty corny now."
"__DISNEY__ I like the direction they went with their more action oriented live action, like Pirates of the Caribbean."
"__DISNEY__ That first Pirates movie was such a pleasant surprise! I thought it would be awful, but I think it's marvelous."
"__DISNEY__ Johnny Depp, he is amazing."
"__DISNEY__ He's just one of the terrific elements of that movie. I love the music and the production values too."
"__DISNEY__ The rest of the Pirates movies were not as good, I don't think."
"__DISNEY__ The second one was okay, but yea, then the series kind of went off the rails."
"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the latest one?"
"__DISNEY__ Not yet, but I'll give it a chance when it comes out on DVD."
