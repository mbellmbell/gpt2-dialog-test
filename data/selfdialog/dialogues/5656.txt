"__STAR_WARS__ I read that the guy who did Darth Vader's voice got paid a good deal to not do much work."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you mean James Earl Jones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right.  He only made $7,500 for Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's still decent money for sound work."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it only took him 2.5 hours to be done."
"__STAR_WARS__ Uh, that's a pretty darn great hourly wage."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but when you think about royalties and other things he missed out on, it's nothing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm sure he was able to negotiate better terms going forward."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm sure he was, just thought it was interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Someone should pay me that much!"
