"__DISNEY__ Did you hear about the live action lion king remake?"
"__DISNEY__ I did. Waiting for them to ruin my childhood yet again!"
"__DISNEY__ Did you not like the jungle book or beauty and the beast remakes?"
"__DISNEY__ Neither were terrible, but Hollywood is getting very unoriginal."
"__DISNEY__ Gee. Are there ANY Disney movies you'd like to see remade?"
"__DISNEY__ How about cars since it wasn't good in the first place?"
"__DISNEY__ I'll pass since their sequels have been even worse. Who knows how much they'll mess up a remake!"
"__DISNEY__ Very true! It's also a bit soon for that remake."
"__DISNEY__ My guess is they'll find a way to remake Mary Poppins next."
"__DISNEY__ That wouldn't surprise me at all."
