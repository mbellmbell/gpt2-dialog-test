"__MOVIES__ So have you seen any good movies lately in the theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I usually don't go out to the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any movies other than in the theater then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I've been going through old Scorsese movies lately"
"__MOVIES__ are those the ones with Leonardo DiCaprio in all of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Not all of them but yeah he like to cast him a lot."
"__MOVIES__ I was Wolf of Wall Street and that's it"
"__MOVIES__ I bet you've seen others but don't know it, like Goodfellas"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I didn't know that was directed by him, that's interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've also been watching Kubrick movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh which ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I watch 2001 last night, it was pretty good but I prefer the book."
"__MOVIES__ That movie is just too confusing for me."
"__MOVIES__ You should try the book, it makes a lot more sense than the movie and it makes the movie more enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give that a try."
"__MOVIES__ But my favorite of his is Full metal Jacket."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was also confusing to me when I watched it"
"__MOVIES__ It was also based off of a book but it loosely follows it and might be be much help to you."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give these movies a rewatch soon"
"__MOVIES__ I bet you'll enjoy them."
