"__HORROR__ Hey dude you watch any good horror movies lately?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I actually did, I watched a Get Out."
"__HORROR__ How was it?  I heard it was directed by a Jordan Peele.  Isn't he a mostly comedy actor and writer.  It seems a little odd he would direct a horror movie."
"__HORROR__ Yes, I thought the same thing but the movie was very well made and it works."
"__HORROR__ How so?  What makes it great.  From the trailers it looked like a very serious horror film."
"__HORROR__ The movie is more of a horror-comedy satire that deals with people's fears about race in a very smart and funny way. It's very well directed and the plot really takes you on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish."
"__HORROR__ Wow that sounds interesting. I'm definitely going to check it out."
"__HORROR__ Yeah you should.  It has great performances from the pretty much everyone in the cast."
"__HORROR__ Was there anyone in the movie you liked best?"
"__HORROR__ Definitely Chris' best friend Rod, he really steals the show with his comedic performance but also the great choices he makes in the movie."
