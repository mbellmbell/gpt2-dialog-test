"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen David Bowie in a movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Only in Labyrinth many years ago."
"__MOVIES__ I just watched a great film from the early '80s called Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. It's Japanese."
"__MOVIES__ He was in a Japanese movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, surprisingly. He plays a prisoner of war in a Japanese prison camp during World War 2."
"__MOVIES__ Does he play a Briton?"
"__MOVIES__ No, a South African. The film does a good job at showing Japanese and British culture's perspectives towards war."
"__MOVIES__ Is his character Mr. Lawrence?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Mr. Lawrence is played by Tom Conti. He plays a beautiful role in trying to bridge the cultural gap between the Brits and Japanese in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ How was David Bowie's performance?"
"__MOVIES__ Quite touching, actually, with a lot of nuance brought to the character. Another standout role was Ryuichi Sakamoto as a Japanese captain."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Sakamoto a music composer? Same guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's him! He also scored the movie and even won a BAFTA for it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, Sakamoto and David Bowie on the same film's score must have been a gift for the ears."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately, David Bowie was not involved in the soundtrack at all."
"__MOVIES__ What a waste!"
"__MOVIES__ You should still give the film a try. It is a beautifully sensitive film that will sit with you long after you've watched it."
"__MOVIES__ Brotherhood is a concept that always makes me feel like someone has been cutting onions!"
"__MOVIES__ Prepare yourself. Don't watch it around your girlfriend."
"__MOVIES__ Noted!"
