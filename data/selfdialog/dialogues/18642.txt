"__MOVIES__ Did you see Girl on a Train?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually yeah I did."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Well first let me say I read the book.  The book is better."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I heard too."
"__MOVIES__ So to me they didn't get the main character right in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Something felt a little off there."
"__MOVIES__ You got that too?  Did you read the book?"
"__MOVIES__ No I didn't.  But in the movie it felt like they couldn't create that character right, she was too whiny or something."
"__MOVIES__ Okay I see.  And the mystery wasn't so mysterious."
"__MOVIES__ No it really wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ I read the book - what did you think about the mystery and drama in the movie version?"
"__MOVIES__ Halfway through I thought, its Justin Theroux."
"__MOVIES__ Right?  Like, this guy can't be this perfect."
"__MOVIES__ And then they made all the women so flawed."
"__MOVIES__ That's true.  None of them were really sympathetic."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  One stole a husband, another drank endlessly, and the other slept around."
"__MOVIES__ Its so sad."
"__MOVIES__ I mean what is the author saying about women?"
"__MOVIES__ Well they got redeemed.  I think it was a message about society."
