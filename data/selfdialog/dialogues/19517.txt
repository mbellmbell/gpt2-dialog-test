"__MOVIES__ Did you watch Baywatch the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that looked really stupid."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't stupid, it was funny."
"__MOVIES__ I doubt that it was funny, you were probably just charmed by the actors in it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, isn't that what every movie is about?"
"__MOVIES__ No, movies should be about plot development, and character design, and pacing."
"__MOVIES__ Baywatch has those things."
"__MOVIES__ Again, I doubt it. Baywatch has beautiful people, that's it. That's all baywatch has ever been."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, but some movies are just about having fun, Baywatch is one of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Too many movies seem to be focused on mindless fun these days."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I watched it because I'm a big fan of the Rock."
"__MOVIES__ I am too, but really, he should stick to cooler roles."
"__MOVIES__ But he's the rock, nobody is going to give him cooler roles."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good point. I guess he probably plays basically the same character in every movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, in Fast n Furious he plays a big buff cop that nobody can beat."
"__MOVIES__ Well he was awesome in The Rundown."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, he really was, but again, big tough guy that nobody can beat."
"__MOVIES__ Very true. But he does it so well."
"__MOVIES__ Yea probably because that's who he is in real life."
"__MOVIES__ Obviously, but he's also really funny and caring too."
