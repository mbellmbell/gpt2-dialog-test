"__MOVIES__ Did you know that Lin Manuel Miranda wrote a lot of the music for Moana?"
"__MOVIES__ Of Hamilton fame? No way!"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that cool? He collaborated with Polynesian musicians to bring the music to life."
"__MOVIES__ Is the music all in English? Or in Polynesian languages too?"
"__MOVIES__ They actually included Samoan, Tokelauan, and Tuvalu. With traditional instruments, too!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! They've come a long way since Pocahontas. Actually consulting with native peoples?"
"__MOVIES__ I know! I've heard a lot of Polynesian people are very proud of how the movie turned out."
"__MOVIES__ Did they use Polynesian actors too?"
"__MOVIES__ For the most part, they did! Did you know The Rock actually is of Maori descent?"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I had no idea! So he's in it too?"
"__MOVIES__ He is! And the actress that voices the main character, Moana, is Hawaiian."
"__MOVIES__ How did they do with capturing the visuals of the scenery?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness, it's beautiful! The way they portray the water is magnificent."
"__MOVIES__ Is it too late to see it on the big screen?"
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately, yes. But maybe you could wait for a reshowing!"
"__MOVIES__ I want to see the whole world of the film! No iPhone screen for me."
"__MOVIES__ That's the way to go. You'll want to see the detail on every mountain and wave."
"__MOVIES__ So is it your new favorite Disney movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Totally! The music is just so good. And the story development!"
"__MOVIES__ You no longer need a prince to be a Disney princess!"
