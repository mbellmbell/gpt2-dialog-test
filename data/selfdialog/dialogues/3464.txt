"__MUSIC__ What music have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been getting really into The Mountain Goats."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, cool. I think I've heard of them. What genre are they?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say they're sort of folk and rock, but mostly rock."
"__MUSIC__ Nice! I've heard some people say that about Dinosaur Jr, is it like that?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really. The Mountain Goats has a lot of guitar, and less other stuff, at least in his earlier work."
"__MUSIC__ His? Wait, I thought this was a band."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it is, but it's mostly this one guy, John Darnielle. He's the only permanent member."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, did he kick those other people out?"
"__MUSIC__ No, he just has different people that join it or leave depending on what they need for an album."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. If I wanted to check them out, where should I start?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably with the album Sunset Tree! It's a bit older but it's a fan favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I'll look into it. Do you have a favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ This Year is really good, and usually the first song people hear by them."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds great! I love knowing what songs are my friend's favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of which, what have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I just listened to Master of Reality for the first time. The Black Sabbath album."
"__MUSIC__ Really? How was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's so good. The song Sweet Leaf is absolutely killer."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it really is. I think it's the second-best song they ever made."
