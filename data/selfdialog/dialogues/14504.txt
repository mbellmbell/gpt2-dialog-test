"__HORROR__ What do you think is hitchcocks scariest film?"
"__HORROR__ Psycho, I think this is his scariest ever, don't you?"
"__HORROR__ It is good. but scariest for me is The bird's."
"__HORROR__ I think the they are both worthy of being in the horror category. Psycho is far more scary though."
"__HORROR__ I don't agree. THE FACT THAT NATURE IS SO UNCONTROLLABLE AND CAN JUST TURN ON HUMANS ANYTIME IS THE ULTIMATE SACRE."
"__HORROR__ no need to yell.. Just kidding. It is a scary concept. But still say psycho look at what that says about human nature and how sick some people are."
"__HORROR__ I think we will have to agree to disagree on hitchcocks scariest. Anthony Perkins certainly creeped me out in this role."
"__HORROR__ Perkins is the ultimate creep in this role. Did you ever notice how he walks up the stairs in the main house?"
"__HORROR__ Yes actually, he kind of sashes, sways his hips like a woman."
"__HORROR__ I often wonder if this was perkins natural movement or a character choice.. either way worked well for the role."
