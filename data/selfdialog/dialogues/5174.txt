"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you remember the first race in fast & furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The first ever race?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes that is the one i'm talking about."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why do you ask?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was just thinking about that scene and was curious if you remember if Brian's car was or broke down."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I believe it had some engine troubles during the race."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I remember he was trying to give Dom the best race he could."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yep Brian tried so hard that one race."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That race set the stage for the rest of the movie and movies."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree I think if that scene sucked it wouldn't have been as big as it was."
