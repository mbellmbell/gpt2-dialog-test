"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm confused about how a player can stay onside or be offside."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ To be onside, a player on offense can only completely enter the other team's zone after the puck has crossed into the zone."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How do you know when the puck is in other other team's zone."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ There is a blue line on the ice that borders that zone."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I've seen two blue lines in each rink."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, one bordering each team's zone, and in between is neutral ice that belongs to neither team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Can an offensive player partially cross into the other team's zone before the puck?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, but they have to keep some part of their body, like their skate for example, behind the blue line until the puck crosses."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's interesting. That keeps them from having too much advantage, it sounds like."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah. Any number of defensive players can already be in that zone before that puck crosses."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm also confused about how the points are scored."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, there are goals, of course, that count towards the score of the game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ True, but I've heard that assists also count toward a player's points."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, but not towards the score of the team, so they don't determine wins or losses."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So how does the point system work?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, there is only one goal per scoring play, but there can be up to two assists."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know the person who gets the puck in the net scores the goal, but who scores the assist?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The one or two players who touch the puck before the goal scorer and set the goal scorer up to score."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So, in theory, there could be twice as many assists as goals scored."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, but sometimes a goal is scored with one or even no assists."
