"__MUSIC__ Whatever happened to Alanis Morissette?"
"__MUSIC__ You know what, I don't know."
"__MUSIC__ I was just curious because I haven't heard any new music from her recently."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she kind of disappeared over the past 15 years."
"__MUSIC__ I remember her last song from 2006, where she remade that Seal song."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy? Right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was Crazy."
"__MUSIC__ That does seem like a long time ago."
"__MUSIC__ She came on the scene and rocked it out and then mellowed out."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I wonder if the mellowing out phase started to decline her career."
"__MUSIC__ Her music was still good after she mellowed out, so I'm not sure."
"__MUSIC__ She was into all that spiritual stuff. I wonder if that's why she also disappeared."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, many of her songs when she mellowed out were about her trips to Asia."
"__MUSIC__ The Thank You song was about India and her trip there."
"__MUSIC__ Funny, how she just kind of disappeared."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I'm going to go look her up when I get home."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. Maybe she is still making music."
"__MUSIC__ Possibly. Sometimes popular artists continue to churn out albums but we never hear any of the songs because they aren't mainstream anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I bet she has made music since 2006, but we never heard any of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Possibly. It will be interesting to see what ever happened to her."
