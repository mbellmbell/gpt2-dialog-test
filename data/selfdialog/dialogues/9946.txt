"__COMEDY__ Have you ever seen The 40 year old virgin?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes I have and it was hilarious! Steve Carrel cracks me up."
"__COMEDY__ He is so funny. I thought Seth Rogen did a good lowkey job in that movie too."
"__COMEDY__ And the dialogue was so clever. They made you believe a man could actually be a virgin at 40."
"__COMEDY__ Those guys when they get together make some really funny movies. Do you like Adam Sandler?"
"__COMEDY__ I definitely do. Happy Gilmore is my favorite movie of his."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yeah? Mine is Little Nicky."
"__COMEDY__ I think it's funny how we blatantly puts his sponsors in the spotlight in those movies."
"__COMEDY__ You're right. It becomes like a little easter egg hunt to spot the sponsors."
"__COMEDY__ Click was an excellent movie by him too. It was a little different from his usual but surprisingly heartwarming."
