"__STAR_WARS__ Who shot first?  Han, or Greedo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Han!  One hundred percent."
"__STAR_WARS__ Didn't George Lucas edit the later versions to show Greedo shooting first?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He did, which is why it was so controversial."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why was that controversial?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Han shooting first is significant because it shows what a scoundrel he was in the beginning of the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see.  So the importance stems from demonstrating his evolution as a person?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Correct."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why did Lucas change it in the revamped editions of the movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The world may never know, to be honest."
