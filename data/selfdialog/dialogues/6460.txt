"__STAR_WARS__ What is your least favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really don't like Star Wars episodes one, two, and three."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those are the ones I dislike the most as well. They are just too cheesy and gimmicky compared to all the others."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. They are a prequel to the originals, but besides somewhat fitting with the storyline, they're not much like the other movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I feel the same way! Plus, you know, there are characters like Jar Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ugh. Yeah, exactly."
"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the newest Star Wars films? What do you think about those?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I saw The Force Awakens and Rogue One in theaters. I really liked those!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too! I thought those movies were well written and really good! They reminded me a lot more of the original films."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's great that they have awesome female leads in the series again. Plus, Rey, Finn, and Jyn are pretty awesome characters."
