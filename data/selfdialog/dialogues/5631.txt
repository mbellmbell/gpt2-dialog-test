"__STAR_WARS__ So which Star Wars movie is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that is a complex question. Do you mean of the old trilogy, the newer movies, or out of all of them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Out of all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I would still have to go with A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the older ones better anyways."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they will always be Star Wars to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Anytime Jar-Jar Binks is in a scene of the newer ones I about have to leave the room."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I know, I cannot stand to here that thing talk."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why in the world did they add him as a character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see why his part was important, but why did they make him so annoying?"
