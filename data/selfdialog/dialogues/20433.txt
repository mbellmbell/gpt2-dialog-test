"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't. Did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did. I really liked it!"
"__MOVIES__ Was it like the other DC movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, to me it felt really different! Gal Godot did a great job!"
"__MOVIES__ That's so good to hear, I want to go see it really badly!"
"__MOVIES__ I especially loved Chris Pine in it."
"__MOVIES__ What was his character like?"
"__MOVIES__ He was a British spy in the military and he found Wonder Woman on her island."
"__MOVIES__ I think Chris Pine is so cute. Was it a love story then?"
"__MOVIES__ A little bit, but it didn't overpower the main plot."
"__MOVIES__ What was the plot anyways? Besides Wonder Woman kicking butt!"
"__MOVIES__ She was trying to find and defeat the god of war."
"__MOVIES__ The god of war? Sounds crazy!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to spoil the ending, but it definitely was action packed!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard it got really good reviews."
"__MOVIES__ So did I! And I'm glad!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know Gal Godot was pregnant while filming?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't know that! How cool!"
"__MOVIES__ Very cool, especially since I think she did a lot of the stunts."
