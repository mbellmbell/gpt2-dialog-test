"__MOVIES__ Can you believe it's been over 60 years since Hollywood released a decent movie?"
"__MOVIES__ What are you talking about? Have you been living in a cave for that long?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm talking about The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly; the single greatest movie ever."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't go that far."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I have and I will."
"__MOVIES__ What makes it so great? Clint Eastwood?"
"__MOVIES__ No. The storytelling is what's so great about it."
"__MOVIES__ It was okay."
"__MOVIES__ It's better than okay. It's more original and intriguing than any movie released since."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's a bit of a hyperbole."
"__MOVIES__ The story and plot was simple and to the point. No plot holes or unneeded distractions."
"__MOVIES__ You know what I didn't get about that old movie?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ Why was Tuco 'The Bad' when Eastwood's character double crossed him first?"
"__MOVIES__ Good question. I guess it's because of the extreme way he went to get payback."
"__MOVIES__ 'Blonde' should have been 'The Bad' in the title, if you ask me."
"__MOVIES__ They did explain more about Tuco than 'Blonde' in the story. We don't even know his real name."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't the character Eastwood played in those old movies usually nameless?"
"__MOVIES__ Most of the time, but that doesn't change the fact that it's the best movie ever."
"__MOVIES__ If you say so."
