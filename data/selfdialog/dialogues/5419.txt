"__STAR_WARS__ Do you ever wonder if anyone from the Star Wars universe ever made it to our galaxy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really, that was a long time ago."
"__STAR_WARS__ Good point. Do you think they could ever do a cross over between Star Trek and Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, they occupy totally different timelines."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh good point. Do you think we will see Jar Jar Binks in another movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There's no way, that was the worst character of all time."
"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite star wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite is Admiral Akbar, he's got a lot of subtle depth."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's interesting, my favorite character is Lando Calrissian."
"__STAR_WARS__ But that guy is a total double crosser, why?"
