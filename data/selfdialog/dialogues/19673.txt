"__MOVIES__ Did you watch Arrival yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched it a while ago. I thought it was good."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about the director?"
"__MOVIES__ He's one of the better ones right now but his movies are hit or miss with me. I like Sicario and Incendies but I didn't care for Prisoners."
"__MOVIES__ So where would you rank this one among his movies?"
"__MOVIES__ It was closer to the top but not his best. I would put it at his third best, below Incendies and above Enemy."
"__MOVIES__ Is there something you didn't like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a bit predictable."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What part of it was predictable?"
"__MOVIES__ I watch a lot of time travel movies and I can spot some of the conventions when I see them in other films. I could tell early on that this would involve time displacement."
"__MOVIES__ When did you figure that out?"
"__MOVIES__ There was some foreshadowing when she began talking to the aliens. She spotted an image that triggered a flashback and it was the kind of thing I've seen in a lot of time travel movies."
"__MOVIES__ What time travel movies are you talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen something similar in 12 Monkeys. And then it became obvious that the aliens would cause her to displace time."
"__MOVIES__ So you foresaw that there would be a universal language she would use to traverse time?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not specifically. But I thought the aliens might give her a gift because that also happens in a lot of movies."
"__MOVIES__ And you knew that the flashback at the beginning didn't actually take place until after the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, no. I thought at first that they might give her a way to relive those memories, but when she revealed she didn't have a child then I knew that she was only going to have those memories going forward."
"__MOVIES__ So what are some other movies I can watch about time displacement or alternate lives?"
"__MOVIES__ Well you can watch Triangle, Timecrimes, Coherence, Another Earth, Primer, and the list goes on and on."
