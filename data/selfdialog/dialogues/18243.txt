"__MOVIES__ One of my favorite movies of all time and guilty pleasure is 'Galaxy Quest'. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the one starring 'Tim the Toolman Taylor'?!"
"__MOVIES__ Ha, ha, yes, it had Tim Allen in it as the Captain of the ship, The Galaxy Quest."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that a take-off on 'Star Trek, the Original Series'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes...Tim's character was supposed to be like Captain Kirk. But Alan Rickman's character was even better at sot of paralleling Spock."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah...it sort of poked at Yeoman Rand, too."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean? Sigourney Weaver's character?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she was all boobs, and the fans all thought that she was having an affair with the Captain."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you could say that it was close on, but I get the feeling her character doing that 'repeating the computer' thing was from another series."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. Maybe something like 'Space 1999', or 'UFO'."
"__MOVIES__ I just adored the bits where the guy from 'Monk', Tony Shaloob - was tryign to impress the alien girl."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that stoned engineer character was hilarious! I loved that moment when the security guard screams out, 'Oh, no, that's just not right!' as Tech Sgt. Chen makes out with the alien chick."
"__MOVIES__ The crew of that ship were actually all squids or something, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. And they had some sort of transmuting device that made them look almost human."
"__MOVIES__ I loved how they walked, as though they still had eight limbs!"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely a funny movie, although once you've seen it, it really isn't as funny as the first time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I disagree! Each time I watch it, I find something funny that I didn't notice before."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Like Tech Sgt. Chen inspecting the Engineering deck, and all he has to say is, 'Wow, look at the clean floors!'"
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right, it IS a guilty pleasure!"
