"__MUSIC__ How long do you think we could have a conversation for with just song lyrics and have it actually make sense?"
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it'd be fun."
"__MUSIC__ Let it go."
"__MUSIC__ That's the spirit."
"__MUSIC__ That's not what meant."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me what you want."
"__MUSIC__ I will kill you."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, despicable me."
"__MUSIC__ The only song lyrics you know come from children's movies."
"__MUSIC__ That's not true!"
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha, I threw you off after two lines."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you."
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome."
"__MUSIC__ Gotcha!"
"__MUSIC__ I hate you."
"__MUSIC__ You should lighten up."
"__MUSIC__ You should stop harassing me with songs that I don't want stuck in my head."
"__MUSIC__ Sigh, okay."
"__MUSIC__ Thank y... no, I'm not falling for that again!"
