"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who do you think is the greatest female rapper of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hands down Missy Elliott. I've always loved her style of music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, she really is an individual and very identifiable. No other female rapper has the same sound as her."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly. People always say Lil Kim or Foxy Brown, and I ask them what is the difference."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True, they have similar sounds and used to have a similar sexy look back in the day."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think Da Brat is also really talented. I'm not sure if she raps anymore though"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I haven't heard much from her for a while but she really used to be one of my favorites. Her and Trina."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Trina? I remember the name but can't remember what song she sang"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ She had this big song about 10 years ago called 'Here we Go'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yes, featuring Kelly Rowland. I liked that song actually."
