"__BASEBALL__ Have you ever been to a live major league baseball game?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I think baseball is so boring."
"__BASEBALL__ I bet you wouldn't think it was so boring if you saw a game in person."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASEBALL__ At a live baseball game, you're more engaged, it's more exciting."
"__BASEBALL__ There are too many commercials in televised baseball games! It makes the games last a ridiculously long period of time."
"__BASEBALL__ That's why live major league baseball games are exciting: there aren't any commercial breaks."
"__BASEBALL__ What else do you think makes live baseball so much better?"
"__BASEBALL__ There's sort of a sense of community. Even if you don't normally follow a team, it's fun to get caught up in rooting for one of the teams."
"__BASEBALL__ I have to admit that when the crowd is involved with cheers or doing the wave, it does look fun."
"__BASEBALL__ And you get to see the super-fans up close, the guys who paint their faces and dye their hair to match the teams' colors."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think the players really notice that?"
"__BASEBALL__ I do. I think the players draw on the energy of the crowd and the excitement of the fans."
"__BASEBALL__ It's a shame that major league games have become so expensive."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. It costs more for a family of 4 to go to a game, park, get hot dogs and sodas and maybe a ball cap or t-shirt,  than it cost me to attend a semester at college!"
"__BASEBALL__ Going to a game can cost as much as a used car! It makes the experience out of reach for so many ordinary people. That may be why baseball has become less popular over the years."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you think the games have become so expensive to attend?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think it's because they pay the players so much more than they used to. Athletes are paid as much as rockstars, and the fans ultimately pay the price."
"__BASEBALL__ So do you think you'd like to go to a major league game sometime."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure, I just need to win the lottery first!"
