"__MUSIC__ Do you have any music with a special meaning for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure! Don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I'm an old softy. I am surprised to hear you also feel so moved."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely! You want an example?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ OK. Let me think..."
"__MUSIC__ This is great! What do you got?"
"__MUSIC__ OK. Here is spooky one."
"__MUSIC__ Spooky? Don't tell me this is a story about the song, 'The Monster Mash'!"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I do have one. But that;s a different story."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. So what's the spooky story?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard the Steve Green song, 'Enter In' ?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Sure."
"__MUSIC__ You remember the part where he sings about passing through death's gate?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. But that was not about entering death...It is more about surrendering to God and finding peace."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but what if you were walking through a cemetery while listening to the song? 'Die and enter in' kind of sends chills down your back!"
"__MUSIC__ I can see that."
"__MUSIC__ I used to walk to college while listening to a walkman playing Steve Green's 'Enter In', and I had to walk through a historic old cemetery on my way, since it was the fastest route."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. So that is creepy!"
"__MUSIC__ So now every time I pass by a cemetery, it causes me to sing 'Enter In'...but the funniest thing is that it makes me feel all peaceful"
