"__POP__ I bought the new Katy Perry album."
"__POP__ I didn't know she had one. What's it called?"
"__POP__ It's called Witness. It has that song on it Chained to the Rhythm."
"__POP__ Oh I really liked that song. Really good for Katy, at least."
"__POP__ Yeah it's a cute song, but the album isn't really my thing."
"__POP__ Really? Why not?"
"__POP__ I think she tried to make it really deep, but it comes off as shallow."
"__POP__ That's surprising. I really like Katy Perry, too."
"__POP__ I normally do too. But I think I'm just gonna stick with Selena Gomez's next LP."
"__POP__ If it's as good as Bad Liar, we'll be in luck!"
