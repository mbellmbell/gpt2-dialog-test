"__BASKETBALL__ Are you watching the Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards series?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Is that the series for the finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  The series is tied 2-2 now."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's probably a good series.  Who's been playing the best so far?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, Isiah Thomas has been having some good games"
"__BASKETBALL__ I like Washington.  Wall is one of my favorite players."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's been really physical.  Isiah had his teeth knocked out again."
"__BASKETBALL__ I really would like Washington to win, though.  Celtics have been a dynasty long enough!"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true, but they're a great franchise.  They deserve to start winning titles again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Nah... Cleveland will win it all again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not if the Warriors have their way!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I tihnk the Warriors are overrated.  They'll cave to the Cavs again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, at least we don't have to worry about Washington playing them.  They won't make it that far this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, neither will the Celtics!"
"__BASKETBALL__ OK, I'll give you that.  If Durant stays healthy, they may have a chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Nah.... I'm telling you.  Draymond Green will get thrown out of a few games again and it'll be the Cavs all over."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I can't argue with that or be mad.  LeBron deserves all the titles he wants."
"__BASKETBALL__ True.  He's definitely the best player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Absolutely.  I wouldn't mind Cleveland winning again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me neither."
