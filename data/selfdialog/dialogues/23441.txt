"__DISNEY__ Well you know what I always say, 'Hakuna Matata'."
"__DISNEY__ Are you seriously quoting me The Lion King mottos right now?"
"__DISNEY__ Well I'd say Timon and Pumba knew how to live life."
"__DISNEY__ Except for the fact that it meant Simba was just going to leave behind everyone he loved."
"__DISNEY__ Let's give Simba a break here okay. His evil Uncle Scar tricked him into thinking he killed Mufasa!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah Scar was a pretty bad dude."
"__DISNEY__ Simba did eventually come back to take down Scar and become the rightful leader of Pride Rock."
"__DISNEY__ All's well that ends well."
"__DISNEY__ Hey did you know that The Lion King was based on Shakespeare's Hamlet?"
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that! It makes sense though!"
