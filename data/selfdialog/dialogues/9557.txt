"__COMEDY__ i think, of all the genres, comedy changes the most, if you ask me."
"__COMEDY__ Um, I don't think so. Sci Fi changes the most."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, yeah, you're right. With all the effects and CGI and everything."
"__COMEDY__ Yep, we can still laugh at comedies from the 70s. Sci fi from the 70s look silly."
"__COMEDY__ Tell that to all the start trek fans."
"__COMEDY__ Star trek is not merely a sci fi. It's a part of Americana."
"__COMEDY__ Whatever. anyway. I think humor in the 70s were different from now. Look at Woody Allen's movies."
"__COMEDY__ Well, that's not really representative of 70s comedy. That's just Woody Allen. And he's the one who set the standards for the romatic comedy genre"
"__COMEDY__ And I don't like romatic comedies. it's usually acted badly, even with famous comedians. Look at Billy Crystal movies. He has a weird awkward cadence."
"__COMEDY__ And that will be the charm of Billy Crystal. he just acts that way. He talks that way in real life too. So it becomes believable."
