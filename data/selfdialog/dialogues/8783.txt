"__BEATLES__ I heard a song yesterday that reminded me of 'Strawberry Fields Forever.' Do you like that song?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I love that song. Are you a Beatles fan?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I am. My favorite album is Revolver."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, I'm not really familiar with that album. What songs are on it?"
"__BEATLES__ 'Taxman,' 'Eleanor Rigby.' The latter is beautiful, one of the first ones to have strings. It's a pretty sad song actually."
"__BEATLES__ Sadder than 'Yesterday'?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes. 'Eleanor Rigby' isn't a love song, it's about loneliness. There are more songs on that album you might know, like 'Tomorrow Never Knows'"
"__BEATLES__ I have not heard that one, I am mostly familiar with their earlier pop songs from A Hard Days Night and Help."
"__BEATLES__ You should really listen to their middle to late career work. It's cool to hear them experiment. White Album is also good, as is Sgt. Pepper."
"__BEATLES__ Thanks. I will definitely check those out. I really like their ballads, too, so hopefully there are some good ones!"
