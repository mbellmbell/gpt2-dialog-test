"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Washington Redskins.  Who is yours?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the Dallas Cowboys.  I think we're in this season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Super Bowl?  I doubt that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious!? Did you not see that performace last season by Dak and Zeke?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are good.  But, as usualy with the Cowboys, not good enough to get to the big game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We beat you guys. Twice, if I'm not mistaken..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, we had a disconnected team.  I don't think that will happen this season.  Cousins is good and they've beefed up our other areas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You guys need to get rid of a few people, too. Eitherway, we will do the same thing we did last year with you guys. Win!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt that.  Dak and your RB were new and there was no film on them.  Now, everybody has something to study and find out their quirks..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OMG! I can't believe you think that with the kind of skill and talent they have, that tape on them is going to make that big of a difference.  They were rookies and still went almost undefeated!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tape is a very useful tool and those guys study that stuff hard before playing a team.  You guys will not have a year like you had last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You wish.  There has been tape on Brady for years.  He's still, although I hate to admit it, one of the greats.  I'm not saying that having the tape is not helpful.  But, when it is true talent, it won't change the outcome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that.... Man, what do you have against Tom Brady!? Even I say he is the man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He seems like an awful person to me.  I just don't like him.  Also, he's a cheater.  His whole team has been caught several times now doing things that are against the rules in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was out for 4 games last year and they still made it to the big game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's an excellent cheater.  I just think that run was fueled by anger. LOL!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You would say that.... One second you say that talent or skill can overcome anything like, for instance, tapes.  Then you say cheating is the reason a very talented QB with 4 rings has them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets not get side-tracked...  The Cowboys will win the Super Bowl this year.  Brady is on the downslope and it's our time now after 20 years!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You Cowboys fans say that every year..."
