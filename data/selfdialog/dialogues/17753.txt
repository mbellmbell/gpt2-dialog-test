"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Disney movie?"

"__MOVIES__ Yes!  That is mine too."
"__MOVIES__ I remember liking everything about it as a child."
"__MOVIES__ Likewise.  It was so empowering to young girls."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, Mulan was so strong and determined.  I also liked that 'Mulan' represented elements of Asian culture."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that Ming-Na Wen was the voice of Mulan?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh no way, she's such a great actress."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite song in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed 'I'll Make a Man Out of You.'  That song really builds."
"__MOVIES__ I listen to it at the gym all the time.  I get chills during the training montage scene."
"__MOVIES__ How about you.  What was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked 'Reflection.'"
"__MOVIES__ Another classic!"

"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't even realize 'Mulan' had a sequel.  Maybe I'll give it a watch."
