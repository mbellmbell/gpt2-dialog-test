"__DISNEY__ You'll never guess what I watched with the kids last night."
"__DISNEY__ What?"
"__DISNEY__ The North Avenue Irregulars!"
"__DISNEY__ No! Really?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I just had to share it with the kids. It was one of my favorite Disney movies growing up."
"__DISNEY__ Mine, as well. I don't think anybody remembers it though."
"__DISNEY__ I think you and I are the only ones!"
"__DISNEY__ Well, the only person people nowadays would know from the movie is Cloris Leachman."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. I don't think anyone remembers Karen Valentine anymore."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, she was one of my favorites back in the day, so pretty and cute. I think I'm going to have to watch the movie now!"
