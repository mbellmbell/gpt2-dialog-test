"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that the melody of Shape of You and No Scrubs is the same?"
"__MUSIC__ What? No way!"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. Ed Sheeran included the writers of No Scrubs on his song because the melody totally matches."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Who were the writers he included?"
"__MUSIC__ It was Tiny and Kandi Burruss."
"__MUSIC__ That's so crazy. I had no idea they wrote No Scrubs."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know either until recently. No Scrubs was such a great song by TLC."
"__MUSIC__ It definitely was. Weren't Tiny and Kandi in a group together called Xscape?"
"__MUSIC__ That's right. They're on a reunion tour right now."
"__MUSIC__ It's always so nice to see groups reunite. I loved Xscape's song Who Can I Run To."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Ever since I heard they were on a reunion tour, I've been listening to all their music."
"__MUSIC__ What other songs of theirs do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Just Kickin' It, Understanding, and Tonight."
"__MUSIC__ Those were some of their greatest hits."
"__MUSIC__ I wish there were more girl groups out right now."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. The only one that comes to mind is Fifth Harmony."
"__MUSIC__ I love their song Worth It."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song too, but it's the only song of theirs that I know."
"__MUSIC__ You know what? That's the only one I know, too!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to have to check out some more of their music because I'm sure they're very talented."
