"__MUSIC__ What are some of your favorite bands that have slid into obscurity?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think Linkin Park would be one."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, thats a good one."
"__MUSIC__ They used to be huge but now you never hear of them."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what happened to them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they are actually still around and making music."
"__MUSIC__ Are they really? It seems like its been forever since I have even heard that name."
"__MUSIC__ Linkin Park is even #1 on the top 100 billboard artists right now."
"__MUSIC__ No kidding? I had no idea."
"__MUSIC__ What about you? Whats a band that used to be huge but you don't really hear of now?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think Hinder comes to mind."
"__MUSIC__ For sure, Hinder sky rocketed to fame a decade back but it seems like they just disappeared afterwards."
"__MUSIC__ Right? When was the last time they released an album?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they released one in 2016 but that was right after their lead singer left the band and they got a new one. I couldn't tell you what it was called."
"__MUSIC__ So they have a new singer? Wow. Thats probably why they aren't as popular anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, their lead singer's vocal quality was the reason they were so good."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, indeed. He had such a unique voice."
"__MUSIC__ I remember seeing them in concert in 2006."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, were they any good live?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yea, they were fantastic. That concert was worth every penny."
