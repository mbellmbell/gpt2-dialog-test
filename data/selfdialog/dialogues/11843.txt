"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, it is July already.  You about ready for some football again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am, but I do appreciate baseball.  Where I live at all I hear about is football all year long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you do live in New Orleans...............they love their Saints there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That they do, but I'm a Dallas Cowboy fan. Cowboys forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys had a great year last year.  Bet you never saw that coming."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't and hardly anyone else did either.  I would've never though that Romo would not be a Cowboy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a shock.  Dak is where it is at, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is definitely the future.  Hope he stays healthy long term."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and hopefully he doesn't go into a sophmore slump because sometimes the rival teams have figured you out in your second season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope not.  I hope he is the Cowboy's quarterback for a long time to come.  We are actually picked to face the Patriots in the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did read that.  If that is the case, I'm pulling for your Cowboys then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you.  You get tired of hearing about the Patriots and Brady all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean he is a great quarterback, but I like it when new teams win the Superbowl.  I mean, that is when my team isn't in it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your team?  It must suck being a Browns fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't go into my closet at night for fear of hanging myself.....hahahaha.........I don't expect much from the Browns that is for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they won a game or two last year.  They were barely projected to do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, don't remind me.  I don't know how the Browns will ever turn it around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at the Cowboys, been losing for years recently and now we are preemptive favorites all of a sudden."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we'll see what happens this year that is for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes we will.  Good luck to you even though being a Browns fan it's usually bad luck."
