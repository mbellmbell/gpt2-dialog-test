"__MUSIC__ You listen to Top 40 songs right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there is a pop radio station that I keep on during my drive to work every day."
"__MUSIC__ Any favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, none really come to mind right away since pop music sort of blurs together.  How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't actually like this one, but the song 'Issues' is stuck in my head and I can't get it out."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that song by?  I heard it the other day."
"__MUSIC__ It's by Julia Michaels."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of her."
"__MUSIC__ She is a relatively new face to the public.  But she's actually been around the music industry for years."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know what.  What has she done?"
"__MUSIC__ She's written for so many famous artists.  And she started writing those hits since she was 14."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's so young.  Can you give me examples of songs I might know?"
"__MUSIC__ She wrote 'Sorry' by Justin Bieber.  Also John Legend's “What You Do to Me.”"
"__MUSIC__ I'm very impressed.  Those don't really sound like the song 'Issues,' at least stylistically."
"__MUSIC__ Julia also wrote Ed Sheeran's 'Dive,' Gwen Stefani's “Used to Love You,” and Selena Gomez's 'Good For You.'"
"__MUSIC__ That is quite the resumé.  'Good For You' actually makes sense, because stylistically they are sort of similar."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I noticed that too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not a fan of her Indie-girl type singing technique, though in general it is not my favorite sound."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's alright but I can see why you'd think that.  So many artists sound like that these days."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to follow her career more closely and see what else she does."
