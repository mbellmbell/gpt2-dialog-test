"__HARRY_POTTER__ So I'm a bit confused about Harry's parents."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What part is confusing?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ His dad was a total jerk and his mom was nice."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah.  So?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought it his parents would have been more pure.  Seem like that's kind of how Harry was supposed to."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No way.  Harry was supposed to be conflicted."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just seems weird to me that Harry shouted all the time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was his dad's rebellious side."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe Harry is just a jerk."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You try being the boy who lived!"
