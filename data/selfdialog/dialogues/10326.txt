"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you like any rap or hip hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, I love Kendrick Lamar's older albums such as Section. 80 and Good Kidd, M.A.A.D City."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You don't like his newer albums?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think they're good, but I don't find myself wanting to listen to them."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What don't you like about the newer albums?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I just feel like they're made more for the mainstream. I feel like 'Be Humble' was made to be played at NBA games."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hm, I disagree. Have you heard any good songs on the radio lately?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No. None. I heard an awful song by Ugly God called 'Water'. Maybe it was meant to be terrible, so I would rememeber it..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess it worked if that's the case. What's so bad about it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It has an annoying water drop sound effect and the lyrics are so idiotic. It sounds like no effort was put into it. I thought it was ameteur/local at first."
