"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with Rhonda Vincent?"
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of her.  What type of music does she sing?"
"__MUSIC__ She is a bluegrass performer.  Are you familiar with bluegrass music?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean bluegrass like with a banjo?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, banjos, mandolins, guitars, and such.  It is really popular in my region of the US.  Have you heard any of it?"
"__MUSIC__ Only in movies.  How big is it and what region are you in?"
"__MUSIC__ I live in the Appalachian Mountain region of the Southeast.  It has quite the following here.  Have you heard of Flatt & Scruggs or Alison Krauss?"
"__MUSIC__ Alison Krauss sounds familiar.  We don't really have bluegrass on the West coast.  Do you play an instrument?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I have wanted to learn and the local schools here now have a program to teach kids bluegrass instruments.  What type of music is popular out west?"
"__MUSIC__ We enjoy more popular type music and sometime the folk genre which is kind of like bluegrass isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess somewhat.  There are a lot of new, contemporary bluegrass artists nowadays such as Trampled by Turtles or Old Crow Medicine Show that are bringing awareness of bluegrass to the masses.  Ever heard of those?"
"__MUSIC__ Old Crow I think.  What is so great about bluegrass where you are from?"
"__MUSIC__ It is a part of our heritage.  Our region isn't known for a lot but music is something that provides a lot of pride and camaraderie  amongst the neighbors here. Have you ever traveled in the South?"
"__MUSIC__ No, never had the chance but I'd like to go try the bbq and maybe try the music out."
"__MUSIC__ There are a lot of festivals in this area that combine the two quite well.  The biggest festival near  here is called Merlefest. Tickets go really fast for it."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever gotten to go?"
"__MUSIC__ No, my husband is not too into bluegrass as he's not originally from here so he has no urge to go.  I did get him to go to a smaller festival once and he didn't' complain too much.  Do you like festivals?"
"__MUSIC__ I like outdoor concerts so I think I would really like a festival with good food!"
"__MUSIC__ You should definitely come to the South and experience the culture of the food and music together.  You would really like it, I believe."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you for sharing with me!  I'm going to go look up Merlefest now and see what it is all about!"
