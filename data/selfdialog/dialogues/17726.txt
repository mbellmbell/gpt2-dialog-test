"__MOVIES__ I watched The Big Short last night. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No I never watched that one. What's it about again?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a few traders who bet against the housing market before the financial crisis in 2008."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that came out a while ago right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was out in 2015."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I sort of remember now, who was in it though?"
"__MOVIES__ Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell and Brad Pitt were the main characters."
"__MOVIES__ Nice, that's a star studded cast!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everyone was really good in it too."
"__MOVIES__ How is the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I like it a lot especially since I'm into stocks and finance. I've actually seen it a few times."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it a documentary?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe it's listed as a documentary but it's not like other documentaries about the markets and economy."
"__MOVIES__ Is it like Margin Call or The Wolf of Wall Street?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a mix of the two, more like Margin Call though."
"__MOVIES__ Nice, I liked Margin Call. I'll have to check out this one now."
"__MOVIES__ You'll love it. Another good stock market movie is Boiler Room, which is one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've seen that one with Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, not your typical Vin Diesel role."
"__MOVIES__ Sure isn't, I'm so used to seeing him in action movies like all the The Fast and the Furious ones."
