"__COMEDY__ Who is your favorite comedy actor or actress?"
"__COMEDY__ I really love any move with Will Ferrell."
"__COMEDY__ Me too! He's hilarious! Have you seen Stranger Than Fiction?"
"__COMEDY__ I have seen that. I was surprised at how well he did with a drama comedy!"
"__COMEDY__ I know what you mean. It wasn't as 'goody funny' as a lot of the other movies he's been in."
"__COMEDY__ I agree. But this was actually my favorite movie he's been in."
"__COMEDY__ Mine too! I think it was because he is still so funny even when he's being partially serious."
"__COMEDY__ He cracks me up no matter what move it is that he's starring in."
"__COMEDY__ I know, if I hear that something has Will Ferrell in it, I'll watch it just for that reason."
"__COMEDY__ I feel the same way. I wouldn't have watched Anchorman, for example, if it didn't have him in it."
