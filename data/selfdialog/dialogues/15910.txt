"__ROCK__ Dang, rock seems to be dead today!"
"__ROCK__ You are wrong about that."
"__ROCK__ Why do you say that?"
"__ROCK__ I am going to see At The Drive-In today."
"__ROCK__ That band is still around?"
"__ROCK__ Indeed. You should get some tickets."
"__ROCK__ I don't know if I have money. Do they have any new music?"
"__ROCK__ Yes they do. They just made a new album."
"__ROCK__ I think it might be worth checking them out. I loved them back in the day."
"__ROCK__ So did I. The new album is just as good as the old stuff."
