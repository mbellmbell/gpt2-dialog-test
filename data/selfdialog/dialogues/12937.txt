"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for the NFL to start!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Been too long without football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots are going to go back to back!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, I think the Cowboys will take it all this year. The Cheatriots don't stand a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well, the Cowboys let their best corners walk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, the Cowboys let veterans walk, but they aren't the best. Everyone is really high on this new group and they look really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe, but there's no pass rusher."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Between Taco Charlton and Charles Tapper, there's plenty of talent there. We'll see what hapoens and how they gel in training camp."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't think they're that great. The rest of the NFC East has stepped up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The rest of the NFC East has miles to go. This offense is potent and with Prescott and Elliott returning to form, they'll win it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you like in the AFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's the Chiefs. They have a complete team, and Andy Reid is a fantastic coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did't they draft a quarterback this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Patrick Mahomes from Texas Tech. I'm excited to see how he does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does have a good coach to learn from."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and Alex Smith is better than people give him credit for. Mahomes will get his due."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Texans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Texans won't go anywhere without a QB. Right now, their best bet is to see who gets cut in training camp....and pray."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. They messed up with Osweiller. No QB. Hey, I have to go. Talk to you later."
