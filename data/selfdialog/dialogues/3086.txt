"__MUSIC__ Alright, who is your favorite artist or band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ that's easy. Radiohead"
"__MUSIC__ oh, I've heard of them but i don't really know much about them"
"__MUSIC__ Let me guess, you know the song 'Creep'"
"__MUSIC__ yeah, that's about it"
"__MUSIC__ well, let me tell you, there is SO MUCH MORE to Radiohead than Creep. Most fans agree that song is actually a part of their weakest album."
"__MUSIC__ wow really? what is their other music like?"
"__MUSIC__ their other albums are much less pop-rock-ish and are more alternative. they have a wide variety of sounds: experimental, ambient, electronic, orchestral...and more"
"__MUSIC__ hmm I'm pretty interested in that actually, I think I'd like to check them out a bit more! Where do you suggest I start?"
"__MUSIC__ well, how turned away would you be from experimental music that's not like anything you've probably heard before?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm into it. I listen to some weird stuff and I'm sick of the same old pop crap all the time"
"__MUSIC__ Great. I'd start with the album OK Computer. It's widely regarded as one of their best. Then, my favorite, Kid A"
"__MUSIC__ Why's that album your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ It is just so different from anything else. It moves me like few other albums do, and got me through some tough times growing up. Some people find it strange though"
"__MUSIC__ I will definitely check it out! Sounds amazing"
"__MUSIC__ I hope you like it! I know Radiohead is not for everyone, but they hold a very special place in my heart."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome. Wait so how many albums do they have in total?"
"__MUSIC__ Nine LPs; their most recent one (another amazing record) just came out in 2016"
"__MUSIC__ wow I've got a lot of music to check out! I'm so excited. Can you rank the albums in your favorite to least favorite order? That's how I'll listen to them"
"__MUSIC__ Of course - though that's a tough question!. Kid A, OK Computer, In Rainbows, A Moon Shaped Pool, Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief, The Bends, The King of Limbs, Pablo Honey. Enjoy!"
