"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a fan of the New England Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I hate that team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But why? They are such an amazing team. Name one team in recent memory that has been as dominant as they've been."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't care if they win a lot, I still don't like them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it because you don't like Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not just Brady. Belichick and the whole organization are just a bunch of dirty cheats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, you're still on about that Deflate Gate scandal aren't you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that whole team is full of cheats and they all need to be banned from the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You do realize they actually won another Super Bowl after that whole scandal blew over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So? What's that have to do with anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It means that despite what people would like to say, a few under-inflated balls was not the reason the Patriots were so good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it was still an unfair advantage!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the other thing, if a ball was under-inflated during a game, wouldn't both sides get the same advantage since they play with the same ball?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that's technically true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So then how does one side get a huge unfair advantage if they are both throwing the same ball?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, so even if they didn't get some huge advantage or cheat, I still don't like them!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now you are just being stubborn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I just refuse to jump on the Patriots bandwagon along with everyone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What bandwagon? I've been a Patriots fan since they were getting trounce back in the 90s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well maybe you're a true fan, but most people are just jumping on the bandwagon."
