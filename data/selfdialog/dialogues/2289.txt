"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to Taylor Swift lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Um yes, how could you not?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I just had a throwback of her song 'Love Story' last night."
"__MUSIC__ 'Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone..' Ah love those lyrics!"
"__MUSIC__ You know it by heart huh? What's your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ From which album??"
"__MUSIC__ Um...'Fearless?'"
"__MUSIC__ Ah it would have to be 'Fifteen.'  Such a sweet song."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but I think 'You Belong With Me' is much better."
"__MUSIC__ Hm..you have a point there! That song is just so upbeat."
"__MUSIC__ She has so much great songs and is a great writer too."
"__MUSIC__ I know, her album '1989' was always on top of the charts."
"__MUSIC__ It was! I think that was when she really transitioned to pop."
"__MUSIC__ Right, 'Blank Space' was soo pop."
"__MUSIC__ I loved that song.  'Welcome to New York' was a great opener to the album."
"__MUSIC__ I thought so too! She also did great by making a deluxe portion of it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! The polaroids were so hipster."
"__MUSIC__ Just like majority of her songs. Haha!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, do you wanna dance to 'Shake it off' right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's do it!"
