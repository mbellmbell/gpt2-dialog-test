"__MUSIC__ Hey, did you go to DC101's Kerfuffle?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I liked some of the bands playing, but not others."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite band playing?"
"__MUSIC__ Weezer. I love the song 'Say It Ain't So.'"
"__MUSIC__ Me too. It's such a catchy tune."
"__MUSIC__ Plus the song 'Buddy Holly' has a great music video referencing 'Happy Days.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I know! It's so cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so I would've gone to the concert, but Kings of Leon was also headlining."
"__MUSIC__ Who's Kings of Leon?"
"__MUSIC__ They're this rock band from Nashville."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds cool to me."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're cool in theory, but I find their sound annoying."
"__MUSIC__ What makes it annoying?"
"__MUSIC__ The lead vocalist's voice is grating to me."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's crazy. I find the lead vocalist of Dave Matthew's Band to be ge grating too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so you understand."
"__MUSIC__ I totally do. Sounds like I won't check out that band."
"__MUSIC__ No, but a good rock band to check out, if you haven't yet, is Imagine Dragons."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? What kind of music do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ They're an alternative rock band. They're definitely worth a listen."
