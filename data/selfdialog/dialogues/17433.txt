"__MOVIES__ Wow, you went to a kids movie alone?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Nobody wanted to see Zootopia with me so I went by myself!"
"__MOVIES__ Did anyone look at you funny?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I'm a girl.  I think if I were a guy it would be different."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was wonderful!  The lead rabbit was so cute!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard Jason Bateman was in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he played the other lead as a fox."
"__MOVIES__ A fox and a rabbit?  He didn't try to eat her?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  All the animals in the movie try to live in harmony with each other."
"__MOVIES__ How do they do that?"
"__MOVIES__ Basically like humans try to get along with each other.  They have rules and a justice system."
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of funny."
"__MOVIES__ It is.  The story starts with the bunny going to the big city to be a police officer among all these large animals."
"__MOVIES__ And nobody steps on her?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  I guess they are very careful not to step on the little ones."
"__MOVIES__ I'm kind of sorry I didn't see this with you."
"__MOVIES__ You should go!  It's very entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ I'm a guy, I can't go to a kid's movie by myself!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll go with you then."
