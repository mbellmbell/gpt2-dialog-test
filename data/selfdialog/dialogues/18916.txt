"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie 'The Heat'?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, have you seen it?  It is hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have.  I agree that it is a funny movie to watch, as is almost anything with Melissa McCarthy."
"__MOVIES__ What is one of your favorite parts?"
"__MOVIES__ When officer Mullins (McCarthy) goes on a tirade about her boss and his missing balls!"
"__MOVIES__ That is classic, she throws a box of tick tacks at him, and says 'Shove those up your scrotum'"
"__MOVIES__ What is one of your favorite scenes?"
"__MOVIES__ I love when the FBI Agent Sara Ashburn (Bullock) goes to Mullins house with her and they are having a family dinner!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! 'Are you or are you not a Nak'"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sorry what is a Nak?"
"__MOVIES__ Like Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street... Oh a Nark!"
"__MOVIES__ That is classic, but my favorite part is when she says I am special agent... and the lady goes 'Special as in retarded?'"
"__MOVIES__ 'Um, no we do not say that, we say special needs, and no, I have a very high IQ!'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and the 'are you a man or a woman?'"
"__MOVIES__ I remember that, she says i'm all female, and he goes really, from the get go?  Hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ My husband gets annoyed saying that the movie is not at all realistic, I try telling him that it is simply a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I am sure there is not much realistic in the movie, but it is always good for a laugh!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is one of those movies I can watch over and over and still laugh!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I have to rewind some of my favorite scenes sometimes because I am laughing so hard that I start crying!"
