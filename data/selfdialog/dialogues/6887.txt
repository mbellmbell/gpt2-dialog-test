"__STAR_WARS__ Do you prefer the old Star Wars movies or the new ones"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the old ones. I grew up with Luke, Hans and Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ One of my favorite scenes is when Hans cuts open that animal and stuffs Luke into it to keep them alive."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought that was gross."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also thought it was funny when Leia kissed Luke for luck and Hans got all jealous"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but then you find out they are brother and sister"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, what a twist. How about Darth Vader being their father"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know right! How messed up is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ And then later in the series for Han and Leia's son to turn to the dark side"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, and then he kills Han's!! I almost cried!"
