"__SUPERHERO__ What's your least favorite DC movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh that's not hard at all. Green Lantern was terrible."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree with that. The special effects and acting were horrible."
"__SUPERHERO__ I wonder if Ryan Reynolds regrets making that movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ He made it seem like he did in Deadpool. I loved that little nod."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too. Now that was a great movie and a great role for him."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. What's your least favorite DC movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Probably any of the Superman movies. They were super corny to me."
"__SUPERHERO__ They really were. But I did like the latest ones with Henry Cavill as Superman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Okay those I can tolerate, but even though Christopher Reeves was great I don't like the originals at all."
