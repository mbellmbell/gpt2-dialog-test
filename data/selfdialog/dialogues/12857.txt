"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the best team in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The New England Patriots won the last Superbowl, so I think it's fair to say they are the best team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they really the best team though, or did they just have a good run this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well isn't the point of the Superbowl to see who is the best team for each season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but then that doesn't answer my question. I asked you who you think the best team in general is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would still have to say the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will win again next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, maybe not. They definitely have a chance though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All teams have a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team do you think is best, in general?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's between a top few. For example, the Seahawks, Broncos, Steelers and even your favorite, the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you basing this on?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm basing it on who makes it to the Superbowl finals, consistently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought you said the winner of the Superbowl doesn't dictate who's best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The current winner does, but I do think it makes sense to look at who has been doing well over the past few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I do agree that those teams have been consistent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Consistency is key."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seahawks have only won once though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but they've made it to the finals twice in the past 5 years. That's more than many teams have been doing, trust me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you on that one"
