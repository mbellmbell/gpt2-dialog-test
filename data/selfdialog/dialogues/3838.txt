"__MUSIC__ He is long gone off to a better place now, but what do you think of Elvis?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, Elvis is amazing. An iconic rock and movie star even to this day. Of course to many people his memory is hard to let go."
"__MUSIC__ I have a huge collection of Elvis vinyls and still slowly building it."
"__MUSIC__ You do? My father had left me some old Elvis records after he passed. I never thought to let them go so I put them up in storage."
"__MUSIC__ Storage? I have all mine in display in the den in my home. If fact my den is set up as an Elvis mini museum. So much memorabilia."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds nice. Do you have old pictures of him as well?"
"__MUSIC__ I have just about everything. What are some of his songs that you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like his more upbeat songs, like Jailhouse Rock,  Hound dog and of course Blue Suede Shoes."
"__MUSIC__ I'm like minded but it's so hard to chose from one song to the next. He has starred in many classic movies as well."
"__MUSIC__ Which one of those movies are your top favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say my favorite, from the top of my mind, is the movie King Creole."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, isn't that the one where he starred next to Carolyn Jones."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he was a serious crooner in that movie. Who is Carolyn Jones?"
"__MUSIC__ If you remember the original Addams Family shows, well she played as Morticia  Addams."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I remember her in that show. She is a good actress. Carolyn worked well with Elvis. They really set off that movie King Creole."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. But he has starred in many other great movies of the times. Jailhouse rock was a fun movie to watch."
"__MUSIC__ Elvis almost portrayed himself in that movie. A young and upcoming rock star, who would know!"
"__MUSIC__ I think I'm going to pull the Elvis vinyl records I have from storage and donate them you for your museum."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you. It will be to a good cause. Elvis songs need to be shared and never stored away."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. Elvis is the man."
