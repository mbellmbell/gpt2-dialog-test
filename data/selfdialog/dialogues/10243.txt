"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The 90's had some pretty decent mainstream rap..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I LOVED Blacksheep.  Remember their album A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yeah!  That one had U Mean I'm Not and This or That, right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ha ha ha!!  Yes!  U Mean I'm Not was hilarious - parody, satire, I guess it could be classified..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How about someone like Eminem, though?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean, he was mainstream, kind of...but maybe got too hot to handle later on..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ His thing turned into like a soap opera..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, like it wasn't so much about his artwork, but his personal life supposedly got dragged into everything.  Whole tracks were dedicated to family members, etc."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but he sure as all get-out was fascinating to watch and listen to.  Just couldn't help myself."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Neither could I...  Need to see what Eminem's up to now..."
