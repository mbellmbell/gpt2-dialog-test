"__MOVIES__ Hey Betty how are you doing?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm awesome Brad! Was thinking about seeing a film today!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that sounds awesome. Movies are a bit expensive, it'd have to be amazing for me to want to see anything nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking of that new Fast and the Furious movie."
"__MOVIES__ I have been living under a rock, that came out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! And it has the Rock in it!"
"__MOVIES__ Good one haha! I do like the Rock, and the new one has insane special effects."
"__MOVIES__ I think it is showing in IMAX too!"
"__MOVIES__ Does that mean 3-D?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, IMAX is just a huge screen with incredible surround sound."
"__MOVIES__ So it is like stadium seating?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! You want to go?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Most of the original cast, and I think Vin Diesel goes rogue in this one."
"__MOVIES__ It is the 8th film so things needed to change up I think."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, this one seems different and cool."
"__MOVIES__ Ok awesome! Shall we go to Citywalk Theatre in Universal?"
"__MOVIES__ That is the one I wanted to visit!"
"__MOVIES__ Let's go see the noon show!"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds awesome!"
