"__MOVIES__ I think we are due for another Joy Luck Club."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think? It has been a while since there was movie about Asian culture."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I see the moms in that movie and it reminds of me of grandmother and her sisters. You know she had 9 of them."
"__MOVIES__ You're kidding. Big family. And a lot of sisters."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, each sister is just like one of Aunties. One was very much the perfectionist, another very critical, one down on her luck....they all complained about each other as much as they loved each other."
"__MOVIES__ That's just family. Did you have history of your family coming over from China like the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You know we didn't. I'm 4th generation. My grandmother who I loved dearly was torn between cultures just like mothers. They want to adopt American culture but the Chinese part is so rooted in them."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! 4th gen. That's crazy. Do you think the movie depicted Chinese American families accurately?"
"__MOVIES__ They kind of did. I guess. There is a good bit of conflict between generations. The older people just don't know how to make peace with the new world."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. It's probably ingrained in them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is. And Chinese culture is about a lot of guilt. It's hard for them to adjust."
"__MOVIES__ But it seems like food always brings people back together."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, meals are very important. We ate at my grandmother's house every Sunday."
"__MOVIES__ Every Sunday?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, without fail she cooked for her 3 sons, their wives and the 11 grandchildren."
"__MOVIES__ Holy cow! That's a lot of work. Bet you had great food."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, nothing like a Chinese home cooked meal. As the movie can protest. The mom's take a lot of pride in their cooking."
"__MOVIES__ And crafty mah-jong playing according to the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we didn't do that part."
"__MOVIES__ Too bad it looks fun. After seeing the movie I wanted to play!"
