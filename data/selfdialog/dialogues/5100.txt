"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How do you feel about the series going up to 10 movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What are you talking about?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, I'm sorry. The Fast & Furious series."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, that one. I honestly think that's just silly."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought the same. To think the tag line for Furious 7 was 'One last ride.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Right? At this rate, there's going to be 3 extra last rides."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ For number 8, 'Just one more ride.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ For number 9, 'Seriously, this is the last ride.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ For number 10, 'Someone please stop this last ride.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I haven't laughed this hard in years!"
