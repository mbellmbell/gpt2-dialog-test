"__HORROR__ Hey what was you favorite horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ Hands down John Carpenter's The Thing."
"__HORROR__ Really? What is the reason you chose that old film?"
"__HORROR__ It's a classic! It's story is impossible to reliably copy and pull off today."
"__HORROR__ It was just another alien flick?"
"__HORROR__ No, it was an alien that assumed the identity of those it killed. The old film really had you guessing who was who."
"__HORROR__ That's true. I will admit it was and still is a cult classic."
"__HORROR__ Don't you remember they were going to do a remake a few years ago but the director said he didn't want to ruin the film so he did a prequel instead."
"__HORROR__ That was suppose to be a remake? I'm glad it wasn't, because you were able to tell who was killed outright."
"__HORROR__ Exactly, the original never eluded to who was killed and in what order. The film was perfect in my opinion and modern day directors should really take note of that element."
