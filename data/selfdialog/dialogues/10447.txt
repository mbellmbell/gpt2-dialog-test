"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I saw A Tribe Called Quest at FYF this year. They were incredible."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You did? I missed it! Low End Theory is one of my favorite albums."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, they were sick, even though Phife Dawg is gone now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ R.I.P. Phife man. That made me really sad!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Me too. But still, they really killed it. I was dancing my butt off when they dropped Left My Wallet in El Segundo."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's one of my favorites too. I heard Missy Elliott was also really good."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, she was also pretty good. She played a lot of songs from The Cookbook."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ My favorite album by her is Da Real World. So many classics on that one!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You should go next year, I heard De La Soul and the Pharcyde were jealous and wanted to do a back to back set."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Sick man! They should get The Jungle Brothers and A Tribe Called Quest again and really throw an amazing show!"
