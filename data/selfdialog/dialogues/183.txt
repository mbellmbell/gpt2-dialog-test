"__MUSIC__ Guy Sigsworth. And he's worked with a lot of big names. Bjork, even."
"__MUSIC__ They were such a perfect duo. Psychobabble is close to my heart."
"__MUSIC__ How can you choose just one song?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, what if you had to? What would you pick?"

"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you're right. It makes me think about death, but not in a scary way."
"__MUSIC__ She's a genius. She does these blog videos where she shows off her studio. She plays like every instrument."
