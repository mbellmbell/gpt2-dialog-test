"__STAR_WARS__ Is Degoba Yoda's home planet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just wonder where he came from."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Where are the other Yodas?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe he outlived them all...."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha! Well he was 900."
"__STAR_WARS__ Old fella...."
"__STAR_WARS__ I figure he either came from Degoba, or just went there to hide."
"__STAR_WARS__ Awesome hiding spot!"
