"__MOVIES__ What's one of your most favorite movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's easy. Jurassic Park would definitely be up there."
"__MOVIES__ Really? How come?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I used to be an avid reader. I had purchased the book not knowing much about it except that it sounded like it would be good."
"__MOVIES__ I never read the book."
"__MOVIES__ Well the movie blew me away because it was the first time a book made in to a movie lived up to my imagination."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think i get what you mean. How can a movie compete with your imagination."
"__MOVIES__ Your brain paints pictures in your mind of what a place or person would look like and my perception of what the compound looked like was right on point."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I mean the whole movie is mind blowing to watch on a big screen but to feel like someone was inside your head seeing what your imagination came up with was stupifying."
"__MOVIES__ When the special effects kick in in certain places in the movie it does make you feel likes it's pretty real."
"__MOVIES__ Yes the water sitting on the console that shakes as the T-rex approaches is scary."
"__MOVIES__ Is the T-Rex the first dinosaur you see?"
"__MOVIES__ No I don't think so. It was a Brachiosaurus."
"__MOVIES__ That's the one that looks like Dino the dinosaur on the Sinclar gas station sign isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ I do think you are right about that."
"__MOVIES__ Or was Dino a brontosaurus?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know i am not a nerd like you."
"__MOVIES__ You are so funny..."
"__MOVIES__ Oh just go watch all 4 or 5 of the sequels and you can get your dinosaur nerd on!"
