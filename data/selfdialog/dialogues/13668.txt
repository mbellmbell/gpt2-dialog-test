"__BASKETBALL__ Did you watch the Warriors play last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, it was an awesome game!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Even better to see it in person."
"__BASKETBALL__ What?! You were there?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes! Up in the nosebleeds, but the atmosphere was awesome."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's amazing, especially to be there for a playoff game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. I always thought Steph, Klay, and KD were fun to watch on TV, but it is nothing like seeing it in person."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can only imagine. I forgot, how many points did Steph end up with last night? I know he's been in a slump."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well he broke out of that slump last night. He finished with 38."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's right! And Klay had 42, right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, and add in Durant's 34 and you had quite the trifecta."
"__BASKETBALL__ Getting Durant in the off-season was such a good move for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know! I'd take him over Bogut hands down."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I was wishy-washy on him. I miss Barbossa though."
"__BASKETBALL__ He could come in at clutch moments, but I'd still take KD."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, definitely. He really helps pick the team up if Klay and Steph are off."
"__BASKETBALL__ He does. But on an 'off' night you are still getting 28 points, I mean how bad can it be?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Very true! It looks like we may have a Warriors/Cavs rematch this year for the championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hope so! That would be one heck of a series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes! Let's hope the Warriors don't blow it again this year."
