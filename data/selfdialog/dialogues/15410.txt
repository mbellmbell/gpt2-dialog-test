"__HARRY_POTTER__ How do you figure that? He was a amazing!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He mentally tortured Harry and all his friends, for one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But he was just trying to teach him a lesson."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, he hated the kid's dad. He was an adult, jeez."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He also wanted it to look like he hated him, to Voldmort."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sure, in the last couple movies. But, he did not have to be evil to the kid."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He loved Harry's mom."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right, but was all mad she chose another guy. So he took it out on Harry."
