"__ROCK__ Did you see the latest news on Alternative Press?"
"__ROCK__ No I haven't. Is it good news?"
"__ROCK__ Well, not exactly. Do you like Of Mice and Men?"
"__ROCK__ Like them, no. I absolutely LOVE them."
"__ROCK__ Me too. Sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but Austin Carlisle has officially left the band."
"__ROCK__ Oh no! How will this affect the music? Without his voice Of Mice and Men just wont be the same."
"__ROCK__ He has to focus on his health. The doctors warned him that if he continued at the rate he was going with touring and recording that he could end up paralyzed."
"__ROCK__ That would be awful. It sounds like it was a decision that had to be made."
"__ROCK__ Totally. And we know Austin can't completely walk away from the post-hardcore rock music scene."
"__ROCK__ You're right, he's made for it. I'm excited to hear what he does next, and for what Of Mice and Men do next."
