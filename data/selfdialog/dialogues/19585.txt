"__MOVIES__ I need to get some new movies for the kids. I am so sick of watching the same Minions movie over and over."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the Studio Ghibli movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm. I'm not really sure."
"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of My Neighbor Totoro?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I have. I have not seen it, though. Neither have the kids. Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's excellent. It can be a bit hard to find on streaming sites. I find with Studio Ghibli, it's best to just buy the DVDs. They are never on Neflix."
"__MOVIES__ No problem. I like to have buy DVDs anyway."
"__MOVIES__ If you like My Neighbor Totoro, there are other films put out by that studio that you should check out, too. The films are really beautifully animated with excellent storylines. They come out of Japan."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. My kids can't read subtitles, yet."
"__MOVIES__ That's not a problem. You can find them dubbed in English. Just make sure you are buying the dubbed version."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. I am on Amazon. What should I put in my cart? I need some stuff for summer vacation."
"__MOVIES__ My Neighbor Totoro, like I said. Also, Kiki's Delivery Service is really good."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. That looks cute, too."
"__MOVIES__ It's really sweet. It's about a young witch who goes out into the world to come of age. It's really lovely."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. What else? I see one hear called Spirited Away. Is that good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's excellent but it probably won't appeal to very young kids. It has a more complicated storyline. Do your kids get scared easily?"
"__MOVIES__ No. They love Halloween and spooky things. Why? Is it scary?"
"__MOVIES__ It has some scary moments and some pretty creepy villains. Also, it deals with the spirit world, so the kids need to have some sort of understanding of death."
"__MOVIES__ They do. You think it would be okay for age 8 and 9?"
"__MOVIES__ I personally think so. It's a brilliant movie. In our house, it is our all-time favorite animated film. Get Ponyo, too. It's cute!"
