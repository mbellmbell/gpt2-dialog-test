"__MUSIC__ Hey sweetie. You having a good day at work?"
"__MUSIC__ Hey! Not really, but at least I can listen to music, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Music makes everything better. Speaking of music, I heard a song today that made me think of you."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? What was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Blake Shelton's Who Are You When I'm Not Looking."
"__MUSIC__ Oh you are so sweet. I love that song."
"__MUSIC__ Blake Shelton's got such a great voice."
"__MUSIC__ He really does. I love his album that came out last year."
"__MUSIC__ Was that called If I'm Honest?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that was it. It's got some great songs."
"__MUSIC__ Do we have it at the house?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that would be a good birthday present for you, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ I would like that! He's got another one of his top hits too."
"__MUSIC__ Let me see...  Is that Reloaded: 20 Top Hits?"
"__MUSIC__ Something like that. I think my friend let me borrow that once."
"__MUSIC__ Was it good?"
"__MUSIC__ I enjoyed listening to it. Didn't have my favorite song by him on there, Ol' Red."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I forgot about that song. I'm going to go listen to that."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, glad to help! Have fun."
