"__MOVIES__ Hey man, what's up?"
"__MOVIES__ Not too much, what are you up to?"
"__MOVIES__ Just looking at all the new movies coming out, these next few years are going to be awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't really looked, what good ones are coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, to start, Justice League is going to be out this year and it's going to be amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Who's all going to be in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder woman, the guy who played Khal Drogo is playing aquaman, the flash, and a few others."
"__MOVIES__ That does sound awesome.  Anything else?"
"__MOVIES__ Black panther, man, it looks so good."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the trailer for that one, it does look awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it does.  Besides super hero movies, Valerian looks good."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Cara Delevingne?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think it has the most potential besides Marvel or DC movies."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to watch the trailer for it, I don't know too much about it."
"__MOVIES__ Do it. But back to movies coming out, not only is aquaman going to be in Justice League, he's got his own movie coming out in 2018!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's awesome"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah man, so many good ones coming out in 2018, Tomb Raider, a new avengers, a new Deadpool, I'm going to be broke."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, they should have a pass you can buy to go to a new movie every week."
"__MOVIES__ I think they do have something like that actually."
"__MOVIES__ You'll have to get it!"
