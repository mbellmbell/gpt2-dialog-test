"__STAR_WARS__ When I was twelve I was in love with Luke Skywalker. You know, Mark Hamill."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're kidding! I mean, look how old her is now!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ahem....how old am I? Please I'm talking about the year 1977!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, you were in love with Mark (scoff) Hamill. Tell me more about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was so young, and cute, and had heaps of pretty straight blonde hair, a forked chin, dimples, and the bluest eyes ever...."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Harrison Ford? Don't tell me he's chopped liver."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, by no means, but when I was 13, he seemed just a little too mature for me. As I grew up, though...he started looking much more appetizing."
"__STAR_WARS__ So did you ever meet him? What about conventions and stuff?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I never had the gall to go to cons when he was starring,nor did I have the money. I did see him in Penn Station once, when he was directing a Broadway Play, and I was too scared to speak with him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, talk about being star-crossed. Maybe Chewbacca is a little more approachable."
