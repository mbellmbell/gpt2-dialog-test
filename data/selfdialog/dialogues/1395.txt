"__MUSIC__ Are there any songs you've completely memorized?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, I love music, and my favorite songs I listen to over and over."
"__MUSIC__ But I'm talking about perfect memorization, where you could sing it word for word perfectly."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there are a few."
"__MUSIC__ What's one of them."
"__MUSIC__ Well, this is a little embarrassing..."
"__MUSIC__ Aw, don't be shy! I won't laugh."
"__MUSIC__ 'The Humpty Dance', but Humpty Hump and the Electric Underground."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, what??"
"__MUSIC__ You said you wouldn't laugh!"
"__MUSIC__ OK, I couldn't help it. But why do you know all the words to that song, of all songs?"
"__MUSIC__ It's my go-to Karaoke song."
"__MUSIC__ Why would you pick that one?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's got goofy, funny lyrics, so people have fun listening to me sing it."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense, actually."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I have a terrible voice, so no one wants to listen to me sing some normally beautiful song badly."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, choosing music where you don't actually have to be good at singing is a smart strategy."
"__MUSIC__ It's worked well for me over the years."
"__MUSIC__ And it explains why you know all the words to the Humpty Dance!"
"__MUSIC__ Precisely. Maybe I'll sing it for you sometime."
