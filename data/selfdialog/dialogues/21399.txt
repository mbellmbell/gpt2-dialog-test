"__THRILLER__ What are your thoughts on the revenant movie?"
"__THRILLER__ Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor but this role was overrated."
"__THRILLER__ What? This is the role he finally won an oscar with."
"__THRILLER__ That is exactly my point. I think he deserved an oscar for multiple other roles outside of this one."
"__THRILLER__ I thought Leonardo DiCaprio's oscar was well deserved for this role."
"__THRILLER__ I think he deserved an oscar.. in general. But I THINK THE ACADEMY JUST HAD TO GIVE HIM ONE AT THIS POINT AND OTHER ROLES WERE MORE DESERVING."
"__THRILLER__ I for one am just glad he finally got an oscar for anything. it had been a long time coming."
"__THRILLER__ I do agree with you there. He had given so many worthy performances."
"__THRILLER__ Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the greatest living actors ever."
"__THRILLER__ I would even argue for all time.He is really up there for me. I think many more oscars are in his future or at least performances worthy of an oscar."
