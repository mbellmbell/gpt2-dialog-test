"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favourite aspect of the Star Wars franchise?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say the special effects."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Considering how bad they were back then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah they were bad but there's something homey about movies from that time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, for me it's kind of distracting. I like a more streamlined look."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's something to be said for the improvement in special effects, but I like the fact that back then you had to settle for something obviously bad, that people couldn't have every snazzy thing they wanted."
"__STAR_WARS__ You actually like not being satisfied?"
"__STAR_WARS__ On the contrary, I'm completely satisfied with them. The difference was you had less available to be satisfied with and you just had to be content with it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think I understand that."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's just my two cents anyway."
