"__MUSIC__ Are you into the band Queens of the Stone Age."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, they've got some really awesome songs. What's your favorite album of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough call! I would probably have to go with Songs for the Deaf personally. How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Songs for the Deaf was great and it definitely put them on the map. I think my favorite is their latest one though, Like Clockwork."
"__MUSIC__ I loved that album too. I hear that they'll be releasing new music soon which I'm really excited about."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that, I'll have to keep an eye out for that!"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever seen then perform live?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't unfortunately, have you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, several times in fact, you definitely should catch them if they're in town, their live act is incredible."
"__MUSIC__ I will definitely do that! Have you been to any other concerts lately?"
"__MUSIC__ The last one I went to was a Mark Lanegan concert. I even got to meet him after the show."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa, lucky! He works with Queens of the Stone Age a lot too, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, he's been on every album of theirs except the first I think. His voice is out of this world."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, definitely one of the best singers around. He kind of has a Tom Waits vibe about him at times with that gravelly voice."
"__MUSIC__ Tom Waits is another legend for sure. I can understand the comparison between the two."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're both hugely talented, one of a kind vocalists. I'm really hoping to see Tom Waits on tour too."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't had the pleasure myself, but that would be epic."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Tom Waits album?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Rain Dogs, it's such a classic."
"__MUSIC__ Swordfishtrombones for me, but I totally agree about Rain Dogs."
