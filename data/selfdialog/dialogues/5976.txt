"__STAR_WARS__ What are your thoughts on Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ewan McGregor? He's a good actor but he's no Alec Guiness."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love Alec Guiness!  Have you seen him in The Detective, as Father Brown?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes!  That's a great film.  I agree, he's great at Obi-Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think McGregor did a bad job, though.  He is a really good actor."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, he didn't add the element of humor that Alec Guiness does."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know what you mean. Like in a New Hope when he says, Obi-Wan isn't dead because I am Obi-Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have a theory that Rey is his grand daughter."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be a lot better than the predictable answer of her being Luke or Leia's child."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the Skywalkers do like to abandon their children, so who knows!"
