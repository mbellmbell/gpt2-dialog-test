"__STAR_WARS__ Who is better, Rey or Finn?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Finn is much more entertaining. He's funny."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Rey seems like she's the main character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe that's the problem with her. She does everything too perfectly."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She flies the Millenium Falcon better than Han Solo does!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really. She only repaired something Han didn't know about."
"__STAR_WARS__ Repairing the Millenium Falcon is something Han Solo should be the expert in."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han hadn't seen the ship in years, though. It was stolen from him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess they wanted us to know Rey is an expert pilot."
