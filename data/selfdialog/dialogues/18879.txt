"__MOVIES__ What do you think about Ben Affleck as Batman in 'Batman v Superman?'"
"__MOVIES__ I thought he was phenomenal.  My favorite Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  I think he's good, but my favorite is Michael Keaton."
"__MOVIES__ Keaton was great too."
"__MOVIES__ He was.  It was also the first movie that really set the darker tone for Batman that we have today."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about 'Batman v Superman' as a whole?"
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, besides the Batman scenes, the rest of the movie wasn't really that good."
"__MOVIES__ It was a huge disappointment.  I had looked forward to it for so long."
"__MOVIES__ Yea.  The script was awful and pacing was poor."
"__MOVIES__ They also tried to fit too much into one movie."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it.  They had to introduce us to Batman in this film universe, show us Superman, and also introduce the Justice League all at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ There just simply wasn't enough time for all of it."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention that the actual Batman vs. Superman fight scene was a fraction of the movie's run-time."
"__MOVIES__ Though it was a really cool action sequence."
"__MOVIES__ I will give props to Zack Snyder though for the excellent visuals of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's one thing no critic can take away from Snyder.  The man really knows how to make things look good for the camera."
"__MOVIES__ I have high hopes for the new 'Justice League' movie."
"__MOVIES__ Same.  I think 'Batman v Superman' might have been weak, but at least set foundations for a Justice League movie to work."
"__MOVIES__ The good thing is that the cast is great."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget that 'Justice League' will have Joss Whedon fixing up elements of the script.  And we both know the man knows how to improve a script."
