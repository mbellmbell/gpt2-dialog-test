"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite movie with Burt Reynolds?"
"__MOVIES__ Take a guess what my favorite movie with him is."
"__MOVIES__ Is it Smokey and the Bandit?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes of course it is!"
"__MOVIES__ That is my favorite with Burt Reynolds as well."
"__MOVIES__ It is just such a suspenseful movie. They are being chased by police almost the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ I agree that there is never a boring moment in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Sally Field is also great in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ She and Burt make a great pair as they evade police."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I enjoyed when she took over the wheel that part was funny."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like Smokey and the Bandit 2 or 3?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the second one and sort of liked the third one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they were definitely not bad movies."
"__MOVIES__ I just don't think they were absolutely necessary. The first movie had a great ending."
"__MOVIES__ I know it was strange how the ending of the first movie is so happy then the beginning of the second one is depressing."
"__MOVIES__ I read that they tried to hard to make the second movie reflect the real world."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Burt and Sally broke up in real life so they couldn't be close in the second movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think this was unfair to the fans of Smokey and The Bandit!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree we didn't need the movie to reflect real life! Movies are supposed to be an escape from the real world."
"__MOVIES__ At least we will always have Smokey and the Bandit 1 and it will always be great."
