"__BASEBALL__ What is the deal with the Pirates this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Their owner is cheap and won't spend money to win"
"__BASEBALL__ But they had such a promising core"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they didn't put the best pieces around them"
"__BASEBALL__ The pitching staff has been solid though"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it was supposed to be the weak point"
"__BASEBALL__ Can they build off of that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not really, because the offense is so bad"
"__BASEBALL__ Right, but you couldn't see the Marte situation coming"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but you should have had a better backup plan than John Jaso"
"__BASEBALL__ No team could survive a loss like Marte though."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure they could. Teams that commit to winning can survive"
"__BASEBALL__ What happens to Cutch?"
"__BASEBALL__ He'll be gone in July"
"__BASEBALL__ You think? He's the face of the franchise"
"__BASEBALL__ Not any more. They'll deal him for a bucket of balls"
"__BASEBALL__ What's next?"
"__BASEBALL__ They'll blow up the team and sell the future to fans"
"__BASEBALL__ Haven't we been down this road before?"
"__BASEBALL__ Over and over again."
