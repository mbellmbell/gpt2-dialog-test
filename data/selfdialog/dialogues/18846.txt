"__MOVIES__ You have to go see La La Land."

"__MOVIES__ Ha ha. You liked it that much."
"__MOVIES__ Its like a musical genre unto itself.  It amazes me frankly."

"__MOVIES__ The music is what stands out to me best.  Really top notch."
"__MOVIES__ What songs did you like?"
"__MOVIES__ That little opening number on the crowded freeway.  Plus the theme song."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know Ryan Gosling was a singer?"

"__MOVIES__ Ryan did his own stunts - dancing and piano."
"__MOVIES__ Funny.  Emma Stone's a dancer?"
"__MOVIES__ Well she danced in the film."
