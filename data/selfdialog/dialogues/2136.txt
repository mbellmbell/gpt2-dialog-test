"__MUSIC__ Is there any genre of music you simply don't understand?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, actually. Postmodern music."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not familiar with the genre."
"__MUSIC__ It's stuff like John Cage."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of him, but I'm not familiar with his work."
"__MUSIC__ It's like music, but also not like music."
"__MUSIC__ That statement doesn't really make sense!"
"__MUSIC__ Much like the music!"
"__MUSIC__ Can you explain further?"
"__MUSIC__ OK, let me explain one of his compositions."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, that works."
"__MUSIC__ Musicians are present, but don't play any music. That's it!"
"__MUSIC__ Huh?"
"__MUSIC__ That's right. Four minutes and 33 seconds of silence."
"__MUSIC__ I... don't quite get it."
"__MUSIC__ The idea is supposed to be that the audience hears all the other noises in the room."
"__MUSIC__ That happens all the time. That's not music."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I say. But some people think Post Modern Music is brilliant."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'm with you. Seems like the Emperor has no clothes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the one style of music I am baffled by."
