"__THRILLER__ What was the best gun battle you've seen in a movie?"
"__THRILLER__ Has to be Heat when they were on the streets of LA."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, that was just fantastic."
"__THRILLER__ I remember the sound the most.  The bullets just echo off the street and buildings."
"__THRILLER__ That was a great movie throughout.  I liked the ending too."
"__THRILLER__ You mean at the airport?"
"__THRILLER__ Right, the cat and mouse games and how he sees his shadow at the end."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, very tense."
"__THRILLER__ I wish Pacino and Deniro would make another movie."
"__THRILLER__ Hopefully someday, but not banking on it."
