"__MUSIC__ What genre do you think deserves more love than it gets?"
"__MUSIC__ British post-punk for sure."
"__MUSIC__ I know what punk is, what is post-punk?"
"__MUSIC__ Post-punk took the attitude and ethos of punk and ditched the simplistic aesthetic."
"__MUSIC__ That kind of makes sense. So like the Sex Pistols wrote a loud, power chord-y punk album, and then John Lydon formed Public Image Ltd which keeps some of the attitude, but is way different."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Public Image Ltd is super moody. A band can only make so many true punk albums before they're just writing the same song."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I agree with that, I mean look at The Descendents."
"__MUSIC__ Well, we're gonna disagree about that."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so who are some post-punk bands?"
"__MUSIC__ You've for sure heard of some, Public Image Ltd, New Order and Joy Division, but you might also know, The Slits, This Heat, The Chameleons, and Gang of Four."
"__MUSIC__ So what's distinctive about British post-punk?"
"__MUSIC__ American post-punk has a lot in common with college rock, think Mission of Burma. They're more jangly and tend to be less moody."
"__MUSIC__ Which of these bands do you think was having the most fun?"
"__MUSIC__ Out of the British post-punk bands? For sure The Slits, they're a girls group and they're having a great time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, it has the snotty punk attitude, disaffected vocals, and it's joyous."
"__MUSIC__ They totally sound like they're having a ton of fun. I love it."
"__MUSIC__ They do a great cover of 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine.'"
"__MUSIC__ It might be sacrilegious to say this, but that's my favorite track."
"__MUSIC__ Slightly sacrilegious, but it's a great track. Their fingerprints are all over modern post-punk too, listen to the keys on typical girls, that's totally LCD Soundsystem."
"__MUSIC__ Right? I can so hear that, more people need to listen to The Slits."
