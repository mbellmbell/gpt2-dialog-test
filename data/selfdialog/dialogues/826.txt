"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard the new Eminem song, 'I Miss You'?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what's it like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's in the same direction as his newer stuff, and Dre produced the beat."
"__MUSIC__ Wow cool, I generally prefer his older stuff but I'll check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too, what's your farovite album?"
"__MUSIC__ I personally like the Marshall mathers LP."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool, I like the Slim Shady LP."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good one too, have you been to one of his concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, at the last one I went to some girl threw a beer bottle on stage."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah crazy stuff like that happens all the time at his concerts."
"__MUSIC__ That's why I'd much rather go to a Snoop Dogg concert, less violence."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I really think Eminems lyrics can promote violence at his concerts."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder why that is. Do you buy any merch while your there?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah because they really don't get much money from their record companies, so I like to buy their merchandise from the stands."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I picked up a sick shirt last time."
"__MUSIC__ Nice, I have a whole collections of ones I picked up from rap concertts."
"__MUSIC__ Do you go to any different types of concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I also go to electronic, such as Daft Punk."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I saw them last year with Skrillex, I think Skrillex did better."
"__MUSIC__ Well Skrillex is good too yeah."
