"__MOVIES__ Spider-Man: Homecoming is coming out soon. It looks good."
"__MOVIES__ It looks more like Iron Man: Featuring Spider-Man if you ask me."
"__MOVIES__ They do want to really push the fact that Spider-Man is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now."
"__MOVIES__ Yet he still belongs to Sony, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but they have a deal so they can share the character."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that Sony is making a Venom spin-off film, and it will be canon to Homecoming, but it won't be canon to the rest of the MCU films?"
"__MOVIES__ They have wanted to make a Venom movie for a long time. I don't know how that'll work though."
"__MOVIES__ I think it'll be like, things that happen in Homecoming effect Venom, but things that happen in Venom just won't impact Thor or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ This is what happens when a company sells off their IPs then tries to get them back. We get messes like this."
"__MOVIES__ They have the same issue with Fox and The Fantastic Four and X-Men. Except they can't use those characters at all."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that, I think they made some sort of deal with them to get that X-Men TV show Legion made."
"__MOVIES__ So Marvel can use the X-Men now?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think it's anything like that, but they have some sort of smaller deal."
"__MOVIES__ That might be for the best. The X-Men movies have been going for 17 years now, so it would be hard to cram them into the Marvel universe."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, it's crazy to think it's been that long since the first one."
"__MOVIES__ And even crazier to think that the series is more popular than ever thanks to movies like Logan and Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ You gotta hand it to Fox, I guess. They may not know what to do with The Fantastic Four, but they're doing something right with X-Men."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely, but I'm a bit sad we'll never get to see Hugh Jackman interacting with Robert Downey Jr. or any other Avenger."
"__MOVIES__ At least we got Logan though. That was the perfect sendoff for him and Patrick Stewart."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it really was."
