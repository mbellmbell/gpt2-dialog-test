"__THRILLER__ I just finished watching a really good thriller by Hitchcock!"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, what was it, and who were the actors?"
"__THRILLER__ It's called 'Rear Window', and it stars Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr! I was literally 'spellbound' by this one!"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, stop with the Hitchcock puns! Should I watch it? I do so love Jimmy Stewart."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, the plot is pretty thick on this one. Jimmy Stewart is a retired photographer who has broken his leg, and is stuck in his apartment."
"__THRILLER__ What? It all takes place in one location?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, but he can see out of his window into the courtyard of his apartment complex. He thinks he sees the guy across the way killing and disposing of his invalid wife!"
"__THRILLER__ So how do Grace Kelly come into this? I mean sure, she's beautiful to look at..."
"__THRILLER__ She helps Jimmy Stewart's character outwit Raymond Burr's villian by sneaking into his apartment and spying on him. It's really suspenseful when she get trapped in Burr's apartment and he come home to find her there!"
"__THRILLER__ Well, anything that has Princess Grace in it is something I'd be glad to take a look at. And Hitchcock, well, say no more!"
