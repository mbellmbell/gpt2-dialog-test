"__MUSIC__ Do you know the song Sweet Dreams?"
"__MUSIC__ The song by the Eurythmics?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so you know it?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, it was a popular song."
"__MUSIC__ Did you rather their version or Marilyn Manson's remake?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, I liked Marilyn Manson's version better."
"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of Marilyn Manson?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, but his version would just better."
"__MUSIC__ So, you don't like the original version?"
"__MUSIC__ The original has too much of that 80s sound."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you don't like all the electronic sound."
"__MUSIC__ No, that's probably it.  I like that Marilyn Manson's version is just a little harder."
"__MUSIC__ Are you into hard rock?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but this song isn't all that hard.  It's just hard enough for me."
"__MUSIC__ Are there any other Marilyn Manson songs that you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the one about the drugs."
"__MUSIC__ That really doesn't narrow it down."
"__MUSIC__ It says 'I don't like the drugs, the drugs like me.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and I like the Dope Show too."
