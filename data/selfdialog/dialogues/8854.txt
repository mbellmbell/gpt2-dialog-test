"__BEATLES__ What was the song 'Hey Jude' about?"
"__BEATLES__ That's actually a very interesting story.  There is the actual reason, but many other interpretations."
"__BEATLES__ Can you elaborate for me?"
"__BEATLES__ So it was originally written by Paul McCartney, directed at John Lennon's ex-wife and son."
"__BEATLES__ Why did he write a song for Lennon's wife?"
"__BEATLES__ He did it to console and comfort her and John's son after John had his affair with Yoko Ono."
"__BEATLES__ Oh that's very nice of him."
"__BEATLES__ It really was.  Though due to the nature of some of the lyrics, John thought the song was for him, while others thought it was about Paul."
"__BEATLES__ That is fascinating.  I guess that's the beauty of music, and the many interpretations it can have."
"__BEATLES__ You're right.  And in this instance, it led to the creation of one of the Beatles' best songs."
