"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pick a dark horse NFL championship matchup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ooooh, fun. The crappy teams making it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, the better-than-expected teams that are going to come through out of nowhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean only making it because of Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers getting injured?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And don't say the Browns to be a troll."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dang! How'd you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're predictable. Go ahead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I choose the Bills and Bengals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Try again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Excuse me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're in the same conference, so they wouldn't be in the championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You said championship, not Super Bowl. I'm assuming the AFC championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fine, why those two?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both have been somewhat solid teams the last few years but fell short."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have such a bad history the last 25 years, though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right? They're due. Bengals haven't won a playoff game since 91, I think, and the Bills haven't been to the title game since their 4-peat of being losers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going for the Colts and Eagles in the SUPER BOWL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eagles have no chance! They're irrelevant."
