"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You stoked to see how the Cowboys will do this year without Romo?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think Prescott will be an amazing addition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he doesn't choke like Romo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he had a knack for that. I mean when he was on, he was on, but he would kill it so fast you didn't realize what the hell happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think they have a chance at the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, with a new quarterback, and the defense line from last year I definitely see them having a shot. I'd really like to see the Cowboys and Panthers in a superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, frankly I'm just tired of seeing the Patriots get in, in spite of all the cheating scandals. I love Cam Newton so I'd love to see the Panthers get in there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think it's time for Tom Cheating Brady to hang it up. How many balls can you deflate before you find a different career?!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right?! I think Cam Newton deserves a superbowl win, even though Dallas is my number one team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does for sure. If the Panthers could ever get past the crappy ref calls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know it's ridiculous. I've watched too many Panthers games won by the refs, not the other team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like as much gripe as people make about it the NFL would have a better system to ensure fair games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it looks like the Patriots are 'set to win' the super bowl again this year, per predictions right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the refs on their team and deflated balls, why not!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the cowboys are predicted second in line, so maybe they can blow those predictions to pieces this year. Not really lining up great for the Panthers though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I saw that Cowboys were number 2, and Panthers didn't even make the top 10!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well we know stats are everything, just look at the Panthers having an almost perfect season, then blowing it at the Superbowl. Maybe the Boys will pull through this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They seem to have a better chance than my poor cardiac cats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha! True. Well maybe we can make a gentleman's bet on the cheatriots and the cowboys this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're on! Lets make a Superbowl pool at work and win some money!"
