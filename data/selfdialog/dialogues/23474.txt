"__DISNEY__ My favorite Disney sidekick is definitely Mushu."
"__DISNEY__ He's okay, but not the best."
"__DISNEY__ So who do you prefer?"
"__DISNEY__ Timon and Pumba!"
"__DISNEY__ Wait, why?"
"__DISNEY__ Hakuna Matata is a good song and a great life philosophy."
"__DISNEY__ Not a bad point. Mushu can breathe fire though!"
"__DISNEY__ Ok, hardly. I prefer the horse from Mulan, honestly."
"__DISNEY__ Haha you're right, that horse is great."
"__DISNEY__ Way better than Mushu."
