"__HORROR__ Did you think Hellraiser was a good film?"
"__HORROR__ Yes and no."
"__HORROR__ Whys that?"
"__HORROR__ I like films with killers that could be legitimate."
"__HORROR__ So you think the main actor was too fictitious?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah and that made the movie seem out of touch"
"__HORROR__ Well all horror films are mostly out of touch so to speak."
"__HORROR__ They are but this was fake-ish in my mind."
"__HORROR__ I agree that you could say that but its what the genre is about"
"__HORROR__ The guy almost looked like he was a robot in most of the film."
