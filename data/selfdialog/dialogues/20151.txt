"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Jungle Book movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The live action one, you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the new one that came out recently."
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't watched it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it yesterday. It was really cool!"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, I was deliberately avoiding it."
"__MOVIES__ Why would you do that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the original Disney Jungle Book animated movie was one of my childhood favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Mine too! But that made me want to see it more."
"__MOVIES__ It works the opposite for me. It make me worried that the new one could never live up to the original."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I see where you're coming from."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it just seemed like if it can't live up to the first one, I'm just going to be disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think you would be, though. The visual effects were stunning."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but give me the good old animation, and I'll be happy."
"__MOVIES__ You can't imagine how cool and dynamic all the animals were."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure that's the case, but it still wouldn't be the same."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I can't really convince you that you're wrong, but I think you're making a mistake not seeing it."
"__MOVIES__ Possibly, but I'll survive!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, I guess so. Just in a slightly less Jungly world."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll go watch the original movie again!"
