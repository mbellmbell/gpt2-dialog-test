"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favourite Disney movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably the animate Beauty & the Beast. I loved that one!"
"__MOVIES__ That was a great movie. I think Moana has become my favourite though."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Moana."
"__MOVIES__ The animated tattoos on Maui were hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ They were. And Dwayne Johnson did such a great job voicing that character."
"__MOVIES__ I was thrilled when they announced that casting, he is so great."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear how they cast the voice for Moana?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't."
"__MOVIES__ They did a search for a unknown native pacific young woman to do the voice."
"__MOVIES__ That's amazing. I love when big studios try to do good things."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I mean it's Disney. They could have cast Selena Gomez and called it a day."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Also wasn't Lin Manuel-Miranda involved with Moana?"
"__MOVIES__ He was, he worked on the music!"
"__MOVIES__ He is such a talent, I love everything he does."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. Moana was just a fun movie all around with a great powerful girl character."
"__MOVIES__ And great music."
"__MOVIES__ Really great music. I don't think I have anything bad to say about that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know they are making a lot of live action remakes, but I just really enjoy their animated movies."
"__MOVIES__ I doubt Disney will ever stop making animated movies, don't worry."
