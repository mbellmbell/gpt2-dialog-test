"__MUSIC__ All these main stream artists are jumping on the dance music movement and sampling tracks from the underground scene. Have you noticed?"
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Kanye sampled M.A.W. on his Pablo album."
"__MUSIC__ Really I haven't heard it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and just recently Katy Perry sampled an old school classic from Roland Clark."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ They used 'I get deeper' it sounds cool but you know how the scene gets about going mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ Has there been any response from Roland about his vocals being sampled?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard anything but I know he was supporting the track on social media."
"__MUSIC__ That vocal is iconic in the scene. Hopefully Roland gets the credit he deserves for his work."
"__MUSIC__ Dance music is so trendy now. It is the reincarnation of disco."
"__MUSIC__ Dance comes from disco right? I love disco I don't know why it went out of style."
"__MUSIC__ Disco was killed because of the culture and lifestyle that came with the music and that is why mainstream and the general population wanted it to end. Disco thrived in the underground and represented a world that was not safe to live among the general cookie cutter population."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, dance music as we know it today is the descendant of disco. Some would say it comes from Chicago house music when the Godfather of House Frankie Knuckles turned it all on it's head."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I've heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ Yes Frankie Knuckles was a major influencer and New York natives talk about Larry Levan and what is known as Garage music. All these sounds stem from the underground and are great influencers of what we now call dance music."
"__MUSIC__ Who else sampled underground tracks?"
"__MUSIC__ Well Drake ruined a beautiful track by Black Coffee he not only sampled it but put another woman's vocals on it that sounds awful."
"__MUSIC__ Haha that sounds about accurate. When mainstream gets it's hands on underground art they ruin it."
