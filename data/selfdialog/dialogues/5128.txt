"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hey man what was your favorite Fast & Furious and why?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'd have to say it was Fast 5."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really? How come?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I liked the introduction of Dwayne Johnson's character. It really felt like he was a threat to the group."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah his character was pretty aweosme. He did a great job on it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ In addition to that I really liked they way they paid respects to Paul Walker and his character. It was a real tear jerker in the theaters."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah. I agree. It wasn't my favorite of the series but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't good."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What was your favorite?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'd say Fast 7 was mine because of Jason Statham's character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Nice choice."
