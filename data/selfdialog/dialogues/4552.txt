"__MUSIC__ Were you ever a fan of The Cult?"
"__MUSIC__ You kidding me? Their music is awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, Ian Astbury is definitely one of my all time favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love British bands that have a hard rocking American bluesy sound to their music."
"__MUSIC__ You know the song The Boys are Back in Town by Thin Lizzy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah dude, classic song. Makes you want to go hit the town and drink a few beers."
"__MUSIC__ They're a bunch of Irish dudes. Thin Lizzy's an Irish band."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome, it's like the most iconic American sounding blues rock song, an Irish tribute to America I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately, the lead singer went out Jimi Hendrix style. It sucks."
"__MUSIC__ Hendrix's death was such a tragedy. He's the best guitarist of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Why did all the best rock bands of the '70's have to end with some type of tragic demise?"
"__MUSIC__ Not all of them went out like that, but you're right, a bunch of those dudes went out way too early."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say the most tragic was Lynyrd Skynyrd. Plane crash and I don't think anyone made it out alive."
"__MUSIC__ Just like Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens back in the day. Those guys were fantastic musicians."
"__MUSIC__ Ian Astbury and The Cult are still rocking today thank goodness."
"__MUSIC__ She Sells Sanctuary is easily one of my top five favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ That and Fire Woman kick butt. I never get tired of those songs."
"__MUSIC__ How long have they been playing together anyway?"
"__MUSIC__ At least since the early '80's off an on. I know they have had their fair share of breakups and reunions."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's pretty darn cool how good music really lasts the test of time."
