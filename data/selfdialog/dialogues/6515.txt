"__STAR_WARS__ What's your opinion on the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, well, overall I really enjoyed all the ones I've seen and would definitely rewatch them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which ones are those?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first trilogy that came out plus The Force Awakens. There was something that bothered me in them though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it seemed like every time a light saber was used it would affect the victim differently. One time it would cut right through somebody, then it would be propelling them back, then it would be making them simply disappear."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not the most realistic of movie series', I admit."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I know, I just like consistency. Like, I don't care if something is wild and fantastical and doesn't make sense, as long as it doesn't make sense in a consistent way, know what I mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I feel you. I had my own issues with the inconsistencies myself."
"__STAR_WARS__ You'll have to tell me about them sometime."
