"__STAR_WARS__ I just watched the original trilogy again and I'm not sure how I feel about return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?  That had a great story about the redemption of Vader, and Luke finally becoming a full Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was amazing, as were the effects as always.  But those Ewoks man."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hear you, they were the low point of the movie.  But they were pretty awesome in that big battle."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess you're right.  Plus kids love them too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and how about when Luke and Leah revealed they really are siblings?"
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure, and Leah has force powers that Luke is someday going to teach her."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd like to see that, see how strong she is next to her twin brother."
"__STAR_WARS__ They should be equals."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, that would be a great movie.  Maybe for Episode 8."
