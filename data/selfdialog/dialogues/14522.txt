"__HORROR__ Have you seen the horror movie Uzumaki?"
"__HORROR__ What is that? Is it really scary?"
"__HORROR__ Uzumaki is by a Japanese manga artist I believe. His stories are truly horrifying... I mean campy."
"__HORROR__ Campy like Scary Movie or campy like, you're lying to me!"
"__HORROR__ Campy like... well you'll have to see it. This isn't like Scary Movie but it isn't that horrifying."
"__HORROR__ I feel like you're lying to me since you made me watch Human Centipede!"
"__HORROR__ Okay, it is kind of more like Human Centipede where it's bad campy but your brain might fill in the gaps."
"__HORROR__ Ew! I still hate you for that!"
"__HORROR__ But it's not entirely like Human Centipede and less disgusting."
"__HORROR__ I don't believe you and I'm not watching anymore horror movies with you!"
