"__MUSIC__ Ghibli movies always have the best soundtracks."
"__MUSIC__ I know. The one from Totoro gets stuck in my head all the time."
"__MUSIC__ I read recently that it's just one guy, Joe Hisaishi, who does the soundtracks for most of them."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Does he have any other music?"
"__MUSIC__ It seems like he's done a few other things. Lots of movies."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't surprise me."
"__MUSIC__ His songs have a way of really transporting you to a place that feels far away and fantastical."
"__MUSIC__ It's so great when a movie can actually do that. The music is very important."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I found a group called Grand Gallery Japan that was covering some of his songs, and I got interested in them too."
"__MUSIC__ What did they change?"
"__MUSIC__ It was all piano and strings. I think they put it in a minor key too, to make it sound sadder."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think they would do that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the album was called 'Melancholy Piano and Strings,' so I'm guessing that had something to do with it."
"__MUSIC__ Was there anything else good on the album?"
"__MUSIC__ A few songs! It introduced me to a few artists I like now."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's DJ Okawari, who also makes very place-based ambient songs."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds interesting."
"__MUSIC__ There are lyrics though."
"__MUSIC__ Lend me the album sometime!"
