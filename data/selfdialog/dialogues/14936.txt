"__ACTION__ What's the best action movie ever made?"
"__ACTION__ Die hard without a doubt."
"__ACTION__ Why die hard? I mean I enjoy it, but best of all time?"
"__ACTION__ John McClane is such a great action character and Bruce Willis is great in the role."
"__ACTION__ I'll give you that, but better than some of Jackie Chan's early stuff? Better than The Terminator?"
"__ACTION__ It's absolutely better than both, don't get me wrong I love Arnold's classic Terminator role as much as the next guy."
"__ACTION__ I would take any of The Terminator films over any of The Die Hard Films."
"__ACTION__ Even the one that didn't include Arnold Schwarzenegger in the cast at all?"
"__ACTION__ Absolutely, Die Hard just never really did it for me in a major way."
"__ACTION__ You're missing out, John McClane would totally terminate the Terminator"
