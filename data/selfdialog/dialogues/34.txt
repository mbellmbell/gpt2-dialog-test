"__MUSIC__ Who do you prefer: Katy Perry or Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift definitely. I found 1989 to be the best pop album of the past five years."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I found singles like Shake it Off and Out of the Woods to be very cliche and vapid."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't go that far, but I would say that I'd rather focus on the album's better songs, such as Blank Space, Style, and Wildest Dreams."
"__MUSIC__ I would agree that Blank Space was the album's best song, but Style and Wildest Dreams are mediocre at best."
"__MUSIC__ Really, please give me two songs that Katy Perry has released that compare to Style and Wildest Dreams in terms of quality."
"__MUSIC__ Easy, Teenage Dream and Thinking of You."
"__MUSIC__ I will concede that Teenage Dream is superior to both songs, but not to Blank Space. Also, Thinking of You was such a minor song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it is her best ballad. It is so much better than songs like Firework or Roar."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't it interesting that you had to go back over five years to choose two songs that are better than two more recent Taylor Swift songs?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not my fault that Katy Perry hasn't released a great album since 2010. However, Witness is fun at least."
"__MUSIC__ I just find the lyrics to her songs to be either too vapid or frankly too vulgar."
"__MUSIC__ When you say too vulgar, are you referring to Bon App√©tit?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. I find the music video where they are making Katy Perry to appear as food very weird and kind of gross."
"__MUSIC__ I think that it's weird, but clever. Also, I enjoy the verse that Migos does a lot."
"__MUSIC__ I can't understand those guys at all."
"__MUSIC__ While they are difficult to understand, their unique sound is so interesting and fun to hear."
"__MUSIC__ That might be the difference between us. I tend to prefer strong lyrics in a song, which could explain why I prefer Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, but from that respect, all of her songs lyrics are about ex-boyfriends. Doesn't that get repetitive?"
"__MUSIC__ Well my favorite songs of hers are the songs about successful relationships, like Love Story and Mine."
