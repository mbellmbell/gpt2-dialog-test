"__BASEBALL__ Wow, he's so good."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they are gonna make the playoffs this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I hope, it just depends on if they play consistently."

"__BASEBALL__ That would have been amazing to see them win it."
"__BASEBALL__ It might happen we've got enough good players."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right. With cabrera at the plate anything is possible."
