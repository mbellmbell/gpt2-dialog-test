"__MUSIC__ Do you consider Weird Al Yankovic to be music?"
"__MUSIC__ Somewhat yes but also somewhat no."
"__MUSIC__ I agree I am not sure it is fair to call what he does music."
"__MUSIC__ He basically just takes good songs and writes parody lyrics. His original songs are mostly silly."
"__MUSIC__ That isn't how music should be made."
"__MUSIC__ Call him a parody artist or a joker. I can't call him a musician."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly Weird Al isn't really the first choice at weddings or even birthday parties."
"__MUSIC__ The other thing is his lyrics are often crass and sophmoric."
"__MUSIC__ I know he is just trying to get cheap laughs from little kids who still find swear words to be funny."
"__MUSIC__ He isn't all bad but I definitely don't think it's fair to compare him to the artists he makes fun of."
"__MUSIC__ Some of his parodies were good don't get me wrong such as White & Nerdy and Canadian Idiot."
"__MUSIC__ Yes he can make me laugh but again both of those original songs are also good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah while the parodies are good the reason we like them is partially because of the original songs."
"__MUSIC__ People seem to forget that when they listen to parodies."
"__MUSIC__ I heard Weird Al is getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
"__MUSIC__ Well I guess we can't really hate on him to much then. He is sucessful at what he does."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah even if we can't call him a musician we can call him a success."
"__MUSIC__ He is definitely one of the best parody artists."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly you know what Weird Al isn't that bad of a guy."
"__MUSIC__ He really isn't that bad!"
