"__MUSIC__ I like rap, but I don't like that gangster stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither. Who wants to hear about a gold chain?"
"__MUSIC__ Nobody does. What is something good that is rap but not about cars?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of A Tribe Called Quest?"
"__MUSIC__ No I have not. Who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They are an alternative hip hop group from what they call the Golden Era Of Hip Hop."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like what I am looking for."
"__MUSIC__ It is what you are looking for. Have you ever heard of Jungle Brothers?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes they are great."
"__MUSIC__ A Tribe Called Quest was friends with them and collaborated a few times."
"__MUSIC__ That is so awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ It is. Their songs were about empowered people not making them jealous."
"__MUSIC__ Where would I start if I wanted to listen to them?"
"__MUSIC__ I would check out the album Midnight Marauders."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like my type of album."
"__MUSIC__ It is so smooth you need to check it out now."
"__MUSIC__ So what is good about this album?"
"__MUSIC__ The way they use samples are so amazing. You just have to hear it to believe it."
"__MUSIC__ That is great. I love when musicians sample other music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Hopefully we don't get draconian copyright laws in the future which prevent us from hearing new music."
