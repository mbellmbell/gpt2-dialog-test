"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. It got me pumped for the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, I can't wait to see how everybody is going to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. Who do you think is going to be good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Christian McCaffrey is already good and is promising."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he is quick. He will be good as long as he can stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Talking about health, did you watch the documentary on Calvin Johnson?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. What was it about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was talking about his football career and how he had issues staying healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did he say about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was explaining that he was on painkillers for a long time and that he was having issues waking up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. That is kind of the nature of the game."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. Do you think Marshawn Lynch will stay healthy?"
