"__MOVIES__ What are your top three movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Stardust, Warm Bodies, and Scott Pilgrim vs the World. You?"
"__MOVIES__ Donnie Darko, I Heart Huckbees, and Southland Tales. What about your favorite trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. I would have to go with The Matrix? You?"
"__MOVIES__ Classic Star Wars trilogy - Episodes 4-6 all the way."
"__MOVIES__ Not bad. What'd you think of Episode 7."
"__MOVIES__ On one hand I liked how it felt like a modern day retelling of the original saga but on the other I thought there were too many parallels. Did watch it three times so there's that."
"__MOVIES__ Guess you liked it more than you disliked it then."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah... I mean... yeah, you're right. It did a good job at setting up future films though so Episode 8 should be a LOT more enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked seeing Luke at the end, but I'm curious what's up with him being all isolated and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Won't know for sure, but if you remember Yoda and Obi-Wan went into self-exile also."
"__MOVIES__ True. Guess it could be a jedi thing. Have you seen Rogue Squadron yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet and have been actively avoiding spoilers since it's came out. Don't ruin it for me!"
"__MOVIES__ I won't. I couldn't even if I wanted to as I've prioritized other movies before it. Will get there eventually."
"__MOVIES__ Is it out on bluray yet? I'll probably rent it next weekend since I have off."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's been out since April 4th on dvd and bluray. Only know that because the missus made me preorder and pickup The Bounce Back at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ The Bounce Back? Wasn't that with Shemar Moore, Nadine Velazquez, and Matthew Willig?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. She loved it, but I thought it was just alright. Not really my cup of tea, but you'd probably like it to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks, I'll have to borrow it sometime."
"__MOVIES__ Sure thing. Can pick it up when you come over to watch that new Keanu Reeves movie John Wick: Chapter 2 this weekend."
