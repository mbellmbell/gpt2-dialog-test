"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new anime movie Your Name yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't, I don't like anime you know that."
"__MOVIES__ What makes an anime movie any different than the other animated movies you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I just don't like the aesthetics and style decisions anime chooses to take."
"__MOVIES__ But Your Name doesn't share any of those qualities."
"__MOVIES__ You're telling me Your Name isn't an anime movie then?"
"__MOVIES__ No it is but you're thinking about the fan service type quirks anime typically have, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and I'd be willing to guarantee Your Name has them."
"__MOVIES__ You haven't seen it how can you possibly know this?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay maybe I'm wrong, but knowing I don't like anime what makes you think I'll like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a beautiful story, it's beautifully animated, great score."
"__MOVIES__ So you're saying if I watch it to just regard it as any other animated movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You should do that for all anime films honestly, there are tons of good ones."
"__MOVIES__ This could be a turning point for me I suppose."
"__MOVIES__ The fact that you haven't seen any Miyazaki movies blows my mind."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sorry man, I just don't like anime."
"__MOVIES__ But Miyazaki films are magical, true cinema masterpieces."
"__MOVIES__ Hyperbole like that doesn't help the case."
"__MOVIES__ Watch Howl's Moving Castle and then get back to me on the hyperbole."
"__MOVIES__ Are you sure you want this to happen?"
