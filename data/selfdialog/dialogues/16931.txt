"__MOVIES__ I've been watching a lot of movies about race in America."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones?"
"__MOVIES__ First, 'Moonlight.'"
"__MOVIES__ That wasn't about race per se. More a slice-of-life coming of age movie about a boy who happened to grow up in a drug-riddled ghetto."
"__MOVIES__ But still, the main characters were African American."
"__MOVIES__ What are the other movies you've seen about race?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Get Out,' Jordan Peele's 'psychological thriller' (his term), and 'I Am Not Your Negro,' the documentary about James Baldwin."
"__MOVIES__ They were all great movies. All three of the ones you mentioned. I saw them, too."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't 'Moonlight' remind you a little of Truffaut's 'Les Quatre Cent Coups' ('The 400 Blows')?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, both are coming-of-age stories about young boys who grow up in a troubled household."
"__MOVIES__ And who are ignored by their parents."
"__MOVIES__ The drug dealer in 'Moonlight' was a much better protector for the young boy than his own mother was."
"__MOVIES__ That's because she was a drug addict."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Better to be the pusher than the user."
"__MOVIES__ So, now that I've exhausted all the latest African American films that aren't 'Medea' movies, I need to find something else to see."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to see 'A Quiet Passion,' about the very white Emily Dickinson. Wanna come?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I saw that. Cynthia Nixon was great, but the movie was dreadful."
"__MOVIES__ But it got a rating of 98 percent on Rotten Tomatoes!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It got a great review on the Ebert site, too, and probably elsewhere. I must be missing something."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I promised Dana I'd go. So, I'll have to sit there and cringe while all the old ladies in the audience sob and sigh."
