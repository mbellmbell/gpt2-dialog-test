"__ROCK__ What do you think of rock music right now?"
"__ROCK__ I think the classic stuff is way better. The stuff now is awful."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I agree, there's nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody."
"__ROCK__ I totally agree. I would take some Rolling Stones or ACDC anyday over the current music."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, although some of the bands from the 90s aren't bad."
"__ROCK__ True. I used to listen to Slipknot all the time."
"__ROCK__ They're a little too heavy for me. I prefer some classic Nirvana."
"__ROCK__ True, nothing can beat Nirvana. It's such a shame Kurt Cobain died so young."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I totally agree. The good die young."
"__ROCK__ Better than turn into Aerosmith! They're terrible now."
