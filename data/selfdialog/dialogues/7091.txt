"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see Game 1 of the Penguins/Senators series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah I was pleasantly surprised that Ottawa won."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Playoff hockey is the best, especially when it goes to overtime."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ True, I just wish it lasted longer. It was only like 5 minutes of OT!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Fair enough. Hopefully the rest of the series will be this competitive."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I really hope so. I'm not much of a Penguins fan so I'm cautiously optimistic."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You don't like Sidney Crosby?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Nope, he's so overrated."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's a strong take!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He's good and all that, but he's always had such a great team around him too."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sure, but he's a big part in making those around him better."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ To an extent, but he's only on the ice for like 18 minutes per game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So who are you rooting for in the Anaheim/Nashville series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Predators for sure."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ This is the deepest in the playoffs they've ever gone, it's pretty cool for that town."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Nashville had a lot of slightly better than average teams when Barry Trotz was coaching there, but this year they're finally a legitimate contender."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Of course they are, since they're in the conference finals. It would still be an upset to beat the Ducks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Ducks have more firepower on offense but I think their defense is vulnerable."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It'll be exciting to see who ends up winning the Cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Let's go Senators!"
