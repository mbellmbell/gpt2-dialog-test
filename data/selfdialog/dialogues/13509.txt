"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you got this year in NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, not sure, it seems wide open."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I certainly don't have the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, no kidding, what a disaster that has turned into."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they already have a QB controversy and they'll still be terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just a poorly managed franchise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they're giving the Redskins a run for their money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, very true. The Redskins missed their opportunity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They looked fine with Cousins and should have built around him, but, now, there is all this drama."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they always seem to have issues."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, the division they're in will be brutal this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, Giants, Eagles and Cowboys all look good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely gonna be a tough division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the toughest with the AFC South being the weakest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's Titans or Texans there fighting it out for most mediocre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Titans could be good if Mariotta stays healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a big if though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, unfortunately. He's injury prone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Bucs made the right decision with Winston in that draft class."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely true."
