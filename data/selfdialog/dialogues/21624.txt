"__DISNEY__ What was your favourite Disney movie as a kid?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd say Aladdin. It was pretty darn cool."
"__DISNEY__ It had a lot going on. Robin Williams as the Genie was just genius."
"__DISNEY__ Completely. It was one of his best roles. He was hilarious."
"__DISNEY__ It had a good villain too. Jafar right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he was scary as hell. Almost too scary for a kid's movie."
"__DISNEY__ But at least he was a villain with some actual threat right?"
"__DISNEY__ I suppose. I mostly just wanted my own magic carpet."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! The Carpet was so awesome. It had a ton of personality for a rug."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly. Forget the gold and jewels, just give me the Carpet."
