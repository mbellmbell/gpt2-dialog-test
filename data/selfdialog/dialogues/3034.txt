"__MUSIC__ What channel are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ KGON - classic rock."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, all right.  Good choice, they are playing some pretty good tunes."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah!  Been listening to them forever.  Before it was classic rock."
"__MUSIC__ I like listening to a verity of music myself."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but mostly the old classics."
"__MUSIC__ Don't they get old and kind of musty to you.  I mean, the same songs over and over?"
"__MUSIC__ Lol, no, there was a lot of music done back in the day so they've got a lot to choose from."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm more into today's music I guess.  I like something fresh."
"__MUSIC__ I got ya'.  There is some good new music out there but a lot of it is just noise to me."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's always been good and bad music I guess.  I like what they play on KISN. It's popular and the kids like it."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I've seen some new acts lately watching Darrell's House on MTV."
"__MUSIC__ I've caught that a few times. Where different songwriters and stars go to his house and jam with him."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's pretty cool.  He's something else the way he can work with just about anyone and any type of music."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  I wasn't much of a Hall and Oat's fan but his show is jamming."
"__MUSIC__ I always liked them even though I listened to rock most of the time."
"__MUSIC__ They were a bit to bubble gum for me back when I was in school."
"__MUSIC__ But now that's the type of music you listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Well, shows that age can change even your listening styles."
"__MUSIC__ Or that having kids around all the time can change your listening style."
