"__MUSIC__ Hi, what are you up to?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, just listening to some really weird music."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Mr. Bungle, it's got to be the strangest thing I've ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ Is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of the stuff is awful, but some of it is genius."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting, what do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Some songs are very different from others."
"__MUSIC__ Like how?"
"__MUSIC__ Some songs are funky circus music, and have heavy metal portions."
"__MUSIC__ Wow that's hard to keep track of."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, they're very hard to keep track of and very different from anyone else."
"__MUSIC__ What does some of their other stuff sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ There's actually a whole album dedicated to like 60's pop, but with their spin on it."
"__MUSIC__ That's very different from circus funk."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, very. The singer does all kinds of really strange stuff, like screaming and sound effects."
"__MUSIC__ Very odd. Are they any good at least?"
"__MUSIC__ A ton of people hate it I'm sure, and it's actually pretty scary to listen to the first time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's weird. I'm not sure I'd like them."
"__MUSIC__ I'll find some of their gentler songs to recommend at least, maybe you'll like those."
