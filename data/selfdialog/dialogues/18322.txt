"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen any good horror movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't know if you'd quite call it horror, but we did watch something called 'The Boy' that was really disturbing."
"__MOVIES__ It kinda sounds disturbing!  I haven't heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well I hadn't either.  We ran across it on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ So what was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's really weird.  It's about this woman who takes a nanny job except it's not watching a child."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean, it's not watching a child?"
"__MOVIES__ It's watching a doll."
"__MOVIES__ What on earth, a doll?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Creepy, right?"
"__MOVIES__ No doubt!  So what winds up happening?"
"__MOVIES__ Well she's in this huge creepy house, and strange things keep happening.  It seems like the doll is alive."
"__MOVIES__ So it's haunted or something."
"__MOVIES__ Something like that.  And the owners of the doll treat it like a live boy."
"__MOVIES__ Very odd!  I've never heard of anything like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it just gets weirder and weirder.  She's all isolated there with the doll."
"__MOVIES__ I would totally leave that strange situation!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too.  But she hangs in there in spite of obvious warning signs that she should leave."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, typical horror theme.  Sticking around in spite of dreadful warning signs."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it really was.  The ending was disturbing as can be."
