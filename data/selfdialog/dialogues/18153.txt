"__MOVIES__ I have a movie to recommend to you."
"__MOVIES__ Let's see. Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Silence'. The last Martin Scorsese film."
"__MOVIES__ I've been wanting to see it since I watched the trailer!"
"__MOVIES__ It is so good! Very psychological."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me a bit about it."
"__MOVIES__ It is about these two Catholic missionaries that go to Japan to evangelize and look for a priest that never came back from there."
"__MOVIES__ Very interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is very intense and it has a lot of suspense."
"__MOVIES__ Who are the actors?"
"__MOVIES__ The cast is unbelievable. The main two actors are Liam Neeson and Andrew Garfield."
"__MOVIES__ Nice combo. Andrew Garfield got nominated this year for the 'Oscars', but it wasn't because of this movie right?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it was because of another movie: Hacksaw Ridge. But I honestly think that his acting on 'Silence' was better."
"__MOVIES__ The kid is making a name for himself, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. In this movie you totally forget any other roles he has done in the past. He is very believable."
"__MOVIES__ I will see it soon."
"__MOVIES__ You wont regret it. After you see it we have to talk about it."
"__MOVIES__ Sure. I'll give you my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I must warn you that you might be tempted to believe it is a true story but it is actually based on a Japanese novel."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, ok. I'll keep that in mind."
