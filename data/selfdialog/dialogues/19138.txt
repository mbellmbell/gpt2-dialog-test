"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Fast and the Furious movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, I've seen them all."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like them?"
"__MOVIES__ Mostly, yeah. They're a lot of fun, with some crazily inventive car chases."
"__MOVIES__ Which would you say is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Good question. I'd maybe say number five, Fast 5."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Not the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one didn't quite have the formula figured out. It took them a few movies to get it down pat."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ The ensemble cast, mostly. Diesel, Walker, The Rock, Ludacris, Michelle Rodriquez, Tyrese Gibson."
"__MOVIES__ Was that the first one Dwayne Johnson was in?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. And to me, he was kind of the last element needed to make the ensemble perfect."
"__MOVIES__ But Paul Walker was still alive during the filming of that one?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in all but the most recent one. It's not quite the same without him."
"__MOVIES__ I actually never watched any of them after Tokyo Drift."
"__MOVIES__ What made you stop watching them?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it started to seem kind of like they were doing the same thing over and over."
"__MOVIES__ It's a winning formula, why mess with it?"
"__MOVIES__ It just got a little stale, for me."
"__MOVIES__ Give Fast 5 a shot - I think you'lll like it."
