"__BEATLES__ Did you like more of the Beatles earlier recordings, or did you prefer the later music?"
"__BEATLES__ Actually i liked some of the early stuff and some of the later material.  I definitely liked songs such as 'I Want to Hold your Hand,' but i also loved 'Let it Be,' and 'Long and Winding Road.'  So I liked early and later recordings."
"__BEATLES__ Me too...I also liked a lot of the stuff that I guess could be called the 'middle years.'  I'm referring to albums like 'Rubber Soul' and 'Revolver.'"
"__BEATLES__ I know what you mean.  You're talking about songs like 'Yellow Submarine' and 'Eight Days a Week.'  great stuff!"
"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ I'd say 'Sargeant Pepper' is my favorite, but the 'white album' is a close second.  I consider 'Sgt. Pepper' a legendary album."
"__BEATLES__ I actually remember the day i bought that album.  It had all those 'cut outs' and pictures along with the actual record.  Of course this was during the days of vinyl records, long before compact discs."
"__BEATLES__ Do you remember the album called 'Magical Mystery Tour?' I don't think it was one of the more famous albums; it had some of their singles on it, and as i recall some pretty weird stuff."
"__BEATLES__ I am familiar with that album.  'Magical Mystery Tour,' in addition to being an album, was a not very successful television movie the group did."
"__BEATLES__ No kidding; i didn't know that.  I think the song 'Hello Goodbye' was on that album.  I really liked that song.  I enjoyed our chat about the greatest group ever."
