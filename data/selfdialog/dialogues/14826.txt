"__ACTION__ So, do you think Scarface is an action movie? Or is it crime?"
"__ACTION__ It's definitely an action movie, at least in the Al Pacino version. That's the only one I've seen."
"__ACTION__ Me too. But isn't crime a different category?"
"__ACTION__ There's different kinds of crime movies. Like Godfather III is actually sort of an opera, and sort of a love story too."
"__ACTION__ Really? I never saw it. Is it good?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, kind of. But Scarface is an action movie because of all the violent action. You have to have violence in an action movie, I think."
"__ACTION__ Or you could call it a romance, because of Michelle Pfeiffer. What a massively unhappy marriage."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, she was great as Elvira--and there was another woman too, Mary Elizabeth Matroantonio. But it was Pacino's film."
"__ACTION__ Yeah. His work made the whole corrupt rags-to-riches story seem almost heroic."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, almost. You still knew he was just a drug dealer, who would die in the end."
