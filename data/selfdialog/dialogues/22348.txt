"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ No, not yet, I haven't."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I feel like everybody's seen it by now."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I haven't really had the desire, but there's a lady at work who is obsessed with Olaf."
"__DISNEY__ Oh my gosh, Olaf is my favorite! I have a stuffed Olaf at home."
"__DISNEY__ I see him all the time when I go to Target, kids seem to love him."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not surprised, he really is a fan favorite; maybe even more popular than Elsa!"
"__DISNEY__ Who is Elsa? Is she the one with white hair?"
"__DISNEY__ Elsa is the main character in Frozen. Man, you really have a lot of catching up to do!"
"__DISNEY__ I really do, I'm not hip with the jive anymore. What are you doing this weekend?"
