"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney film?"
"__DISNEY__ I would probably have to say Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good one, but do you mean the live action or the animated one?"
"__DISNEY__ Animated.  The live action one was a fine remake and Emma Watson was a great choice for Belle, but I didn't love her singing."
"__DISNEY__ I agree with you.  Disney is really pumping out a lot of live action movies lately.  The CGI was cool in The Jungle Book, I can't wait to see what they do with The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ I can't image there being a live action version of the Lion King, there aren't even any people in it."
"__DISNEY__ Good point,  Hey, did you hear they're making a new Frozen movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No I did not!  I can't imagine what direction they'd be able to take that movie in."
"__DISNEY__ Me either, but I have high hopes for it."
"__DISNEY__ I hope the songs are just as good as the first one.  Let it Go was in my head for at least a year."
