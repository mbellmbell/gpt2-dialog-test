"__MUSIC__ You listening to any good music right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Have you ever heard of 311?"
"__MUSIC__ Aww? Yeah I used to listen to them in college. They still around?"
"__MUSIC__ Still around??? HAHA they just released a new album."
"__MUSIC__ Really!? I loved Down. That was my favorite song that summer."
"__MUSIC__ Dude you are way behind. They've had at least 4 albums since that one."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! And they still got it?"
"__MUSIC__ I've liked every one.  And this new one is no different. It's called Mosaic."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. Do they still put on their big concert? They do it every two years."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. 311 day. March 11th. I haven't been to one yet. Really trying to go."
"__MUSIC__ I would like to check that out too."
"__MUSIC__ We should plan it out. Save money and do it right."
"__MUSIC__ I am definitely down for that."
"__MUSIC__ They also do cruises. I did one of those. Expensive but so worth it."
"__MUSIC__ Like a concert on a ship?"
"__MUSIC__ Like several concerts on the ship and on shore. Every day 4 to 5 shows. About 5 to 6 different bands."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds insane."
"__MUSIC__ It was one big party. I want to do another. But 311 day first."
"__MUSIC__ Can you recommend an album for me to check out."
"__MUSIC__ Either Mosaic or Stereolithic. Both awesome."
