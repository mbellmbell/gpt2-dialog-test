"__DISNEY__ I just found my collection of Disney movies at my parents house, do you want me to bring some over for the kids?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that would be so great! I appreciate it."
"__DISNEY__ Of course, I'm happy to help.  My favorite was the Little Mermaid when I was young, do the kids like mermaids and princesses?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, they are definitely in the princess stage. They love Aladdin and Princess Jasmine, if you happen to have a copy of that one too!"
"__DISNEY__ I think I have every Disney movie ever made. I even have some of the new ones they might not have yet!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, excellent, thank you so much! They haven't seen Princess and the Frog yet, but they keep talking about it."
"__DISNEY__ I have that one too! i'll add that to the pile, and it was a really good movie for little girls to watch, I think."
"__DISNEY__ Perfect, I love Disney movies but I'm glad their newer ones are more focused on female empowerment."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, the classic movies will always be classic, but they do seem to have more female heroes lately!"
"__DISNEY__ Disney is such a classic part of childhood, thanks so much for bringing over those cute musical movies!"
