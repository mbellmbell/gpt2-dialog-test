"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the  San Diego Padres on Thursday, Mike?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nope. I had dinner plans and went out with the wife. How was it?"
"__BASEBALL__ With that a 4-2 win over the San Diego Padres, the Brewers are in first place."
"__BASEBALL__ That win was their ninth in 11 games."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. They are doing good."
"__BASEBALL__ Losing two of the last eleven games isn't too bad at all."
"__BASEBALL__ Of course every loss hurts when you are trying to get into the playoffs."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they do have long odds."
"__BASEBALL__ Especially in a tough NL Central where you know the Chicago Cubs haven't yet played their best baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ They say the computers are giving  them about 2 percent odds of winning the division, about 10 percent of making the playoffs."
"__BASEBALL__ Dang. The computers don't like their odds too much but what do computers know?"
"__BASEBALL__ Only what you tell them."
"__BASEBALL__ Dang straight."
"__BASEBALL__ But you know what, though? It's still  fun to be in first place!"
"__BASEBALL__ I couldn't agree with you more."
"__BASEBALL__ I think this season's playoff will be very interesting."
"__BASEBALL__ I might try to see a game or two in person."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? If you do, let me know."
"__BASEBALL__ You want to go to the ball park too?"
"__BASEBALL__ Of course! I have to support my team."
