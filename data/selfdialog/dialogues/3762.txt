"__MUSIC__ Did you see that Haruki Murakami has a new book out?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, what's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a nonfiction book called 'Absolutely On Music'. He interviews a conductor about classical music."
"__MUSIC__ What conductor?"
"__MUSIC__ His name is Seiji Ozawa. He conducted a bunch of famous orchestras all over the world."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I love Murakami, do you think it's worth reading? I don't know much about music."
"__MUSIC__ Probably. I read it at home and listened to all of the classical pieces they were talking about as I read."
"__MUSIC__ Were they easy to find?"
"__MUSIC__ People have been putting up playlists on youtube and that sort of thing."
"__MUSIC__ I wish they'd just sell it as a CD."
"__MUSIC__ That would make things easier."
"__MUSIC__ Does Murakami know a lot about music?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, it seems like it. Sometimes it's difficult to tell which of them is the conductor!"
"__MUSIC__ That's surprising to me. I wouldn't have thought it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there are lots of references to music in his books."
"__MUSIC__ I always thought that was just music he liked."
"__MUSIC__ He talks a lot about collecting rare and unusual records, too."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I will pick up a copy!"
"__MUSIC__ I could just lend it to you."
"__MUSIC__ Would you? Thanks!"
