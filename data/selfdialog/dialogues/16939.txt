"__MOVIES__ Which of the three Star Trek reboot movies do you think is best?"
"__MOVIES__ First one."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I guess it just feels the most cohesive."
"__MOVIES__ I like the third one best, myself."
"__MOVIES__ The third one is fine, but I feel like it's a bit under-cooked."
"__MOVIES__ I feel the same about the second one. That one is very under-cooked."
"__MOVIES__ I think the second one starts out really good actually, a really strong first act."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being bad."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't say it's bad. Just messy. The third one is the one I think is boring."
"__MOVIES__ Now you're just being crazy. Don't tell me you prefer Into Darkness over Beyond?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd rank them about the same really."
"__MOVIES__ You're crazy. The correct ranking is, 3, 1, 2, in that order."
"__MOVIES__ Mine is 1, with 2 and 3 being more or less equal. My opinion on which is better varies slightly from day to day."
"__MOVIES__ But the second one doesn't even feel like a real Star Trek film though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the first one felt like a Star Wars film. And I like it, but we can't just judge movies on how they feel to us."
"__MOVIES__ But isn't that what ranking movies is all about? Judging feels based on nothing but personal preference?"
"__MOVIES__ I suppose you're right."
"__MOVIES__ Well, at least I can probably agree that none of the reboot films are completely awful."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're not Generations, or worse, V."
