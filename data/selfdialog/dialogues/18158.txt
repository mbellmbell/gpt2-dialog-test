"__MOVIES__ I love horror movies. Do you know of any on Netflix that we can watch?"
"__MOVIES__ There are a bunch. The newest favorite of mine is Sinister."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard of that. Is it scary or just one of those typical butcher movies. I like suspense."
"__MOVIES__ No, it is very suspenseful and there is creepy violence."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean creepy? Is it another dark movie where you can't even see what is going on?"
"__MOVIES__ No, you can really see the action. It is just that it involves not just adults but whole families who die."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Is there a serial killer on the loose or some fake monster?"
"__MOVIES__ It is so hard to explain. There are whole families who die in crazy ways."
"__MOVIES__ Is there just one killer or is it some supernatural killer like in The Ring?"
"__MOVIES__ This guy-father played by Ethan Hawke is a writer and he takes his family (wife and 2 children) to a house where the whole family was murdered. Ethen Hawke is planning on writing about it."
"__MOVIES__ I like those type of plots. Is there ghosts in the house?"
"__MOVIES__ Sort of... the previous family were all hung on a tree in the front yard but the daughter was not among the dead and she was never found again."
"__MOVIES__ Is she being held hostage someplace or is she the killer?"
"__MOVIES__ Again, it is hard to explain. No the girl is not held hostage but she is a part of causing the killings of her family."
"__MOVIES__ How could the daughter hang her full grown parents? It is starting to sound a bit far fetched and stupid."
"__MOVIES__ No, you do not understand. It is really suspenseful and I do not want to give the ending away but the daughter is just one of many children who kill their family."
"__MOVIES__ So the movie is focused on many different families? So does it jump from one house to another?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the father - Ethan Hawke- finds old movies in the attic and on the movies it shows all the other families being murdered- each time, one child goes missing."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds sort of something I would like. Is it really as scary as you claim?"
"__MOVIES__ Trust me- I know you will like it. I especially love the ending. I do not want to tell you any more so I do not ruin it for you."
