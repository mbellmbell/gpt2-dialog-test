"__MOVIES__ I'm trying to decide if I want to get Netflix or Hulu. What do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ What kind of movies do you like to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I like classic gangster movies, and film noir-"
"__MOVIES__ Me too, what is you favorite?  I Love Desert Fury with Elizabeth Scott, but I also like really trashy 60's movies like Peyton Place."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, me too.  I have this awesome movie that was one of Suzanne Pleshette's first movies called A Rage To Live, have you seen that?"
"__MOVIES__ I have! You will die when I tell you what I'm watching now....Valley of the Dolls!!! It's on Amazon. That's the greatest kitsch musical EVER."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that the one that Judy Garland was supposed to play Barbara Stanwyck's part, but she was too messed up all the time?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, there's that hysterical scene where she's one screen with this giant swinging mobile trying to sing without it hitting her in the face!"
"__MOVIES__ And wasn't that one of Sharon Tate's only movies? She was so beautiful. So sad what happened to her."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it really was. You could tell she was really going to be a big star. so, what do you think - are either of those services going to have movies that I like?"
"__MOVIES__ I have Hulu, I really like it because it has a lot of the Criterion Collection movies, so you know those are good, although most of them are the foreign ones."
"__MOVIES__ That's OK, good ones like Kurosawa?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  And from pretty much every country. They do have Samuel Fuller's movies-"
"__MOVIES__ Like Shock Corrridor?  And that movie about the woman where at the beginning they pull off her wig and she's bald?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh- right- she was in soap operas for years - Constance Fuller I think? What is the name of that movie? Ummm..it's a good one- where she ends up marrying the town ne'er do well...and becomes a nurse!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, that's a good one. So cheesy and so awesome with all those weird plot twists all the time. And she sells some kind of champagne out of a suitcase. Too much."
"__MOVIES__ I used to have Netflix, but they didn't have as many classic films, mostly new stuff like all those stupid action movies from comic books, I really am so bored with those."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Fast and Furious 67, ha! How many Rocky movies can they make, pretty soon Stallone is going to be in a wheelchair for Rocky 27."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen him? He looks like he's had WAY too much plastic surgery."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he has.  Him, and John Travolta. I saw a picture of him the other day, and I didn't even recognize him- Someone asked me the other day what my favorite Tom Cruise movie was- I just drew a total blank. Risky Business? Maybe?"
