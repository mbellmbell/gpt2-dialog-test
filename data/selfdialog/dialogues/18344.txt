"__MOVIES__ Wanna play a game?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure."
"__MOVIES__ Best comedy of all time... Go!"
"__MOVIES__ Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Best comic book movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Captain America 3: Civil War. Best parody film?"
"__MOVIES__ Civil War was good but overrated in my opinion. Ant-Man was way better overall."
"__MOVIES__ Blasphemy! Civil War is only second to the upcoming Infinity War."
"__MOVIES__ Civil War is second to Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ I... actually no, I'll conceed to that. Deadpool was smegging hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Space Balls by the way. Favorite 80s film?"
"__MOVIES__ Farris Bueller's Day Off. I would have went with Blazing Saddles."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, another great Mel Brooks film. Good choice."
"__MOVIES__ What'd you think of Young Frankenstine?"
"__MOVIES__ It was okay. The black and white killed it for me."
"__MOVIES__ Same. Don't know why my friend is so obsessed with it."
"__MOVIES__ I know exactly who you're talking about, and if I watched any film repeatedly as much as her and Young Frankenstein it'd have to be Robin Hood: Men In Tights."
"__MOVIES__ That was my first Mel Gibson movie! Speaking Blazing Saddles though, did you hear about his newest film?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Blazing Samurai... it's animated but has a great cast with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson AND Michael Cera so still totally worth it. Think it comes out sometime in August maybe?"
"__MOVIES__ Can't wait!"
