"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Killers song?"
"__MUSIC__ The Killers are still around? They haven't put anything out in forever!"
"__MUSIC__ It's been about 5 years actually! But yeah, they just put a new song out a week or so ago for their new album!"
"__MUSIC__ Cool, what's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called 'The Man.' You should give it a listen!"
"__MUSIC__ What's so good about it? The Killers have always been hit or miss for me."
"__MUSIC__ It's a really groovy song. Think in the style of the Bee Gees."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, like disco? That sounds kind of interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's pretty different from the kinds of songs they've put out before. Really catchy though!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'll have to give it a listen. Sounds like an interesting combination."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard that they're coming out with a new album this Fall as well."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That's awesome, I'm glad they're coming out with new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ If the whole new album sounds like 'The Man,' it's going to be really interesting! I have high hopes for it."
"__MUSIC__ That would be cool to see them go in a different direction. Their style has always stayed pretty much the same."
"__MUSIC__ True. But 'Hot Fuss' is one of my favorite albums of all time!"
"__MUSIC__ It is a pretty good album. A few good songs on there."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of GREAT songs on there! 'Mr. Brightside,' 'Smile Like you Mean It,' and so many others! The whole album is pretty much played on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I forgot about some of those songs, the album was released so long ago!"
"__MUSIC__ I promise you, it still holds up to this day. Each song is great."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to re-listen to it then. Great idea!"
