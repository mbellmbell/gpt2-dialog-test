"__HARRY_POTTER__ Question: Who was more wrong by Harry - Snape or Dumbledore?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What in the world are you talking about? Snape was always horrible to Harry. How can you say Dumbledore was wrong?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Did you not finish the series? In Snape's flashback it is explained that Dumbledore was basically raising Harry like 'a pig for slaughter.'"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ok yes that's a good point. But still, it's Dumbledore we are talking about!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That doesn't negate all he did."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He didn't do it because he was evil. It was necessary in his mind to save all of the world! He loved Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't call that love."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't call how Snape treated Harry love. He took care of Harry all that time only because he was Lily's son."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes but which is worse?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Snape will always be worse."
