"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team in the NFL do you like the least?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Take a guess and I'll tell you if you are right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it the Arizona Cardinals?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No that isn't right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it the Los Angeles Chargers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That isn't right either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay I give up then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you sure just think about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wait is it the Baltimore Ravens?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly I just can't stand them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why don't you like them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is so much domestic violence associated with their team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I agree but they can't control that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually they can control it but they choose not too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They always look the other way, give second chances, and even let the most shady players join their roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They let Ray Lewis keep playing even after his murder trial."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he is a solid player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely is but still the mentality in Baltimore is winning over being moral."
