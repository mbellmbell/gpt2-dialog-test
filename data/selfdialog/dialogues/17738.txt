"__MOVIES__ Do you watch Disney movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes, why?"
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking of taking someone out on a date and she likes Disney movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you know what her favorite Disney movie is?"
"__MOVIES__ No idea, but I think I saw here with a princess with red hair"
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I think that's the Little Mermaid"
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of that one"
"__MOVIES__ What?! The Little Mermaid?!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, is it a new one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it came out back in the early 90s"
"__MOVIES__ Really?! I guess I missed that one"
"__MOVIES__ My sister used to watch it all the time"
"__MOVIES__ I never had a sister so I was never exposed to it"
"__MOVIES__ It's actually not too bad. Pretty good songs"
"__MOVIES__ Remember any of the names of the songs?"
"__MOVIES__ Under the Sea, Kiss the Girl...some others I can't think of right now"
"__MOVIES__ Okay I'll have to check it out and see if that's one of her favorites"
"__MOVIES__ yeah, good idea so you can relate to her"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, thanks for the help"
"__MOVIES__ You're welcome"
