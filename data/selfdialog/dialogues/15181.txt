"__HARRY_POTTER__ So you think Haggrid and Madame Maxime got together after everything was settled?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Good question. I think we all just assumed Haggrid was still game keeper at Hogwarts."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, probably. How do you think the Fantasical Beasts tie in to that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It would have been cool for Haggrid to meet Newt Scramander. I think they would have had a lot to talk about."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, that new movie was pretty good. I'm not sure how I feel about the Cursed Child."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It sounded a little to far off base for me. Like the description of Harry sounded completely out of character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought so too, but I'll probably still go see it. I love the Harry Potter movies though they are different from the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it's a different vibe but still good."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They did an excellent job with special effects."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Considering how vivid the descriptions are in the book and how my imagination wandered...they did great."
