"__MOVIES__ Did you see Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yupp. I thought it was great."
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, it was kind of dull to me."
"__MOVIES__ How so? It was action packed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there were some intense scenes, but overall, not nearly as exciting as the X-men movies."
"__MOVIES__ Thats true, but this was really just about logan and some other unknown mutants."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. I guess if there were all the other ones then it would have been much better."
"__MOVIES__ But that would defeat the whole purpose of a Logan movie."
"__MOVIES__ True. What was your favorite part"
"__MOVIES__ The farmhouse part where he was staying with the nice family."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh, that was brutal."
"__MOVIES__ I know! I felt so bad for the father!"
"__MOVIES__ Right? I wasn't expecting it to be so gory."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, most Marvel movies aren't big on blood and whatnot."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the little girl?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of. She was a bit annoying at times with how angry she was."
"__MOVIES__ She was a great character, in my opinion. Her having the claws on her feet was epic."
"__MOVIES__ The scene in the corner store with her was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right! When she was just taking whatever she wanted."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Too bad there won't be a sequel"
