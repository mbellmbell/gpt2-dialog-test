"__BASKETBALL__ Are you going to the basketball game at school tonight?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe. Who are we playing?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Larsonville. They always beat us."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe they won't this time. We're good this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. We beat Ashton and they always beat us too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Max Howard is great."
"__BASKETBALL__ He really is. I can't believe that touchdown he scored last week."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wasn't that the tie breaker?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. We won because of him."
"__BASKETBALL__ I was elated and I normally don't care much about the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't either. I usually just go to see friends."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think that's most of us."
"__BASKETBALL__ Want to ride together then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure. Can you pick me up a little early so we can get a seat?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. I don't want to have to sit all the way at the top of the stands again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Neither do I. I hate that."
"__BASKETBALL__ So do I. It's hard to get anywhere if you want food or something."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'll buy you a pretzel if you want one at the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ I love those. This game is going to be so great."
"__BASKETBALL__ If we win everyone's going to be so excited."
