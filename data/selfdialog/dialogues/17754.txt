"__MOVIES__ Would you say you liked Weekend at Bernie's?"
"__MOVIES__ I would definitely say that!"
"__MOVIES__ What about Weekend at Bernie's 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, I liked that one too. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I did like them both. Corny movies, but entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ I watched them recently and noe that I'm older they don't seem as good, but I still liked them."
"__MOVIES__ That's why I was asking."
"__MOVIES__ You just watched them again too?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I am going to though. I wondered if they held up well."
"__MOVIES__ They were still entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ I remember wishing I could live in a house like that when I got older."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know! That beautiful property on the ocean."
"__MOVIES__ And it seemed so big and open in a friendly neighborhood."
"__MOVIES__ You know, when I was young I thought that was I'm California for some reason."
"__MOVIES__ It isn't?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, they worked in New York City and took the ferry out."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I always thought California too."
"__MOVIES__ I guess we didn't pay attention to detail."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah really. Maybe they shot it in Malibu or something though."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. You never know."
