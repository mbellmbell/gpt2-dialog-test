"__MUSIC__ I was outside eating and somebody drove by sharing their music pretty loudly."
"__MUSIC__ Was it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly I couldn't tell, it just sounded like a lot of toneless screaming."
"__MUSIC__ Screamo music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was some kind of metal."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love metal! Especially melodic folk metal."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds... oddly specific."
"__MUSIC__ I mean I like all kinds of metal, that just happens to be my favourite."
"__MUSIC__ I could never get into metal personally."
"__MUSIC__ Well it's not for everyone. Did you at least give it a chance?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it just all sounds kind of stressful to me. I don't know how you could listen to it and relax."
"__MUSIC__ It helps when you understand the lyrics and the sentiment and don't just look at the surface of 'hey, it's loud and clashy'."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure there's a lot of cheerful metal out there."
"__MUSIC__ There really is. I mean, the number of songs that have 'victory' in the title alone..."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, well I can never understand what they're talking about in the songs anyway."
"__MUSIC__ That's why you read the lyrics beforehand, my friend."
"__MUSIC__ I also don't feel like I could ever sing along to it."
"__MUSIC__ You don't have to. You can growl and scream along to it."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like it would give me a sore throat."
"__MUSIC__ I've never tried to myself."
