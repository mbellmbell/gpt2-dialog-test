"__MOVIES__ I saw the trailer for the new movie coming out, 'Pitch Perfect 3.' I can't wait to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Pitch Perfect, and of course Pitch Perfect 2 wasn't quite as good, but I really liked when Fat Amy was singing to Bumper."
"__MOVIES__ That was hilarious. There was an article about the movie that said this will probably be the last movie in the series."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it would be hard to continue since they've supposedly graduated, unless maybe they became college professors."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good idea! The article said we will find out why Amy is called Fat Amy, and it's a tearjerker."
"__MOVIES__ Uh oh. I really like Amy. Rebel Wilson did a great job playing her."
"__MOVIES__ The movie is going to show the Bellas traveling all over the world."
"__MOVIES__ It must be like when they did the world championships in 'Pitch Perfect 2.'"
"__MOVIES__ There's a new cast member, Ruby Rose from 'Orange Is The New Black.'"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know her, but I want to see all the old Bellas."
"__MOVIES__ They have some wacky scenes, like a synchronized swimming pool scene."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like something Aubrey would organize! She was hilarious. That barfing scene was so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I don't think anyone could ever forget that. I wonder how she managed to make it travel so far?"
"__MOVIES__ Special effects maybe?"
"__MOVIES__ One of the cast members who plays Flo said she thinks there could always be a possibility of a fourth movie as long as people wanted it. She said the group of girls love each other and have become like family."
"__MOVIES__ I just hope Jessica and Ashley actually get to talk in this movie. I really hated the way they were never given any lines."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. In the first movie, when they were all sitting and telling something personal about themselves, they were the only two who didn't get to say anything."
"__MOVIES__ They are called 'The Insignificant Ones' by fans and the other girls, and that seems so hurtful."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe this third movie will be different since it might be the last one, and they actually get some lines."
"__MOVIES__ You know what would be wickedly funny? If they had a fourth movie with just them as college professors teaching music, and they explained to their classes that they liked to talk a lot because in college they could never get a word in edgewise around the other girls!"
