"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, so, Star Wars or Star Trek?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars. I just couldn't get into the original Star Trek."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The special effects were terrible, for one. The plots seemed kind of silly, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but it was all about science and discovery and exploring issues of ethics."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's another thing, they kept 'dropping anvils', telling people what to think."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some anvils still need to be dropped. Anyway, how aren't there any lessons to be learned from Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars is your basic good versus evil. Simple as."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or is it? Think about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whatever!"
