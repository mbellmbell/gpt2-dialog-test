"__MOVIES__ I don't care I'm an adult, I love Disney movies"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I don't think I've seen any in years."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but what about when you were a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I used to watch them all the time then!"
"__MOVIES__ What was your favourite?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I don't know that I could pick one. What was yours?"
"__MOVIES__ I love the old ones like Robin Hood and The Sword in the Stone."
"__MOVIES__ Robin Hood's the one with the fox everyone on Buzzfeed thinks is sexy, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha! Yes that's right."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I've seen The Sword in the Stone."
"__MOVIES__ Oh it's brilliant."
"__MOVIES__ Is it about King Arthur?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but when he was young, before he became king."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't sound interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Well it's got Merlin who finds him and knows who he will be so he decides to teach him what he'll need to know."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess, it all goes wrong?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! And he's got an owl."
"__MOVIES__ Who, Arthur?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Merlin. He's called Archimedes."
"__MOVIES__ Well that sounds like a dumb name for an owl."
