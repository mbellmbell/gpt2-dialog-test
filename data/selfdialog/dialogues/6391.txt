"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean the Force Awakens? Yes I have"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I mean Rogue One, the spin-off movie"
"__STAR_WARS__ I haven't even heard of it before now. What is it about?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's about the group of rebels who steal the plans for the Death Star"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, is it any good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I really enjoyed it even though it's almost entirely new characters to the series"
"__STAR_WARS__ Who else is in it from the other films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Bail Organa is in it briefly, and so is Mon Mothma when she's younger, but that's about it"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sounds interesting. I was always curious what happened before the beginning of A New Hope, so I'll check it out"
