"__MUSIC__ I'm one of those people who really fears the dentist."
"__MUSIC__ Everybody fears the dentist."
"__MUSIC__ I guess, but I'm absolutely phobic, and the sound of the drill sets me off. So I got a Baroque music tape to drown it out."
"__MUSIC__ Your dentist let you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she didn't care. So I'd turn up some Brandenburgs or whatever when the drilling started, and feel relatively relaxed."
"__MUSIC__ This worked?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah."
"__MUSIC__ I should try that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it seemed to kill the pain, too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm definitely going to try it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, well, there is a slight problem though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Now when I hear certain tunes, like in an elevator or something, I tense up a bit."
"__MUSIC__ But it seems like it would be worth it."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. You know my neice got married last month?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. You told me all about it."
"__MUSIC__ Not everything. She came up the aisle, and the sun was shining, the flowers were beautiful, and I was miserable."
"__MUSIC__ They were playing Bach?"
"__MUSIC__ No, Pachelbel, actually, the Canon in D. Solemn joy. It was horrible."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. I'll just take novocaine."
