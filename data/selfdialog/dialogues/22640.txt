"__DISNEY__ What is it you like about Disney movies? Is there anything specific you can think of?"
"__DISNEY__ Disney films always have fun storylines, and always leave you feeling great at the end."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. I can't think of a single Disney movie with a sad ending. Can you?"
"__DISNEY__ I will say that Big Red was sad, honestly. I watched that as a child and will never forget how I cried."
"__DISNEY__ I hadn't thought of that movie. That one's an oldie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but when a movie brings you to tears, especially as a child, you tend to remember it."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. Bambi did that to me. His poor mother...well, we know what happened to her."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, now we are on the same page. But in general, Disney movies are fantastic and a brand I trust."
"__DISNEY__ Well thank you for your honest response. I appreciate it."
"__DISNEY__ You are most welcome. Disney's Pixar movies are my favorites though. I love the 3D animations the most!"
