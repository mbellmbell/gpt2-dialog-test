"__HORROR__ I know, creepy right?"
"__HORROR__ When the mom started getting bruises on her, I was terrified."
"__HORROR__ That part was scary because it felt like ghosts could finally really hurt a person."

"__HORROR__ Oh, that part made me scream out loud.  I woke up my dog!"
"__HORROR__ It was great to finally see a movie that was scary without gore."
