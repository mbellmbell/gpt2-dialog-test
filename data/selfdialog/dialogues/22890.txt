"__DISNEY__ What was the latest Disney movie you've seen?"
"__DISNEY__ I've seen Moana quite recently. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I haven't had the chance to see Moana yet. What is the movie about?"
"__DISNEY__ The movie is based on stories from Polynesian mythology. It's about a little girl who goes on an epic journey to help restore the balance of nature on her island, with the help of a demigod called Maui."
"__DISNEY__ What did you enjoy about the movie the most?"
"__DISNEY__ I think the best part of the movie was just watching Moana's perseverance through all of the difficulties she had to face. She never gave up."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds like she will be a good role model for little girls everywhere."
"__DISNEY__ I believe so. She is portrayed as a very strong, independent young woman who follows her heart and does the right thing."
"__DISNEY__ I think I will check this movie out very soon."
"__DISNEY__ You should. It also puts nature in focus, which is an additional element that really makes this movie worth watching."
