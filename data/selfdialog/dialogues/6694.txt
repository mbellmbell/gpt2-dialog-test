"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the concept of the Death Star in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do actually."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was wondering if you thought it was practical like it could be actually done?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think a weapon could be created like that but not in the same way."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think we could ever create a weapon that is essentially a planet/moon just would require hundreds of years, that's a lot of space to use and build something that large inside of it."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think it was a cool concept?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I absolutely loved the idea and it was rather shocking."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it was a big twist."
