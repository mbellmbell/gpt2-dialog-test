"__STAR_WARS__ So what did you think about Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was well made. It also ties in nicely to the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it explained what happened in between the third and fourth movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I always wondered how they knew the weak point of the death star."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No not really. I thought it was too cheesy and nostalgic."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah they tried to incorporate too many of the old characters and had too many allusions."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah the flashbacks of Han, Chewy, and Leigh were questionable."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the fact that they're releasing a movie every year and I can't wait to see the new one in December."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I'm really interested to see who the new Jedi's are."
