"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, yeah. How did you like it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought it was great. Especially when Twilight died."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ha. That was pretty good. However, there was so much missing from the movie that was in the book."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know. It was the first movie that really broke away from the book."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of all of the movies, I think that Goblet of Fire was the one that should have been split in two."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? I think Order of the Phoenix  is the one that should have been split up into two movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I disagree. What would they have done, had them at the house for most of the first movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's true. I guess it would have been rather boring to watch since move of the movie was just 'mundane' stuff happening."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes. Then again, it would have given Creature more film time."
