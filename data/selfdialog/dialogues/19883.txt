"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the Evil Dead series?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the show but not the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you have to see the movies. The show isn't as good."
"__MOVIES__ I like it a lot Bruce Campbell is hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ He is. The show is funny but just not as good as the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is the best?"
"__MOVIES__ They're all good but the first one is probably the worst."
"__MOVIES__ Why? Usually the first is the best."
"__MOVIES__ I think he was trying to make it a serious horror movie. But it was so bad that it ended up being funny."
"__MOVIES__ So why are the other ones better?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it seems like Sam Raimi embraced the humor in the rest of them and focused on making them funny."
"__MOVIES__ That's hilarious. Do they play out chronologically?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. But I'm a little confused about it."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the same thing happens in both part one and two. I can't tell if it's a remake or a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever looked it up?"
"__MOVIES__ No but I should."
"__MOVIES__ Well either way you've convinced me to check em out."
"__MOVIES__ You'll understand the show better too if you watch em."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Thanks."
