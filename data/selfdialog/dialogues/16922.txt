"__MOVIES__ Do you watch superhero movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I love them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? What's your favorite one?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure...but I did think Guardians of the Galaxy was really good."
"__MOVIES__ That one was alright. Why is it probably your favorite though?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the characters were all so likable, and they didn't overshoot with the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a lot of superhero movies do that."
"__MOVIES__ Yup, like Man of Steel."
"__MOVIES__ Terrible movie."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed."
"__MOVIES__ What else did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought they paced the movie really well too."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It never felt like it dragged, or got boring. It also never felt like it was being rushed for the sake of plot."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose that's true."
"__MOVIES__ Of course it is. The only other superhero movie that had such good pacing was probably The Avengers."
"__MOVIES__ That was the best superhero movie in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they really got everything right with that one."
"__MOVIES__ Either way, I'm definitely going to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can't wait."
