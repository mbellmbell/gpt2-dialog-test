"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely Jungle Book."
"__DISNEY__ The new one or the old cartoon?  I liked the new movie."
"__DISNEY__ I liked the new movie too, but the old cartoon is my favorite.  I just loved all of the characters and the songs."
"__DISNEY__ The songs are the best!  I love the monkey's song - that's got to be one of the best Disney songs of all time."
"__DISNEY__ I even love just the background music too - it reminds me of Disneyland."
"__DISNEY__ I thought that the new movie did a pretty good job too.  Some things were a little different but it was good."
"__DISNEY__ I thought so too. I thought that the actor who played Mogli was really cute."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that it was his first acting job and that's why he just seemed like a normal little boy."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that's so cute. Of course I loved Baloo and Baghera too."
