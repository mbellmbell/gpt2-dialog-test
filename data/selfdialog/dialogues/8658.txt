"__BEATLES__ Do you have a favorite Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ I like them all. How can you have a favorite?"
"__BEATLES__ Each album is a different period of artistic expression. Sargent Peppers is different than Let it Be or the White Album."
"__BEATLES__ Those are good. I guess I always liked Abbey Road. I like the cover."
"__BEATLES__ 'Come Together,' 'Octopus' Garden,' 'Here Comes the Sun' -- all excellent!"
"__BEATLES__ John Lennon, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, what's your favorite song by Paul McCartney on Abbey Road?"
"__BEATLES__ That's easy. 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer,' totally."
"__BEATLES__ There was a lot of activity in the band at that time."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, John Lennon had already left the band and Paul McCartney followed about a year later."
"__BEATLES__ Well, to get back to your question, I guess that Abbey Road is my favorite Beatles album."
