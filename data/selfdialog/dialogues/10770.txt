"__FASHION__ Did you see Taylor Swift's dress at the Grammy's?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, she looked absolutely stunning."
"__FASHION__ I'm trying to remember the name of the designer but it has slipped my mind."
"__FASHION__ I think her name is Versace."
"__FASHION__ Right, yes, that's it!"
"__FASHION__ She has such a great eye for fashion, doesn't she?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, the way she created the dress with big and bold blocks of color was so unique."
"__FASHION__ I agree, it's simple yet dramatic at the same time."
"__FASHION__ Yep, I love when designers play with color for their red carpet dresses like she does."
"__FASHION__ True, but Adele looked amazing too, and her's was just a long black dress."
"__FASHION__ Sometimes the simple classic styles can be the most beautiful, can't they?"
"__FASHION__ Yes!  Although the complex beading on her dress made it much more unique and sophisticated than your average black dress."
"__FASHION__ True, but then you have people like Lady Gaga in her extremely bold Mark Jacob's outfit who really steal the show when it comes to fashion."
"__FASHION__ I must have missed that, what did it look like?"
"__FASHION__ It was an almost electric blue dress, with a suit-like structure."
"__FASHION__ Oh, that's right, and she had on those huge crimson heels!"
"__FASHION__ Yep, she definitely had the most unique outfit of anyone."
"__FASHION__ Lady Gaga is always wearing the most unique fashion of anyone!"
"__FASHION__ I really can't argue with that!"
"__FASHION__ Her fashion sense is just too bold to be contained."
