"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think the greatest quarterback of all time is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a tough one. I don't know if it's Manning or Montana for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think he deserves to be in the conversation?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. I think if he would've had the same career without the controversy we'd have that conversation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're crazy, what controversy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where have you been? Deflategate, spy gate, do those ring a bell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's be honest here though, none of those determined whether or not Brady won the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding me? How is cheating not related to gaining an unfair advantage over the other team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because even if those events wouldn't have happened Brady still would have won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't know that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you don't know that he would've lost if he didn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a pretty good idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll never know, so until that happens he's a winner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, winner with an asterisk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on, hes the greatest quarterback of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he's the greatest QB who had to resort to cheating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you don't think he would've won the same without cheating?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I do not."
