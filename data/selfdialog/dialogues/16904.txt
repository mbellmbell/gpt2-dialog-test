"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness did you see the Dunkirk trailer yet?"
"__MOVIES__ For the World War II movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one! It comes out this summer."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it, I just didn't think you were a WWII film kinda guy."
"__MOVIES__ I mean not necessarily, but this is a Nolan film so I'd go see it no matter what it was about."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, Christopher Nolan did this? I love his films!"
"__MOVIES__ He's easily one of the best directors currently making original works."
"__MOVIES__ Oh for sure! The Prestige is just a masterpiece."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I think it's his best."
"__MOVIES__ Even more than Inception?"
"__MOVIES__ I honestly thought Inception was more predictable, but the Prestige just had so much care in the details."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but Inception is classic."
"__MOVIES__ It does have some incredible special effects, I'll give it that."
"__MOVIES__ That's because Nolan puts so much effort in to keeping all his effects in camera."
"__MOVIES__ I heard about that, didn't he really build all his sets or something?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about all, but I know he built the rotating room in Inception."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! And he also really had people do that plane scene in the beginning of The Dark Knight Rises."
"__MOVIES__ His Batman trilogy is also amazing."
"__MOVIES__ The Dark Knight is easily my favourite super hero film of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I totally agree. I guess I'll have to see Dunkirk after all!"
