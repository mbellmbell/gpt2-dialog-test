"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the upcoming Han Solo film."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am excited about it, but it is hard to imagine anyone but Harrison Ford playing Han."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Alden Ehrenreich has big shoes to fill for sure. I will probably go see it though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. Did I just here that they fired the directors?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were fired because the producers felt the plot was getting too comical and they didn't want to change it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, who is going to finish it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They brought in Ron Howard to do re-shoots and oversee the editing."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is pretty good, I think he can do it. Didn't he work with George Lucas."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he was in American Graffiti and he also Directed Willow for George Lucas."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, yeah, I forgot about Willow. It was really good!"
