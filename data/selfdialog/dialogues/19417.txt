"__MOVIES__ What movie are you most looking forward to?"
"__MOVIES__ Spider man homecoming, for sure!"
"__MOVIES__ I cannot wait for that. Iron man AND spider man."
"__MOVIES__ I know! Have you seen the trailer?!"
"__MOVIES__ Of course. I'm not too big on who they chose for Spider man, though."
"__MOVIES__ I don't mind the guy. No one can beat the original, though."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. I hope its better than the last one."
"__MOVIES__ The last Spidey move was good, but not great."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. But with Tony Stark in this, there's no way it'll be bad"
"__MOVIES__ I sure hope so. Tony is hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if any of the other avengers will be in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think there will be. I saw the cast list and its just Tony."
"__MOVIES__ Thats a bummer. Not even a cameo?"
"__MOVIES__ Not from what I read. Only cameo is Stan Lee, but thats in every movie."
"__MOVIES__ His cameos are amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I know! I think hes been in every Marvel movie."
"__MOVIES__ Only other bummer is that mary jane is out?"
"__MOVIES__ What? She's a main character."
"__MOVIES__ Not in this one!"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I don't know how I feel about that"
