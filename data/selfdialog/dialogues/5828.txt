"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have any movie insights or unknown star wars trivia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well A little bit, I know some of the backstory of the original scripts."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like what? Please do share."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well George's script was originally way too long so he cut the  final two acts and gave the first act of the screenplay as a whole story for star wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ I did not know that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya, the other two acts got made into The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow that would have been way too much story line for one film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, agreed,I am glad they split it up. They would have had to cut out so much content."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think everything happens for a reason, so happy it worked out the way it did."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes for sure a' force'  behind everything!"
