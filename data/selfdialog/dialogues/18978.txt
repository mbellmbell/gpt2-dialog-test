"__MOVIES__ Did you see that there is going to be a Film Noir filmfest in September?"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Where, here in town? Where did you hear about that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's the first time they've ever done it.  I saw it online in the website about film fesitivals, then I emailed the contact person for more information."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Wow- what did they say, what movies are they showing?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the big thing is that they are going to have a special showing of Gun Crazy, and Peggy Cummings is going to be the guest speaker."
"__MOVIES__ Gun Crazy? I love that movie- that's one of my favorite film noir movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I know!  And, Eddie Mueller who did the commentary on the DVD is going to be there as well."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see that!  What other movies were they showing?"
"__MOVIES__ They had a remastered copy of Detour, Ace in the Hole, and let me think what else."
"__MOVIES__ Detour! What, did they clean it up since it's been in public doman for so long."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's been digitized, and it's a great copy- That is my favorite movie, Al's life is just the perfect metaphor for everything that can go wrong will."
"__MOVIES__ I have the book about that movie, they only took a week to shoot it, it's such a classic, it's the perfect noir example, I would love to see it in restored condition."
"__MOVIES__ I think they are also showing an Ida Lupino directed movie that has thought to have been lost, but I can't remember the title, I'd have to look it up."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, was that part of the movies that burnt in that warehose fire back in New Jersey?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably, they've been trying to find copies of them in dfferent countries, I think this one they found in a vault in Chekloslovakia."
"__MOVIES__ That's my dream, to find a lost movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! I really wish I had been able to talk to Eddie Mueller at the film fest I went to in Los Angeles last year, I can't wait for this, I'm such a huge fan of his commentaries and books."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Didnt he do the commentary for Kansas City Confidential?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so- I think they may be showing that as well, I'll have to check, the festival is going to go for 3 days and there are about 20 movies being shown."
"__MOVIES__ We've probably seen most of them already, but it would be so great to see them on the big screen.  I can't wait!"
