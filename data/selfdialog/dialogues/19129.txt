"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies in the past few months?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing new. I'm more into silent films."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever been to that old theater downtown? They play them sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ I go whenever they're showing something good!"
"__MOVIES__ I can't say I've ever seen a silent film before."
"__MOVIES__ Well you like Star Wars right? And Blade Runner?"
"__MOVIES__ Two of my all-time favorites, yes!"
"__MOVIES__ Well then you should check out Metropolis."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of that. What is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a 1926 sci-fi film. The first sci-fi film!"
"__MOVIES__ You know that's my favorite genre."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it was the first of its kind. It was done by Fritz Lang."
"__MOVIES__ Who is Fritz Lang?"
"__MOVIES__ He was a director in Germany. One of the greatest."
"__MOVIES__ Better than Steven Spielberg?"
"__MOVIES__ They're definitely on the same level, although I prefer Lang's stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess, if you prefer the classics!"
"__MOVIES__ The classics force you to pay attention to the plot!"
"__MOVIES__ But they also put me to sleep!"
