"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see that the Green Bay Packers picked up Bennett this offseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't believe he left the Patriots though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think after he won his ring last year, he was just looking for a new atmosphere to play in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to believe he has been with so many teams, I feel like every year it's someone new."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wasn't exactly a bust in Chicago, but that squad wasn't very good so it didn't really go anywhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was in Carolina too, but not many people remember that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had forgotten that he was a Panther for a short time, I just keep thinking about Chicago and New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Green Bay will be a change for him, but he will be going from one great quarterback to another."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is so lucky that at the end of his career he will be able to say that he has caught passes from both Brady and Rodgers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully, he will have won a superbowl with each, too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he has a better chance in Green Bay than in Chicago or New York."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder why Seattle didn't take a look at him, playing with his brother would've been fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that Seattle seems set at tight end, but from a personal standpoint, he would've had fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure Michael would've liked sparring with him at practice!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The way they both have so much passion for the game, it's easy to see why they are both successful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Martellus will add an energy to the Green Bay locker room that will make them stand out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kind of like his brother in Seattle, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both guys are so passionate, but in different ways. Martellus is much more playful in his execution."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably because he is on offense, rather than defense, so the energy is a bit different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does add something interesting to each team he has played on, so we will have to see how Green Bay uses him."
