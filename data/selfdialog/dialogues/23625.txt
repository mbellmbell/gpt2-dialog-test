"__DISNEY__ Did you hear about the little short feature film based on the Disney movie Frozen that's coming out in November?"
"__DISNEY__ No, what's it called?"
"__DISNEY__ Olaf's Frozen Adventure. It's only 21 minutes long, but it sounds cute."

"__DISNEY__ In this one, he's gathering up the best holiday traditions for Anna, Elsa, and Kristoff."
"__DISNEY__ So all those original characters will be in it? That sounds like fun!"
"__DISNEY__ There's going to be four new original songs in it too."
"__DISNEY__ When does it come out?"
"__DISNEY__ November 22, 2017. Right in time for the Christmas holidays."
