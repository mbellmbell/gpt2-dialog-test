"__COMEDY__ Seen any good comedies lately?"
"__COMEDY__ It's been a bit, but I've seen a couple that made me laugh a lot, like Dodgeball."
"__COMEDY__ I remember that one!  'If you can dodge a wretch, you can dodge a ball!'"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, Billy Bob Thornton really made that film!"
"__COMEDY__ Any others?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, I saw Trainwreck and Masterminds, neither of which I cared to much for."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, you gonna jump on the anti-Amy Schumer bandwagon?"
"__COMEDY__ No, no... I mean, I like some of her standup, but for some reason this film didn't really do it for me."
"__COMEDY__ Masterminds... what was that about?"
"__COMEDY__ This guy who works as a armored car guard is convinced by a girl he liked to rob the place."
