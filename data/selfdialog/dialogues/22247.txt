"__DISNEY__ I can't get that song 'Let it Go' out of my head, and the movie Frozen came out years ago!"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe by the time the new one comes out you will have a new song in your head!"
"__DISNEY__ I wasn't even a big fan of the movie.  It definitely wasn't my favorite Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ It wasn't my favorite, but I did not see the plot twist with Hans coming."
"__DISNEY__ I totally thought he was a good guy the whole time!  I loved Kristoff though so I'm not mad."
"__DISNEY__ Olaf was pretty cute too.  His song made me crack up."
"__DISNEY__ He had some of the best lines in the movie!"
"__DISNEY__ I did love the song with the rock trolls though, it was pretty cute."
"__DISNEY__ That scene was great!  But I would feel totally awkward if that was me."
"__DISNEY__ But it was totally funny. And super catchy."
