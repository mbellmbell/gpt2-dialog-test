"__MOVIES__ Did you go to movies last night?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I just saw the best movie. I saw the new alien movie."
"__MOVIES__ Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the new alien creature is awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I love those movies. You never know who is going to bite it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, bunch of people bit it but there's a twist."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's unexpected but I won't spoil it."
"__MOVIES__ Glad it's back on aliens and not on Promethus."
"__MOVIES__ But it's tied together. You can see the link. Big explanation."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm, interesting. I might have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You should. If you saw the others you'll like this one. The space scenes are really cool."
"__MOVIES__ Great. I really like those."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think the lead is from Harry Potter, the Fantastical Beast."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see those. Isn't Fastbender the AI character?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's really good. Kind of still like an android but he makes the movie."
"__MOVIES__ He was great in Assasin's Creed."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see that. Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's wicked. You should check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Will do. Maybe this weekend."
