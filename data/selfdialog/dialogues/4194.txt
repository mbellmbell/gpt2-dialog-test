"__MUSIC__ So what is your favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ That's tough to answer as I like so many!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, then.  Who is your favorite band today?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to say Radiohead."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting.  I liked it when they were more radio friendly..."
"__MUSIC__ I understand but their more experimental music is extraordinary."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  Don't they have a new album coming out soon?"
"__MUSIC__ It seems like they're always working on something!"
"__MUSIC__ Didn't they cover a Smith's song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was The Headmaster's Ritual."
"__MUSIC__ I loved that cover!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they did an excellent job with it!  How did you hear about it?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, actually.  I was on youtube one day and I noticed it."
"__MUSIC__ Are you a Smiths fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I have been since the 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Morrissey is too out there for me."
"__MUSIC__ He is eccentric but one of the best lyricists and most unique singers of all time!"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't argue with you on that!"
"__MUSIC__ You know, I think I'll find my Queen Is Dead album!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's their best I hear!"
