"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see that Houston/Spurs game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, James Harden played terribly."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think it will hurt his MVP chances?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I would imagine so. You going to watch Warriors/Spurs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ For sure, I think it will be a great series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too. The Spurs have a shot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think they could win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know if they could win, but I think they can win a few games at least."
"__BASKETBALL__ Only if Kawhi Leonard is okay, I think."
"__BASKETBALL__ His ankle is fine, so he'll be playing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh really? I hadn't heard."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the coach said he will play game 1 on Sunday."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's good news for the Spurs. Do you think they could win without him?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Win the series? Not a chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed. They could win a game or two but not the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think they could win the whole thing?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not sure. I think it will be a Cavs/Warriors final again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too, which is a shame."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why is it a shame?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I just miss when the league was more competitive."
