"__DISNEY__ Big Hero 6 was well done."
"__DISNEY__ Yes I enjoyed it. Hero was a great character."
"__DISNEY__ I loved Baymax. I bet he feels like a big blow up balloon."
"__DISNEY__ It sure would be fun bouncing on him, ha ha. But seriously it was a good story."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it was sad when Hero's brother died. I was not expecting that."
"__DISNEY__ It does seem like many characters get killed in Disney films."
"__DISNEY__ It is meant to show resiliency in characters I guess."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I don't know how they would have made a good story about that without his brother's death."
"__DISNEY__ Yes sometimes good characters die."
"__DISNEY__ I cried when the original Baymax also 'died'. Glad he gave Hero his disk so he could rebuild him."
