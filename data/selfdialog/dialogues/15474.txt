"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, yeah. I saw all of them in the theater when they came out."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, so you remember what happened to Cedric Diggory, right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course. That scene was absolutely heart rending."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right? When they come out and Harry is crying over Cedric but the music just keeps playing, and everyone is clapping?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I still cry when I watch it and I've seen it like five times."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know. The first time you see it you're just so shocked, but every time after that there is just a sense of dread before it happens."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you ever secretly root for him to live even though you obviously know he's going to die?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought I was the only one who did that!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Nope! I do it, too. Not just with Harry Potter, but with a bunch of other movies, too."
