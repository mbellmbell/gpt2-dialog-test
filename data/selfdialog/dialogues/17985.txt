"__MOVIES__ Do you like horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not really, what about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Only if they're not that gory...more psychological type thrillers"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, although I don't mind some of the old 80s slasher flicks"
"__MOVIES__ I remember watching one of the Halloween movies when I was young"
"__MOVIES__ How did that go over for you"
"__MOVIES__ I was scared for weeks after watching the movie"
"__MOVIES__ Michael Meyers?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was definitely a scary looking dude"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the Freddy Krueger ones were kind of campy"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those were almost a parody of horror movies"
"__MOVIES__ And then there was the Friday the 13th series"
"__MOVIES__ yeah another series that was a bit campy"
"__MOVIES__ The first one was good, but they rapidly deteriorated after that"
"__MOVIES__ Today's horror movies seem pretty gory"
"__MOVIES__ Some, but not all. There was a really good one called Get Out that came out recently"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I heard about that one"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, definitely a mind bending...not super gory"
"__MOVIES__ Not like Saw"
"__MOVIES__ No, nothing like that one."
