"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you want to win the Superbowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely want the Detroit Lions to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they have a chance, coming off that disappointing first round loss in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I think they took a step forward last year, even with the loss of Megatron."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but Matthew Stafford pretty much carried the team, he can't do that every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they had alot of injuries, so he was forced to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think they can do it, if they stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hopeful that they can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely want the Cowboys to take it home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear about the recent news with Dak Prescott?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, what happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He used an auto-pen to sign a bunch of football cards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that's kind of immoral."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and it's been a week and he hasn't said anything about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's probably waiting for his lawyers to release a statement, what about the card manufacturers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, Panini hasn't said anything either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that's a bad situation, but I still want them to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Dak and Ezekiel can have a crazy sophomore season, I think there's a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, hopefully they can keep the off field issues under control."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'd be crazy if Dak got suspended for it!"
