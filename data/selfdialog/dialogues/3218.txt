"__MUSIC__ Okay, I posted this question in an internet as a joke, but I don't think anyone got it."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, lay it on me..."
"__MUSIC__ I said, 'Who do you think is more devoted to their potential lover: the Proclaimers or Vanessa Carlton?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm.... uh.. shoot, I'm sorry, you may have to explain that to me."
"__MUSIC__ Ahhh. man, I figured you would get it."
"__MUSIC__ Sorry, bro."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, here it is: the Proclaimers came up with a song call '500 Miles' where they say, 'And I would walk 500 hundred miles and I would walk 500 hundred more...'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, I remember that.. uh.. what was it?  'Just to be the man who'd walk 1,000 miles to fall at your door'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, pretty close.  And Vanessa Carlton had a big hit called, 'A Thousand Miles' where she says, 'And you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you.'"
"__MUSIC__ Wait, wait.. that's the video where the girl's playing on the piano while the background seems to be like, passing by her in the background."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's it!  If you're curious, they did that by mounting the piano on the back of a truck."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool.  Alright, NOW I get it.. .it's an interesting question though.. since they'd go travel the same distance."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I didn't mean for it to be a real philosophical discussion.  The thought just popped in my head and I thought it was funny."
"__MUSIC__ Well, let's tackle it though.  They're both going 1,000 miles, but I gotta give to the Proclaimers."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they're will to travel all that way just to FALL DOWN at their lover's door.  They say nothing about actually being able to see her.  (I'm assuming it's a 'her', but dunno.)"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, yeah, and Vanessa wants to actually SEE her lover in exchange for all this travel."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Man, the crazy stuff we talk about sometimes, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.... hehe."
