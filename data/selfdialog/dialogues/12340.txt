"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football season's starting soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it is. I've got my Sunday's booked then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How're the Bears looking this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're a mess, as usual."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, why so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Starting at the top, the QB situation is questionable at best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't believe in Mike Glennon?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's okay, but there's a reason he's been a back up for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Trubiskey?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The rookie? I hope they don't rush him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if Glennon does poorly, the fans will call for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but there's no point in throwing a rookie into the fire with a weak team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, letting Alshon Jeffrey leave didn't help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a top receiver for any team, but he might be a waste on the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he'll do well with the Eagles this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. I really do like him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He can really play, bummer about the Bears though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking last in the division this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll find out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so."
