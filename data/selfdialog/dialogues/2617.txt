"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you ever listen to band from the 70s and 80s?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I really enjoy that kind of music, especially the classic rock."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! That's my favorite genre during that time."
"__MUSIC__ One of mine too, but I enjoy disco too! What are some of your favorite bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Journey is one of my favorite bands in that time, but really it is just one of my favorite bands."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely! They have some of the best music, and they have many songs that topped the charts."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and I know I hear them being used pretty often in movies. I don't even think they made a song that wasn't good."
"__MUSIC__ I think your're right. They are the kinds of songs that so many age groups enjoy."
"__MUSIC__ True, my daughter is one of them, and she is only 13. By the way, her name is Journey!"
"__MUSIC__ Really? Did you name her after the band?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha, no, it was just a coincidence. But, she likes that her name is the same as the band."
"__MUSIC__ I bet people ask her about it all the time, if she was named after the band."
"__MUSIC__ They do! She doesn't mind. What's your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say, 'Faithfully'. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to go with 'Don't stop Believing'. It's so great!"
"__MUSIC__ It is, but so is 'Wheel in the Sky'. So many great songs from them."
"__MUSIC__ I know, even 20 plus years later."
"__MUSIC__ True! I think they will always be popular."
"__MUSIC__ No doubt, they will be heard and remembered for years."
"__MUSIC__ I agree!"
