"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What kind of year are the Colts going to have, you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not sure. I don't keep up much with AFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've got Andrew Luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't he the highest paid player, or was?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, I used to think he was really slow but it turns out he's pretty fast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought the same thing. I thought he was a real plodder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Get a good pass rush on him and he was toast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I think I heard he runs like a 4.4 forty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's pretty good. Faster than a lot of QBs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Faster than Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, old man Brady. I got to say the guy is good even if I don't like him much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it's human nature to root for the underdog and Brady's no underdog."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Belichick as a coach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I kind of feel about him the same way I feel about Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I admire him and I think he's a great coach but I can't cheer for his team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's like they don't need cheering for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like a machine, a winning machine. Hard to cheer for a machine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that. I'm with you, man."
