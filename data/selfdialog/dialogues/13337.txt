"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited for the football season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! I can't wait. Who do you think is going to win the NFC East?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Cowboys will win it again. They have a great quarterback and runningback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I think the Redskins have a really good shot this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Redskins have a tough schedule though. It will either be Dallas or NY Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think the Giants will be good this year. Eli Manning is getting old and they don't have a good run game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On second thought, I wouldn't count the Eagles out either. Carson Wentz was pretty good last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True he was but they need help in other areas and aren't ready to compete in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the NFC North?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to imagine anyone but Packers winning it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lions were good last year and they've gotten stronger in the off season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Matt Stafford is still overrated and has yet to show he can win big games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Rodgers is getting older. Maybe Minnesota can step up this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they lost Peterson which is going to make it tough for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One this for sure is that the Bears are going to be terrible again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They just can't seem to find a decent quarterback. At least their running game is good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think wins NFC South?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons again, no doubt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And NFC West?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going out on a limb and saying Rams!"
