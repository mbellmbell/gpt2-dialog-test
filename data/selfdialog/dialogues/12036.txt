"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you thing the Saints are going to do next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What city are they from again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ New Orleans, LA is their home town. They play in the Superdome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is one of the largest stadiums to play in I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I think they will do well next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you sure? Their performance has been dropping off lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have Drew Brees. He's on of the highest ranked quarterbacks in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right. He won MVP when they went to the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's pretty amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but do you think he'll be able to pull the whole team this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a great all-around team. They'll be fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I though he lost a lot of his receivers this past season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they picked some good ones at the last draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. Having a killer passing arm doesn't do any good if he has no one to throw to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. What do you think they will be strongest at, offence or defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Defense for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They haven't had an amazing defense since the 1990s. They need points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but you have to stop the other team from scoring to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I still think the offence will be their strong suit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll see when the season starts."
