"__MUSIC__ Man, whatever happened to that bull Canibus?"
"__MUSIC__ I think L L Cool J ended his career."
"__MUSIC__ What you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember they had that beef over the song 4,3,2,1 ?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know they had beef."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Canibus did a verse on the remix. L L thought it was a dis, so he deleted the verse from the song."
"__MUSIC__ I think I do remember hearing about that. That song was still hot though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. But Canibus bowed out of the game."
"__MUSIC__ He was a beast. He did a feature with the Lost Boyz and like Redman."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. That song was called Beasts From the East."
"__MUSIC__ Canibus had the hottest verse on the track."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he did, but A + had a verse on that track which was just as hot."
"__MUSIC__ I forgot all about A +. What happened to him."
"__MUSIC__ He was a young bull when he was in the game. He made like a solo album but it wasn't that hot."
"__MUSIC__ I liked him. Do you remember M C Shan?"
"__MUSIC__ Do I remember? I got Living in the World of Hip Hop on like five of my playlists."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that song was tight. I remember when Shan was beefing with KRS-One."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Shan made The Bridge and then KRS came back with The BRidge is Over."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. The way The Bridge is Over starts out? That bass line."
"__MUSIC__ KRS was that dude. I liked him back when Scott La Rock was still alive."
