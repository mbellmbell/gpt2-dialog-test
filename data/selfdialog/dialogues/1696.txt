"__MUSIC__ I am going on a road trip tomorrow. Can you recommend a CD or two I should listen to while I'm driving?"
"__MUSIC__ I am sure I can. Are you looking for a specific type of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I would like to hear something I am not familiar with, maybe something older."
"__MUSIC__ I have the perfect thing. Have you heard of Jim Croce?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I can't say that I have.  What kind of music does he make?"
"__MUSIC__ I would call it American Folk with some rock mixed in."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds really interesting."
"__MUSIC__ You have probably heard at least one of his songs. I still hear 'Time in a Bottle' on the radio every once in a while."
"__MUSIC__ I think I may have heard that one but, I don't really remember."
"__MUSIC__ That song is popular but, I have other reasons for liking him."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Tell me a little about what you like."
"__MUSIC__ He has a song that includes the lyrics 'New York's not my home.  When I lived in New York for a couple of years, I listened to that song probably 5 times a day."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like a really sad song."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you could call it sad. I would personally say it was not so much sad for me, it just had a lot of deep meaning."
"__MUSIC__ I am anxious to hear it now but, I will save it for the trip."
"__MUSIC__ Make sure you pay attention to 'Lover's Cross' that one has a lot of meaning for me too."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you so much, this guy sounds great. Is he still making albums?"
"__MUSIC__ No, unfortunately a plane crash took his life early on. He was young and had only made 5 albums."
"__MUSIC__ That is terrible. I wonder why plane crashes take so many notable musicians."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that is one of the mysteries of the world my friend."
