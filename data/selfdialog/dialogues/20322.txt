"__MOVIES__ You know what movie I just watched?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what?"
"__MOVIES__ Arachnaphobia!  That's such a scary movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh whatever!  It didn't scare me at all."
"__MOVIES__ You weren't scared by the spiders?  Gosh, I can't get them out of my mind."
"__MOVIES__ No, I thought they were absurd.  Nothing like that really exists."
"__MOVIES__ Well it scared me.  They were huge."
"__MOVIES__ Unrealistically so!  The whole movie was silly."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think so.  There are some pretty big spiders out there."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was silly.  Plus the plot was weak."
"__MOVIES__ You thought so? I found it to be suspenseful."
"__MOVIES__ Nahh.  That movie came out back in 1990 right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  It's almost thirty years old."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably why it's so lame.  The special effects were weak back then."
"__MOVIES__ I thought they were pretty good for being so old."
"__MOVIES__ No.  Imagine if they did a remake!  That would be horrifying."
"__MOVIES__ It wouldn't be as good as the original.  Plus John Goodman is great."
"__MOVIES__ I don't care for him much."
"__MOVIES__ Well geez, you really hated the movie didn't you!"
"__MOVIES__ I told you it's not one of my favorites."
