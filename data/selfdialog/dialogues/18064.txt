"__MOVIES__ Any good kids movies coming out this summer?"
"__MOVIES__ There is a “Capitan Underpants” one, if your kids like this kind of humor."
"__MOVIES__ That is for elementary and middle school kids I assume since the books are. Is it a cartoon?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Do you care if they are cartoons or not?"
"__MOVIES__ It doesn’t matter either way as long as they are child friendly."
"__MOVIES__ Well, “Despicable Me 3” and “Cars 3” are both cartoons, and for kids."
"__MOVIES__ What about ones that aren’t cartoons?"
"__MOVIES__ There is a Whimpy Kid movie that is still for the younger crowd, but not a cartoon."
"__MOVIES__ What about movies for older kids?"
"__MOVIES__ “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” and “King Arthur” are out already, and are probably good for teens but not little kids."
"__MOVIES__ They don’t need to be G rated or anything."
"__MOVIES__ There is a new Pirates, with Depp of course, out now. Also, Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ It is so expensive though to take kids to the movies, I want to make sure they really want to go and will enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the major movie chains offer really cheap movies during the summer, on weekday mornings I think."
"__MOVIES__ Are they new ones, or at least reasonably new?"
"__MOVIES__ I know Regal has some including “Kung Fu Panda 3” and “Trolls”"
"__MOVIES__ Those aren’t too old."
"__MOVIES__ There is also “The Lego Batman Movie” and “Sing” so they seem like they are within the last couple years. The all seem good for elementary aged kids."
"__MOVIES__ How much are the movies at Regal?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it is only a dollar."
