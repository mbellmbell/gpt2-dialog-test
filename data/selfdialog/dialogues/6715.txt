"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really did not like it, although it could be due to the script itself."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree.  While he may not have been the best actor, the writing did not help."
"__STAR_WARS__ While we're on the subject, who do you think was the best actor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I actually think the best actor may have been Ian McDiarmid."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who did he play?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was the one who portrayed Emperor Palpatine in the prequel series."
"__STAR_WARS__ Any scenes come to mind in particular?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Ian McDiarmid's scene in 'Revenge of the Sith' inside the theater, when he manipulates Anakin was so well acted."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a good scene.  A very haunting performance indeed."
