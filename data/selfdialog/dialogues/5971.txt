"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think so, was that the one about the Death Star?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, no that was Rogue One, this one occurred after Return of Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, but I thought there was a Death Star in this one too"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, there was a planet like the Death Star that blew things up"
"__STAR_WARS__ But isn't that what the Death Star is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, the Death Star is a space station not a planet"
"__STAR_WARS__ But I thought it was as big as a planet"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, more like the size of a small moon"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so confused"
