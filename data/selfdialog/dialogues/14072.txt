"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think will make the NBA finals this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I assume it will be Cleveland and Golden State again."
"__BASKETBALL__ I heard that the same two teams have never met in the NBA finals three consecutive years."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's pretty interesting. I didn't know that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but I agree with you. Those two are the best again this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess someone could get injured."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's always a possibility."
"__BASKETBALL__ But both teams have been blowing through the early rounds with no trouble at all."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I've barely even watched their games because I knew they would be blowouts."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wonder if the Spurs will give Golden State any trouble?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, they'll certainly be more of a challenge than Utah and Portland."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, those series were a joke."
"__BASKETBALL__ San Antonio can never be counted out."
"__BASKETBALL__ They're kind of like the Patriots of the NBA."
"__BASKETBALL__ Right. Popovich is a lot like Belichick."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he always finds a way to make things work for the team."
"__BASKETBALL__ I really hope we get to see the Cavaliers and Warriors again though."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know. That's the matchup I think most people want to see."
"__BASKETBALL__ If everyone stays healthy we'll be seeing round 3 soon enough."
"__BASKETBALL__ Let's hope so!"
