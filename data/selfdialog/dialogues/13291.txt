"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's going to be the worst team in the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it wrong that my mind instantly flashes to the Browns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, can't blame you. They've been bad for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That said, I actually liked their draft last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But is that going to be enough to change their fortunes next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It might take a couple of years, and a few more good drafts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they've certainly had some bad drafts in recent years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the 49ers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're a contender for worst team, if only because I don't like their quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The surest way to have a terrible record in the NFL is to have no stability at the QB position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the 49s could bounce back a little, though. They have some some talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about good old Jacksonville?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now there's a team with talent! If Jacksonville could figure out the QB position, I think they could be really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that's what picking at the top of the draft year after year does for you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they've stock piled some really good players, especially on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think the Jaguars will underperform this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't bet against you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Bears will be better, so my final answer is the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair enough. They really do need to figure out their QB situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and I don't think they get it done."
