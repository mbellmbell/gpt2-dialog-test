"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think was the biggest offseason acquisition this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly it is hard to pick just one, there are so many players moving teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well ok, pick one that you can think of that has some importance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Brandon Marshall the WR signing with the Giants was a big deal"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Him and Odell Beckham should make a good duo that is for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not just them being a duo, Marshall should take some pressure off people double teaming OBJ"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sterling Shepherd should have a decent season because of Marshall as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Him and the new TE they drafted should see plenty of looks based on how they spread the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The passing game seems to be there for the Giants, but the running game is still lacking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Paul Perkins looks like he could be the starter with Rashad Jennings filling in. I am not sure on their ceiling though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Shane Vereen has always been a good 3rd down back"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has, I am not sold on Perkins nor Jennings on being the bell cow of the Giants backfield"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to pick, I would say Jennings will be the top guy based on the fact he has been around the longest"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could be true but young guys are always looking to take their chance"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How far do you see the Giants going?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will finish 8-8. Eli Manning just isn't as good as he used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any other offseason moves you think are important?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ WR Alshon Jeffery going to the Eagles is big."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a fact, he should prove to be a huge weapon for that offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wentz should be a better QB because of Jeffery. Hopefully he stays healthy."
