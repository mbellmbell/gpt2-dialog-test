"__MOVIES__ Hey, do you want to go and see that wimpy kid movie with me?"
"__MOVIES__ Wimpy kid? Oh you mean Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it looks like it will be a riot."
"__MOVIES__ I went to see two night ago."
"__MOVIES__ You did? How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ This is one of the worst movies of 2017. And it's only May."
"__MOVIES__ That's brutal. What was wrong with it?"
"__MOVIES__ It is a less-funny, remake -another one, I mean, of- National Lampoon's Vacation."
"__MOVIES__ National Lampoon's Vacation. Now that is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is and this movie is not even in the same ball field."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like  Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul' is the common type of road trip movie, the one where everything that can go wrong does go wrong."
"__MOVIES__ It'll have the grownups asking the kids: 'Are we there yet?'"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you were expecting too much from the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I just wanted a good laugh for my money. This movie did not deliver."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure, Wimpy Kid fans will embrace the movie and its jokes."
"__MOVIES__ You'll never know how good the first three Diary of a Wimpy Kid movies were until you're forced to see the fourth one."
"__MOVIES__ I think the  appeal of a Wimpy Kid movie is in seeing that kid play off against those who aren't so wimpy."
"__MOVIES__ Almost worth it for the 'Psycho' shower scene send-up. Almost."
"__MOVIES__ Don't spoil it for me."
"__MOVIES__ You're going to wish I had."
