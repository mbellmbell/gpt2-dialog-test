"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think about the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to get excited, with the Bears basically in a rebuild."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, nothing is more underwhelming than Mike Glennon. Not bad, but not thrilling."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. Hopefully Trubisky shows up earlier than expected."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't feel great about that pick. The history of Bears QBs and all that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotta hope. At least we get a new GM if he flops."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but Pace will have at least another couple years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not looking forward to another transition, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Flip flopping from a 4-3 to a 3-4 takes enough time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel bad for the other side of the ball, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jordan Howard emerges, but it's on a team going nowhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, and who knows which receivers will be healthy by week three."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But then Kevin White is almost like a rookie again, so there's hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A rookie with no good ankles. I'm not optimistic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the real rookies, other than Trubisky?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's awfully small-school heavy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the TE, Shaheen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking about that tiny 3rd-down back they took later."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't like Tarik Cohen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he turns into the next Devin Hester, fine, but there aren't too many of those."
