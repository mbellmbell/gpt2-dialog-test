"__DISNEY__ Which movie reinforces gender stereotypes? I'm thinking of holding a discussion about patriarchal themes in films with my literature group."
"__DISNEY__ At the top of my head, I'm going with Cinderella. It's a classic example of societal norms and expectations for women in the '50s."
"__DISNEY__ Hm, female politics in Disney movies? That sounds super exciting."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, you can talk about beauty standards and the need to fit those standards in order to find a man."
"__DISNEY__ How so?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, how about the fact that all the women in the kingdom got all dolled up for the prince?"
"__DISNEY__ I forget how the story goes. Wasn't there some sort of ball?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. They were all invited to be eligible to be the prince's bride."
"__DISNEY__ Ah, right. And the prince had to choose his future queen based on looks."
"__DISNEY__ That sends a negative message to viewers, which was basically that women had to rely on her looks to get married."
