"__MUSIC__ Hey, Ms. T. What kind of music do you listen to? You listen to Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Nah. I like all the genres, but just the really good stuff from each one."
"__MUSIC__ I bet you like that country music though."
"__MUSIC__ I like my country prior to the 90s. Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn. But that's not all I like."
"__MUSIC__ What? Maybe you like that Classic Rock stuff. What's that. . . Queen?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. Freddy Mercury spends a lot of time in my head and in my CD player. He's a good ol' fashioned loverboy! Ha. I never got into the Doobie Brothers, but Tom Petty? Yessss. And Jimi Hendrix? I like a lot of different music types. Could you tell?"
"__MUSIC__ My dad likes to listen to some screaming stuff, really loud and thrashy. Metallica? Is that a thing. Oh, and some Judas preacher, or something."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Metallica is bad-A, but I'm not huge into the heavy stuff. And you know I don't like loud stuff. But I'm a huge fan of the music on Cartoon Network's Metalocalypse. Have you seen that one?? Brendon Smalls is a genius. Did Loren Bouchard work on that one?? Bob's Burgers is his, and it always has music too. Why am I asking you? Never mind."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite of all the music?"
"__MUSIC__ Classical music runs through my veins. Even opera. You should listen to Carmina Burana, Carl Orff. You've probably heard part of it on horror movie soundtracks."
"__MUSIC__ I can't get with opera. (sings random notes in falsetto)"
"__MUSIC__ Or, hey! You want heavy metal? The great great grandfather of metal, Mr. Mozart, and his Requiem. That jank ain' messing around."
"__MUSIC__ You're crazy, Ms. T. Don't you listen to anything normal? Anything, like, from less than a decade ago? And especially not hundreds of years ago, dang."
"__MUSIC__ I had a boss once that made me learn the words to the first few verses of 'It takes 2 to make a thing go right.' Want me to rap for you?"
"__MUSIC__ How about no? And I said LESS than a decade ago, ol' lady."
"__MUSIC__ How about Pink Floyd?  They go all the way back to the 60s, but the members are STILL putting out new stuff, as recent as, 2016, I think, with Endless River."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they started out pretty psychodelic, but after Syd Barrett left the band, their music just turned into a gorgeous psychological exploration of life and emotion. If you've never listened to Dark Side, you're missing out."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'll check it out. Do me a favor. Go home tonight and listen to Kanye."
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe. But only if you go home and listen to Outkast and the WuTang Clan!"
