"__DISNEY__ Did you know that Bambi is coming out on Blu Ray?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I heard that today actually."
"__DISNEY__ I saw an interview with the men who had played Thumper and Bambi not that long ago."
"__DISNEY__ Really? That is cool. What did they say?"
"__DISNEY__ They were only 4 and 5 when they did the film and it took 3 years for them to make it."
"__DISNEY__ Wow that is a long time."
"__DISNEY__ Yes they had to do voice work every once in a while whenever changes were made."
"__DISNEY__ Well then it is good that they were so young as their voices could not have changed much."
"__DISNEY__ Yes , they also said that kids still mail them pictures of Bambi and Thumper."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that is really sweet. Must make them feel so great!"
