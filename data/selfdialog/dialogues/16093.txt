"__ROCK__ I love how even though they're somewhat of a joke rock band, they can still genuinely rock."
"__ROCK__ Oh totally, Jack Black has a great voice and Kyle Gass can shred."
"__ROCK__ It's even better when they get Dave Grohl to guest on drums."
"__ROCK__ Him as the devil in Pick of Destiny was a great treat."
"__ROCK__ What's your favorite Tenacious D song?"
