"__MOVIES__ You know what movie we should watch that I haven't seen in ages?"
"__MOVIES__ That's not very helpful.  I could probably name a thousand movies."
"__MOVIES__ Willow.  Do you remember Willow?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes.  The one with the midget."
"__MOVIES__ That's a horrible description for the film."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm not sure how else to put it really."
"__MOVIES__ First off, he's not a midget, he's a dwarf.  Secondly, it was a period piece."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't a period piece.  It's fantasy, we never had a time of magic like that."
"__MOVIES__ You get what I mean.  Anyway, that was a pretty solid film back in the late 80's."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't Ron Howard direct that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he did.  It was one of his bigger projects to that date."
"__MOVIES__ I remember Val Kilmer was also in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he played the hero swordsman.  That was 30 years ago when he was in much better shape."
"__MOVIES__ He played the character pretty well as the character had a bit of an edge to him."
"__MOVIES__ I always hated that scene where she was turning everyone into pigs."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that!  Gave me nightmares as a child."
"__MOVIES__ She kept saying 'You're all PIGS!' and the soldiers are in agony turning into pigs."
"__MOVIES__ Don't remind me.  I told you, it gives me nightmares."
"__MOVIES__ You know what, maybe we shouldn't watch it now that I think about it."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  I don't need to relive those nightmares."
