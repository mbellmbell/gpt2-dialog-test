"__MOVIES__ I hate the movie Mean Girls."
"__MOVIES__ Why? That movie is such a classic."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but whenever I watch it I just find myself getting annoyed with the characters."
"__MOVIES__ Ah. I see what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ I just hate how fake Regina George is, and then Cady ends up just like her!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but at least Janis and Damian were pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess you're right."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever end up watching Mean Girls 2?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've never heard about it."
"__MOVIES__ It didn't have a theatrical release. It premiered on ABC Family."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really. Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good for a television film."
"__MOVIES__ Some of these television movies nowadays are not so bad."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I loved Big Driver."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Maria Bello was so good in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ The cameo by Joan Jett was nice as well."
"__MOVIES__ Totally. Did you ever see A Good Marriage?"
"__MOVIES__ No. What is that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ That one is based on a Stephen King novella just like Big Driver."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. It must be so cool for him to see his books brought to life on screen."
