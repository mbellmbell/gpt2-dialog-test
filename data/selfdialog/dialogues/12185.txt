"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! Doesn't the NFL pre-season start soon?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kind of, right now its still training camp and the pre-season games won't start until September."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotcha. How are your Packers looking this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So far I like what I see at training camp, but we are still a long way from football season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know how I feel about the changes to the Redskins office, I feel like it can go either way at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I heard there were some big changes on the offensive line and the coaching staff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think any big name players might be playing their last season this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, Brees is getting old and so is Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Brady has been having some great seasons! He is ready for retirement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but personally I'd rather quit while I'm ahead than stay in the game and go out with a loosing season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does this mean you think your Packers stand a chance against the Patriots this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course! But, I'm not so sure the Patriots will be up for a repeat performance of last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to get tickets to any games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, they are really expensive and I'd have to travel a few hours."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which ones are you looking at?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Packers have a pre-season game in DC against the Redskins, and there is a game just before Christmas against the Panthers in North Carolina"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The pre-season game would not be as exciting as the game against the Panthers. They had a great season last year, it should be a good game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the pre-season game has cheaper tickets. That and the game against the Panthers is on my birthday and that would suck if the Packers lost."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, let me know if you go to the pre-season game in DC. I'd love to check out the new recruits for the Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure thing! I'll look at tickets tonight."
