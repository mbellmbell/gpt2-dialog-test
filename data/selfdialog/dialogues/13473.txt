"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Cowboys defense will be next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It should be great compared to last season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh? They lost several key defensive players over the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nolan Carroll and Barry Church are two that come to mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they were ok last season but they gave up big plays. The team didn't lose much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are they going to make up for those guys and the others they lost on defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you not watch the draft this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. Who did the Cowboys pick up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They used their first pick on Taco Charlton a defensive end out of Michigan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Never heard of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a beast! Taco will be an impact player his first league in the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds promising. Who else did they pick up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chidobe Awuzie! Say that five times fast. He is a cornerback from Colorado."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a strange name. So they used their first two picks for defensive players. That's a good sign."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they made great choices with those two and they also picked up two more cornerbacks and a safety with their remaining picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow! They did go defense heavy in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys are not dumb. They saw the problems last year and went out and got what they needed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like it. How good do you expect such a young defense to be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There will be some growing pains for sure but I think they will step up and get the job done."
