"__FASHION__ It looks like all the clothes are going to have holes in them again this summer."
"__FASHION__ Oh you mean all the eyelet. There's eyelet every summer."
"__FASHION__ Yes and I hate it. I always think people are evaluating my underwear."
"__FASHION__ It's meant to be cooling. In fact it is cooling."
"__FASHION__ Not if you wear a camisole and slip underneath, it's not."
"__FASHION__ So don't."
"__FASHION__ Pardon me if I'm shy."
"__FASHION__ Marcie, nobody wants to see our stuff, we're old. Besides, everybody else will be in shorts and crop tops."
"__FASHION__ That's true, Elise. Don't mind me."
"__FASHION__ Get yourself a nice eyelet blouse, and let the breezes blow."
"__FASHION__ Hmm. Maybe a little eyelet around the top or bottom. Just to be airy."
"__FASHION__ That's the spirit. Summer is for breezy fashions."
"__FASHION__ Okay. Come shopping with me?"
"__FASHION__ What do you mean? You're supposed to shop from your computer."
"__FASHION__ Oh. I never have."
"__FASHION__ It's great. Your big airy bedroom is your dressing room, and they usually pay for shippping whatever you return."
"__FASHION__ Really?"
"__FASHION__ Really. It's the greatest fashion advance since eyelet."
"__FASHION__ Maybe I'll try it."
"__FASHION__ Do that. It's so cool."
