"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where are you from?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I live in Boston now but I'm actually from a town right outside Boston called Foxborough?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's where the Gillette Stadium is right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! Have you been to Foxborough??"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but I've seen it many times on ESPN. Gillette is home to the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, as a matter of fact it is. So you're a fan of the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I don't watch much football. My boyfriend watches it all the time and he supports Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have been a Patriots fan for many years now. They're the best!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they really the best, or do you only support them because they're based in your hometown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A bit of both I guess. I like being local to my community."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It helps that the team in your community is very popular. My boyfriend has only been supporting them since they won Superbowl a couple years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I support them whether or not they win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just to get on my boyfriend's nerve I sometimes say that I'm a Jets fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he's a true Patriots fan he probably gets very angry at you!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? I don't get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NY Jets are our enemies! The Jets Vs Patriots is one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they any good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they are. Not as good the Patriots of course"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, of course not!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots til I die!!"
