"__MUSIC__ Are you a Billy Joel fan?"

"__MUSIC__ I just want to strut down the streets of Manhattan after listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ I want to go to one of his concerts at Madison Square Garden."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I hear they're absolutely incredible."
"__MUSIC__ I heard there's nothing better than hearing him singing in front of his home crowd."
"__MUSIC__ I heard the exact same thing."
"__MUSIC__ We should go!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. I would love to hear him sing 'Piano Man' live."
"__MUSIC__ That would be a dream come true for me."
"__MUSIC__ I also want to hear 'We Didn't Start the Fire' live."
"__MUSIC__ I've tried so many times to memorize the lyrics to that song but I just could never do it."
