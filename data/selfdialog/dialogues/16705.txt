"__MOVIES__ What are some movies that you would recommend for guys?"
"__MOVIES__ New films?"
"__MOVIES__ No they can be from any point in time."
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say all of the 'Die Hard', 'Rocky' series and the front half of the Terminator series."
"__MOVIES__ Why only the front half?"
"__MOVIES__ The tail end of the series starting going all girl power on the audience. It was a real turn off."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, now I remember.  Sarah turned into some kind of tough woman that don't need a man. I thought it was pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah thats the problem. It was funny."
"__MOVIES__ Seems like you hated it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did. I don't like whn a serious toned movie is turned into a comedy. It really ruins the series."
"__MOVIES__ Where would you say you would stop watching the series?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd stop watching at Terminator 2 personally, but part 3 is watchable."
"__MOVIES__ Wait in part 2 Sarah was a pretty tough individual."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it wasn't forced and she grew into that from the first film."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, now that you mention it I see the character development."
"__MOVIES__ Now in the later films she's just magically this rough and tough person that has everything figured out."
"__MOVIES__ They never explained it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not at all. What's worse is the actress wasn't even convincing. She literally looked like she was putting on an act."
"__MOVIES__ How was Linda Hamilton when she played the role?"
"__MOVIES__ She was very believeable and natural."
