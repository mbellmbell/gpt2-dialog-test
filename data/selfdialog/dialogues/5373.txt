"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Rey is one of the Skywalker kids?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I do not."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then why does she have the force?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe she is a new breed of Jedi, maybe something like Anakin was."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was he?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was half force and half human, he was made with metachlorins."
"__STAR_WARS__ The things the force is made up of?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, when Qui Con Gin was speaking to his mom about his skills, she told him that."
"__STAR_WARS__ And he thought that possible?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, actually, but he tested him. Anakin's blood was off the chart with metachlorins."
