"__STAR_WARS__ Which do you like better - the original Star Wars or the 'enhanced' version?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm kind of a purist when it comes to movies. The original version will always be my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why? The special effects aren't as good, Han fired first..."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's because I saw the original Star Wars about 50 times in theaters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, you are a true fan."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was my dad's favorite film, so we would all pile in the car every few weekends and go see it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, I can see why the original would be a sort of 'memory movie' for you."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see the enhanced version, and all the sweat and blood that went into on-set effects is gone, replaced by CGI."
"__STAR_WARS__ I always thought most people would like the improved version."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me, I don't necessarily regard the changes as 'improvements.' Not bad, just different from what I remember."
