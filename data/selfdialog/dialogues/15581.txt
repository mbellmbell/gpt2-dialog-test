"__HARRY_POTTER__ So now that you have finished the entire series, what is your final Snape opinion?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh wow, I don't even know yet. I am still processing. I think I have always felt like Snape wasn't evil."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Even at the end of Half-Blood Prince?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, I had a feeling more was going on. Good old Rowling!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I had my doubts though. I still don't think he is all good. I mean, he still did really bad things."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree. And the reason he was good-ish at the end was because he was obsessed with a dead woman who didn't even love him!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly! But man, I was crying with the whole Snape flashback."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Alan Rickman was absolutely amazing at that part. That was incredibly emotional."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He really was. And people say that's a kid's movie!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right! It so isn't! Snape redeemed himself."
