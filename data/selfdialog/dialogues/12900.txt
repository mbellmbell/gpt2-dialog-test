"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either, the kids will love watching the NFL games in the man cave too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think the Saints are gonna go all the way this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope! The Saints haven't been able to capture the magic they once had during the 2009 season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the 2010 Saints super bowl win was magical for the team and the city of New Orleans."
