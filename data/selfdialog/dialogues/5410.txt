"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Kylo Ren is a good proxy for Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, he is not even a close second."
"__STAR_WARS__ You do not like the character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is not that I do not like him, it is just that he is not even that bad of a bad guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ In what way?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he could have killed Rey. He was even sad killing his dad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Anyone would be, I am sure Anakin was sad killing Obi Wan Kanobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ He may have been, but SIth lose all their light. Vader was not sad at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Vader gained remorse, so Kylo can have a bit too?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He gained it at death, at the hands of all the light Jedi in his son, Kylo is just weak. He can not even stand up to an officer."
