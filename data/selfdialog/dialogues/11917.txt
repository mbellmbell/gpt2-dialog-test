"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's up man?  You ready to watch the nfl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure am!  Too bad you don't have any team to root for now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know, the Chargers left San Diego this year.  They're they LA Chargers now..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right.  It must kinda suck for you since you were a big fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't know if I'll root for them. I'll probably watch a few games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it's basically the same team.  Rivers, Gates and crew."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your'e right, but it still hurts because I really invested a lot of my time and money as a fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well maybe let's change the topic, who do you think will win it this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I think the Patriots have a good shot this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  I thought you hated them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I kinda do, but I can't pretend they aren't really good.  Brady looks like he isn't slowing down at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess.  I think the Packers are gonna win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  They've been one and done for how many years now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but I think they're due this year.  Aaron Rodgers has been playing great lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's totally been really solid.  Who knows.  The Cowboys are looking strong this year too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, although too bad about the Romo situation, I really like the guy but he keeps getting hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, feel bad for the dude but his time is up now.  Time for a new leader for the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully some new team emerges this season.  Pats going all the way again will be kinda of boring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  I think seeing a dynasty take over everyone is good for everbody.  It creates someone to really root against"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ M"
