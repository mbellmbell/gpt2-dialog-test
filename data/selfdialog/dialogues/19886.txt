"__MOVIES__ Did you hear they are finally making a movie of 'The Dark Tower'?"
"__MOVIES__ Like the Stephen King books?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep!"
"__MOVIES__ That's awesome! I can't believe they haven't done it before."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither, I've been waiting for years and years."
"__MOVIES__ Which of the books will it cover?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's supposed to be a continuation or a retelling or something, I didn't really understand."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to look it up."
"__MOVIES__ Guess who they have playing the gunslinger?"
"__MOVIES__ The gunslinger, Roland?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes."
"__MOVIES__ Who?"
"__MOVIES__ Idris Elba."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! That's a really cool choice. Who do they have playing R.F."
"__MOVIES__ I think they're not going to call him Randall Flag, and go by the other name, but it's Matthew McConnaughey."
"__MOVIES__ Matthew McConnaughey? Really? I can't imagine him as an evil-incarnate villain."
"__MOVIES__ In the trailer, it looks like it works."
"__MOVIES__ Can you send me the link to the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure will!"
"__MOVIES__ Thanks! I can't wait to watch it."
