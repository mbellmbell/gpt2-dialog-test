"__ROCK__ So who do you like better, Iron Maiden or Metallica?"
"__ROCK__ That's easy. Iron Maiden!"
"__ROCK__ What is it about their music that makes them superior to Metallica, for you?"
"__ROCK__ Well, they're a lot more consistent and never watered down their sound for commercial appeal."
"__ROCK__ That's true! They don't really have a 'Black Album' or a 'Load' in their discography."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, Iron Maiden have set a high standard for themselves musically, and their music is creative too."
"__ROCK__ We tend to forget how influential they really were."
"__ROCK__ Yes, their dual-lead-guitar sound is pretty incredible, in how the guitars interlock and harmonize."
"__ROCK__ Metallica had some great albums and songs, for sure, but their music to me is not as intelligent."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I think people who appreciate all sorts of music will get a lot more out of Iron Maiden than Metallica."
