"__MUSIC__ You know who I find to be kind of a funny artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ Why Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she herself is not that funny. The fact that she started out as a country singer and has transitioned to the pop star she is today."
"__MUSIC__ I hardly remember her as a country singer."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it is easy to forget considering all the pop success she has had."
"__MUSIC__ Right, I mean I can't name one country song she did."
"__MUSIC__ It is hard to listen to her music today and find even a tiny hint of country style in there."
"__MUSIC__ I would never have known she had country roots if I was not a country fan anyways."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think anyone who doesn't listen to country music would have no idea."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't Miley Cyrus sing some country as well?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she dabbled in it, but she has kind of always been a pop person."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of Miley, I really like her new song 'Malibu'."
"__MUSIC__ Oh me too. I feel like she is going back to where she started out a little."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she got unique there for a little bit."
"__MUSIC__ She did, and it overflowed to her music."
"__MUSIC__ I really like that song though. I hope she keeps making more songs like that."
"__MUSIC__ I think she will given the reception it is getting."
"__MUSIC__ I guess all young people have to go through a 'unique' stage."
