"__BASEBALL__ Do you think the Cubs can repeat this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I doubt it. It's hard to repeat."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I don't think so either. They lost Chapman and some of their starting pitching isn't as good."
"__BASEBALL__ And baseball teams don't really repeat championships very often."
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Nationals might make it to the World Series, but I don't know that they win it."
"__BASEBALL__ It's so early in the season that it doesn't matter what the Nationals are doing right now. They always fall short."
"__BASEBALL__ It could be the Dodgers, but it's kind of the same thing with them too."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but someone new has to break through."
"__BASEBALL__ I just hope it isn't the Cardinals again."
"__BASEBALL__ Or the Giants, but I don't think we'll have to worry about them."
"__BASEBALL__ What about the American League?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know. I don't follow the AL as much as the NL."
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees are surprisingly good so far."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. They finally have some young talent."
"__BASEBALL__ And they have Chapman back to save games like he did for the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ There's a lot of good teams in the American League right now."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right. The Orioles and Astros should be right there."
"__BASEBALL__ And don't forget the Indians."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they came so close last year."
"__BASEBALL__ It's going to be a good season in both leagues."
