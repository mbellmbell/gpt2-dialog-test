"__BASEBALL__ I can't believe the Marlins are still so bad this year."
"__BASEBALL__ I can."
"__BASEBALL__ Why's that?"
"__BASEBALL__ The death of Fernandez really messed up that franchise. Their pitching is terrible."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but the hitters aren't hitting either."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess. Stanton is batting what, .250?"
"__BASEBALL__ I hate to say it, but he's extremely overrated. That contract..."
"__BASEBALL__ Finally the Marlins spend monoey and the player doesn't live up to it."
"__BASEBALL__ He's making 1 million per strike out. Haha!"
"__BASEBALL__ Ouch. And what happened to Yelich? He was so good in the World Baseball Classic."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know. His batting average is just as low as Stanton's. It's a shame."
"__BASEBALL__ That team has been together for a while too. You would think it would click eventually."
"__BASEBALL__ The players aren't bad but the combination doesn't work. No one is hitting."
"__BASEBALL__ Who else is struggling?"
"__BASEBALL__ Bour, Gordan, even Ichiro."
"__BASEBALL__ They may have to hire a new batting coach. What happened to Barry Bonds?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's gone. The only one who learned anything from him was Ozuna."
"__BASEBALL__ He's doing real good, right? Probably the only all-star for them this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yup. Oh well, hope they win tonight."
"__BASEBALL__ Game starts in 15 minutes. We'll find out soon."
