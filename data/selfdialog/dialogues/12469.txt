"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like there are so many people in the NFL who need to retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, what is the cutoff age again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think there's an official cut off age, but so many players are pushing 40."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 40 year olds still got it, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but you know that over time they just lose stamina and agility and such."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the youngest you can be in the NFL, again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably 18, I really doubt 18 year olds get drafted though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's probably really young players on teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they don't play much I assume."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how the oldest player in the NFL is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if he's officially retired yet, but Bret Farve was definetely the oldest for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I remember him! A defense, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he was a quaterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, you are right in that he is older now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know for a fact he is over 40."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He must have been in the NFL forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, good player though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eventually your time is up though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like I said it's time for him to stop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They all retire eventually."
