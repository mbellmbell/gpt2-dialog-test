"__STAR_WARS__ I loved it when Yoda fought Count Dooku!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know - the CGI was spectacular as was Yoda's green lightsaber!"
"__STAR_WARS__ They were able to match the puppet so well with the all CGI.  Do you think that Count Dooku really knew what was going on?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think a little bit, but that he was mostly a pawn of Darth Sidious."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think that Snoke is really Darth Plageius?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Unsure - it will be interesting to see who he really is, and how he tempted Kylo and what he knows about Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Luke will die in The Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I think they will keep Luke around for the final movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Luke will fight Snoke?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he and Rey have to at some point..."
