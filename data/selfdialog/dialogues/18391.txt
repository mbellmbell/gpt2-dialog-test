"__MOVIES__ Did you watch that movie The Space Between Us?"
"__MOVIES__ I finally did and I loved it!"
"__MOVIES__ I loved how they showed him seeing stuff for the first time."
"__MOVIES__ Like how they showed him seeing horses-that was so real!"
"__MOVIES__ And rain!  He made me really appreciate things that I see more."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think he was going to die?"
"__MOVIES__ I did for a bit.  I kindof already figured out that that guy was going to be his dad though."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  Tulsa was interesting.  She really cared about him."
"__MOVIES__ They met online.  That made me wonder just who we interact with online!"
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean.  Did you see how he acted with the ocean?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought that was really cool. i mean, if you think about it, there's no water at all on Mars."
"__MOVIES__ Or trees for that matter.  I would have liked for them to show him reacting to more things on Earth."
"__MOVIES__ I would have too.  I hope one day we get to put a colony on Mars like that."
"__MOVIES__ I do too.  DId you notice at the end how that female astronaut took Tulsa in?"
"__MOVIES__ It looked like she was training her to go to Mars."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think that the woman will go with Tulsa?"
"__MOVIES__ I like to think that she would.  She loved Gardner too."
"__MOVIES__ It would be like having the whole family there!"
"__MOVIES__ I was surprised that his Dad went!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it made sense."
