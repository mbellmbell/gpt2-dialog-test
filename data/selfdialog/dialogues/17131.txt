"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one with Chris Pratt, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it in theaters a while back."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet, but we bought it on DVD when it came out."
"__MOVIES__ You have it on DVD and haven't watched it yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I figured it was more of a boys movie."
"__MOVIES__ Not necessarily true. Sure, it's an action movie, but I think it's great for the whole family!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm just not a space movie fan."
"__MOVIES__ It's really more of a comedy set in space."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Chris Pratt does a fantastic job at portraying his character, but he's such a funny guy and it shows."
"__MOVIES__ This is also the same movie with the 'Groot' character, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! He's one of the general favorites!"
"__MOVIES__ I have seen pictures and videos of him and he is funny."
"__MOVIES__ There's a little Groot too, and it's really cute!"
"__MOVIES__ A little Groot?"
"__MOVIES__ Like a miniature version of the one you've seen."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I see."
"__MOVIES__ I would definitely recommend watching it, especially if you already have it!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll do that!"
