"__MUSIC__ I've started listening to Lord Huron a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a folk-rock or alt-rock sort of band."
"__MUSIC__ Have I heard any of their songs?"
"__MUSIC__ You might have heard 'Ends of the Earth.' It's been played on a few TV shows."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound familiar."
"__MUSIC__ I think you'd like them!"
"__MUSIC__ Really? Who do they sound like."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Maybe the Lumineers?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know them?"
"__MUSIC__ They have one album called 'The Lumineers.' But I think you've at least heard Ho Hey."
"__MUSIC__ That one does sound familiar."
"__MUSIC__ How about The Decemberists? They're also kind of folk-rock in the same way."
"__MUSIC__ I think of them as chamber pop, but I do like them."
"__MUSIC__ I especially liked 'The Crane Wife.'"
"__MUSIC__ O Valencia was always my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you liked that, maybe you should give Lord Huron a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Could you lend me the album?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd be happy to!"
"__MUSIC__ Great!"
