"__MUSIC__ I'm listening to the new Mariah Carey album."
"__MUSIC__ She's still singing?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but not very well anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Oh no, what's going on with her?"
"__MUSIC__ She sounds raspy and off pitch."
"__MUSIC__ Are the songs at least good?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't care for her writing style anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I used to love her music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, she was my favorite singer when I was growing up."
"__MUSIC__ I think she is trying to stay young and not growing up with her fans."
"__MUSIC__ That's exactly it."
"__MUSIC__ She needs to do more age appropriate music."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, I don't want to hear these types of songs anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Then why are you listening to it?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm just giving it a try."
"__MUSIC__ To make up your own mind?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, absolutely."
"__MUSIC__ I do that too, I like to decide for myself if an album is good or not."
"__MUSIC__ well this is not good at all."
"__MUSIC__ thanks for the heads up, I may skip this one."
