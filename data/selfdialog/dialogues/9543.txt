"__BASEBALL__ How about that Phillies bullpen?"
"__BASEBALL__ It might be the worst baseball has ever seen!"
"__BASEBALL__ They just dont have one guy that can get anyone out."
"__BASEBALL__ Feel for the manager, its like the wheel of death"
"__BASEBALL__ They literally do not have one dependable arm."
"__BASEBALL__ Bullpens are hard to staff"
"__BASEBALL__ Its a hit or miss part of the team"
"__BASEBALL__ I mean who do you think could do that job?"
"__BASEBALL__ Staff a pen?"
"__BASEBALL__ No throw a seamless inning."
"__BASEBALL__ In their pen, Neshek?"
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe but hes had issues"
"__BASEBALL__ I dont think theyve thrown him into the fire."
"__BASEBALL__ They tried one time in the 8th and he didnt do bad."
"__BASEBALL__ Again, its tough to think what you could do with that kind of arm."
"__BASEBALL__ I think youll see the team not address the needs ever."
"__BASEBALL__ Vince Velasquez could be their new closer soon"
"__BASEBALL__ I dont think so, dont take away from the rotation to supplement your pen."
"__BASEBALL__ Well bad teams dont need good arms back there."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah thats why I think theyll do it piece meal for the rest of the year."
