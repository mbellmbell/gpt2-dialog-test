"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I just watched Doctor Strange on Netflix!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, they have that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, I think they just got it recently."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think they have some kind of Marvel deal, so it makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I love the Marvel movies, so I am glad Netflix gets a lot of them."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Which hero is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, that is hard to say. Probably Thor."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I am a huge Iron Man fan!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Iron Man is pretty awesome. I just really like mythology."
"__MOVIES__ I see. That makes sense then."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite movie is probably Avengers, though."
"__MOVIES__ I know! It was just so good."
"__MOVIES__ So many heroes in one movie! Hard to dislike."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Captain America: Civil War because of that."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Spiderman was such a treat."
"__MOVIES__ I am really excited to see his movie! I think it is coming out soon."
"__MOVIES__ We should go watch it together! I think it comes out in July."
"__MOVIES__ Okay! Sounds like fun."
"__MOVIES__ Sweet. We will make plans later."
