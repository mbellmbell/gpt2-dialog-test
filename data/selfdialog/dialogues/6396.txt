"__STAR_WARS__ What was the best lightsaber battle of the whole Star Wars franchise?"
"__STAR_WARS__ As much as I disliked 'Phantom Menace,' I loved the battle where Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan face off against Darth Maul"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was such a great sequence.  And so fast-paced too."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was the first time any of us ever saw a lightsaber battle that intense."
"__STAR_WARS__ It made the original trilogy's lightsaber duels seem tame in comparison.  Very high-octane."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ray Park was so good as Darth Maul."
"__STAR_WARS__ He almost had zero dialogue, but was still so scary."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that Ray Park did his own stunts?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't.  That's very impressive."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, in real life Ray is an expert martial artist.  He brought a lot to his role as Maul."
