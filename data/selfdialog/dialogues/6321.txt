"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite part of the Star Wars soundtrack?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like Yoda and Leia's theme - overall The Empire Strikes Back music is the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some people like the prequel music too - like Dual of the Fates from The Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's great, as is the lightsaber dual with Darth Maul."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a high point of the movie between Obi-wan and Qui-gon."
"__STAR_WARS__ Indeed, I don't know if the lightsaber dual of that movie will ever be topped."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if Luke and Kylo will have a big shown down in The Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Possibly - or maybe they will save it for Episode IX."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Disney has their work cut out for them - so many people love Star Wars!"
"__STAR_WARS__ As long as they create a great story around Skywalker, I think it will work."
