"__DISNEY__ Did you know Tom Hanks voices Woody in the Disney movie Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ I did not. Wait I thought Toy Story was a Pixar movie?"
"__DISNEY__ It was a joint collaboration between Disney and Pixar."
"__DISNEY__ Well, that is interesting. Are there any other famous actors in Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ Tim Allen voices Buzzlightyear."
"__DISNEY__ I love Tim Allen, he's so funny."
"__DISNEY__ Also, great bit of trivia here, Joss Whedon and Joel Cohen wrote the screenplay for the first Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ What Joss Whedon as in the director of Avengers! Wait isn't that also a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes it is, maybe they should have an Avengers and Toy Story cross over."
"__DISNEY__ The toys would definitely win that fight, they've got a dinosaur for heaven's sake!"
