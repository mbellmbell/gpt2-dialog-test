"__MUSIC__ In the past, you've told me that techno music is the basis for several other genres of music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's correct."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of these genres?"
"__MUSIC__ I think rave music has the most interesting story."
"__MUSIC__ How's that?"
"__MUSIC__ The Belleville Three, the pioneers of techno, were critical to the development of techno."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you've told me that."
"__MUSIC__ True, but there's something that people don't understand."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ The Belleville Three didn't have much commerical success. Their contributions were largely artistic."
"__MUSIC__ Yet, electronic dance music -- EDM -- is huge today!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's because of rave music."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ The early records from the Belleville Three ended up in the discount and used bins of many record stores."
"__MUSIC__ Why does that matter?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, some of those records were found in Amsterdam and London. And, talented people there recognized their potential."
"__MUSIC__ What did they do them with them?"
"__MUSIC__ They modified that sound. They took the Detroit element out of it."
"__MUSIC__ What happened to the music then? How did it change?"
"__MUSIC__ It was more robotic, but that allowed it to become more popular. To many people, it represented the sound of the future."
