"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think wookies have flea and lice problems?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would definitely say so. I mean with all that fur who knows what could set up shop in there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they use soap and shampoo to bathe, or just shampoo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well they are like 90% fur so I would think that soap would be somewhat useless."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about a wookie with severe alopecia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean a bald wookie or mostly bald wookie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, they would need soap don't you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say so but I bet their skin is sensitive so it would be like aloe vera based, very gentle and soothing soap."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do wookies ever suffer from male pattern baldness?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Beats me. Have you ever seen a bald wookie? I haven't."
