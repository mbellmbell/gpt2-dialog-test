"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been to see a symphony concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I saw the El Paso Symphony once when I was visiting my grandparents."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess so. I don't really remember what they played."
"__MUSIC__ I really enjoy symphonic music but my favorite kind of music is the music that they use to accompany a movie."
"__MUSIC__ That's called a soundtrack isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes it is. John Williams is a famous composer of sountracks. Have you heard of him?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! He wrote the music score for Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ That and a lot of other film scores. I like Raiders of the Lost Ark soundtrack the best."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't realize he wrote that. What else did he write?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's see, he did E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Empire of the Sun, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, and even Haryy Potter."
"__MUSIC__ Holy Cow! That guy is really amazing. I know a lot of his music even though I didn't realize he wrote it."
"__MUSIC__ I just heard that they released a three-disk boxed set of all the musical scores that John Williams did with Steven Spielberg."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to ask for that for my birthday! Does he ever play the music he writes?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he plays the piano so I suppose he does."
"__MUSIC__ I bet it doesn't sound the same on a piano."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure it doesn't, but he also conducts the musicians that play his music in the studio."
"__MUSIC__ How do you know so much about John Williams?"
"__MUSIC__ I wanted to be a studio musician and play movie soundtracks and he is the best there is in the business."
"__MUSIC__ Well I hope you get to work with him some day."
