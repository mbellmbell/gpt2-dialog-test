"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see Rambo?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ The second one."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one where he goes to Vietnam to rescue POWs?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember seeing that as a kid. I thought it was so cool"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was pretty intense. That's where Stallone got all ripped."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably started taking some steroids."
"__MOVIES__ He was also pretty ripped in Rocky."
"__MOVIES__ Well starting in Rocky III is when he became really ripped."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and then there was Rambo III a few years later."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right and didn't they do another Rambo fairly recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it wasn't that good. Stallone looked really old in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you can't keep up the story line for that long."
"__MOVIES__ No you can't. I did like the second and first Rambo movies though."
"__MOVIES__ I just remember that was a large body count in the second one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he must've killed over a 100 people in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh dear. Almost a bit far fetch."
"__MOVIES__ Well he is Rambo."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and no one messes with John Rambo."
