"__FASHION__ What do you think of this new ripped jeans look?"
"__FASHION__ Ug, I hate it."
"__FASHION__ SO do I. It's like people are spending money to look ragged."
"__FASHION__ I don't let my kids buy stuff like that."
"__FASHION__ Neither do I and if their clothes do get ripped and I can't fix it we toss it out."
"__FASHION__ Don't do that. I can make quilts with the scraps."
"__FASHION__ I've always wanted to know how."
"__FASHION__ I can show you."
"__FASHION__ That would be great. I just got a lot of stained stuff out of Katie's closet this morning."
"__FASHION__ That means she needs new clothes then, right?"
"__FASHION__ Yes. She's into all the new trends."
"__FASHION__ So are my kids."
"__FASHION__ We should go to the thrift store to find her some new stuff and we can get your kids something too."
"__FASHION__ That would be fun. I love thrift stores because you can get trendy clothes for less."
"__FASHION__ Some of that namebrand stuff is too expensive new."
"__FASHION__ I agree. I can't see paying those prices for a shirt."
"__FASHION__ Neither can I but I'll buy it used."
"__FASHION__ I have no problem with that either."
"__FASHION__ When do you want to go?"
"__FASHION__ No time like the present I guess."
