"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the latest Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I haven't yet. I'm looking forward to seeing it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which story arc do you like best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite arc was learning how Annakin become Darth Vader. Who would have imagined that little boy would have turned into the imposing Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm more a fan of the original three movies released."
"__STAR_WARS__ They sure packed a punch! I bet my ex wasn't the only one who thought he was piloting a fighter home after the movie!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think part of that is that it was the first time we were exposed to that world. It was so much to take in."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, even excellent sequels can suffer a bit in comparison, because the 'newness' of the experience is gone. It seems like reviewers sometimes forget that."
"__STAR_WARS__ The filmmakers must be always trying to up their game, to try to bring in new locations, characters and story reveals to make it new again."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's a daunting task. I'm not sure they could ever top the impact of: 'Luke, I am your father!'"
