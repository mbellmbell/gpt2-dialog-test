"__MOVIES__ Today was the 40th anniversary of Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup.  40 years ago on May 26, 1977, 'Star Wars' came out."
"__MOVIES__ It's crazy to think that 40 years later, 'Star Wars' is still such a pillar of pop culture."
"__MOVIES__ The fact that you can go up to anyone and say 'No, I am your father,' and have them immediately catch the reference; that says so much."
"__MOVIES__ Best 5 sci-fi movies ever."
"__MOVIES__ Why five?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the three from the original trilogy plus 'Rogue One' and Episode VI."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, so you're not including the prequels."
"__MOVIES__ I am not, because they were awful."
"__MOVIES__ I mean they can't compare at all to the original, but they did have their moments."
"__MOVIES__ Jar-Jar and Senate hearings were so boring to me as a child."
"__MOVIES__ I thought pod-racing was sort of cool."
"__MOVIES__ Agree to disagree!"
"__MOVIES__ Though they definitely could have connected storylines better so that they could transition into the original saga."
"__MOVIES__ On the bright side, 'Rogue One' fixed a lot of the biggest plot holes."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and for that I'm so thankful.  They did it really tactfully too."
"__MOVIES__ I'm looking forward to more one-off 'Star Wars' movies like that one."
"__MOVIES__ Well you have the young Han Solo movie to look forward to."
"__MOVIES__ That's right.  I can't wait to see it."
