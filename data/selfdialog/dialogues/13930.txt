"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see Game 1 of the Spurs vs. Warriors series?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, it was a great comeback by the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see when Kawhi Leonard got injured?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, he landed on Pachulia's foot when he shot the ball."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it was intentional by Zaza Pachulia."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know. He is just an awkward player."
"__BASKETBALL__ The way he put out his foot looked weird to me."
"__BASKETBALL__ He is big and lumbering so he needed an extra step to slow his momentum."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, he was already landed."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why would he want to do that intentionally, though?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Spurs were winning and Leonard is their best player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure, but that seems a bit farfetched."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not in the playoffs. Players will do anything to win."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think it matters. The Warriors may have lost that game, but they would win the series anyway."
"__BASKETBALL__ That may be true. The team is stacked."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly. The Spurs may have pushed them to six or seven games at best."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Spurs just don't have the personnel."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's why they went belly-up without Kawhi. They need another star player to compete."
"__BASKETBALL__ Looks like they will end up getting swept now. Did you see game 2 and 3?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. This series is over."
