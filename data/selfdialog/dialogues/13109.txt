"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you think will be this years MVP?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tough to say since there are so many great players"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to your eye on someone who you think has a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I would go with Leveon Bell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bell? Really!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think as long as he stays out of trouble than he can get the stats needed for the MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I can see that. Staying out of trouble is going to be key for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was great again last year despite being suspended."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus they get Martavius Bryant back from suspension which should help out the passing game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Getting him back should help get safetys out of the box on run support."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steelers are looking like they could make another superbowl push with all the pieces they have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, only thing is people are not sure how long Roethlisberger will be around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot he was thinking about retiring this past season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he was, its unfortunate because he is a great QB despite his age"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He always is playing hurt from what I can remember."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is no lie. He is a tough guy though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. One of the toughest QBs to ever play the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, but Bell is my pick for MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bell has a solid chance, but will have some stiff competition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your right, there are many good running backs out there."
