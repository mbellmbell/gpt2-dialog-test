"__ACTION__ What is your favorite action movie?"
"__ACTION__ I really like Gladiator.  Braveheart will probably come second."
"__ACTION__ Gladiator is one of my favorites too.  It was just a well-done movie from the beginning to end."
"__ACTION__ I still get teary-eyed when I saw the last scene of Maximus' friend burying Maxmimus' small carvings of his family."
"__ACTION__ One action movie that I love that doesn't get enough credit is Conan the Barbarian."
"__ACTION__ Conan the Barbarian?  Is that the movie with NBA Basketball player Wilt Chamberlain?"
"__ACTION__ No, that was the sequel to Conan the Barbarian.  The name was Conan the Destroyer."
"__ACTION__ Conan the Destroyer was absolutely awful."
"__ACTION__ James Earl Jones did a great job portraying the villain Thusla Doom in Conan the Barbarian.  He made the movie for me."
"__ACTION__ The actions scenes in the movie were great too.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his prime then."
