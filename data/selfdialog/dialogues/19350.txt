"__MOVIES__ Have you watched the Martian?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the Matt Damon movie right where he's stuck on Mars?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I loved it. Watched it last week."
"__MOVIES__ I liked how Ridley Scott the director infused some humor in there to keep it not so dark and bleek."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was both Matt Damon's idea as well as Ridley's. I don't think there's a Matt Damon movie where he doesn't display his personality."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of Matt Damon what's your favorite movie of his?"
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite Matt Damon movie is the Bourne series."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I think he's okay in there but there are so many other movies that Matt's done that I think are better."
"__MOVIES__ Which movies do you like more? Don't tell me We Bought a Zoo."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, We Bought a Zoo was a very fun family movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I'm just kidding about it, I have to admit I enjoyed We Bought a Zoo too."
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite Matt Damon movie is probably the Adjustment Bureau."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I have to agree I really like that too. Having Emily Blunt in that movie bumped it up a notch for me too in regards to Matt Damon movie."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't surprise me. I know how much of an Emily Blunt fan boy you are."
"__MOVIES__ How can you blame me? Since her performance with Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow, she won me over. Then she followed it up with Sicario!"
"__MOVIES__ You're leaving out her performance from Into the Woods."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, I didn't enjoy Into the Woods too much. I didn't realize it was more of a musical."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't that bad plus you had a fantastic cast in that movie, with Anna Kendrick, Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, James Corden."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it was subjective to me, I don't really watch musicals too much or enjoy them, so I had no idea Into the Woods was a musical."
"__MOVIES__ I bet your mind would of changed if Matt Damon was in that movie!"
