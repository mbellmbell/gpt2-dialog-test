"__MUSIC__ So I noticed you seem to like songs that tell a story."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Like Tupac's Violent, and Lynard Skynard's Gimme Three Steps."
"__MUSIC__ Nice!"
"__MUSIC__ I don't like songs that are a bunch of words thrown together for the sake of finishing a song or for the sake of rhyming."
"__MUSIC__ You'd probably like Harper Valley PTA then."
"__MUSIC__ Who does it?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure who did it originally, but Dolly Parton's version is pretty well known."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check it out. What's it about?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's from the point of view of this mom, talking about what happens with her daughter at school and there's kind of a surprising end."
"__MUSIC__ I'm all about that. I'll have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you can find several versions on youtube."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good. What style of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of countryish I guess?"
"__MUSIC__ Ew, you know I can't stand country."
"__MUSIC__ But hopefully the story in it will outweigh that for you!"
"__MUSIC__ I hope so."
"__MUSIC__ I found that it provokes really good imagery. Like it was really easy to imagine everything that's narrated."
"__MUSIC__ I like that in a song. I like that about Violent."
"__MUSIC__ What is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like we need to exchange some music!"
