"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Guardians Of Galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, either, but I am really looking forward. Everyone told me that it's a good one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I actually heard some not good reviews from people I know."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know, I have seen the first part and hope the second will be the good as the first one, but you never know."
"__MOVIES__ Right, sometimes second part not so good as the first one. But I also did like the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Do you remember that funny tree, what was his name? That was my favorite character."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right, he was so cute. But I have seen it also long time ago, don't remember any names."
"__MOVIES__ I can google it, let's by the way wee who is gonna be in the second part. Are they the same characters?"
"__MOVIES__ It's ok, let's better check when it's on the theaters and will go together as we both like these type of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a good idea, let's go to this cinema we have been last time?"
"__MOVIES__ yeah, they have good building there and the are always many movies on. When would you like to go, this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Saturday evening could be great, how about you?"
"__MOVIES__ That's fine, I am looking now, they have one at 6 pm and one at 8, which would you prefer?"
"__MOVIES__ 6 could be better for me, would like to go talk a bit after movie as well. Which other good movies have you seen recently? After this conversation I feel like to watch something right now."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know, I am watching Tudors all this week and haven't pay attention much what's new on, I am more on the shows now."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, Tudors are good one. I am on other side, like to watch all new movies, as much as I possible could. Always want some new fresh story."
"__MOVIES__ I understand. Have you seen the Lion? It's not so new, just pops up in my head, the movie I have seen recently and liked a lot. Very interesting story, but you better watch yourself."
"__MOVIES__ Thank you, I have heard about it, but haven't seen yet. I will go check if it's on Netflix and watch if you don't mind."
"__MOVIES__ No problem, I have to go out soon anyway. So, wee you on Saturday. Hope it will be great evening."
