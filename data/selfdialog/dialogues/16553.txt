"__MOVIES__ Have you watched any new movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure! I watched Alien Covenant because I'm a huge fan of the Alien movies franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's interesting. I've been thinking of watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I wouldn't recommend it. It was extremely disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Can you tell me why?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was disappointing on so many levels. The acting, screenplay, direction etc. I could go on."
"__MOVIES__ Wait a minute! Didn't Ridley Scott direct this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he did. And that's what makes it even more disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ That a director of his caliber can churn our mediocre films?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and it also makes me feel now that the Alien franchise has become a caricature of what it used to be."
"__MOVIES__ That does sound very disappointing. Yes, the earlier Alien movies were amazing."
"__MOVIES__ This movie is actually a continuation of the story from Prometheus."
"__MOVIES__ Does it have the same characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Sadly, no. We only see Michael Fassbender reprising his role as David."
"__MOVIES__ He was good though at portraying the character, I imagine?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes he was. But very few of the rest of the cast were as competent."
"__MOVIES__ How about the story itself?"
"__MOVIES__ It was massively disappointing. There were so many plot holes."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I am really shocked to hear all this. I guess I won't watch it after all."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I would instead recommend watching some of the older Alien movies."
