"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do the winning players for the Super Bowl get?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a huge bonus."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know the losers get a bonus, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For losing the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think of it more as an incentive to play their best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how much do they get?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They each got fifty three thousand dollars in this year's game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So about half?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have the players always gotten bonuses?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. It started with the first Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much did they get?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The winners got fifteen thousand dollars and the losers got seventy five hundred."
