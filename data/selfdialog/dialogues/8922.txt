"__BEATLES__ I finally watched 'A hard day's night' the other day."
"__BEATLES__ How was it?"
"__BEATLES__ Well after hearing about how great it was for about 25 years I must admit I was kind of disappointed."
"__BEATLES__ Why?"
"__BEATLES__ The movie didn't have much of a plot, but the music was awesome."
"__BEATLES__ I haven't seen the movie myself. What songs do they sing?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, the title track of course, in fact that's at the very beginning of the movie. That I think is one of the best parts of the movie."
"__BEATLES__ I've seen parts of that video; that's when all the fans are chasing them."
"__BEATLES__ All of them except for Paul who is sitting on a bench in disguise reading a newspaper."
"__BEATLES__ Yes I remember that."
