"__THRILLER__ What would you say is your all time favorite Thriller movie?"
"__THRILLER__ While I don't watch too many thrillers, one that comes to mind was Disturbia."
"__THRILLER__ I have not seen that one.  Would you recommend it?"
"__THRILLER__ I absolutely would.  It was a 2007 movie starring Shia LeBeouf and Carrie-Anne Moss."
"__THRILLER__ What was it about?"
"__THRILLER__ It was about a teen who finds out he lives next door to a killer, but no one believes him at first until it's too late."
"__THRILLER__ That sounds pretty intense.  I know who Shia is but I don't know who Carrie-Anne Moss is."
"__THRILLER__ She was the actress who played Trinity in 'The Matrix.'"
"__THRILLER__ Oh I see.  I do know her then."
"__THRILLER__ She is a phenomenal actress.  You should definitely give Disturbia a shot."
