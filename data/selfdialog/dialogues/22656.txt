"__DISNEY__ I just read something interesting about Harrison Ford and getting the part of Han Solo."
"__DISNEY__ What's that?"
"__DISNEY__ He never auditioned for the part."
"__DISNEY__ Then how did he get it?"
"__DISNEY__ He was helping other actors run their lines when George Lucas was casting and after awhile, Lucas realized that Ford was perfect for the part."
"__DISNEY__ How lucky is that?"
"__DISNEY__ And do you know how much he got paid for A New Hope?"
"__DISNEY__ I have no idea."
"__DISNEY__ Only $10,000."
"__DISNEY__ That's nothing!"
