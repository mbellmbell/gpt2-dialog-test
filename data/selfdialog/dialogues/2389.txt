"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you remember the Nas and Jay battle?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely! Ether and the Takeover are two of my favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ Who do you think won the battle?"
"__MUSIC__ After going back and listening through out the years, i don't think there's a clear winner."
"__MUSIC__ That might be true considering they both continued their careers and made a impact of the music industry."
"__MUSIC__ I will say this, Jay-Z had a better overall career than Nas did."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he did, he even became the Def Jam president for a little while."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't Nas actually signed to Def Jam at the time?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he was, so you could say Jay-Z was his boss."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that is a bit funny. Who do you think is more lyrical?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say Nas on that Ether joint."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah his lyrical assault on Jay-Z was nonstop from beginning to end."
"__MUSIC__ Every about that song is fire. The lyrics, the chorus, even the beat."
"__MUSIC__ The Takeover had a pretty dope beat as well. Who ever produced it did a great job."
"__MUSIC__ Kanye West actually produced it."
"__MUSIC__ No wonder why the musical samples were orchestrated so well."
"__MUSIC__ Who produced Ether?"
"__MUSIC__ A guy called Ron Browz."
"__MUSIC__ I never heard of him. Is he still around?"
"__MUSIC__ To be honest i have no idea."
