"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue One is my favorite Star Wars film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whoa really, even over the original trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it manages to capture two themes really well."
"__STAR_WARS__ What themes are those?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Bleakness and hopefulness, the movie is full of them both."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh good thinking, I agree on that."
"__STAR_WARS__ The fact that they had the courage to actually end the film the way they did, was nothing short of impeccable."
"__STAR_WARS__ Indeed, a very dark but hopeful ending that paved the way for our heroes in the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can only hope the next Star Wars spin offs are that good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Honestly with Disney at the helm, I can't see that being anything but the case."
