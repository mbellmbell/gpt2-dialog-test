"__DISNEY__ Did you see Moana?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!  I loved it.  My daughter didn't like it as much though and I don't know why."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe she was comparing it to Frozen.  I heard a lot of people were."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe.  I personally loved the songs in Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Me too.  I feel like Disney is really having a big revival recently."
"__DISNEY__ They're also making all those live versions of their old films.  That could go on for quite a while."
"__DISNEY__ I think I heard they're doing one for The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ I will definitely have to check that out.  Beauty and the Beast was great."
"__DISNEY__ I thought so too.  Emma Watson wasn't really that great in it to me though."
"__DISNEY__ Really?  I thought she was exactly how Belle should act."
