"__STAR_WARS__ In the Star Wars movies, why does everyone accept the clones, from the second episode."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it is complicated, but they do since they needed them."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, why were they made."
"__STAR_WARS__ A rogue Jedi thought that soldiers would be needed, so he commissioned them to be created."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is that not sort of against the Jedi code?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but they still used them."
"__STAR_WARS__ How did they all turn so bad and turn into the bad people in the white suits."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those are not all clones, the Empire takes kids as well, and in Finn, and turns them into storm troopers."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, the Jedi did what they did."
"__STAR_WARS__ In a way yes, though the did not know they were commissioned, the clones."
