"__MOVIES__ Do you have any movies with Jim Carrey?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have The Majestic, which is really good."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I've heard about that one! Isn't that the one where he has that green mask?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that's a different one. This one is actually a pretty serious drama movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about the main guy, who Jim plays, who gets into an accident and loses his memory."
"__MOVIES__ What else happens?"
"__MOVIES__ After he loses his memory, he wanders into a town and accidentally assumes the identity of someone else who's been missing for a long time."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a really cool idea. Sounds stressful."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely gets stressful later on, because you get afraid that the people will find out that he isn't who he thinks he is."
"__MOVIES__ That's quite a plot."
"__MOVIES__ There's a lot of other cool stuff that happens too, like he somehow becomes really good at piano by just trying to remember how to play even though he never learned."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. Are there any romance parts?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a pretty big romance that goes on, which also gets stressful because she doesn't know that he isn't the guy who has been missing."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I would be able to handle that amount of stress."
"__MOVIES__ It gets nearly unbearable honestly, but it's got a great ending."
"__MOVIES__ Is it at least a happy one?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say so, basically he remembers that he was in an accident and that he isn't who he thought he was."
"__MOVIES__ What happens after he remembers?"
"__MOVIES__ He tells the people in the town and they decided to accept him anyways after they discuss."
