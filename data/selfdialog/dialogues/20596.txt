"__THRILLER__ I wanted to watch something good and scary, but not gore focused."
"__THRILLER__ You could watch something based on Stephen King's work."
"__THRILLER__ Oh! Good idea! Which one?"
"__THRILLER__ You could watch Carrie. It is more of a thriller than a true horror."
"__THRILLER__ That sounds like a good one. Who made that one?"
"__THRILLER__ Brian De Palma directed Carrie."
"__THRILLER__ Great. I love his work that I've seen before."
"__THRILLER__ Carrie also has some spectacular editing. You're in for a treat with the ending of that film!"
"__THRILLER__ I really appreciate the recommendation. I'd love to see that one on the big screen."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I know. That finale would be breathtaking in a theater."
