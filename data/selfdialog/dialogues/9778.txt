"__COMEDY__ How did you like Ghostbusters?"
"__COMEDY__ I used to like it growing up."
"__COMEDY__ How did you like the remake?"
"__COMEDY__ I actually didn't see it."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, did you plan on seeing it?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, I don't really like a lot of the remakes of classics."
"__COMEDY__ I know what you mean."
"__COMEDY__ I wish they had just done a sequel with the actors now."
"__COMEDY__ Well, the guy that played Egon had died."
"__COMEDY__ They could have worked on it earlier though.  He had died right around the time it was released."
