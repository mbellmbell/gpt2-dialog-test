"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think the Rangers will start to dismantle their team?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, why would they do that?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Cause they keep failing expectations."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I mean their window is closing as Hank gets older."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Exactly so why not start to rebuild now?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They dont need a rebuild, maybe a retool."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Would signing Shattenkirk help them?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I dont see how it could."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How about signing a goalie?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That would be right if Hank was on his way out."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah hes still playing at a high level"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Eventually he wont be and they need to fix the problem."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I wonder if theyll draft a guy or go through trades."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well they should draft now. Normally it takes time."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What about Nash?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hes played up to his contract."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He could reap in a big return."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree with most of that, he does have a higher cap hit."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah but hes good still and can play where you need him."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree, he isnt an absolute albatross."
