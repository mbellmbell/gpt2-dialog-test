"__STAR_WARS__ I think that The Empire Strikes Back was the best Star Wars film. How about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Most definitely, Irvin Kershner added some darkness to the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say that Kershner was the best out of all the Star Wars directors."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would agree, Lucas is probably my number two favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope as the series continues, we see some darker storylines similar to Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, tragedy needs to remain a part of the ongoing saga."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about Han being killed in The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was disappointed. He was my favorite character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, mine too, they killed the coolest dude in the galaxy."
"__STAR_WARS__ At least Chewbacca lives to carry on his legacy."
