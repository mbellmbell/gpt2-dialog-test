"__MOVIES__ I just saw the new Transformers movie....."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I saw it last night myself!"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I absolutely loved it! I thought it was the best movie of the year!"
"__MOVIES__ You must not have seen any other movies this year."
"__MOVIES__ What makes you say that? I thought it was great!"
"__MOVIES__ Where do I start.....for one, the plot was just a mess and all over the place!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, true......but you don't go to these kinds of movie for the plot, you go for the action!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, lets talk about the action then.....it was just a mess, action needs to have a point, but there was NO POINT!"
"__MOVIES__ There was a point, I'm almost positive anyways......"
"__MOVIES__ We were never given a reason to care because it was all too confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, you made your point, what else didn't you like?"
"__MOVIES__ The forced comedy wasn't funny, at all."
"__MOVIES__ But Anthony Hopkins was funny!"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't cringed so much since I watched the last Saw movie because of the horrible dialogue"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you definately have a point, was there anything you liked about the movie??"
"__MOVIES__ No, too long, too confusing, 14 year old girl running around with more cleavage than Megan Fox displayed......"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I still thought it was epic"
"__MOVIES__ Really, even though you agreed to all of my point?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and remind me to never see a movie with you, you think too much"
