"__HARRY_POTTER__ So I've never seen the Harry Potter movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? By 2017 you haven't seen ANY of the movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No. I've read the books so many times I'm worried it will ruin it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Only if you go into the movies expecting the same thing as the books, word for word, scene for scene."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Does that not happen?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, in the first book they almost match it up scene for scene, but they cut out some of the stuff at the end when they are trying to get to the stone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? That sucks. I love that part of the book."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but there is SO much they get right. And some much that the books don't have."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? Like what."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The music. Right off the bat, it adds so much to it. Plus the detail that they put into all of the shots. My visit of Hogwarts couldn't compare to the movie version."
