"__ICEHOCKEY__ What's your favorite aspect of Ice Hockey?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The physical nature of it."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Can you explain further?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I like how when there is a disagreement, the gloves come off and they fight."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's like a small part of the sport itself"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah but it's definitely my favorite aspect"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Why don't you just watch MMA if you like fighting?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Doesn't take place on ice."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If MMA was on ice you would be more willing to watch it?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sure. It would make jiu jitsu that much harder."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What if hockey players were allowed to use jiu jitsu?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't even think it would be hockey at that point."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well they still play hockey. Only difference is when they fight, they're allowed to wrestle and choke each other out."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You have my interest. Continue."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If one of the players taps out, the puck gets surrendered to the other team"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It becomes less about the game at that point. Now it's more about who has better wrestlers."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Why can't it be both?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think they would just make a rule to timeout those that wrestle."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That makes it even more interesting. Now the winner's team has the puck, but the losers have a power play."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You don't know anything about hockey."
