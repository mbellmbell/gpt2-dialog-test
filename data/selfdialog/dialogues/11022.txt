"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. Go packers!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't know you were a packers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. I guess I got it from my dad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh cool. I like Payton manning. I don't care what team he's on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So your a Broncos fan right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure am. He's a great quarterback. I Was so happy when he left the colts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I never was a colts fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not a Patriots fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well yeah but I think Tom Brady's pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You do? What about deflating the footballs and cheating by looking at plays?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I'm not so sure all that happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which one?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they got fined for the deflating balls. I think they did for looking at the play books."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't belive someone like Brady would cheat that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well how do you explain how they win so much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are just a really solid team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not so sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at the last Super Bowl. They came back against the Falcons. They couldn't have cheated then."
