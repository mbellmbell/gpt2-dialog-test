"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, what do you like about Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the aspect of some magic being thrown in with a bit of science."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's pretty neat, I've never really thought of the force as magic."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't imagine how else to think of it. Space Wizards, really, with their own ideas."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. That could explain force sensitive people, they can feel the magic, but can't use it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, like Princess Leia. She could always feel it, but wasn't exactly like her brother."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know, that makes me curious, what if she could but was never really trained?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, she was a Princess so that makes sense. She was still pretty badass."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do like the female characters being strong on their own."
"__STAR_WARS__ They don't need anyone to save them, they aren't going to give in. Real role models."
