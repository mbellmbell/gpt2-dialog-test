"__MOVIES__ I wonder what most people consider to be the best film of ALL time."
"__MOVIES__ That's a loaded question."
"__MOVIES__ It certainly is. It involves 1. identifying what a film is, 2. choosing the best from each decade or so, 3. narrowing down to that one film that everyone, if not most, would agree as the best film of all time"
"__MOVIES__ Not possible."
"__MOVIES__ Says who?"
"__MOVIES__ Says me. No one will agree that one single film is the best of ALL time. They can't even agree which film is the best given any decade."
"__MOVIES__ Well, people also read at 8th grade level. it's only understandable that they can't decide on such thing."
"__MOVIES__ Ooooorrrrrr, the question is even more stupid than the people."
"__MOVIES__ Nope I don't think so. It's pretty simple, really."
"__MOVIES__ No it's not. I'll tell you why it's not simple. What's the best scifi film of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Star wars, hands down."
"__MOVIES__ That's your best scifi film of all time? That's... that's just sad.. Ok fine. Star wars. Now consider the sequels or prequels or whatever. Which one of them is the best? Or was the original with god awful special effects is the ebst? Or the newest is the best? See? you can't decide."
"__MOVIES__ You can't compare old movies special effects to computer generated ones nowadays. It's like comparing apples and oranges."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. What about the plot lines? Acting? The set? What about the camera angles?"
"__MOVIES__ [shrug]"
"__MOVIES__ What does that even mean? Just a shrug and you think you can still hold this stupid view that we can come up with the best single film of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ I dunno."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you can't. You can, however, have many best movies."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't even make sense."
"__MOVIES__ Of course it does. The 100 best movies of all time, or top 10 best scifi movies from the 90s, or whatever. But no one can do, the best film of all time. It doesn't exist."
