"__STAR_WARS__ I never understood why Anakin got so upset."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was a bad part of the first prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was just silly how bipolar he was."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  One moment, he gets mad at the queen, next moment says he can't live without her."
"__STAR_WARS__ It really hurt the movies how he went back and forth."
"__STAR_WARS__ And killed any momentum of him being emotionally battered."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right.  The fact that he killed her still rubs me the wrong way."

"__STAR_WARS__ They'll never remake them, but I wish they did."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too.  Can't erase the past though."
