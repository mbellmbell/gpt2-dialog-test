"__MUSIC__ Does your dog like to listen to music?"
"__MUSIC__ Music is on a lot in my house but I never noticed if the dog was listening. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I read a study done by the University of Glasgow that tested the reactions of dogs to different types of music."
"__MUSIC__ Why on earth would they care what kind of music dogs like or hate?"
"__MUSIC__ Think about it for a minute. Both of our dogs are kind of hyper."
"__MUSIC__ True, terriers get very excited."
"__MUSIC__ So if there were a type of music you played that would calm your dog down, why not play it?"
"__MUSIC__ What if I don't like listening to the same kind of music as the dog?"
"__MUSIC__ Think about it for a minute. When you leave the house wouldn't it be great if you left music on and the dog stayed calm?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, he really gets into stuff when I leave even for a minute- getting in the trash, eating the couch. So tell me what to play."
"__MUSIC__ Well the study tested soft rock, Motown, pop, reggae and classical."
"__MUSIC__ How did they test the music on dogs?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they played each type of music over a period of time and assessed physiological and behavioral changes in the dogs in this rehoming center."
"__MUSIC__ Don't tell me they were all mellow when they played classical music and went crazy and did bad things when they heard rock music."
"__MUSIC__ No, surprisingly not. Dogs prefer reggae and soft rock!"
"__MUSIC__ What did they test on the dogs?"
"__MUSIC__ Heart rate, breathing, behavior and researchers said they showed a decrease in stress levels especially when the music was reggae or soft work/"
"__MUSIC__ So tell me, have you tested this out on your dog?"
"__MUSIC__ Whenever we have to leave her alone we  put the cable station on the reggae or soft rock station. She's been good and has her favorite music."
"__MUSIC__ My guess is that she prefers the reggae station, just like her doggie daddy."
