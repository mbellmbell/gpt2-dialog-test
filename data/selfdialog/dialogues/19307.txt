"__MOVIES__ The movie called 'life'"
"__MOVIES__ I have not seen it yet."
"__MOVIES__ It is pretty good.  You should check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Whats it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is about a group of astronaughts at a space station.  They have life they found on mars."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds typical, what happens?"
"__MOVIES__ They are studying it and piss it off. Then it kills them all."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, what does the life look like."
"__MOVIES__ It looks like a big jelly fish when it grows."
"__MOVIES__ It grows?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it gets bigger as it eats the atronaughts."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that gnarly."
"__MOVIES__ The ending is not what you would expect either."
"__MOVIES__ Were you shocked?"
"__MOVIES__ My jaw dropped, but that is all I can say without ruining it for you."
"__MOVIES__ You might have already said too much."
"__MOVIES__ You still wont expect the ending."
