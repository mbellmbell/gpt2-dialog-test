"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, do you think Disney will drive our love for SW into the ground?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not excited about all these spin-offs"
"__STAR_WARS__ On paper, it seems cool to have things divert from the story/rules of the franchise"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right. But Rogue One was basically a prequel"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was so disappointing. Shades of Dirty Dozen but overwhelmed by tying in it"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is the problem, Disney. All those reshoots rumors"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they probably just used the reshoots to tie it into the franchise"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't care to see young Han Solo. I'd love for complete stand-alone stories"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ A Mace Windu story would be awesome. Or, I mean, Vader's hunt of the Jedi. We got a tiny taste in Rogue One"
