"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of hip-hop music at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Not especially, why?"
"__MUSIC__ Just wondering."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I just feel like I can;t relate to a lot of hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, sometimes I feel like a poser being a white person and listening to rap!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can see how that'd happen."
"__MUSIC__ There is some really cheesy rap written by white artists though."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by cheesy?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Lil Dicky?"
"__MUSIC__ No, is that a rapper?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ What's he like? It's a weird name."
"__MUSIC__ He's a super dorky Jewish guy, and a lot of his raps are parodies of just that."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds fun!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the music videos for some of his songs are pretty histerical too."
"__MUSIC__ This is definitely something I wanna check out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, please do! Then we can talk about him."
"__MUSIC__ What should I listen to first?"
"__MUSIC__ Check out the song Ex-Girlfriend, but be sure to watch the music video!"
