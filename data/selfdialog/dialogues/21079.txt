"__THRILLER__ What do you think of thrillers?"
"__THRILLER__ As long as they're not violent they're OK. I don't like a lot of violence in a movie."
"__THRILLER__ Neither do I. It's not entertaining to me."
"__THRILLER__ I don't understand why it would be to anyone."
"__THRILLER__ I saw 'What Lies Beneath' and the suspense was great."
"__THRILLER__ That's an older one, right?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, it came out about 15 years ago."
"__THRILLER__ I may have seen it but I can't remember. I think it used to be shown on HBO."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, that's right."
"__THRILLER__ I couldn't believe the ending in that. I was surprised."
