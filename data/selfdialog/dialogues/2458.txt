"__MUSIC__ well, the western art music, or classical music as many call it, does have odd time signatures. Anything in odd multiples of 3 IS odd."
"__MUSIC__ But they feel like waltzes, and waltzes are not very cool."
"__MUSIC__ No, but odd time signature indeed. It doesn't have to be complicated to be in an odd time signature and that is not an requirement for a music to be good"
"__MUSIC__ No it's not. but certain odd time signatures are very cool, like many used in jazz or fusion."
"__MUSIC__ many many classical pieces uses odd time signature in sections. There are so many examples, I don't know where to begin."
"__MUSIC__ The composer and the piece is a start."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. Fine. One example is Bela Bartok's Dance no 5 from six dances in Bulgarian rhythm is in 9/8 time signature."
"__MUSIC__ That's a real odd time signature."
"__MUSIC__ Except he expresses it as 2+2+2+3/ 8 It's just weird."
"__MUSIC__ probably to make it easier on the players. Play 2/b notes is not that hard nor is playing 3/8."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. Exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Play 2/8 three times and then play 3/8 once, except in one fluid bar. I can see that."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, but the piice itself is kinda bizzare."
"__MUSIC__ Well, most of Bartok's music is bizarre.."
"__MUSIC__ He even invented a pizzicato named after himself."
"__MUSIC__ Bartok Pizzicato."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. First used in his 4th string quartet. 4th movement to be exact."
"__MUSIC__ Nikita Koshkin adapted it for the guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. In Usher waltz."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite adaptation of the technique for any instrument by far."
