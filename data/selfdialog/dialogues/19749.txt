"__MOVIES__ I was looking through some movies on line wondering what to watch when I came across Killer Klown from  Outer Space."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that really sounds like it would oustanding!"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! Who wouldn't love and enjoy aliens that invade Earth that look like clowns."
"__MOVIES__ Why would any body make something so stupid!"
"__MOVIES__ I have heard of fusion  cooking but that is just as about as dumb Attack of the Killer Tomatoes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but at least it was them making fun of stupid 'b' rate movies. They weren't taking themselves seriously."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wait here's another one that was super cheesy  goodness. Attack of the 50 Foot Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Holy cow you really pulled one out of nowhere."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did. 1958  an alien turns a woman into a giantess."
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing the cover of that movie when i worked at a video store but I never bothered to read it because it looked so bad."
"__MOVIES__ Hey it's cult classic shot in black and white."
"__MOVIES__ That is something I have been meaning to do."
"__MOVIES__ What? Shoot a movie in black and white?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Make a list of cult science fiction classics and watch them."
"__MOVIES__ But there are cult classics in that genre that are really good and some that aren't."
"__MOVIES__ I would have a list for the cheesy ones and then the good ones to make it easier on myself."
"__MOVIES__ I will see if  I can help you out and come up with a few you may not think of."
"__MOVIES__ That would be great!"
"__MOVIES__ Until later my friend."
"__MOVIES__ Happy hunting!"
