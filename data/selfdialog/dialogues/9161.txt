"__BASEBALL__ Hey, did you watch the KC and Rays game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I watched up to the seventh inning but it was still one to nothing."
"__BASEBALL__ Aw, that stinks; they started scoring in the eighth.  The Royals got five in the eighth."
"__BASEBALL__ Really! I can't believe that.  I watched the entire boring ball and missed the good stuff."
"__BASEBALL__ Vargas was throwing some heat!  I think the Rays only had three or four hits."
"__BASEBALL__ That guy is a beast!  His ERA might be below one pretty soon."
"__BASEBALL__ I think this might be the end of the Rays for this year.  They've lost six of the last nine games to bad teams."
"__BASEBALL__ I think you might be right.  The Royals are bad too and they whipped them easily."
"__BASEBALL__ I think the main issue is their bullpen."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, every game I watch they are in the game into the starting pitcher gets pulled and then they start getting shelled."
"__BASEBALL__ You been watching your boys, the Red Sox, a lot."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I've been watching all their games.  I've been pretty dead at work, so I get the chance to watch them regularly."
"__BASEBALL__ Their game last night was pretty good, did you see that win over the Brewers?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I actually missed that.  I thought they'd win easily so I didn't make time for it.  Did they win easily?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, not really.  It was tied up one to one going into the ninth inning."
"__BASEBALL__ What! That sucks, I hate I missed that game.  What happened in the ninth?"
"__BASEBALL__ Boston got a couple guys on and Betts crushed a three run homer!"
"__BASEBALL__ That sounds like an awesome game, I hate I missed it.  Who got the win for the Sox?"
"__BASEBALL__ Kimbrel got the win.  I think he's two and O now.  It was a little rough though, because they brought in Feliz first but he could only get one out."
"__BASEBALL__ Man, I'm not missing any more of their games.  Go Sox!"
