"__MOVIES__ So I am looking for some good movies to watch while I am healing from my surgery. Any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know I love movies. You are going to need to be a little more specific as to what type of move."
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe a mixture of movies I can watch when my little kids are around and some to watch with my husband when they go to sleep. My husband and I like historical movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, as far as kids movies go I would have to suggest some of the newer movies that I have seen. What about Zootopia?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is about a little rabbit who wants to be a police officer but faces a lot of obstacles even once she is successful."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a good movie with a good lesson."
"__MOVIES__ I like it when kids movies have good takeaways for the kids to learn."
"__MOVIES__ Any other suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Well for you and your husband I would reccomend one of my favorites-The Pianist."
"__MOVIES__ What time period is that set during?"
"__MOVIES__ It is set during World War Two in Poland."
"__MOVIES__ I am liking it so far, what is the plot like?"
"__MOVIES__ A professional pianist is Jewish, which obviously creates problems when the Nazis invade. He ends up being in hiding to avoid concentration camps."
"__MOVIES__ Now that sounds good. I love those kinds of movies!"
"__MOVIES__ The really cool part is that it is based on real life events."
"__MOVIES__ Can I ask for a spoiler?"
"__MOVIES__ I suppose. What do you want to know?"
"__MOVIES__ Does the piano player make it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if you must know-yes, he does."
