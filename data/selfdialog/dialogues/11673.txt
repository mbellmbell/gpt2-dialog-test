"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are your Redskins looking for next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty good, I hope! This Kirk Cousins thing is out of control though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I don't know what that is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is our quarterback, and basically he and the Red Skins still haven't come to a long-term agreement for his contract."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no! When do they have to reach an agreement by?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to reach an agreement by July 17th."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow, that is soon. What is the issue?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His pay. If they don't come to an agreement, he'll get paid about $24 million for just next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I see. Hasn't he been pretty good for the Redskins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely! He was a bit of a wildcard, but he has been very good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happens if they don't reach an agreement?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they don't, it could be his last season with the Redskins, and we need him a lot!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no, so this could cost the Redskins a lot of money and a good player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, hopefully it'll work out. Are you planning on going to any games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. I'm a big Cowboys fan, so I'm trying to plan a trip to go see them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that would be really awesome. Where is their stadium?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's actually in Arlington, Texas, not Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh interesting. I have never been there. I went to a Falcons game at the Georgia dome last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, how was that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was awesome. The Falcons are building a new stadium soon though."
