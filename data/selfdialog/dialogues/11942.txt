"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you  been paying attention to the news coming from the all team practices?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not as much as most people, but I have a pretty good idea about most of the teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the news about the Bronco's?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they had that one run two seasons ago, and now they have to slow down to train up all the new guys they have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's true. I like what I'm hearing about the Bucaneers so far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it seems like Winston has really stepped up during this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they can take the NFC South?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. If Carolina comes out like they are capable of then there won't be much contest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean? The Saints are still in that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When was the last time they had a chance though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. And you know last season was a total fluke for Atlanta."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, they won't be back in the post season for a few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan just doesn't have it in him. They got lucky that the rest of the division was sort of crappy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's funny that we get that, but actual Falcon fans would beg to differ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but when was the last time you listened to someone from Georgia anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd have to say never."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. And of course you can't talk about a football season without bringing up New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh please, we were well on our way before you said that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's totally possible that they come out and win, even if that's not what you want to watch all season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's never what I want to watch, but sometimes you just have to accept the inevitable."
