"__MUSIC__ I really need to listen to music while I work, but my iPod is broken."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you stream music on the internet? That's what I do."
"__MUSIC__ What website do you use?"
"__MUSIC__ I use a website called Pandora. I would recommend it."
"__MUSIC__ How much does it cost? It sounds expensive."
"__MUSIC__ It's free actually. You can pay for upgraded service without ads etc but I use the free version and it's fine."
"__MUSIC__ It has ads? So it;s like a radio?"
"__MUSIC__ There are some ads inbetween songs but it really isn't that bad."
"__MUSIC__ What type of music do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ There are various genres in there. You can list your favorite artists and they will play music from that artist and people like them."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not following...Can you give me an example?"
"__MUSIC__ For instanse you can create a Michael Jackson channel. On that channel it will play Michael Jackson music, Prince, Jackson 5, Justin Timbalake, and other artists that are similar."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so it sort of gets to know my preferences."
"__MUSIC__ Yes exactly, and plays music that it think you will like."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds pretty convenient. Is it an app?"
"__MUSIC__ It comes in an app for your phone I believe, but I just stream the regular website on my computer while I'm at work."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds exactly like what I need! Thanks so much for letting me know about it."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, no problem. It's the least I can do after you used to make me those mixed tapes casettes when we were in fifth grade"
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe you remember that!"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I do. I still have a couple of the casettes!"
