"__MOVIES__ Why do you think the movie Child's Play started out as serious horror and then became a horror comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably because a killing doll can only scare you so many times before you start to see the ending before the movie starts."
"__MOVIES__ How so? It worked for Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees."
"__MOVIES__ Oh come on, by the 3rd movie on each of those you knew they were going to be killed off somehow."
"__MOVIES__ Not necessarily."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Did either really die in Freddy Vs Jason?"
"__MOVIES__ Freddy got his head chopped off and Jason went back in the lake."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly and when he came out of the lake he was holding Freddy's head and Freddy winked.  That sounds alive to me."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you got me there."
"__MOVIES__ And Nightmare On Elm Street part 1 and 2, Freddy wins even when they think he's dead and the movie ends."
"__MOVIES__ True."
"__MOVIES__ And it was said that Jason can't die in one of the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Don't you find it funny that they don't tell us that until the 9th Jason movie?  That information would have been a lot more helpful a couple decades and movies sooner."
"__MOVIES__ But wait, Jason's mom was the original killer in Friday The 13th and when she died, she stayed dead."
"__MOVIES__ And she was the star of one movie.  Not a series of movies."
"__MOVIES__ Which brings me back to my original question. Why did they turn Child's Play into more comedy than horror and suspense?"
"__MOVIES__ I told you.  Probably to change it up and not be the same stuff all the time."
"__MOVIES__ It worked for Jason and Freddy."
"__MOVIES__ They had better agents."
