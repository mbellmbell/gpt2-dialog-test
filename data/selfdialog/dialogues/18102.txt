"__MOVIES__ You know, I've never seen Weekend at Bernie's."
"__MOVIES__ How is that even possible?"
"__MOVIES__ I've just never gotten around to it. I dunno."
"__MOVIES__ You're missing out, man. It's great."
"__MOVIES__ Should we watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, but we have to also watch the sequel."
"__MOVIES__ There's a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and this is the thing, like all 90s sequels, they have to go out of their way to make it possible."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know how like, after watching Home Alone, you think 'there's no way they'll ever leave that kid at home again.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, more or less."
"__MOVIES__ But then they manage to do it in a way that's totally plausible. You buy it."
"__MOVIES__ Sure. But that's just Home Alone."
"__MOVIES__ It's not just Home Alone though--like, there's a sequel to Speed that takes place on a cruise ship."
"__MOVIES__ With the same characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Some of them. In the same situation twice."
"__MOVIES__ That's absurd."
"__MOVIES__ And Weekend at Bernie's does it best."
"__MOVIES__ How?"
"__MOVIES__ We just need to watch it."
