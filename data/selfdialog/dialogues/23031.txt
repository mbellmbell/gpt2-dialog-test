"__DISNEY__ Oh my goodness!"
"__DISNEY__ What? What is it?"
"__DISNEY__ Beauty and the Beast is officially tied with Maleficent for my favorite live action Disney movie. Actually Maleficent still wins because Angelina Jolie was AMAZING in that role."
"__DISNEY__ You're telling me. It's one of her best roles in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ Do you have a favorite live action Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ As far as remakes go also Maleficent, but in general? Either Honey, I Shrunk the Kids or The Mighty Ducks with Emilio Estevez."
"__DISNEY__ The Mighty Ducks is probably the only sports movie I'll ever watch, and can watch it repeatedly at that. Funnier still is I normally could care less about hockey, but that was a great movie from start to finish."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know man, Air Bud was a pretty good Disney sports movie."
"__DISNEY__ Saw it in theaters and the original was perfect but not quite enough to be in my faves. Plus they made way too many sequels and spin-offs."
"__DISNEY__ That's an understatement! 14 movies is absolutely ridiculous though I really can't fault Disney for wanting to fully take advantage of this cash cow."
