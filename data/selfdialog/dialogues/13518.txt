"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last season, the offense was the ball and chain of this team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Defense was fine and ST wasn't particularly inspiring. Texans did two things I felt they had to do to give the O some pop - they drafted a QB and also a young gun back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ RT could have been addressed as well but I won't grumble about ZC at 57!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we will see a lot of pounding the rock this year and the running game should be ranked very high."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Miller should be a lot more dangerous with fresher legs and should stay fresher throughout the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Foreman will be the hammer with some surprise receptions along the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, we have no real clear picture at RT, even with Giacomini on the team, as he might yet get hurt again but we do have several young guns to coach up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Mancz will retain his C position and Martin will compete for the RT job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also see the receiving corp being very competitive with another season under their belts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been waiting so long for Savage to take the reins I am pretty excited to see him in action from game 1."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But in the back of my mind I keep thinking that Smith will demand that Watson play much like he did with Brock."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not confident about the offense not one bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That skit display we witnessed last season was unreal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No creativity whatsoever especially in the red zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ . We are starting another mediocrity at best quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bill O'Brien calling the plays again which is meh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ . Health to the offensive line will be crucial."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. The creativity is as bad as Kubiak days were the only time we fooled anyone it was a bootleg."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ . I was watching the reshowing of Seattle vs Denver week 3 last year , last night and the Seahawks got the ball and went 3 and out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then Ball fumbled on Denvers first play around the 30."
