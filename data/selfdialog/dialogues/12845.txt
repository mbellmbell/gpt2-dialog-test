"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see that contract that Derek Carr signed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it wasn't all that surprising."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How is a record-setting contract not surprising?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone knew that he'd get an elite contract as one of the top young QBs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he's really proved enough, though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I mean, the injury was a total fluke, since he's been pretty healthy to this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But still, $25 million per year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Salaries keep creeping up with the cap, plus it's not all guaranteed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But do you really think he's better than Andrew Luck?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm surprised to say this, but yeah, he's been more consistent than Luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Luck has definitely put up gaudier stats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yardage-wise, definitely, but he hasn't been as efficient lately. Luck's had more picks and not more TDs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it helps Carr in the red zone, though, having Amari Cooper instead of TY Hilton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but Cooper's young, and you'd think Luck would have more TD throws with that running game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think Frank Gore is that bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on, he used to be good, but he's running on fumes now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marshawn Lynch isn't a spring chicken, himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that'll be interesting, but he's not being paid a ton, anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you think the Raiders are legitimate contenders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but even I'm surprised how well that rebuild went, so maybe I'm getting ahead of myself."
