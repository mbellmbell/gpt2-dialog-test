"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new, live action Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I did! I loved it!"
"__DISNEY__ Same! I think they did an awesome job following the cartoon."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and Emma Watson was a great choice for Bell."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I found it interesting that they made Le Fou openly gay in this movie."
"__DISNEY__ It's great to see Disney being so progressive and showing gay characters!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, though I know a lot of people are very upset by it."
"__DISNEY__ Oh well, they don't have to watch it then. But they will miss out on some great songs and dances!"
"__DISNEY__ Right?! The choreography is so well done!"
"__DISNEY__ And the costumes worked so well!"
