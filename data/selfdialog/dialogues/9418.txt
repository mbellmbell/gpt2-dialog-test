"__BASEBALL__ Hey, can you believe the Rockies?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's been crazy, the question is if they can keep it up"
"__BASEBALL__ At some point the bullpen is going to cost them right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Probably, I mean, the Dodgers are better on paper"
"__BASEBALL__ At the very least CO will hit all year"
"__BASEBALL__ It's hard for surprise teams to last, but maybe they can. They have youth"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah unlike the Twins they have a good mix of youth and vets"
"__BASEBALL__ Anyway, do you think LA has the best shot in the NL?"
"__BASEBALL__ They have the cash and assets to acquire more help, they have youth"
"__BASEBALL__ But they can't hit lefties!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that is so funny and perhaps their downfall again. Though there's not a ton of lefties in the NL"
"__BASEBALL__ But there are bullpen lefties and that matters in the playoffs"
"__BASEBALL__ The key to beating LA is essentially keep it close for 5 innings and then turn over to your lefty bullpen"
"__BASEBALL__ Okay, what is the saddest team in baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Easy. San Francisco."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep. That is a team that has long needed to tear it down and rebuild"
"__BASEBALL__ Does that mean trading Posey?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, that would truly be a tear down."
"__BASEBALL__ They have to do something, or pray they find some decent pieces in the offseason"
"__BASEBALL__ I think their run is over and they need to start over"
