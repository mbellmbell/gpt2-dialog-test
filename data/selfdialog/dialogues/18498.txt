"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Hunger Game first movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was pretty intense."
"__MOVIES__ Can you imagine having our children ripped from us to go hunt each other?"
"__MOVIES__ That is a really crazy thing but I bet there are some countries whose children have to fight to survive."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think you would have traded places with you little sister so she didn't have to go fight like Katniss did in  the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I certainly would have traded places with her, she is so young.  Would you have traded places?"
"__MOVIES__ I am pretty certain I would but I don't know for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember where the Hunger Games took place?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it took place in Panem which was established after an apocalyptic event."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember much about Panem.  Can you help me remember a bit?"
"__MOVIES__ The nation consisted of the wealthy capital.  Surrounding the capital are twelve poor districts."
"__MOVIES__ That's right and they randomly pick 2 kids from each district to go fight for the death in the games."
"__MOVIES__ It is pretty sad to think that this happened in the movie.  It seemed so real."
"__MOVIES__ I know, you feel like you are right there, a part of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the name of the child who Katniss became friends with?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, during the games, Katniss and Rue become good friends."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah and Rue is killed and Katniss killed the tribute who killed Rue."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember Katniss singing to Rue as she was dying?"
"__MOVIES__ She sang to her and then to defy the Capital, she covered Rue's body with flowers."
"__MOVIES__ I was so glad that Katniss did not like the capital and was not afraid to show it."
