"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened to Romo anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He retired"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has the 4th highest passer ratings. It's kinda sad that he didn't have any superbowl wins"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like we talked about, winning the Superbowl isn't all skills, but also depend a lot on luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even going to the Superbowl depends on luck. Who's healthy, playing well, etc"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And each game depends on the play calls too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Romo's going to be a color analysts for the CBS anyway. He's getting 1.5 mill talking about the sports he loves"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a great job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do they calculate that paser rating anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. No idea. I reckon there's division involved"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya think? Let me see here. Oh it's a weighted average"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does that mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That means a certain nunmbers are averaged andthen weighted by multiplying a factor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there are 4 categories, completion/attepmts, yards/attempts, TDs/attepmts, and interceptions/attempts"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeas, and each categoriy is mutiplied by a factor, albeit each by different factors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where did they get the factors?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, I have no idea on that one. But the goal is to get each number to be, at maximum, 2.375 and then those categories are then added and weighted again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is too confusing. I think QBR from ESPN is much better"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you don't even know how they calculate it. You just like it because it's from ESPN. They've never made the details public, until they do, i trust the passer rating from NFL"
