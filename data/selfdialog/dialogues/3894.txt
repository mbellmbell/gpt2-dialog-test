"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Cold War Kids?"
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea. Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they are a band in the alternative genre. I really like them."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of them. What is one of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Well they have a bunch, but my favorite is called First."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've heard that. Then again, I don't listen to that genre much."
"__MUSIC__ It was actually that song that really got me into the alternative genre."
"__MUSIC__ How is that?"
"__MUSIC__ I heard that song on the radio and then looked it up on Youtube. From there, I just went with the suggested playlist."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. Did you find a lot of other music you liked?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. I really like Alt-J, Soundhounds, Milky Chance, and so many more."
"__MUSIC__ You are way out of my area. I've never even heard of any of those artists."
"__MUSIC__ You should definitley try it out."
"__MUSIC__ I may like it. I do like some semi-alternative music like Mumford and Sons."
"__MUSIC__ I love them too. They have that folk/dance vibe."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are pretty unique."
"__MUSIC__ The song Wake Me Up has that same feel, but I can't find anything else like it."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. It seems to be a one off song that combined folk instruments with EDM."
"__MUSIC__ I heard it wasn't well received when it was introduced at the festival."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it definitely is now! That song was everywhere a few years ago."
