"__BASKETBALL__ Do you know how to play basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ A little bit but I do not know all of the rules. Do you want to teach me more?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure I can teach you a few of the rules what do you want to know?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What is traveling?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Traveling occurs when rather than dribbling the basketball you hold the ball while still moving or taking steps."
"__BASKETBALL__ So can I take any steps when holding the ball"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, you can take two steps when holding the ball. At which point you must shoot or pass the ball."
"__BASKETBALL__ So how do the points work in basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Typically the points in basketball are 2 points and 3 points. 2 points are awarded for most baskets."
"__BASKETBALL__ How do you get 3 points in the game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Three points are provided in a basketball game when you make a basket from behind the three point line. This is further away from the basketball hoop."
"__BASKETBALL__ So it could be a risk trying to make 3-point shots I guess."
"__BASKETBALL__ There are also penalties in basketball. A penalty may occur when a player pushes another player, a foul."
"__BASKETBALL__ What happens when a penalty occurs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Depending on the location of the penalty, penalty shots may be awarded."
"__BASKETBALL__ What is a penalty shot?"
"__BASKETBALL__ A penalty shot provides the player that was fouled with two shots into the hoop from the top of the key. The other players must stand on the side of the key and not defend their basket."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sounds like penalty shots could allow a team to make lots of points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Each penalty shot is only worth 1 point. Typically if you make the first shot you get a second shot opportunity."
"__BASKETBALL__ So the three ways to make points are regular 2-point shots, 3-point shots, and penalty shots?"
