"__MOVIES__ have you seen Everything Must Go with Will Ferrell?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was ok, but it bored me. He is a much better comedy actor."
"__MOVIES__ I think he done a good job."
"__MOVIES__ I liked him a lot more, as far as a serious role in Stranger Than Fiction"
"__MOVIES__ That was a good movie, kinda weird. Reminded me of The Truman Show."
"__MOVIES__ Really? How?"
"__MOVIES__ Both had their destiny plotted out for them."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree. Truman yes but Ferrell, the narrator heard and wrote all his thoughts and actions."
"__MOVIES__ No, if she had, she would have had to hve been there, but instead she wrote them and he heard her inner monologue as she wrote."
"__MOVIES__ Still, it is a statement of predestination versus freewill."
"__MOVIES__ How so? Truman had no free will, he was an experiment in reality TV."
"__MOVIES__ True, but he had free will to move about his world."
"__MOVIES__ Not really his world was scripted , or at least all those around him. His wife didn't even like him, how they expalined relations in real world would have been prostitution."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but he was tipped off by returning cast, Ferrell's character could hear the writer simultaniuously, so wouldn't that have actually put him in charge?"
"__MOVIES__ there in lies the tick, is free will really free? As we are held responsible for our actions, or can we blame it on an unsen hand?"
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty deep there..."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't make it any less valid a comparison."
"__MOVIES__ Fair point, so in the end, neither had free will."
"__MOVIES__ I guess not, but I still think Everything Must Go was ok"
"__MOVIES__ It was just that, ok, I would watch it on tv, not in a movie theater."
