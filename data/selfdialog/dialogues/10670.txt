"__FASHION__ i also dig cooper 's outfit"
"__FASHION__ oh really,i thought it was too colorful for a guy like cooper."
"__FASHION__ i wouldn't think so,as the jacket had patches of black"
"__FASHION__ true though."
"__FASHION__ do you think will smith was too casual ?"
"__FASHION__ oh not at all, i just felt he wanted to keep it simple and just do the white long sleeve and black pant,"
"__FASHION__ i felt its a terrible way to dress for an event like the oscar."
"__FASHION__ that's how you see it,but what you'd call casual is well worth $6000"
"__FASHION__ nah it can be that expensive,i would say $2000"
"__FASHION__ oh no way,do you think will smith will rock a sleeve,black pant,a Paul smith shoe and Hermes belt for a piety $2000,it should be way more than that."
"__FASHION__ if what will smith wore you think would cost $6000 then what would you say of Daniel Craig who was just so stunning and stole the red carpet."
"__FASHION__ oyeah Daniel was actually the man on the red carpet , that jacket was way too cool,his stylist must have put a great deal in making him look that way."
"__FASHION__ stylist?i heard he styles himself."
"__FASHION__ if he does then he could make some extra more money being a stylist.lol"
"__FASHION__ oyeah. so about the purse you want to buy which have you decided to purchase."
"__FASHION__ am still  indecisive"
"__FASHION__ why don't you check out the CHANNEL  purse Jenifer Lawrence had on for the Oscars i think it was lovely"
"__FASHION__ yeah i love that purse jenny had, would have been a good choice but then i reckon it would be  too expensive."
"__FASHION__ true though but you should check for the price first as CHANNEL purses are not that all expensive"
"__FASHION__ OK i would check to see if i can afford it."
