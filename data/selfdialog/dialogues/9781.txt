"__COMEDY__ Are they ever going to make another Austin Powers movie?"
"__COMEDY__ I think they were planning to at one time."
"__COMEDY__ Seems kind of pointless though."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, those movies have come and gone."
"__COMEDY__ Mike Myers hasn't done jack in how many years now?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, pretty much since Austin Powers."
"__COMEDY__ If they did do one, he'd be another 20 years old or so I think."
"__COMEDY__ I'd rather him make another Wayne's World before this."
"__COMEDY__ Totally agree with you.  Party on, Wayne!"
"__COMEDY__ Party on, Garth!"
