"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, maybe Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ That's an old one.  Why that one?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, maybe because it's a traditional story."
"__DISNEY__ Have you been to Cinderella's Castle at Disney World?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep, I have pictures of the kids there."
"__DISNEY__ What's the wicked stepmother's name again?"
"__DISNEY__ It's Lady Tremaine I think.  And the cat's name is Lucifer."
"__DISNEY__ Hah, that's fitting I guess."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and the evil stepsisters are Anastasia and Drizella."
