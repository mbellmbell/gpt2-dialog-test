"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes I have and I love them. Have you."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes and I loved the fact that the kids had such good chemistry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's really important, that can make or break a  movie. Have you ever had a marathon?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes me and my kids have Harry Potter marathons all the time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know what adds to the fun? Making butterbeer and popcorn to watch with it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You can actually make butterbeer? The same as it's described in the movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes there's a recipe on line. It contains butterscotch, really good."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That sounds good, I know my kids would love that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Mine flip out over it. We can't watch Harry Potter anymore unless there's butterbeer."
