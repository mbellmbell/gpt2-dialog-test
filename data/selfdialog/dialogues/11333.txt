"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe the start of the NFL season is just about 2 months away know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's crazy. I feel like the Patriots were just beating the Falcons in overtime in the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't remind me. I am still angry about them beating the Steelers in the AFC championship game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Steelers will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am hoping for the best. As long as we can stay healthy I think we have a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adding James Connor to add depth at running back was a good move during the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. We are solid on offense with Ben, Bell, Brown, Connor, and hopefully Bryant will be back to himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So glad Ben decided to come back this year and not retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't believe he would actually retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ James Harrison will always be solid, even if he is 40. The rest of the defense needs to step up and prove themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they made good moves in free agency to sure up the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets hope. Are you planning on going to any games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have tickets to the home game against the Packers. I might go to one of the Thursday night games as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sweet, I'm hoping to make it to a couple as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their really is nothing like the experience of a home Steeler's game at Heinz field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. Got to have the terrible towel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are also so many restaurants around the stadium now that game days are now an all day event."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well let's hope for 16-0."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, I think we have 2 guaranteed wins against the Browns."
