"__MUSIC__ So, are you a music lover?"
"__MUSIC__ That depends on what you mean by 'music lover'"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, do you like to listen to music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't have a lot of time for it."
"__MUSIC__ Not to sound rude, but you can listen to music and do other things at the same time, right?"
"__MUSIC__ I really can't....I like to play it loud, shut my eyes and get taken up in it"
"__MUSIC__ That's ideal, really, but I wonder if you are missing out by having 'less than perfect' circumstances to listen to music ..."
"__MUSIC__ what do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I love your idea and it IS ideal, but what about just playing music while you are doing other things?"
"__MUSIC__ i have a one year old baby.  How would that work?"
"__MUSIC__ I know that when i had a small baby, the baby definitely liked certain kinds of music, like music with a heavy base."
"__MUSIC__ what happened?"
"__MUSIC__ she would actually nod her head in time with the music.  it was so cool to watch. her father played guitar and she would move with that also"
"__MUSIC__ i'm thinking of trying that out.  what do you think i should start with?"
"__MUSIC__ well, depending on the time of day, like nap time, a mid range classical cut would be good. something that had enough action to grab her attention and then slowing down"
"__MUSIC__ why that kind?"
"__MUSIC__ It would help the baby to nap!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, i never really thought of these ideas"
"__MUSIC__ they specifically make CDs of different 'moods' to play for babies; wake them up, put them to sleep, that sort of thing"
"__MUSIC__ this is brilliant...I'm going to do this!"
