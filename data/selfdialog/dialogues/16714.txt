"__MOVIES__ I saw the movie Xanadu last night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that is like a cult classic. I have seen it as well."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I love it! I thought Olivia Newton John was great in it."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too and her singing and dancing was wonderful."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that Gene Kelly played a part in it."
"__MOVIES__ His dancing was impeccable. It was so great that he was in it for sure."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the music in it. I want the soundtrack."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, ELO was great. I am surprised the movie did not do better."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that it was because it was not released in a lot of theaters and the critics didn't like it, but people who saw it did."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so not enough people could see it so the sales were low."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is what I heard."
"__MOVIES__ It was a little cheesy I guess, but it was fun."
"__MOVIES__ I would watch it again just for the music and dancing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and it was fun to see roller skating."
"__MOVIES__ The relationship between Gene Kelly's character and Sonny was great."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that Sonny treated him with respect."
"__MOVIES__ Yes you don't see that a lot nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, people show no respect to older people."
"__MOVIES__ Well the movie shows how valuable older people are."
