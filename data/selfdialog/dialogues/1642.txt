"__MUSIC__ Do you know who Halsey is?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of. She's from the Chainsmokers, right?"
"__MUSIC__ No, she's not part of the Chainsmokers, she was just featured on one of their popular songs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, okay. That song was so overplayed."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but you should check out her own music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, her first album Badlands is really good."
"__MUSIC__ What's her genre would you say?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. Maybe a blend of pop and alternative and electronic."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, sounds cool."
"__MUSIC__ Her new album, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom, is great too."
"__MUSIC__ Is it similar to her first?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of, they're both concept records."
"__MUSIC__ What does that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ It means all the songs sort of go together and tell a story."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's really cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, her new one is based off Romeo and Juliet."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, that's definitely unique."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you should definitely give it a listen all the way through."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I will!"
