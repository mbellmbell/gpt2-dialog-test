"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does the NFL miss from its storied past?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Players who truly care about playing hard, performing well and winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Players like...?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Earl Campbell is a great example. He gave absolutely everything he had all the time. And to this day he's glad he did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Players like him built the NFL we know today."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There was a lot of entertainment value in watching players like Campbell, or Walter Payton, or Mike Singletary, or Ron Jaworski."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could today's declining interest in NFL football be attributed to such a comparison?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Many people see much less entertainment value in watching players pull up short on tackles and jogging to the ball during plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will Amazon be a good broadcast partner for the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to say. The NFL's internet-based broadcast experiments of the last few years have been ephemeral and have produced underwhelming results."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which teams are lost causes at this point?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 49ers are one. Their ownership has taken a resuscitated perennial title contender and reduced it to a semi-professional outfit. The new hires have their work cut out for them, but Lynch and Shanahan give them hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Bears?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chicago has the same problem as San Francisco. No one seems to know what he is doing and the team lurches into the new season like a twitching, plodding zombie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do the Dolphins belong in this group?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, Miami is a mid-level team with some promise, but ownership and management do hurt the Dolphins regularly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Cleveland?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns are still the same. New ownership is needed I'm afraid. Bad uniforms don't help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lions might be good, or bad..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Detroit could go a few different directions, but they are still easy to predict: they are a mediocre team that produces mediocre results."
