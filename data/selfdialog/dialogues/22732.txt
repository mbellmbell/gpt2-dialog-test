"__DISNEY__ I think Frozen is this generation's Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think so? They're such different movies."
"__DISNEY__ I know, but I think they just both took off in the same way."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, do you think they both just became really popular?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and they also both have songs everyone knows."
"__DISNEY__ The 'Let It Go' song kind of annoys me sometimes."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I liked it at first, but now I can't stand it."
"__DISNEY__ The songs from The Lion King didn't annoy me like that."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe that had something to do with us being kids with The Lion King came out though."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe you're right."
