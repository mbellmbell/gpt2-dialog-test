"__MUSIC__ Did you see Katy Perry's performance on SNL last week?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I missed it. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ It was crazy. She has a completely new style muscially and physically."
"__MUSIC__ What's so different about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she performed this song 'Swish Swish.' It almost had a club or techno beat."
"__MUSIC__ She's know for her over-the-top performances. Did she do anything special for performing this song?"
"__MUSIC__ She had a catwalk of drag queens and she was wearing this Beetlejuice like top. The song was kind of catchy though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard that one. It is almost like a blend between hip hop and eighties Madonna."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, she also had this kid in a backpack dancing. He was doing crazy hand movements."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you can never say that you're not entertained or capitvated when she takes the stage."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. That is very true because there's always lots to look at for her stage performances."
"__MUSIC__ What about the second song she performed."
"__MUSIC__ She did the song 'Bon App√©tit' featuing Migos. It's almost got a latin dance and hip hop blend going on."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. What did she do for the stage performance?"
"__MUSIC__ She was laying and dancing on a banquet table surrounded by fruit."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's actually pretty tame compared to her other performances."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she also had people sitting around the table pretending to seductively eat the fruit."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I figured there had to be something more to it. It seemed to basic."
"__MUSIC__ All in all, it was a pretty good performance. The music was danceable."
"__MUSIC__ Im going to have to go back and watch it. Thanks."
