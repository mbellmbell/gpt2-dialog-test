"__STAR_WARS__ What side of the force do you like better, dark or light?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the darkside better"
"__STAR_WARS__ I also do, I think the sith are cooler characters. Which sith lord would win in a duel?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Darth Maul would, judging by The Phantom Menace fight at the end"
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Kylo Ren will end up being a better sith?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He looked very weak in the Force Awakens"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but I bet in the Last Jedi he will fight Luke Skywalker and it'll be better"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know about that, he might have to fight Rey again"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it could be a lot like the Empire Strikes Back"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope so, but we need a Han Solo type character"
