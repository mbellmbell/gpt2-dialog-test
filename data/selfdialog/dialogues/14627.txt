"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey man, how are things?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I can't complain; how are you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No complaints here either. I've been super busy recently, but mostly with cool stuff."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah? Like what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ My brother and I went to see the band Mutoid Man play the other night; it was really good."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Mutoid Man? Never heard of them."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think you'd dig them. Really heavy riff-based rock."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Kind of like Mastodon?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Eh, not really, maybe like a heavier Queens of the Stone Age."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh man, sounds right up my alley. So the show was good?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, it was super loud and my ears are still ringing. The show was two nights ago."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I remember when we saw Explosions in the Sky I swear my ears rang for a week."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah man, those guys are super loud."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So good though. Did you know that they did the Friday Night Lights soundtrack?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, I didn't. That's awesome."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, they've actually done a number of soundtracks besides that one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The Lone Survivor soundtrack."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Really? That was a pretty decent movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I liked it too."
