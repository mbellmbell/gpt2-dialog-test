"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is better, Peyton or Eli?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously Eli."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because Eli had two rings first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea but that alone doesn't make him better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton is taller, bigger, and has more experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To me that just means he's slower, easier to tackle, and older."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton has more yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea but that's because he played more games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's bull. He more touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, it's because he's an older player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many pro bowl nominations does eli have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 3 I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton has 12."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, but what else do you have? Eli is still better in my mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, and only in your mind. Just admit it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look, they are both amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok fine, finally we agree on something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they will both end up in the hall of fame."
