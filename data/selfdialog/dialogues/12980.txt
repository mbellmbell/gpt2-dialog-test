"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of this year's Miami Dolphins roster?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their offensive line is stacked in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't see their draft. It must of been good to get this reaction."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Twenty six players on their roster got drafted in the first three rounds of the NFL draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Take me through a few players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok lets take their quarterback for instance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ryan Tannehill?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, He's the best quarterback they have had since Dan Marino retired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he has shown a consistent level of improvement every year since he was drafted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. He is on a very steady upswing and his performance really shows it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else would you say on the roster is a stand out on the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say their runing back is another stand out for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jay Ajayi?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah thats him! He established himself as a Top 10 RB in the NFL with three 200+ yard performances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was also in a pro bowl if I remember correctly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he was which just adds on to how good this guy is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you expect them to do well this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely I'd be shocked if they didn't"
