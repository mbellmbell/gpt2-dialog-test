"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you following the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah for sure. I watch every Sunday in the fall no matter who is on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Steelers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it my dad. I'm Patriots all the way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did you end up a Pats fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My uncle was so I decided I would be do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you can thank him for that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so. It is fun watching a team who wins a lot, I'll admit it, but it's hard to say I'm a fan when everyone responds with 'bandwagon.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I'm sure you've heard that a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. And then I have to tell them I liked them with Bledsoe was still the quarterback and that helps a little."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's good. I mean, the Steelers haven't been over the top recently, but they've won a lot too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For you. You have the most Super Bowls!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I can't imagine being a fan of the Bills or Eagles or a team like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would definintely be painful. They're loyal though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kuddos to them! I guess I would be to the Steelers too, but I wouldn't like it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. Steelers should be decent again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it is tough to say. No guarantees like the Pats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, I don't see it as a guarantee. You never know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. Any given Sunday. Isn't that the motto?"
