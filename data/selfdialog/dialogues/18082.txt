"__MOVIES__ Hey have you seen the movie Hell or High Water?"
"__MOVIES__ No, is it new?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think it just came out!  It was awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about these two brothers who are bank robbers.  They keep committing different heists to try to save their family farm."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting.  I love a good bank robber movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the suspense is great.  Plus the scenery in the movie is beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Is it set in modern times, or is it in the olden days?"
"__MOVIES__ No it's modern.  I think it's somewhere down in Texas or something."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great, who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't ever remember the names of actors but you would probably recognize them."
"__MOVIES__ So what ends up happening, can you tell me?"
"__MOVIES__ No, you will have to watch it!  I promise you will enjoy it though."
"__MOVIES__ I'm always looking for a good movie.  We watched Desperado the other night, do you remember that one?"

"__MOVIES__ You should re-watch that one when you get a chance."
