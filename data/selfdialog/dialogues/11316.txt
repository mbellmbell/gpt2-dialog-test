"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read a ranking list of the best football players ever. Guess who was number one?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he was number seven. But he's still playing, maybe he can work his way up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, how about Joe Montana?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, close. He was number three. But he is really well known when people talk about the greatest players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, how about Peyton Manning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, he was like number ten or something. Although he WAS a great quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brett Favre was a great quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he was. But he was even further down the list than Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dan Marino was another great quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was down on the list too. The greatest player listed was not a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? What position did the greatest player play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wide receiver. Now that's a good hint, since there wasn't a lot of those on the top of the list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm, Calvin Johnson was a wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was way down on the list. You gotta think old timers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Randy Moss was a wide receiver. Not him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. It was Jerry Rice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, Rice was considered the greatest player of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and number two was Walter Payton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always liked Walter Payton, he was a great player to watch."
