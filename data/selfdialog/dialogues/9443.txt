"__BASEBALL__ Aroldis Chapman on the DL with shoulder issues."
"__BASEBALL__ Not good news."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but the Yankees at least have Betances to fill in as a reliable closer."
"__BASEBALL__ That's good, but this is really bad for Chappy."
"__BASEBALL__ He's only on the 10 day DL, it can't be too bad."
"__BASEBALL__ Not necessarily, they put him on the 10 day disabled list to hold for evaluation."
"__BASEBALL__ So it could be worse than that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. Anytime you hear shoulder injury it is a reason for pause."
"__BASEBALL__ It is being reported as shoulder soreness, not bad."
"__BASEBALL__ Well rotator cuff for a pitchers is very serious. Lot of guys never get well."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right, Scott Kazmir might be one of the only guys to salvage something after major shoulder issues."
"__BASEBALL__ Right, and he had to change his style and it took years to get it back."
"__BASEBALL__ Now I'm worried."
"__BASEBALL__ Well it could be managed, but shoulder is serious opposed to elbow issues or other injuries."
"__BASEBALL__ Let's hope it's minor and he gets through it."
"__BASEBALL__ For his sake I do hope so. The guy throws hard and anything that jeopardizes that can be career threatening."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep. You have to think it's somewhat unsurprising that he would eventually have an issue."
"__BASEBALL__ Reminds me a little bit of Wood and Prior."
"__BASEBALL__ But Chapman is a reliever so maybe he has a better chance of working through it."
"__BASEBALL__ Probably why they made him a reliever in the first place, they had to know the risk of throwing that hard would be best in small doses."
