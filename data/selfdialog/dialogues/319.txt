"__MUSIC__ I have a bunch of old Ska cassettes if you know anybody who'd be interested in buying them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, I would be if I had a tape player."
"__MUSIC__ If mine still worked I'd throw it in. But I have a bunch of Operation Ivy, The Specials, Flight One Eighty and such just if you're interested."
"__MUSIC__ Those are good bands."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I haven't had any luck asking friends."
"__MUSIC__ I mean it's not the most popular genre..."
"__MUSIC__ No, and I don't really know the right outlet for selling or trading specifically ska music."
"__MUSIC__ Have you tried looking for social media groups?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there isn't really anything local since it's such a small town though."
"__MUSIC__ You know there's a subreddit for everything on Reddit, and I happen to know there's a ska subreddit cause I'm subscribed to it."
"__MUSIC__ Is it very active?"
"__MUSIC__ Relatively. There's no one there who isn't familar with those groups and even if you don't manage to sell them you'll meet new people with the same interest in ska!"
"__MUSIC__ I just may have to do that. I need more rudeboys and girls in my life."
"__MUSIC__ I mean that's the biggest venue for us I can think of, short of actually going to ska shows."
"__MUSIC__ Which won't be around here, unfortunately."
"__MUSIC__ True that. Hey maybe you could gift them to someone who'd be willing to listen to them and who hasn't been exposed to ska."
"__MUSIC__ That would be a great way to spread the love for it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I feel like it really deserves a bigger fanbase."
"__MUSIC__ It seemed like when I was growing up there was a bigger fanbase for it, but in hindsight I think that was just my family."
"__MUSIC__ Same here."
