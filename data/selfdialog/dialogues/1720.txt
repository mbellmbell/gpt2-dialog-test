"__MUSIC__ Who are some of your favorite bands of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like White Zombie and Rage Against the Machine."
"__MUSIC__ Rage Against the Machine, I haven't listened to them in awhile. What's your favorite album of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ It's tough to choose. I love their self-titled album, I love Battle of Los Angeles, and Evil Empire is great too."
"__MUSIC__ What about Renegades? It's cover songs, but I really enjoyed it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes that's a good one too. Songs off of Renegades helped me get into them and seek out more of their stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I like them a lot too. I think each album has a different personality and there are different things to like about them."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I would listen to different albums of theirs depending on my mood."
"__MUSIC__ The self-titled first album is really angry and hard charging."
"__MUSIC__ It's like a shot of adrenaline and it doesn't let go. The song 'Wake Up' I used to listen to on my way to work if I had a long day ahead of me."
"__MUSIC__ And of course it has the infamous 'Killing in the Name.'"
"__MUSIC__ I remember hearing that on the radio and they edited out the last several lines because of the expletive that was repeated."
"__MUSIC__ The songs are very political too, like 'Killing in the Name,' 'Bombtrack,' and 'Take the Power Back.'"
"__MUSIC__ You could consider just about all the songs on this album as political. It really established their tone and attitude."
"__MUSIC__ What else stands out about the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Tom Morello's guitar playing is amazing as is Zach de la Rocha's vocal work."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think about the cover?"
"__MUSIC__ The picture of the monk immolating himself, yes it was and still is very controversial. I think it made a powerful statement."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like the way they combined rap and metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's great because they figured out how to pull it off and make it work. Too many imitators have fallen short in trying to replicate the sound."
