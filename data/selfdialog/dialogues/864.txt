"__MUSIC__ Hey, what's your favorite song of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Gosh, what a hard choice!  There are so many good ones."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's hard to pick.  I think mine would be The Righteous Brothers, Unchained Melody."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's a beautiful song!  I love that one too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it almost brings me to tears when I hear it."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't it in that movie Ghost?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it was."
"__MUSIC__ Did they ever have any other famous songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they did but nothing that was as successful as that one."
"__MUSIC__ What was some of their other music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well You've Lost That Loving Feeling would probably be the one you've heard of."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that one is amazing too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  They were a duo, although initially they were in a band called the Paramours."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard of that band."
"__MUSIC__ You might have.  They were from Los Angeles."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure they had a great sound, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  But Hatfield and Medley broke out and formed the Righteous Brothers."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that was a good thing for them!  They sure had success with their singles."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they did.  In 2016, Medley started up another duo and is still recording."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's hard to believe."
