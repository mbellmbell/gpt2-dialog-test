"__MOVIES__ All right another movie discussion lunch.  Today we were going to talk about Redford."
"__MOVIES__ Well, before we get to that I wanted to say something about the new movie theater experience that I forgot to mention in our last discussion."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Surround sound--I hate it.  For years you've adjusted to the sound on screen and now you're suppose to believe that the landslide is coming from the brick wall on your left."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think it's pretty silly too.  But what about Robert Redford--like him as anyone other than the Sundance Kid?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, that was an iconic role, but although I always like him, nothing stands out."
"__MOVIES__ The Electric Horseman, All the Presidents Men?"
"__MOVIES__ He was solid but not iconic, at least not to me."
"__MOVIES__ What about out of Africa?"
"__MOVIES__ You've always liked that movie and it completely bored me."
"__MOVIES__ Meryl Streep."
"__MOVIES__ I know-- she and Redford in a boring movie. She is great, but maybe he's just an average actor with great looks."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe--has he won any acting awards?"
"__MOVIES__ As for as the oscar, I think he was nominated for the Sting--pretty good in that one--I don't know about the other award shows; I watch them but don't remember."
"__MOVIES__ He did win won for directing didn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you did your research before lunch; me too; it was for Ordinary People."
"__MOVIES__ I think that movie was kind of a downer--I don't think I even saw it other than some scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Same for me."
"__MOVIES__ Well he has a new film, and just for you, it's on Netflix.  What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called Discovery, and I think he discovers there's an afterlife.  I'll see if I can tell you more next time."
