"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still the winningest team in superbowl history is the steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And with Big Ben under center, they still have more chances to add to their total."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Big ben was the youngest QB ever to win the superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but he's 35 now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's plenty young enough to at least a couple of more superbowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it would be so awesome to see. if Steelers go to superbowl two more time, they're aty even ten appearances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots need just one more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but Steelers have higher percentage wins. 8 total, and 6 wins out of that 8"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys are at 8 also, but only won 5"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are 3 teams who went to the superbowl 8 times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Broncos being the third one. Only won 3 out of those 8 though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ These percentages are meaningless. Ravens won all their superbowls, but they've only went twice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it's funny how there are still teams that never even went to the superbowl, like ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, yes. Browns, Lions, Teans, and Jaguars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do these team stay in business?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a local loyalties from the fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My teasm, my city type of thing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, of course. So what if they always lose, it's your team nonetheless"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the thing about loyal fans, They never let you down."
