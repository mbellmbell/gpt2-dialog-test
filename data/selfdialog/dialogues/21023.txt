"__THRILLER__ Have you seen any thriller movies about dinosaurs?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I just watched Jurassic Park for like the 500th time."
"__THRILLER__ I love that movie! It's intense."
"__THRILLER__ It definitely is. Do you remember the part where the T-Rex eats the guy who was in the bathroom?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that was awesome. But my favorite part is when the Velociraptors are chasing people around in buildings."
"__THRILLER__ That part was tense. I thought for sure they would kill all those people."
"__THRILLER__ It would be so scary to be in that situation."
"__THRILLER__ I think its pretty odd they didn't have a bunch of guns around."
"__THRILLER__ Me too, considering they were surrounded by dangerous dinosaurs."
"__THRILLER__ I'm gonna have to watch that movie again, I'm excited just thinking about it."
