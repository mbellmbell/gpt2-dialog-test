"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think the best Dumpledore moments were throughout the series?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked when he made that escape during Order of the Phoenix."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was pretty awesome.  How about his grand mater plan in Snape's Memory?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, like when he had Snape begging for mercy?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Don't forget when he fought off all those creatures in the cave with Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ For sure, and when he died.  That made me feel so bad for him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Until later you find out he was already going to die and he master minded it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was amazing.  Dumpledore is always ten steps ahead."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He also seemed to hold his own against Voldemort in the Ministry dual."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, clearly he's the man.  But he couldn't get past those horcuxes."
