"__SUPERHERO__ Who is winning a fight wonder woman or superman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I take gal godot over henry cavil anyday."
"__SUPERHERO__ Really why?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Wonder Woman is essentially a god. Superman has kryptonite as a weakness."
"__SUPERHERO__ I never thought of it like that."
"__SUPERHERO__ It is also refreshing to see a female in the power for a change."
"__SUPERHERO__ I do agree it is nice to have a powerful female superhero."
"__SUPERHERO__ Henry cavil and christopher reeves back in the day as superman were both great."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes no doubts there, but nice to change things up and see a woman of power not just as the love interest."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I enjoy that too. Hope more movies follow suit."
