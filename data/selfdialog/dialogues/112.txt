"__MUSIC__ I need to create a playlist of women singers. Can you help me?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Any particular genre?"
"__MUSIC__ No. Open to all suggestions."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. I definitely recommend some Joni Mitchell. She is a folk singer with a beautiful voice.  Big Yellow Taxi is a song you may have heard."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. I know that song."
"__MUSIC__ PJ Harvey is great. I would play Man-Size off her album Rid of Me."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music does she play?"
"__MUSIC__ She's a rock musician. Very good. You'll like it, I think. Speaking of female rock musicians, you should definitely add Patti Smith."
"__MUSIC__ Any particular track you like for her?"
"__MUSIC__ Horses is one of my favorite songs of all time. It's a long one, though. It's almost 10 minutes long. I don't know if that matters."
"__MUSIC__ It shouldn't be a problem."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Have you heard of Florence and the Machine?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them. I am not really that familiar."
"__MUSIC__ Florence Welch is the lead singer. There's a song on the debut album Lungs called Dog Days are Over. It's a great addition to your playlist. It's a very catchy, high-energy track with beautiful vocals."
"__MUSIC__ How about Amy Winehouse?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. Put some Amy on there. Anything off the Back to Black album. I wouldn't play Rehab, though. I would pick a different track."
"__MUSIC__ How about Tears Dry on Their Own?"
"__MUSIC__ Good choice. That's one of my favorites. It has a great retro sound. Speaking of retro, how about some older stuff like The Supremes and The Ronnettes?"
"__MUSIC__ Good idea. What songs?"
"__MUSIC__ For The Supremes, I would play When the Love Light Starts Shining. Oooh. Play some Tina Turner, too! River-Deep Mountain-High!"
