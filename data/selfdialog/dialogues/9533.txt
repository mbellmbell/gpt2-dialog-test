"__BASEBALL__ Did you ever play little league baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Indeed, I did. I played until I was 15 or so."
"__BASEBALL__ Why did you stop? Were you awful?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I was a great hitter. I stopped because I'd have had to be on the high school team and I hated every one of those jerk jocks."
"__BASEBALL__ What's your favorite memory of little league?"
"__BASEBALL__ That's a tie of two things. First, I hit a grand slam in a field with no fences!"
"__BASEBALL__ Why does that matter, the fences part?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, they can play me as deep as they want. That's one thing I hated about little league - I had dozens of homers over the years robbed because there were no fences."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe if you lost weight you could have ran out the homeruns easier."
"__BASEBALL__ That wasn't nice...but it's true. Where was I?"
"__BASEBALL__ The second best memory of little league?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, now I don't want to tell you because you'll make another fat joke."
"__BASEBALL__ I won't."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I played first base and was always the big kid. Once I had my foot on the bag but this kid ran through even though he was very out, and he hit my hip."
"__BASEBALL__ What happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, his gut hit me in the hip, and that knocked the air out of him and he was on the ground for a few minutes."
"__BASEBALL__ Seriously?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I didn't even budge."
"__BASEBALL__ Is it because you're f.."
"__BASEBALL__ fat? Yes. But it's funny either way."
