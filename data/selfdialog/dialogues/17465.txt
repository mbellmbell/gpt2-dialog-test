"__MOVIES__ Of all the movies you've seen which one impacted you the most?"
"__MOVIES__ Hands down it was The Village by  M. Night Shyamalan. The story line was incredible and the reveal at the ending was mind-blowing!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree. I've watched it at least five times and I still love it!"
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how he came up with the idea for that movie. There were so many interesting things going on with that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Like how the core group of adults were all abused in some way by modern (there's a huge twist) society so they created a village to live in the rest of their lives that is like from the 19th century."
"__MOVIES__ Remember towards end when Ivy Walker gets over the wall and a park range drives up to her in a car, you're like, what??"
"__MOVIES__ Mind-blowing for sure! What about the creatures they invented to keep the kids from going past the village boundary?"
"__MOVIES__ Since you think they're real throughout the whole movie the fear factor alone is about a 10!"
"__MOVIES__ Even though it was super scary I loved the way the romantic relationship was developing between Ivy and Lucius. Joaquin Phoenix is so sexy!"
"__MOVIES__ For being blind she was one heck of a courageous girl! To go through the woods by herself was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I know but by then her dad told her the truth that the creatures aren't real."
"__MOVIES__ I know but she had had however many years of growing up thinking they were real to develop a deep fear of those creatures. It's not going to go away in a day!"
"__MOVIES__ Bryce Dallas Howard did such a good job with her character. She was nominated for Best Breakthrough Female Performance at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards."
"__MOVIES__ She made you feel so scared for her when she was waiting for Lucius by the door and a creature was near her!!"
"__MOVIES__ So what about the character that Adrien Brody played? Noah Percy. He did a good job too."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, now that I think about it I forgot that was him! The Village was filmed almost 14 years ago and I've seen him in several movies since then."
"__MOVIES__ He played a person with developmental disabilities so convincingly. I was on a roller coaster ride with my emotions for his character."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Me too. I felt sorry for him most of the time but then I was mad at him when he stabbed Lucius."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding! But then I felt so bad when he fell in the hole and died when Ivy was going through the forest. She didn't know it was him."
"__MOVIES__ Whew! That was the best movie ever! Let's watch it again!"
