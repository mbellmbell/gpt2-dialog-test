"__STAR_WARS__ Want to watch the next Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What's it called?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars: The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow that sounds so hype. I want to watch it now!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it actually comes out this year. They're really hauling it in the production studios."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or greedy for money. I hope they don't ruin it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well the first two were pretty solid, and set up the third one pretty well."
"__STAR_WARS__ See that's the thing. There's so much setup they could ruin it."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. But I'm still going."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah same. Let's go together."
