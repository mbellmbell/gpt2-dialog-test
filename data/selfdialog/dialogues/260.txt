"__MUSIC__ Do you like The Red Hot Chili Peppers?"
"__MUSIC__ I loved them when I was in high school. Now I kind of wonder why."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Their music hasn't really held up over time."
"__MUSIC__ I think it still sounds pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Can you compare Anthony Kiedis' vocals to someone else from that era like Chris Cornell or Eddie Vedder?"
"__MUSIC__ No definitely not, I don't think Kiedis ever had a singing lesson in his life. Cornell and Vedder had far superior vocals."
"__MUSIC__ Listening to the Chili Peppers now, the majority of their songs are unbearable."
"__MUSIC__ I still love old songs like Under the Bridge, Breaking the Girl, Give It Away."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was their one album that had many good songs. But everything after that?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right. Although Mother's Milk had some good songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, their earlier stuff wasn't too bad. Not great, but not bad. Mainly it's everything after Blood Sugar Sex Magic I'm referring too."
"__MUSIC__ For example?"
"__MUSIC__ Californication? That album is just intolerable."
"__MUSIC__ That's hilarious. Well, since you mentioned Chris Cornell just now, isn't it sad that he passed away?"
"__MUSIC__ It really is. Such a talented and beautiful person, gone way too soon."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder why he committed suicide."
"__MUSIC__ There are probably so many reasons, who can say?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame he felt there was no way out."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, truly a great loss for the music world."
