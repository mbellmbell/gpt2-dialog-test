"__MOVIES__ What's your least favorite genre of movies? I know you love them, but you have to hate some, too."
"__MOVIES__ I hate more than I like, you know that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're a glass-half-empty kind of guy."
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm a 'drink what's in the glass and say 'that was stupid'' kind of guy."
"__MOVIES__ So, your least favorite, or least favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't stand biopics."
"__MOVIES__ Why? I like some. The Aviator with Leonardo DiCaprio was great."
"__MOVIES__ Because to be a biopic, it has to be based on a person."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Based on' means they can change pretty much whatever they want. There's not a single biopic where the living person who it's about said 'Yeah, that's right.'"
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think they change it so much?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they pay the family for the rights. Then, because all human stories are boring, they make stuff up to make it more entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Aren't there any you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Catch Me If You Can was pretty entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Tom and Leo have great chemistry together."
"__MOVIES__ Yours?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is Gandhi."
"__MOVIES__ No, least favorite genre."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, oops. Umm, probably Christian-based."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. There's never any substance."
