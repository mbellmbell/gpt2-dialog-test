"__HARRY_POTTER__ What house would you be?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Gryffindor for sure."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't think you're couragoues enough for them.  You seem more Hufflepuff to me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Whatever, dude.  Hufflepuff is weak."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They're not all wussies.  That guy that died getting the goblet was amazing."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He's the rare exception.  Most Hufflepuff are wussies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, in that case, most Gryffindor are untrusting."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Now you're just making things up."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe you should have been Slytherin."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The sorting hat never lies!"
