"__MOVIES__ Have you seen all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're great, I just saw Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know Vin Diesel is still providing the voice of Groot?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the must have altered his voice because it's clearly not deep like it was in the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm curious to see how they're going to fit everything into the next Avengers movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, in the upcoming Thor movie, it takes place in outer space and has the Hulk in it, so they're setting something big."
"__MOVIES__ I heard the Avengers will be fighting the Infinity War, which will make this an epic battle!"
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if they're going to add Spider-Man again, since his movie is coming out later next month!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, since that franchise is on loan from Sony Pictures... they own the rights to the character's cinematic use."
"__MOVIES__ They must have made some kind of deal, since the last Spider-Man and Fantastic Four movies tanked so badly."
"__MOVIES__ Those were horrible! Don't they know how to make a good movie anymore?"
"__MOVIES__ They're trying to reinvent the wheel, and it's not necessary! The content has been there for years... there's no need to give it a makeover."
"__MOVIES__ All of these reboots leave a bad taste in my mouth. Just make a franchise right and stick with it!"
"__MOVIES__ James Bond went on for a long time without a reboot, and now those movies are hardly recognizable."
"__MOVIES__ Changing actors is one thing, but changing the theme and tone is just inexcusable... they may as well not call him James Bond anymore!"
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it! But at least the Marvel Movies are holding true to what they've already one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it has to end sometime... those actors are getting older and it's not easy to stay in shape."
"__MOVIES__ Right, just like Hugh Jackman no longer playing Wolverine because he's getting too old."
"__MOVIES__ Well, he had quite a run as the character, and I'm sure he'll find more work beyond the superhero genre."
"__MOVIES__ He was fabulous in Les Miserables, and the guy can sing as well as act!"
