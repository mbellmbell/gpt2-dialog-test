"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, who do think has one the most championship titles in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's easy. The Green Bay Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, the Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they have 13 championships. They are the winningest team in all the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, 13? That's a lot but I thought San Francisco had more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No that is a common mistake that everyone makes, but they are not even in the top 5!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? How many championships have they won?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only 5. They won all their in the early 80's and 90's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was that when they had Joe Montana and Steve Young?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and don't forget Jerry Rice. He's the greatest receiver of all time!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was an awesome player. With those 2 quarterbacks, he was unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of people think the New England Patriots are up there too, but they're not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm one of them. I thought that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've only got 5 titles since last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who has more titles than 5?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Believe it or not, the Cleveland Browns have 8 and so do the New York Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, what about the Chicago Bears for the 80's?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are the second winningest team with 9 championships."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, and Green Bay has 13? They are the best team."
