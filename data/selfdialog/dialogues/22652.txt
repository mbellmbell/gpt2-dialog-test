"__DISNEY__ Do you know what the first Disney movie was?"
"__DISNEY__ Nope, sorry. Disney's been around for a long time, it could be any of a handful of the old ones."
"__DISNEY__ Like which ones?"
"__DISNEY__ Well it'd have to be one of the movies that they made by drawing everything out."
"__DISNEY__ So something like Cinderella then maybe?"
"__DISNEY__ Yea that's a good guess. I don't think that was the very first one though."
"__DISNEY__ Which ones were you thinking of?"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe Dumbo, or Bambi. Those seemed to have the old school color look, where the colors aren't as vibrant."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yea those are good choices. What year do you think those came out?"
"__DISNEY__ A long time ago, but not too long back that color didn't exist, so maybe the early 50's."
