"__SUPERHERO__ Do you like the newer Superman movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ They are okay but I think they lost something in the translation."
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean by that?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, it seems like they are trying to be 'modern' instead of sticking to the script.  For example making Louis a single mom."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, that's ridiculous and not necessary for the story."
"__SUPERHERO__ This is supposed to be fantasy no need to make things more 'realistic' to modern life."
"__SUPERHERO__ I liked the script of the Superman movies Christopher Reeve played in."
"__SUPERHERO__ Which is your favorite?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I liked Superman III which had Richard Pryor in it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I liked the scenes where he stole all the fractional cents with the computer."
