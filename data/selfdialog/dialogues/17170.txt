"__MOVIES__ Who is the better actor, Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say Tom Hanks solely because he has made more great movies recently."
"__MOVIES__ What about the recent Jack Reacher franchise?"
"__MOVIES__ Those movies were good, but they do not match the same level of quality as Bridge of Spies or Captain Phillips."
"__MOVIES__ True, but I think that Tom Cruise's performances in Born on the Fourth of July and Magnolia were superior to Tom Hank's Oscar-winning performances in Forest Gump and Philadelphia."
"__MOVIES__ I would agree that Forrest Gump was not as strong, but Philadelphia was an amazing film."
"__MOVIES__ It was a great movie, but I thought that Denzel Washington had the better performance."
"__MOVIES__ I'd say the two were equal. I love Denzel Washington though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really enjoyed his performance in Malcolm X."
"__MOVIES__ That was good, but I really like his newer stuff more."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I found Fences sort of overrated."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought that not only did he give a good acting performance, but his direction was very good."
"__MOVIES__ Agree to disagree. However, his best performance is without a doubt Training Day."
"__MOVIES__ I can definitely agree with that. Speaking of Training Day, what ever happened to Ethan Hawke?"
"__MOVIES__ He's done some great films since, such as the Purge and Boyhood."
"__MOVIES__ I totally forgot about Boyhood. What a fascinating concept for a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, to film a movie over an 11 year timespan was ambitious to say the least."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, between Boyhood and School of Rock, Richard Linklater has directed some of my favorite movies over the past 15 years."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget Dazed and Confused. He directed that too."
"__MOVIES__ Also a quality movie. I really enjoyed Matthew McConaughey's performance as David Wooderson in the film."
