"__MUSIC__ Black Sabbath played their final show in Febuary, and they are having a special one night movie screening of it."
"__MUSIC__ When's the movie screening?"
"__MUSIC__ September 28th for one night only, in over 1500 movie theatres across the country."
"__MUSIC__ Where was their last concert at?"
"__MUSIC__ Birmingham, at a 16,000 seat concert venue.."
"__MUSIC__ Was it sold out?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. The band considers Birmingham their home."
"__MUSIC__ Is the movie just a recording of the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No. It also has behind the scenes stories and conversations, as well as live performance, and versions done in studio that were not done on tour."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, so it's going to be a pretty special movie for the fans."
"__MUSIC__ And only for one night at the theatre. Ozzy said this was definitely the end, they won't be getting back together later."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they have to be getting really old."
"__MUSIC__ The band released a statement saying they never dreamed when they started that they would be playing a final show in their home town 49 years later."
"__MUSIC__ Were all the original members at the last show?"
"__MUSIC__ No, their drummer Bill Ward has been estranged from the band for quite awhile."
"__MUSIC__ He couldn't even come back for the last show?"
"__MUSIC__ He claimed he reached out to the management about it, and they said they were not interested."
"__MUSIC__ Ouch."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to mark it on my calendar, and see about going to the movie. I imagine there will be a lot of sold out theatres."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe they will do pre-sales, and you could find out how soon those would be available."
