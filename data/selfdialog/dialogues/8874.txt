"__BEATLES__ You know a lot about The Beatles, right?"
"__BEATLES__ I know a bit. I'm no expert."
"__BEATLES__ What's their longest album?"
"__BEATLES__ The White Album for sure. It's a double album."
"__BEATLES__ What do you make of it?"
"__BEATLES__ It has some of my favorite Beatles songs of all time, like Revolution, Glass Onion, Happiness is a Warm Gun, and more!"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, I recognize Revolution! That's a really good one."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, one of my favorites for sure. The White Album does have a lot of great songs, but also a bit of filler."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah, like what?"
"__BEATLES__ There is a song called Revolution Number 9 which is super avant garde and long."
