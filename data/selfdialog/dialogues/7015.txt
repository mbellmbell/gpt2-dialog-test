"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you watch the Minnesota Wild yesterday?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I did, had some beer while I was watching. Did you?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes! I'm so glad they won. It's been a long time."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It has. They seem to be coming back strong this season."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are you going to watch them next week?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Definitely. Maybe I'll go to your house and drink your beer, haha."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Very funny. Last time you drank all of it. Who's your favorite on the Wild, currently?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Brodin. You?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's hard to say. I really like Brodin, I really like Eriksson Ek, too."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too. I don't really watch any other sports, honestly."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Neither do I. I'll even watch college ice hockey."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Same here."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you ever cheer for any other teams?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I still watch the Vancouver Canucks sometimes; I used to watch them when I lived in Washington."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How are they doing this season? I still watch the Boston Bruins sometimes; my son does, too."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Canucks have kind of lost their touch, I'm afraid. The Wild's more fun to watch anymore."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's too bad. At least we've both got the Wild, right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Definitely. Are you coming over later to watch the next game?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am. Here's to the Wild winning."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Cheers."
