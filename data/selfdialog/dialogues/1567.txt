"__MUSIC__ You remember that band Clutch?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they were super heavy and loud."
"__MUSIC__ They used to be almost exclusively loud, but they found a nice balance on the last few albums."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool, so they've evolved."
"__MUSIC__ Listen to an album called Blast Tyrant, they have a lot of variety now."
"__MUSIC__ Anything I've heard from that album?"
"__MUSIC__ 'The Regulator' was used in a scene in Sons of Anarchy."
"__MUSIC__ Oh you pointed that out to me when we were watching it, that's an awesome song."
"__MUSIC__ It's probably their most popular, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ I'm 100% buying the album just for that song."
"__MUSIC__ Worth every penny, and the rest of the album is just as good."
"__MUSIC__ Any recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ La Curandera is a good representation of the direction of the band these days."
"__MUSIC__ Okay that one is on my list."
"__MUSIC__ But their album Pure Rock Fury holds up well."
"__MUSIC__ I still listen to that album as well."
"__MUSIC__ That energy helps me get stuff done, it's perfect for the gym."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I get such an adrenaline rush listening to them."
"__MUSIC__ Their singer's voice is out of this world."
"__MUSIC__ It really is like another instrument!"
