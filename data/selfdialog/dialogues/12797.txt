"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how do you think the Dolphins will do next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're not ready to overtake the Pats yet, but are getting closer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they seem to be stuck in that middle gear."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What they need is a better quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tannerhill is good.  But he's just not an elite guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, ever since Dan left they haven't been lucky at that position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough, because he is too good to let go, and not good enough to keep."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the worst kind of QB if you ask me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, makes it hard.  You can't do anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe he'll turn it around next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, they did make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they have been in and out over recent years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too bad they still have to get throttled by the Pats every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes it hard when you have to go through legends non-stop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that's how Miami had if forever when Marino was up there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for the longest time the Pats were a joke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, people forget that.  They were in a division with Marino and Jim Kelley."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must have been hard.   Getting pounded by hall of famers 4 times a year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, now they do the pounding."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree.  They rule the AFC."
