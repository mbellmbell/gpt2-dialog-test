"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite female character out of all of the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I kind of have a soft spot for Leia, she is just a classic."
"__STAR_WARS__ She does have all of the iconic costumes and her tough girl attitude."
"__STAR_WARS__ She has so many good one liners too during the movie.  Carrie Fisher was great in the role."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do love the original cast, but I also love Gin Erso.  Plus her romance story was great."
"__STAR_WARS__ The ending of Rogue One was so sad though, but I kind of loved how it led into the beginning of a New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, I do love that they made a movie that wasn't about the Skywalker family and was about what was happening other places in the galaxy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved all of the movies, but Rogue One was definitely something different."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. Plus Diego Luna was pretty good looking too. I loved his character."
