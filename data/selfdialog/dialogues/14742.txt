"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So, I found this new genre of music.."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ New genre? what do you mean?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's called vaporwave, It's like an internet subculture."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Internet subculture?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, like a trend that started on the internet."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So what kind of music is this?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's kind of like oversampled 80's music, slowed down, with lots of sound effects and samples from movies and TV shows, but there's lots of subgenres that pull from many sources."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It sounds kind of interesting, but also weird."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ it is weird, but it grew on me quickly, plus a lot of the samples are already catchy or popular songs from 20-40 years ago."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I guess I should check it out, sounds like it could be nostalgic in a weird way."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You definitely should, and nostalgia is one of the underlying themes of the music. Aesthetic memes and culture is all a visual element as well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So it's like a musical meme?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Kind of, its such a multifaceted thing that it's not contained within a box."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Can you recommend some aesthetics or vaporwaves?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The first go to for everyone is the multiple performing names of this one girl. Blank banshee, macintosh plus, and vektroid."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Is there anything closer to mainstream?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I would suggest Pepsi Saint or Skylar Spence who are the same person."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Are there any free ways or easy ways to hear this?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I strongly suggest youtube over a music subscription as a lot of content contains copyrighted material and has not been signed or professionally produced."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ well, thanks a lot for the impromptu music suggestions, shoot me a text later bro!"
