"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is Drew Brees finally going to have a bad year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I don't think that he will ever have a bad statistical season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Saints aren't that good of a team anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well no, but Brees still puts up gaudy numbers from the quarterback position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that he will ever reach the Super Bowl again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not with this team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you see him going to another franchise for the last couple years of his career?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but he's already late-thirties in age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Sean Payton and his prospects for another Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He'll probably get back there again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Coach Payton is a genius when it comes to offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he was really effective when his offense was fresh and new."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think defenses have caught onto his offensive scheme?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I won't rule him out if he adapts his playbook a little bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess Payton still has a long time to go in his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the great thing about being a coach, because you can continue into your seventies if you want."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, as a player you only have about fifteen playing years to accomplish everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that Brees will go into coaching when his playing days are over?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could, because he seems to get the cerebral part of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, quarterbacks usually make the best coaches because of their understanding of playbooks."
