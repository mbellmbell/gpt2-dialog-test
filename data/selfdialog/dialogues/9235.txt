"__BASEBALL__ Did you hear about what Cincinnati's Joey Votto said to that kid?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, why, what happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ Cincinnati was playing in San Francisco, and this kid asked Votto if he could have his batting gloves."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok, that sounds like the type of thing players get asked a lot."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, But Votto's answer wasn't what a lot of players would have said!"
"__BASEBALL__ Why, what did he say?"
"__BASEBALL__ He told the kid that he was sitting in the front row and that he was 'elite'."
"__BASEBALL__ You mean like he's saying this kid isn't worthy of his gloves?"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly! He said the kid was privileged and not some 'Make A Wish: kid."
"__BASEBALL__ Ouch! That seems awfully harsh for a baseball star!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know, you'd think he could've handled it better."
"__BASEBALL__ There are nicer ways of saying no than calling a kid 'elite' and 'privileged'!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I thought it made Votto look pretty classless."
"__BASEBALL__ It makes him sound like he's not it in for the fans, just for being praised when he helps out needy kids."
"__BASEBALL__ I sure bet that one kid didn't have any praise for him."
"__BASEBALL__ I bet he had a new favorite team immediately after that."
"__BASEBALL__ You almost couldn't blame the kid if he was rude back."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. That's what you teach kids when you're rude to them!"
"__BASEBALL__ It's not like the kid did anything terrible."
"__BASEBALL__ No he didn't. You'd think players would want to encourage all young fans, even if h didn't give his gloves to him."
