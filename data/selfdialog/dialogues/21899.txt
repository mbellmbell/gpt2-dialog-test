"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast film yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't seen it yet. Have you?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I saw it in theaters a few weeks after it first came out."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was pretty good. Emma Watson was a good casting choice."
"__DISNEY__ I always loved the original cartoon movie. Which did you think was better?"
"__DISNEY__ I think the cartoon was still better, but the new one is worth seeing."
"__DISNEY__ I guess most remakes are never really as good as the original."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, but it's still fun to see classic stories brought to life in new ways."
"__DISNEY__ Good point. I think I'll rent the new Beauty and the Beast this weekend."
