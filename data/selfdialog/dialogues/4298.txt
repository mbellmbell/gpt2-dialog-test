"__MUSIC__ What do you consider the top live albums of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's see.  I would say REO Speedwagon 's You Get What You Play For.  Bob Seger Live Bullet.  Cheap Trick's Live at the Budokan."
"__MUSIC__ Very Nice.  Have you ever seen any of those artists live?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw Bob Seger on his Against the Wind Tour. I saw REO twice."
"__MUSIC__ Seger has been around so long."
"__MUSIC__ I enjoy his music from the Smokin OP's right up through Makin' Thunderbirds and Like a Rock."
"__MUSIC__ You seem to be a 70's and 80's person."
"__MUSIC__ There was some really good music back then."
"__MUSIC__ Did you see a lot of live shows?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  They had shows at the Mississippi River Festival that brought in a lot of groups."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like fun."
"__MUSIC__ The groups liked it because the stage was air conditioned.  It was outside.  We liked it because it was general admission seats."
"__MUSIC__ REO Speedwagon changed during that time."
"__MUSIC__ It broke my heart.  They went from hard rock to pop.  It was sad."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever catch Lynryd Skynyrd?"
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately no.  I wanted to see them and the Eagles.  Saw neither."
"__MUSIC__ The Eagles have reunited several times."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I still haven't caught one of their shows."
"__MUSIC__ Would they be the show you want to see most?"
"__MUSIC__ You better believe it."
