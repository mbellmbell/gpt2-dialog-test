"__ROCK__ What do you think was the best era for rock music?"
"__ROCK__ Probably the 90's. There were so many good rock bands and songs that came about during that time."
"__ROCK__ I agree. I remember that's when I first was really exposed to rock and I loved it."
"__ROCK__ Yea, like we grew up with that music. Bands like Weezer, Nirvana, Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Oasis were so good."
"__ROCK__ I miss that era of rock. I don't even know what is considered rock music these days."
"__ROCK__ A lot of modern rock is like more indie sounding or has a lot of additional electronic effects."
"__ROCK__ I feel like recently there hasn't been like a really good new rock band to come out of the past few years."
"__ROCK__ Yea, I mean there's been some new artists that are pretty good, but nothing compares to 90's rock."
"__ROCK__ I guess though that strictly 'rock' music isn't as popular as it was during the 90's and early 2000's."
"__ROCK__ Yea it's like more electronica and pop type of stuff these days."
