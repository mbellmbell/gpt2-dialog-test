"__MUSIC__ Who are your top five favorite rappers of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Nas, Jay Electronica, Phonte, Max B, and MF Doom."
"__MUSIC__ That's a really interesting list."
"__MUSIC__ Who are your top five?"
"__MUSIC__ Biggie, Nas, Big Pun, Del, and Kendrick."
"__MUSIC__ You're saying Kendrick is an all-timer already?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he's actually been around longer now than Biggie was."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a good point. Biggie died very young."
"__MUSIC__ I think Kendrick has given us three classic albums already."
"__MUSIC__ It's hard enough to put out one."
"__MUSIC__ Jay Electronica hasn't put out any."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but the few songs we've heard from him are on another level."
"__MUSIC__ It's odd that he's had such a small amount of output."
"__MUSIC__ I used to be really frustrated by it, but I've gotten over it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there's nothing we can do about it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think he'll ever put out an album?"
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea."
"__MUSIC__ Del was another interesting choice on your list."
"__MUSIC__ I like him because he's so unique. Nobody else sounds anything like him."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's very true. He's instantly recognizable, and he has bars."
