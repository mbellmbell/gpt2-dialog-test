"__MOVIES__ I just saw the scariest movie I've ever seen!"
"__MOVIES__ What movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The Ring. It was so terrifying."
"__MOVIES__ I'd heard of that movie, but never watched it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure if I should recommend it or not. It was really good, but I'm still freaked out."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ So, the idea is that there's this videotape. And anyone who watches it dies in 7 days."
"__MOVIES__ They die in 7 days? How?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to ruin the movie, in case you see it."
"__MOVIES__ Give me at least a little bit of an idea."
"__MOVIES__ Well, OK - What happens is that after they watch the movie, they get a phone call. And a little girl's voice says 'Seven days' and hangs up."
"__MOVIES__ And....?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to spoil it any further!"
"__MOVIES__ I will say, evil children is one of the creepiest things in horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, and this is a particularly good use of that concept."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any famous actors in it, or is a bunch of no-names?"
"__MOVIES__ Naomi Watts plays the lead. I didn't recognize anyone else."
"__MOVIES__ I might watch it sometime, but only with friends, in broad daylight."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I could barely sleep last night after having watched it. I was so frightened."
"__MOVIES__ Horror movies are weird. It's like, you barely enjoy them at all, in a certain sense."
