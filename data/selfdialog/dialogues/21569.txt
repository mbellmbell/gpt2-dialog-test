"__DISNEY__ I saw an older Disney movie the other day that I hadn't seen in a long time."
"__DISNEY__ What movie was that?"
"__DISNEY__ It was Oliver and Company. I forgot how good that movie was."
"__DISNEY__ I remember watching that when I was kid."
"__DISNEY__ It was a classic when we were younger."
"__DISNEY__ I liked that Billy Joel did some music for it and Bette Midler too."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know Joey Lawrence did Oliver's voice?"
"__DISNEY__ Really? I didn't know that. He was really young then."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. Hard to believe that movie came out so long ago."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they will ever do a sequel to that one."
