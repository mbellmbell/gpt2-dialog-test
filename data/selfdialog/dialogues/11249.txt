"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So football season starts in just a couple more months."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! Time flies. I'm excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how the Patriots will do this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they've got new players. They signed Conor McDermott and nearly 20 rookie free agents."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm psyched about McDermott. Also Derek Rivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope Jimmy Garoppolo stays healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is he replacing Tom Brady as quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not replacing, but I get the sense that they'll be playing him more often."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are they playing in their first regular season game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Kansas City Chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I think that'll be an easy win for the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe. Especially since it's a home game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chiefs used to be the worst team in the NFL. Hands down the worst."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but that was a few years ago. They've had at least two decent seasons since then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they lost the division title two years in a row."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have they ever won a Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They won one, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Back in the 1960s?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 1970. They beat the Vikings, who have never won a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. I wish I'd been around to see that matchup."
