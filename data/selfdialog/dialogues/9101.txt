"__BASEBALL__ Do you know how the Dodgers are doing this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ They got off to a slow start, but they're slowly gaining momentum in the NL West."
"__BASEBALL__ They had the Rookie of the Year last year, didn't they?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, Corey Seager. And they have another bright prospect making news this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Is he any good or just a flash in the pan?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he's tearing up the place... there's no way they're going to send him back to the minors now."
"__BASEBALL__ What's this rookie's name?"
"__BASEBALL__ Cody Bellinger, and he's in line to replace Adrian Gonzalez at first base."
"__BASEBALL__ The kid must be really good to replace Gonzalez... what's he been doing lately?"
"__BASEBALL__ He has five home runs in those 11 games, and just hit a grand slam against the Padres."
"__BASEBALL__ That's incredible! Do you think he's a Rookie of the Year candidate?"
"__BASEBALL__ Most definitely. The Dodgers have a history of cranking out Rookies of the Year."
"__BASEBALL__ I remember in the 1990s they had five in a row."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, one of them was Mike Piazza, who just got elected to the Hall of Fame last year."
"__BASEBALL__ This could be the start of another streak for the Dodgers rookies."
"__BASEBALL__ No doubt... people criticize the team for buying high priced talent, but they've got quite a few farm players in their line up."
"__BASEBALL__ Anyone I've heard of?"
"__BASEBALL__ Joc Pedersen, Yasiel Puig, and Corey Seager are all everyday players, not to mention Clayton Kershaw."
"__BASEBALL__ Kershaw is a pitching machine, isn't he?"
"__BASEBALL__ No doubt... he'll lead the Dodgers to the World Series within the next three years."
