"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just rewatched the Chamber of Secrets, and I have some issues with it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I bet I already know what they are, but shoot."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How in the world did no one know a CHAMBER was sitting inside the school the whole time?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Haha, let it out. It bothers me too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I guess they kind of knew, because it had been opened before. But then why didn't Dumbledore destroy it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That bothers me so much. Let's just keep this really odd killing chamber in the school and hope for the best."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly, with the top minds in the Magical kingdom thinking it's okay, I mean come on."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah anyone could see that's a terrible idea."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And, who the heck would EVER hire Lockhart? That whole book/movie was just a set of contradictions."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well no one wanted the job, so let me pick the absolute worst candidate in history, because why not? Haha"
