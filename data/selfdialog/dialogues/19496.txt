"__MOVIES__ I took the kids to see Cars 3 the other day?"
"__MOVIES__ How was it? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I really did like it. It was closer to the first one in terms of plot."
"__MOVIES__ The second one with the spying was really bad."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was so I think they realized that and let the franchise get back to it's roots."
"__MOVIES__ They probably didn't want the franchise to end with a lousy movie."
"__MOVIES__ Most likely the reason. The animation was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Spoiler alert. Here goes."
"__MOVIES__ No problem. I probably won't see it anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Well Lightening McQueen is getting older as her his other racing friends."
"__MOVIES__ Well sure because it has been like over a decade since the last one came out."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and cars don't last forever. Ha ha!"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, go one."
"__MOVIES__ Well all of a sudden some new cars are brought out. They look different than the other races, more like Formula 1 type cars."
"__MOVIES__ So these cars overtake the older ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, now they begin to win races and McQueen starts to lose confidence because he cannot be fast enough."
"__MOVIES__ So speed he is not. Ha ha!"
"__MOVIES__ Right, so anyway he tries not to give up and goes into the next race and really tries to win but..."
"__MOVIES__ doesn't? Is that where in the trailer it shows he crashes?"
