"__STAR_WARS__ Which is why I keep saying, they need to remake the originals."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, God, I'm going to kill you, then I'm going unfriend you on facebook, stop following you on twitter."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're just upset, because you know I'm right."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not upset because you're right. I'm upset at the thought of redoing a part of Americana. The original trilogy is a part of the American heritage. They're not just movies. Can you remake 'It's a wonderful Life?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't see why not."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, I'm going to unfriend right now. You're not my friend any more. You are an enemy of the American people"
"__STAR_WARS__ Upset. I'm right. Rinse and repeat."
"__STAR_WARS__ No!. You're NOT right!. You're wrong! The original trilogy is fine as they are!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Fine except for all the incongruities. That means being out of place, by the way."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know what incongruity means! And no, these are NOT examples of incongruity."
