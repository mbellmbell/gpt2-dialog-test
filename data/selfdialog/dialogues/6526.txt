"__STAR_WARS__ So, Star Wars is pretty awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know right! what's your favorite one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like Episode one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Why episode one of all things?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar was so cool!"
"__STAR_WARS__ HAHAHA! You had me going for a second. For real though. What's your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm serious dude. Jar jar should have been Killed so many times, he was so annoying, but he lived through all that stuff"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I guess I see your point kind of."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about you dude? What's your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The original. Yoda in the swamp can't go wrong."
