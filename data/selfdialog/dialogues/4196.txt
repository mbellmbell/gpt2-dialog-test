"__MUSIC__ Do you know who Avenged Sevenfold are?"
"__MUSIC__ I do. They're actually my favorite band ever."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Which album of theirs is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ You might be surprised by what I say."
"__MUSIC__ What is it? Sounding the Seventh Trumpet?"
"__MUSIC__ No. It's The Stage!"
"__MUSIC__ The new one? That really isn't a bad choice."
"__MUSIC__ I love the direction they took with the album, making it a concept album and all."
"__MUSIC__ They also really went full on progressive metal with it. I thought that was great."
"__MUSIC__ That's the other thing that made me like it so much. After Hail to the King, I was worried they would start to sound stale."
"__MUSIC__ Thankfully that's not the case, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. They haven't written an album that good in years if you ask me."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song off the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Exist, without question. That son's a masterpiece."
"__MUSIC__ That one was a bit tough for me to get through because of how long it was."
"__MUSIC__ That's unfortunate, because it really is a good song."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked Creating God, myself."
"__MUSIC__ That one's my second favorite. It's arguably the most accessible song on the album."
"__MUSIC__ Accessible in that it's more likely to appeal to a wider audience?"
"__MUSIC__ That's right."
