"__HORROR__ Are you a fan of zombie movies?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, I absolutely love them."
"__HORROR__ Me too!  I even like the really cheesy ones."
"__HORROR__ Yes, they have a pack of movies at Walmart for like $5 and it has a few bad zombie movies on it."
"__HORROR__ I hope The Walking Dead has a movie at some point."
"__HORROR__ I think that seems like a logical way to go."
"__HORROR__ Maybe have the series end and then have a movie afterwards."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I don't really like prequels but I feel like The Walking Dead needs one."
"__HORROR__ It's hard to keep up with indeed."
"__HORROR__ Still, nothing beats Night of the Living Dead."
