"__ROCK__ Do you feel rock music nowadays compares to the old stuff?"
"__ROCK__ Absolutely not, the classics are always better."
"__ROCK__ I would tend to agree, there's exceptions, but they just don't make them like they used to."
"__ROCK__ Yeah give me Bad Company, Reo Speedwagon and Kansas over modern stuff anyday."
"__ROCK__ Speaking of Kansas did you know Anthrax covered Carry On my Wayward son?"
"__ROCK__ Really interesting how was it?"
"__ROCK__ Really good actually, almost sounds like it's Kansas."
"__ROCK__ Will have to check it out, I've heard Gwar's rather original version of the song."
"__ROCK__ Now that's a unique twist in it."
"__ROCK__ You're not kidding, it sure was."
