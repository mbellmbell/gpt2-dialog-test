"__MUSIC__ Are you going to the U2 concert in June?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  Are you going?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep.  It is the 30th Anniversary of the Joshua Tree album."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe it's been that long."
"__MUSIC__ U2 has been around for a while.  They are still producing good music."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I think there last few albums were not enjoyable for me.."
"__MUSIC__ I can find something to enjoy on just about every U2 album released."
"__MUSIC__ The albums that they have released since the year 2000 have been lackluster."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't like the album 'All that you can't leave behind'?  That was a return to their roots."
"__MUSIC__ I will admit.  I think that is a fairly decent album."
"__MUSIC__ 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' had some great songs.  City of Blinding Lights is one of my favorite U2 songs now."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't like that album.  It felt too commercial and polished for me."
"__MUSIC__ What would be your favorite U2 album?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite album is probably 'War'."
"__MUSIC__ That was when they were young and edgy."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I think that is why those songs are some of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ They are some gems from that time period that no one talks about.  Such as 'Seconds'."
"__MUSIC__ That is a great song!"
"__MUSIC__ If I can get a ticket for you, would you want to come to U2 concert in June?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe.  I will have to think about it."
