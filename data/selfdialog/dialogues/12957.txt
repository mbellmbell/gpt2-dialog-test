"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is going to be the breakout star this year in the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you need to look at the rookie class for the next breakout star."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a lot of awesome rookie running backs this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My money is on Leonard Fournette. 6'1' 240 and one of the fastest guys in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's like a freight train running down the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see him as being the next Bo Jackson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could easily rush for 1,500 yards this year, or he could easily fall prey to numerous injuries like he did in college"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He only struggled with a few in college. I believe he'll play at least 15 games and finished first in the league in rushing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think Christian McCafferty will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where was he picked?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Panthers took him 8th overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's quick and can do everything with the ball. I like his game, but I don't see him being as good as Fournette"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a different type of back. I can see him catching 80 passes while rushing 12 times a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In today's game that's just as valuable as a guy who carries it 25 times a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would put money he has more touchdowns than Fournette"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way. Fournette will get all the goal line touches because he's so big"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But McCafferty is so crafty. I can see him scoring in so many different ways."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, I bet neither of them is as good as Elliot this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but only because Elliot has the superior offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both Fournette and McCafferty have awful offensive lines in front of them."
