"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Don't you miss Definitive Jux?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I definitely do. They put out some great music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's crazy to think that they were putting out their stuff at the same time as all the bling rappers."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know. That was a very odd period in hip-hop."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's your favorite Def Jux release?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would probably go with The Cold Vein by Cannibal Ox."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh man, that's a classic album. The production is crazy."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, for sure. What's your favorite?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I like El-P's Fantastic Damage. The production on that is even crazier."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Isn't it wild how big he's gotten? Who would have imagined that?"
