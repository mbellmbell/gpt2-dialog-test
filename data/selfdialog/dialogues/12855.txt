"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of this upcoming season in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited for it. I think there will be some great teams to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like an exciting rookie class."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For some positions, yes. I think it is a strong running back class, but quarterbacks, not as much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There have just been so many changes recently with locations."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. LA went from having no teams to having two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then Vegas now has the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't see how that will work well to build a fan base."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. At least in LA you have a lot of people all over. Vegas seems a little remote for a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel the same way, but I guess if they were offering the best deal, it looks good to the Raiders for now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. How do you think the Texans will do this year? I feel like they are so close to a breakout year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they still need to work their quarterback situation out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got Deshaun Watson though didn't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but just because he was strong in college doesn't mean that translates to the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. I guess not everyone can be  Dak Prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not many rookies come out their first year and play like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think they have all, or at least most, of the pieces in place to finally do something really good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess only time will tell. I think the Raiders are really going to continue the momentum from last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should be fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But when it comes down to it, I think the Patriots are going to repeat."
