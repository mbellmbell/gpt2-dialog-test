"__MUSIC__ Did you hear what happened at the Ariana Grande concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I heard! I don't know who she is, but it's so very tragic."
"__MUSIC__ She's an American pop singer."
"__MUSIC__ Does she sing anything I would know?"
"__MUSIC__ She recently sang a song with Nicki Minaj, and they performed it on Jimmy Kimmel Live."
"__MUSIC__ Actually that does sound familiar. She has a great voice."
"__MUSIC__ Yes she's a great singer."
"__MUSIC__ She reminds me a bit of Cristina Aguilera back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Yes they're both so petite with such large voices!"
"__MUSIC__ I will need to check out more of her music. Does she have any new albums out this year?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he most recent album was last year."
"__MUSIC__ That's even better - I'll be able to buy it on sale at Target."
"__MUSIC__ You can also just buy them online. I buy all of my music on iTunes."
"__MUSIC__ I don't have an iPhone so I've never tried to do that."
"__MUSIC__ There are many other similar sites to buy music onlin though."
"__MUSIC__ I will look into it. Thanks for the suggestion."
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome! It's so much easier and the sites all have big databases."
"__MUSIC__ That is true, so I will definitely be able to find her latest albums"
"__MUSIC__ You will probably even be able to purchase individual tunes rather than the entire album"
"__MUSIC__ Good idea, that will save me some money."
