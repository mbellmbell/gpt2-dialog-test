"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you looked at the NFL schedule this year for the Panthers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think they'll do  better than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully, because the schedule is a little easier than usual."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think Cam Newton will have a good year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, but I think the Patriots are still the team to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh definitely, it seems like that every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there's always some surprise team that comes out of nowhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I wonder who that will be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it's anyone in the NFC South.  I think the Packers could make some noise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah the Falcons blew it last year. It could be Packers and Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope it's two new teams this year in it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think McCaffrey will start and play well?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah he looks like the complete package and could complement Cam Newton well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea he could be dangerous.  Who else could be good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we need Kelvin Benjamin to lose some weight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah for sure, I don't know how he gained so much weight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he's mentally into it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah he is the difference maker.  Are you going to any games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am going to the first home game, maybe you could join me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure I'd love that."
