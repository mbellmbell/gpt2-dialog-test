"__MOVIES__ Don't know about you, but I'm a huge fan of the Batman movies."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones? Nolan or Burton?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely the Nolan ones. They're just so good."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the Burton ones."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the first two. I really enjoyed Michael Keaton's Batman and Jack Nicholson's Joker."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like Nicholson's Joker is highly underrated."
"__MOVIES__ I can see why. For the first proper big-screen appearance for the character, it was pretty awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Danny DeVito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman were also both pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I actually really enjoyed DeVito's Penguin. I'm disappointed that the Penguin character wasn't in the Nolan movies."
"__MOVIES__ It would've been interesting to see, that's for sure."
"__MOVIES__ So I take it you've seen all of the older ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have."
"__MOVIES__ In that case, how do you feel about Batman & Robin?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh. I would've liked to keep that one tucked away. That one wasn't very good."
"__MOVIES__ So I've heard"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, at least Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze was fun."
"__MOVIES__ Ice puns for days!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Also, I feel like they did a good job making Bane look as accurate to the comics as possible."
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, after the Dark Knight Rises, I can't see Bane in any other look other than Tom Hardy's."
"__MOVIES__ His Bane did look pretty cool."
