"__BEATLES__ Whenever I go home for the holidays, my Dad plays The Beatles nonstop."
"__BEATLES__ Does that bug you?"
"__BEATLES__ No, I like The Beatles. It just makes me not feel like listening to them anywhere else."
"__BEATLES__ I understand that. It's probably a lot at once."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. And my memories of most of the songs are connected to my childhood home."
"__BEATLES__ So it feels wrong listening to it somewhere else?"
"__BEATLES__ Basically. I really do like The Beatles though."
"__BEATLES__ I do too. Do you have a favorite song?"
"__BEATLES__ I like Norwegian Wood."
"__BEATLES__ What a coincidence, me too!"
