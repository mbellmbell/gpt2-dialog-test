"__MOVIES__ Hey. What are you up to tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure. Do you want to go to the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I would like go to the movies but it is so expensive."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ A ticket, food, and a drink can cost almost $25."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we could save that money and stay in."
"__MOVIES__ Great idea! How about we rent a couple of movies on Red Box?"
"__MOVIES__ That is a great idea! We could get a pizza too."
"__MOVIES__ Pizza sounds great. I am hungry."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have specific movies on your mind?"
"__MOVIES__ I want to rent Beauty and the Beast for sure."
"__MOVIES__ That movie does look good but I am not sure how I feel about Emma Watson playing Belle."
"__MOVIES__ I think she is a great choice! She is perfect for the role of Belle."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, well I think I will pick out Fifty Shades Darker."
"__MOVIES__ Alright. I will go pick them up. Do you want to go with me?"
"__MOVIES__ No thanks. Hey, can you pick up some chips to go with the pizza?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure. We will still be saving money by watching movies from Red Box instead of going to a movie theater."
"__MOVIES__ Plus we don't have to get all dressed up. I am comfortable in my pajamas."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I will be right back."
"__MOVIES__ Don't keep me waiting too long!"
