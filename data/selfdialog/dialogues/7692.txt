"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you think of Lady Gaga's music?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I hear her music in the clubs all the time. It's very danceable."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You can really move to it. But she also has a few ballads. They're quite beautiful."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She has an amazing voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her personality is something else, too!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you see the meat dress she wore to the Grammy's a few years ago?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Disgusting! But it was just a political statement. She's not the airhead people make her out to be."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Quite the contrary. I watched Howard Sterm interview her, and she came off as very intelligent and well-spoken."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw that interview too! It was strange to see her without her 'costume.'"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She looks pretty ordinary, doesn't she? But man, that voice."
