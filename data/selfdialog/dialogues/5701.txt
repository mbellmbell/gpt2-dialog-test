"__STAR_WARS__ Was Chewbacca an Ewok?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, he was a Wookiee."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, so then Ewok is what those little bears were called in 'Return of the Jedi,' right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yup.  I never understood by the way, how a bunch of Ewoks defeated the Imperial Stormtroopers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently it was mainly a ploy for merchandizing to children."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose children would love Ewok toys since they're basically teddy bears."
"__STAR_WARS__ Speaking of Ewoks, which do you think is the scariest creature in all of the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that the Sarlacc that killed Boba was the scariest."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is a good one.  Though I think the Rancor is easily scarier."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it was definitely bigger, and it almost killed Luke!"
