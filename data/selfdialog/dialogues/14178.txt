"__HORROR__ Have you ever seen the Blair Witch Project 2?"
"__HORROR__ No, I didn't know there was a second one."
"__HORROR__ It's actually a scary movie."
"__HORROR__ Oh, the first one really wasn't scary at all."
"__HORROR__ This one is more like a movie, not a lost and found footage deal."
"__HORROR__ What's it about?"
"__HORROR__ A group of young people go into an old house and find a witch."
"__HORROR__ And they probably all die?"
"__HORROR__ Pretty much, but the music and the atmosphere were dark and scary."
"__HORROR__ I might have to see it."
