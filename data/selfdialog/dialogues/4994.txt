"__FAST_FURIOUS__ who is your favorite Fast & Furious character"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ for sure it's Dom."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really? I always like Hobbs better."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ no way. Dom is the best!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hobbs is so much bigger and stronger though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ yeah, but Hobbs wasn't even one of the original characters."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ True, but he steals the show in the later sequels"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There wouldn't even be a movie without Dom, he's the center of almost all the movies"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ yeah, except for 2, which he was barely in."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ that one was the worst"
