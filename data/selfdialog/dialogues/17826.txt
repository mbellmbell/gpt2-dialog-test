"__MOVIES__ I'm really glad Force Awakens and Rogue one were good films."
"__MOVIES__ Same, having Star Wars back and having it be good is a relief."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think they would be bad films?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, but deep down you never know, look at the prequels."
"__MOVIES__ I think being owned by Disney ensures we'll never see something that bad."
"__MOVIES__ True, same ended up happening with Marvel."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the quality control is off the charts here, budget is there, talent is there."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think we'll suffer from too much Star Wars though?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean like the Marvel fatigue?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it feels like there's a new Marvel movie every day."
"__MOVIES__ Star Wars is a special kind of magic though, once a year isn't fatigue."
"__MOVIES__ But even discounting the movies, it's everywhere."
"__MOVIES__ Star Wars being everywhere is a good thing in my book."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right, I'm just hoping it maintains its integrity."
"__MOVIES__ You see the new posters for The Last Jedi?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the headlines that they were out, but not yet."
"__MOVIES__ You have to, they look so good."
"__MOVIES__ Will look them up as soon as I can, who is on them?"
"__MOVIES__ Just about everybody, there's a really heartbreaking one of Luke and Leia."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man I don't think I'm ready for that."
