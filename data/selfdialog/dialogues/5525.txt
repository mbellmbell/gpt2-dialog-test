"__STAR_WARS__ I liked the original Star Wars movies much better than the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ What didn't you like about the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well for one thing, I didn't like Jar Jar Binks as a character. He was sort of annoying."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I thought so too, but I liked the third movie in the series, Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked that one the best. I especially liked the end with the lightsaber battles and Anakin becoming Darth Vadar."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that part was pretty powerful. It was definitely cool to see how skilled Yoda was."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda has always been my favorite character. I liked him from the very first time we saw him in Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I really liked that scene where Luke first met him and thought he was just some annoying animal from that planet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, and then Yoda suddenly says, 'I cannot train him.' And at that point you realize it is the person Luke has been looking for."
"__STAR_WARS__ Empire Strikes Back is by far my favorite Star Trek movie, and that scene is part of the reason why."
