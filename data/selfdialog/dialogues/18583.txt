"__MOVIES__ I love music movies, or biopics as people call them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I'm glad we sat down to finally watch Jersey Boys, great film."
"__MOVIES__ There's just something about the way underdogs rise from the bottom in a music setting."
"__MOVIES__ It helps that you and I love music as much as we do."
"__MOVIES__ I had no idea Jersey Boys was based on a broadway play."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa what, it is?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and the main character is played by the same actor who stars in the play."
"__MOVIES__ That's really cool actually."
"__MOVIES__ Totally is, I'd be really interested in seeing the play one day."
"__MOVIES__ After how good this film was I am inclined to agree."
"__MOVIES__ What music film do you want to watch next?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard good things about Eddie and the Cruisers."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god I forgot about that one, I've been meaning to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's got that 80s Bruce Springsteen vibe going on in it, I am really excited."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it's important to like the music in a movie based on an artist?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it helps but a good story is still a good story."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, I just think it helps when you can really get behind the tunes too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely I agree, I just don't think it's neccesary."
"__MOVIES__ With that said I will go see where I can rent Eddie and the Cruisers."
"__MOVIES__ I'll get the popcorn ready."
