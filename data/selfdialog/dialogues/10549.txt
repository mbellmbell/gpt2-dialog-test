"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey man, have you listened to Drake's new album?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No man! I don't listen to that garbage!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What are you talking about? Drake is alright. What, are you not a fan of his?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nah man. I don't listen any of that new junk! The golden age of rap is dead!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh really, so what do you listen to then?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I only stick to the classics. Nowadays, everybody is sellin' out!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you have any artists in particular who you would say are the best?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Most people would respond with someone like Tupac or Biggie, but personally, I think MC deserves a spot among one of the greats!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You can't be serious man! That one-hit-wonder?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey man, if you can't appreciate his genius I see no reason to continue this conversation."
