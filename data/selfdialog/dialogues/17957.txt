"__MOVIES__ When are they going to come out with a new Indiana Jones movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, maybe they think everyone is tired of them.  I'm not..."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the ending to Passengers?"
"__MOVIES__ I kind of expected it but it was a little bit of a surprise."
"__MOVIES__ I watched Logan last night.  I was good but not all that great."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  I thought it was really good.  You must not be a fan of Wolverine."
"__MOVIES__ I am a fan of Wolverine but I thought the movie Logan kind of dragged along.  Too many car chases."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, maybe but it did have a lot of good action scenes and it kept with the theme of X Men."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I like all of the X Men characters to be in the movie, with all their various special talents."
"__MOVIES__ X Men does have a lot more special effects and stuff but as a story, Logan in itself was pretty solid."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, another monkey movie.  War for the Planet of the Apes is on at 7:30."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I'm up for that.  How about a romantic comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Aw, not another romance-comedy.  How about Spider-Man: Homecoming?  It's a little of both."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, I liked the last Spiderman but you're buying the popcorn."
"__MOVIES__ You're a fan of history, why don't we stream Dunkirk?"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty good.  Have you read any reviews on it?"
"__MOVIES__ Nevermind, Dunkirk isn't even out yet.  It comes out in July or something."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, too bad.  How about Kong: Skull Island?"
"__MOVIES__ What is Dark Tower about?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard it's some kind of western with a mystic twist about protecting a tower or something."
