"__DISNEY__ Are you excited to see the new Cars 3 movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm looking forward to it."
"__DISNEY__ I really hope that it is a good one."
"__DISNEY__ Sometimes these sequels don't live up to the hype."
"__DISNEY__ I hope Lightening McQueen, Mater, and Sally, and the rest of the gang are in it."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, it would be a shame if they weren't."
"__DISNEY__ I missed Sally in the 2nd movie.  Didn't seem right she was only in a few scenes."
"__DISNEY__ I know, I felt the same way.  She was a huge part of the first movie, seemed a shame to not bring her back strong in the 2nd."
"__DISNEY__ You'll have to tell me how you like the new one."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely, and you too."
