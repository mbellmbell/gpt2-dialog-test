"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the original Star Wars trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, my favorite was The Empire Strikes Back.  I really liked when Luke went to Dagoba!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Yoda is one of my favorite characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was really cool when he got the x-wing out of the swamp after Luke failed to from a lack of faith."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Yoda must have been one of the most powerful jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, though I think Obi-wan Kenobi was becoming nearly as wise.  Especially after all his time on Tatooine."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think he really didn't recognize R2-D2 and C-3P0 in A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It does seem kind of strange, but I suppose it had been nearly 20 years since he had last seen them.  Maybe he figured they had been sent to the spice mines of Kessel already (or at least 3P0."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is rather a wonder that 3P0 survived as long as he had.  He must have had a ton of luck, or caused endless trouble for R2."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I'm leaning more toward the endless trouble..."
