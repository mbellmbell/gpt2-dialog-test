"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Han Solo is the best Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think so. He has a really interesting arc in the first one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, the way he goes from a non caring space pirate to a friend is awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like him in The Empire Strikes Back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, although he did not have as big of an arc."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the first one developed his character a lot more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like him in Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but I think they should have killed him off."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard that is what he wanted in the third film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but I think someone decided it was better to keep his character alive."
