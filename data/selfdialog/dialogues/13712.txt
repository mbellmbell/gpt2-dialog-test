"__BASKETBALL__ What did you think of Game 6 between the Boston Celtics and the Washington Wizards the other night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That was a really tough loss for Boston. I was hoping they would keep their lead and pull it off in the end."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too, I can't believe they lost by 1 point."
"__BASKETBALL__ It seemed like the Celtics were really struggling to make their shots in the first quarter."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, what was strange was that they made 4 out of 17 shot attempts but we're still only down by 5 points at the end of the first quarter."
"__BASKETBALL__ Avery Bradley's alley-oop dunk right before halftime was awesome!"
"__BASKETBALL__ That was great to watch. I was so excited when the Celtics had the lead at halftime."
"__BASKETBALL__ One of the reasons things didn't work out for them is because John Wall had a tremendous game."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, his shooting was terrible in the first half but he still came back as aggressive as ever in the second half."
"__BASKETBALL__ It was Wall's 7-0 shooting run that brought the Wizard's back and tied the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wall wasn't able to make his  three point shots but he had his jump shot down and it showed."
"__BASKETBALL__ He dominated under the basket as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ As usual, Isaiah Thomas was integral in keeping the Celtics in the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ His step back jumper to take the lead in the last quarter was poetry in motion."
"__BASKETBALL__ I just don't know what happened. The Celtics were up by 2 with only a little over seven seconds left in the game and possession of the ball."
"__BASKETBALL__ It seemed like they were either frazzled or sloppy and that's how they ended up turning the ball over to Wall."
"__BASKETBALL__ My heart sunk when Wall put up that 3 pointer from way out there to take the lead."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too, I was hoping it didn't go in but he drained that shot right over Avery Bradley like it was easy."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's when they took the lead. It was over from there."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, but the desperate shot Isaiah Thomas put up at the buzzer didn't look horribly off."
