"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to music that's not from the United States or not in English?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, I guess I don't hear that much of it on top 40 radio."
"__MUSIC__ Well, kind of depends which radio stations you listen to, but you're right that there's not a ton on radio."
"__MUSIC__ Should I be listening to musics from other places or in other languages?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally. I'm super hooked on tons of music in Spanish."
"__MUSIC__ How did you get into it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, partially it was because I lived in the southwest and Los Angeles for a while and there was so much good stuff going on. But I also got really addicted to this podcast."
"__MUSIC__ What podcast?"
"__MUSIC__ Alt.Latino. I'm in love with so much stuff on that podcast."
"__MUSIC__ Can you give me some suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. I love this band called La Santa Cecilia. They're from LA."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ They have this amazing smokey-voiced female lead singer, and then an accordion, some drums and guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds kind of like a rock band."
"__MUSIC__ It's like a rock band meets LA Chicano music. It's awesome."
"__MUSIC__ How would I find their music?"
"__MUSIC__ It's on iTunes like anything else, man!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay. I'll check it. Any particular album I should have a look at?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they're all good. But some of their stuff is also awesomely political, like songs about immigration and migrant workers."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Intrigued. Definitely going to go download!"
