"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the Psycho remake?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Who did it?"
"__MOVIES__ Gus van Sant. He did a shot by shot remake of Psycho."
"__MOVIES__ Who did the original?"
"__MOVIES__ Alfred Hitchcock, in 1960."
"__MOVIES__ When was the remake?"
"__MOVIES__ 1998. It was in color. Plus it wasn't an exact shot by shot remake, though pretty close."
"__MOVIES__ Is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's interesting. He changed a couple of things, but it's worth seeing. It's like a film school project, almost."
"__MOVIES__ What did he change?"
"__MOVIES__ He added a few flash frames to the murder scenes. Plus Norman Bates masturbates in this one."
"__MOVIES__ Hitchcock didn't have him do that, then?"
"__MOVIES__ Er, no."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Vincent Vaughn was Norman Bates, and Anne Heche played Marion Crane?"
"__MOVIES__ Were they any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Vincent Vaughn was OK. I didn't like Heche. I thought she was too ditzy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't like her much."
"__MOVIES__ Still, you should check it out. Especially if you know the original well."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks. I might well do that."
