"__MUSIC__ What is a band that you can't stand."
"__MUSIC__ Red Hot Chili Peppers."
"__MUSIC__ That's surprising. Most people like them."
"__MUSIC__ For some reason, I find them really annoying."
"__MUSIC__ They are kind of a unique band. Maybe you just don't like their unique style."
"__MUSIC__ They are unique, but in a bad way. I really can't stand their songs either. Californication. Uh, I hate, hate, hate, that song."
"__MUSIC__ Any other songs from them that you loathe?"
"__MUSIC__ Otherside. What bands do you hate?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely the Offspring."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you hate the Offspring."
"__MUSIC__ They scream and scream and sound really whiny."
"__MUSIC__ I could see that. I kind of like them, only in the sense that they bring me back to my teenage years."
"__MUSIC__ They do bring me back to those years, but I don't associate them with that the good things that happened during that time in my life."
"__MUSIC__ What song do you hate the most from the Offspring?"
"__MUSIC__ Self-esteem, by a mile."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely scream throughout that song. I could see where you would get the whiny sound with them."
"__MUSIC__ Self-esteem was basically all whining and screaming."
"__MUSIC__ I'll make sure to never play any Offspring songs around you."
"__MUSIC__ Please, don't ever."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, once, if I ever get the urge to drive you up the wall."
