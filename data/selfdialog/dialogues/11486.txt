"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do think of the controversy over the Washington NFL's team's nickname?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That gets political and I don't like to talk politics, but I do get a kick out of team names."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, like how they don't always make sense--like the Utah Jazz.  Utah and jazz?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's because the team moved from New Orleans--I don't know why they didn't change the name, but that's basketball.  Any NFL names that amuse you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, most of them make sense, but what about the Buffalo Bills--are the named after Buffalo Bill Cody?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Houston Texans--what creative genius came up with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We could have the San Francisco Californians."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Seattle Washingtonians."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then there are the New Orleans Saints"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whats wrong with that--maybe related to music and New Orleans and 'When the Saints Come Marching In'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know--are you intimidated by a team of Saints?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you wouldn't be too fearful of the Dolphins either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they are big and they relate to Florida, so I'll give that one a pass."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the New England Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, a patriot seems more like a concept than a mascot, but that's not what bothers me about that team name."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ New England--that's not a city; it's an area."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right--every other team belongs to a city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm going to the game; where do I go; oh I don't know--New England."
