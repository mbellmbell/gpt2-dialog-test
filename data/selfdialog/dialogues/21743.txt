"__DISNEY__ I woke up this morning and on TV was the Disney movie 'The Incredibles'!"
"__DISNEY__ I love that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too.  Might be my favorite Pixar Disney movie!  I love the story and the animation!"
"__DISNEY__ Sometimes I feel like retired Mr Incredible."
"__DISNEY__ Me to.  At least we don't have to worry about a evil villain chasing us."
"__DISNEY__ I don' t know. My boss can be that guy sometimes!"
"__DISNEY__ I think anyone can relate to that."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know there is a 2nd Incredibles coming out soon?"
"__DISNEY__ I had read that on the internet."
"__DISNEY__ A whole generation will have grown up almost before the 2nd one came out!"
