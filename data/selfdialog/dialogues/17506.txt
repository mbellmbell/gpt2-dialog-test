"__MOVIES__ Speaking of movies, what is your favorite comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say I like Caddyshack a lot. Something about Mary is also good."
"__MOVIES__ What about recent comedies? Are there any that you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen clips from that Ben Stiller movie about the actors making the Vietnam War movie. I forget what that movie is called."
"__MOVIES__ What about Animal House? Have you seen that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course that is considered a classic comedy, but it has been so long since I've seen it, and the jokes are a bit old by now."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any other recent comedies that you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I think when they came out I liked those Eddie Murphy cop comedies, but I forget the title."
"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite comedic actor?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say Chevy Chase and Dan Ackroyd may be my favorite comedic actors."
"__MOVIES__ It seems you don't go to the movies very much."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I want to see that new Will Ferrel comedy about the suburban couple who launch a gambling den in their living room. It looks funny."

"__MOVIES__ Yes, I do like many of his films, though some of them are less likeable than others."
"__MOVIES__ Do you ever go to stand-up comedy acts, or watch comedic sitcoms?"
"__MOVIES__ I used to like Seinfeld and Married With Children when they originally came out. Seinfeld episodes are still fun to watch, though Married with Children has gotten a bit stale."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the whole Bill and Ted bit never appealed to me."
"__MOVIES__ It seems a lot of great comedic actors made a name for themselves on Saturday Night Live."
"__MOVIES__ Of course. And then there is Michael Richards, who was hilarious on the show Fridays."
