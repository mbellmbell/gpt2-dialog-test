"__MUSIC__ Hey did you see the Green Day show last night?"
"__MUSIC__ What?! They played here last night?"
"__MUSIC__ They sure did. The show was awesome."
"__MUSIC__ That's unreal. I haven't listened to them in forever."
"__MUSIC__ They just put out a new album this year."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ I listened to it a few times. They sound like old Green Day."
"__MUSIC__ Like very grungey?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that mixed with a bit of punk."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome. I didn't really like their pop stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think they were trying to be more radio friendly."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad they sound like their old selves."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I was worried about them for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Especially with their broadway musical."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah we don't talk aobut that."
"__MUSIC__ Ha good point."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure it wasn't awful, just not my thing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I agree."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we should go see it sometime."
"__MUSIC__ Ha maybe we should!"
