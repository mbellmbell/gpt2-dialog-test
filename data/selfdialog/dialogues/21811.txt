"__DISNEY__ Have you seen that old Disney movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, of course!  I used to love that movie when I was growing up!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too!  I wish Disney would make a newer version."
"__DISNEY__ That would be really cool, I would be first in line to the theatre to watch it."
"__DISNEY__ How many of the seven dwarfs can you name? I think I know all of them."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, I know probably around 5 off the top of my head."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know it first came out in 1937?"
"__DISNEY__ No I didn't.  For such an old film it is really good!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree, I didn't realise at first how old it was!"
"__DISNEY__ Neither, you've made me appreciate it even more now!"
