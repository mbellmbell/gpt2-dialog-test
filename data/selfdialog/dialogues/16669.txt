"__MOVIES__ I love sports movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Michael...sports movies? They are always so cliche."
"__MOVIES__ A lot of them are, but there are a few really good ones out there."
"__MOVIES__ Name one."
"__MOVIES__ Sure. How about Hoosiers? Remember Gene Hackman as the coach of that small indiana high school team?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah! And Dennis Hopper was that alcoholic assistant coach!"
"__MOVIES__ That one was a worthy example of a good sports film!"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to agree with you on that one. But that may be the only one!"
"__MOVIES__ Well I can give you two more without breaking a sweat."
"__MOVIES__ Gettting cocky now are we?"
"__MOVIES__ First one: 'Remember the Titans'."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember it. Just kidding...that was good too."
"__MOVIES__ And number two, and perhaps my favorite sports movie, 'We Are Marshall'!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man...you really came prepared! Ok. You were right."
"__MOVIES__ And, ironically, this may be one of the few Matthew McConaughey movies that was not cliche!"
"__MOVIES__ Ouch!"
"__MOVIES__ Am I right?  Am I right?"
"__MOVIES__ You are indeed correct sir. I stand corrected."
"__MOVIES__ That's right, and don't forget it!"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I should call you, 'Magic Mike'?"
