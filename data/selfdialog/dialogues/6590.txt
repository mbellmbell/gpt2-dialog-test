"__STAR_WARS__ What was the worst Star Wars movie, in your opinion?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't even need to think about that one.  It was 'Phantom Menace.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ What didn't you like about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the most glaring thing was that there were way too many Senate meetings and boring dialogue."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right.  I remember even as a kid, those scenes made me want to fast forward."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also, the dialogue was so badly written.  And the rules for the Jedi were poorly established."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, the rules were always unclear to me.  For instance, why does romantic love lead to the dark side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have absolutely no idea.  Also, the age gap between Padm√© and Anakin was a bit disturbing to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right.  Even though they fixed it in the next movie, I'll always remember that child as Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ They should have just began the prequel right from Anakin being trained as a young Jedi.  Without the backstory of Tatooine."
