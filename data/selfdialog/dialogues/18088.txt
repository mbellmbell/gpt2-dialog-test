"__MOVIES__ What is the most obscure movie you have ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really sure if it's obscure par say, but I've yet to find a single person that's heard of it. Which is quite surprising."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? What is it and why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Southland Tales and because it, in my opinion, has the best cast a movie could possibly have."
"__MOVIES__ You're right - haven't heard of it. Who all is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Justin Timberlake, Sean William Scott, and Curtis Armstrong... to name a few."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow. What an interesting combination. Sarah Michelle Gellar is still acting?"
"__MOVIES__ Well... it's an olderish movie that came out in 2006, but yeah. She's been in quite a few tv shows since then but I think her last movie role was in 2009's 'Veronika Decides to Die'."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame. Cool that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is still acting though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's a good guy and a great actor. Did you know he's going to be in Shazam?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that DC comic book series? Is he going to be Shazam? I could see that."
"__MOVIES__ Actually he's going to be Black Adam because he feels villains and anti-heroes have the more interesting origin story."
"__MOVIES__ That's true especially with Black Adam. Now that I think about it I couldn't imagine a better actor for the role."
"__MOVIES__ Same. Haven't heard too much about the movie unfortunately, but rumor has it the powers that be have decided to possibly go with a Black Adam film now and pushed Shazam to the back burner."
"__MOVIES__ Probably a good call. Too many hero movies, and Black Adam would make a much more interesting story."
"__MOVIES__ Plus it helps to set the stage and build even more anticipation for Shazam."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see The Rock in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. Was skeptical about a Jumanji sequel but everything I've seen and heard makes me think it'll be just as good if not better than the original."
"__MOVIES__ That has a dang good cast as well from what I remember. The Rock, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillian... can't remember who all else, but those three got me hooked instantly."
"__MOVIES__ Karen Gillian had me the most curious at start, but I always thought she was the hottest companion in Doctor Who?"
"__MOVIES__ She certainly was up there for me too, but from the new series I always had a celebrity crush on Billie Piper. She was pretty awesome in Penny Dreadful as well."
