"__DISNEY__ I think I want to dress up as one of the Disney Princesses for Halloween."
"__DISNEY__ Which one?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, yet."
"__DISNEY__ Well, which one's your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ I can't just go with that! I want to make sure it's one I actually look like."
"__DISNEY__ It doesn't matter, you can make your own version! People are always putting their own spin on things, 'steampunk' this and 'modern' that."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I could, but I'm really not that good at sewing or costuming or whatever."
"__DISNEY__ I'll help you. We can work on our costumes together and ours will be the best."
"__DISNEY__ You think we could use them to enter the contest? I don't know about getting up on stage."
"__DISNEY__ We'll do it together, trust me. I'll make mine go with yours and we'll go up there as a team."
