"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the preview for the new Baywatch movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The one with the Rock?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Zac Efron."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't, does it look good?"
"__MOVIES__ No it looks pretty awful to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ That bad?"
"__MOVIES__ Normally they put the funnier parts of the movie into the previews, not in this case."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well the Rock isn't exactly known to be the greatest actor ever."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's not going to be winning any Oscars anytime soon."
"__MOVIES__ On the other hand, the Dunkirk previews look incredible."
"__MOVIES__ They really do! I'm pretty excited."
"__MOVIES__ They've said that the summer will be a pretty weak time for movies this year, but I believe that Dunkirk will be a standout."
"__MOVIES__ I hope so, the previews really make me want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ All I knew about it at first was that it was the movie with Harry Styles in it, and didn't think much of it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, thats right isn't it? I forgot he was in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't think he has a major role though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well that's probably for the better, haha."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it'll be directed by Christoper Nolan, so it should be pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention the score is from Hans Zimmer."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, I didn't know that. Im excited!"
