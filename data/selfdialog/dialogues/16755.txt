"__MOVIES__ There's a movie I saw as a kid, that I'll probably never know what it was called."
"__MOVIES__ What year was that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was around 1970. Saw it in Los Angeles."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me the plot and I'll see if I know what it was."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think it was a Disney movie, but it seemed to have some violence in it, so I'm not sure."
"__MOVIES__ Was it a drama, a comedy, or animated?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a comedy, at least for the first few minutes, when a man was thrown out of a Cadillac."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't sound like a Disney movie to me!"
"__MOVIES__ It must have been rated 'G', because my mother took my brother and me to see it. It got a big laugh, though."
"__MOVIES__ What else can you remember about it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a modernized version of 'Don Quixote' by Cervantes."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that shouldn't be too hard to identify."
"__MOVIES__ I've looked for years for the thing. There was a big train wreck at the end of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember any of the actors? 'Don Quixote' came out in 1605, I think. World's best-selling book!"
"__MOVIES__ No. I didn't recognize any of them, and don't even remember the middle of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who was thrown out of the Cadillac?"
"__MOVIES__ It was supposed to be Pancho, the sidekick to 'The Man of La Mancha'."
"__MOVIES__ And there was a train wreck at the end? There was the musical, 'The Man of La Mancha'..."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose Pancho and The Man went out on a quest, and derailed a train. But this was no musical."
"__MOVIES__ Odd. There must be a database of movies made by year, or some cross reference to 'Don Quixote' you could look up."
