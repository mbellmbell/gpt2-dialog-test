"__MUSIC__ Wow, the last 2 years we have lost so many great musicians...."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Well for starters, David Bowie, Prince, Chuck Berry. For Starters."
"__MUSIC__ Really, where have I been?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know but those are some major players."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe Prince is dead. That's crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, losing David Bowie was a big blow."
"__MUSIC__ Ziggy Stardust....man, he's been around forever."
"__MUSIC__ And Chris Cornell died too and he was only 52."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Lead singer to Sound Garden. The grunge of the 90's."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of remember them but I wasn't in that music except Nirvana."
"__MUSIC__ Really Nirvana, you're so mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, better than Pearl Jam. Eddie Vedder totally sold out."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's only because Kurt Cobain died, he would have sold out eventually too. Think of all that music we missed."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but better to burn up than burn out."
"__MUSIC__ I guess. But their music was pretty good. I'll admit. Can't beat Nevermind as an album. Best of that genre."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and Jeremy on 10 by Pearl Jam. That is some of the best music."
"__MUSIC__ Even though Eddie Vedder sold out, he does have an amazing voice."
"__MUSIC__ One of my favorite songs by them is Animal. It's a cool song."
