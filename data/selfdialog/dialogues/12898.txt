"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your favourite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the Cowboys. I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean I guess?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you hate them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like their owner; he fired my favourite coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah? Who was he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it was 30 years ago. It was Tom Laundry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dang, you can certainly hold a grudge. Why was he fired?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They weren't satisfied with his record, I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh. So why did you like him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he was smart, and I appreciated that he made his athletes behave themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was he the main reason you loved them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, there were a lot of things. I like their quarterback, among others."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it was a players thing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, honestly, when I was five years old the biggest thing was that I liked their uniforms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? That's adorable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought it was cool that they had a star, and they were cowboys, and stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is pretty enticing for a five year old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. So, I guess I mostly like them for who they were."
