"__DISNEY__ Do you remember your first animated Disney movie growing up?"
"__DISNEY__ It's hard to recall, but I think it was either the 1938 Snow White and the Seven Dwarves or the 1942 Bambi. What about yourself?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably either One Hundred and One Dalmatians or The Sword in The Stone."
"__DISNEY__ Sword in the Stone and Robin Hood were, and still are, among my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Mine also. Really need to go back and watch some of these Disney classics."
"__DISNEY__ After binge watching Once Upon a Time I've had an itch to do the same. Probably start with Sleeping Beauty or Peter Pan."
"__DISNEY__ Peter Pan is another personal favorite, and I loved Robin Williams portrayal of Peter in Hook."
"__DISNEY__ Hook was great and I'm still heartbroken about Robin Williams passing away. Still fondly remember seeing him in Flubber in theaters with the family."
"__DISNEY__ That's awesome! Think the only live action Disney movie I've seen in theaters, besides a Star Wars or Marvel Comics one, was One Hundred and One Dalmatians."
"__DISNEY__ Another nicely done live action Disney film. I was tickled to death when I found out the actors who played Gregory House and Arthur Weasley were in it!"
