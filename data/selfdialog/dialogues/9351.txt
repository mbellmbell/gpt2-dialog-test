"__BASEBALL__ The Boston Red Sox are my favorite MLB team."
"__BASEBALL__ When I was growing up, Wade Boogs, Dwight Evans and Roger Clemens were my favorite Red Sox players."
"__BASEBALL__ My father's work had partial season tickets for the Red Sox and I went to about 100 games. I went to game 1 of the 1988 playoffs vs. Oakland."
"__BASEBALL__ Even though they were blown out in that game, it is was alot of fun to be at the park that night. Quite an event for sure!"
"__BASEBALL__ The home team was booed by the crowd as they were in the process of getting destroyed. It was pretty classic Boston sports fans behavior."
"__BASEBALL__ Red Sox fans in specific, and Boston sports fans in general, a tough to please. You need to produce or they turn on you."
"__BASEBALL__ The fans are similar to Philly fans in that regard. Tough to please."
"__BASEBALL__ During my high school and college years of the late 80s into the mid 90s, the Red Sox slowly worsened and became a very bad team. I still watched them as often as I could."
"__BASEBALL__ The strike year of 94 was devastating. Not to only the Red sox, but baseball in general."
"__BASEBALL__ You see, Red Sox fans would come back and show interest in the team no matter what. But other teams did not have that luxury."
"__BASEBALL__ The strike of 94 almost killed baseball. But the yankees becoming a dynasty and all of the HRs hit during the steroid era rescued it."
"__BASEBALL__ Though they are now regarded as cheaters, sluggers like Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds made the country pay attention to them."
"__BASEBALL__ Though they cheated and used steroids, they were megastars. And baseball turned its eyes on the cheaters so it could prosper again."
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees of the mid to late 90s and most of the 2000s helped too. They were a great team that I hated but respected."
"__BASEBALL__ Until 2004, it seemed like they were playing with the Red Sox."
"__BASEBALL__ Even after Pedro dominated the Yankees for the 1st half of his career, New York figured him out and was a thorn in his side."
"__BASEBALL__ Though Pedro battled and battled, he was only 170 pounds and often ran out of gas vs, the Yankees. The New Yorkers were patient and made him tire."
"__BASEBALL__ It was a battle to watch though! The greatness of Pedro vs. the grittiness of New York."
"__BASEBALL__ Eventually it worked out in the Red Sox favor in 2004, but it took an awfully long time for us Sox fans to get there."
"__BASEBALL__ It was well worth the wait though! 86 years of frustration gone!"
