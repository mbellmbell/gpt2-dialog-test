"__FASHION__ Have you seen Vera Wang's new dresses for spring?"
"__FASHION__ I have! I always love her style; she's mysterious and dark while being trendy and fresh at the same time."
"__FASHION__ I agree, although I tend to be more on the mysterious and dark side of things, haha."
"__FASHION__ Haha, yeah, you do. What's your favorite dress in her new collection?"
"__FASHION__ The long, silky black maxi dress with the lace at the neckline."
"__FASHION__ I knew you'd say that!"
"__FASHION__ It can be dressed up or dressed down with accessories and shoes and I like multi-purpose clothing."
"__FASHION__ So do I!"
"__FASHION__ What's your favorite of her new dresses this year?"
"__FASHION__ The 1940s-inspired cream floral one, I think. It's long enough to be dressy but short enough to be fun."
"__FASHION__ I agree! I really like all three of the patterns in the 40s series this year."
"__FASHION__ Is the midnight blue and stars one your favorite?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, it is! You know me so well! Have you bought any yet?"
"__FASHION__ No, I haven't. Besides, Vera Wang also has a set of silk camisoles out, so I couldn't decide what to get."
"__FASHION__ Really? I didn't know she designed camisoles!"
"__FASHION__ She hasn't until this season. I think I might want to buy some."
"__FASHION__ Me too! Really versatile, it looks like. Of course, I love lace necklines."
"__FASHION__ We should go look at her new collection at the mall later!"
"__FASHION__ I agree!"
"__FASHION__ I love Vera Wang's style."
