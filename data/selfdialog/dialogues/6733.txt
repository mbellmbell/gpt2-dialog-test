"__STAR_WARS__ Who's your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I've never known too much about the films, but I always thought that Darth Vader looked like a cool character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not a bad choice for someone who doesn't know much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like I said, I always thought he looked and sounded cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is a very cool character. One of the more memorable ones of the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I figured as much. I see his face on a lot of Star Wars products in stores."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're talking about his masked face, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, why? Has he ever been unmasked?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and he's hideous."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh. That's a new detail for me."
