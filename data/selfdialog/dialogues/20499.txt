"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the new Jungle Book movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it was pretty good but I preferred the classic animated version better."
"__MOVIES__ I actually preferred it to the animated one, the special effects were top notch."
"__MOVIES__ Ya, but it seemed like they attempted to force in the classic songs at times."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree, I actually think they were worked in pretty cleverly."
"__MOVIES__ I will say that Shere Khan was pretty fierce."
"__MOVIES__ The big gorilla was pretty intense too. It definitely had a darker feel than the original."
"__MOVIES__ Ya, it scared my 4 year old though. I'm going to have to stick with the animated one for him for awhile."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ya, I can see that. There were definitely some frightening parts."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard they are remaking more of the disney movies as well."
"__MOVIES__ Ya, like Beauty and the Beast and I've heard the Lion King is coming out in a year or two."
"__MOVIES__ I'm definitely looking forward to that one. I'm curious how they'll make Scar."
"__MOVIES__ Disney is definitely going to milk the money out of those."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe my son will be able to handle those in a couple years."
"__MOVIES__ Those should be fun to watch as a family."
"__MOVIES__ Ya, as long as they don't get too intense though. I would think the Lion King could get pretty frightening."
"__MOVIES__ Especially since they are more realistic than the animated ones."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, we'll have to see how those go."
"__MOVIES__ As long as they are like the Jungle Book, I'll keep watching them."
