"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey there.  You excited about the upcoming season?  What's your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You betcha I am.  Packers all the way!  I can't wait...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, I was talking to that gentleman over there.  But since you butted in like a typical Packer fan, I guess I'll talk to you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better off anyway.  No sense talking about anything other than the Pack.  Goin all the way!!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Typical response.  How's the weather been around your place?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's great weather for a game.  I can't wait for the Green and Gold to beat down the opposition this year and bring the trophy back to Title Town where it should really permanently sit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see you've brought it back to the Packers.  So you are confident this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course.  Nelson is the best receiver in the league; Rodgers is the best QB; the defense will be much better because we have more inexperienced rookies in the secondary; and we have a brand new running back that hasn't yet been physically broken down by a full season of games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the best always rise to the top, don't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck yes.  That's why they always make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But don't necessarily win.  Did they rise to the top against the Falcons last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was only because of the bad call against the fullback when he supposedly fumbled!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about that Seahawk game?  Did they rise to the top when they were up by 9 with 4 minutes left?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not fair!  They were ripped off.  There were so many penalties that weren't called!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't they lead the league in scoring in 2011 but got stuffed by the Giants?  And if I recall, the refs were looking for ways to get the Packers back into the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants stole all of our signals!  They cheated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, that was the Giants vs. Vikings.  Nice try though.  What about when Favre threw that late interception to the Giants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't talk about him.  He's a traitor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you still think that they're destined to win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After they've been hosed so many times, how can I not?"
