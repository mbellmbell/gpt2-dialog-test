"__BEATLES__ Did you know that the Beatles recorded 'All You Need Is Love' 50 years ago today?"
"__BEATLES__ Are you serious?! That's amazing. I love that song."
"__BEATLES__ I love it, too. It's one of my favorites."
"__BEATLES__ Is that on the Sgt. Pepper album?"
"__BEATLES__ No. Magical Mystery Tour."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, right! Which was actually a soundtrack for that weird rockumentary."
"__BEATLES__ Haha, yeah! The psychedelic bus trip..."
"__BEATLES__ There were some great songs on that album, though."
"__BEATLES__ Of course! 'The Fool on the Hill' and 'Penny Lane' and the unforgettable title track."
"__BEATLES__ 'Strawberry Fields Forever,' 'Baby, You're a Rich Man,' 'Hello, Goodbye'... gosh, practically every song on that album was a hit!"
