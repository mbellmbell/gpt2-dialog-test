"__DISNEY__ Which is your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Mulan. What about yours?"
"__DISNEY__ The Lion King. I watched it more than 10 times when I were young."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I like it too. What do you like the most about Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I grew up with Disney so I didn't analyze much movies when I was younger. But now I liked the stories, the songs during the movie and the funny moments."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I agree. And the villains, the way they're created. I like it"
"__DISNEY__ True. But I don't like the fact that they're kinda the same. You can recognize a movie from Disney just a couple of minutes after watching it."
"__DISNEY__ I disagree. I think they're all unique on their way."
"__DISNEY__ Still have some things in common. Like funny lines and the main characters."
"__DISNEY__ Let's agree to disagree."
