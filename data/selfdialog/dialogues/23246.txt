"__DISNEY__ Hey little girl!"
"__DISNEY__ Hi Dad!"
"__DISNEY__ I was cleaning out the attic and came across this box of old Disney storybooks."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, awesome!"
"__DISNEY__ But take a look at this one, 101 Dalmations."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah."
"__DISNEY__ Look at this page. Read it and tell me what you think."
"__DISNEY__ That doesn't seem right. It did happen that way in the movie!"
"__DISNEY__ That's right! They changed the story details in the book!"
"__DISNEY__ Political correctness, I guess."
