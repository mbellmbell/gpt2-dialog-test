"__SUPERHERO__ Have you noticed that these 'superhero' stories are really just old stories being re-told?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I noticed. It was quite apparent in the latest Wonder Woman."
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean?"
"__SUPERHERO__ They heavily relied on Greek mythology."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I see. That's exactly what I mean. You can't get much older than stories from the ancient Greeks."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, and much of Thor is from the Vikings which is about Norse mythology."
"__SUPERHERO__ So, both Marvel and DC have stolen from the past."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, it's not really stolen. It's more re-interpreted."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I agree. But, I'll take it even further. They've improved them!"
"__SUPERHERO__ You're right! The new Wonder Woman movie is an amazing combination of old and new."
