"__POP__ So, who's your favorite pop artist these days?"
"__POP__ I'm not big on the artists now, but I do like Katy Perry."
"__POP__ Ewww... she's annoying.  I don't care for her."
"__POP__ I think she's a good singer.  Have you heard her hit the high notes in Firework?"
"__POP__ I like Taylor Swift much better.  Are they still feuding?"
"__POP__ I think so.  Although I think Katy is ready to squash that."
"__POP__ Yeah, probably because she wants to do some songs with her."
"__POP__ I doubt it.  Katy just released a new song called Swish Swish."
"__POP__ Well, I'm sure she'd want to collaborate with Taylor."
"__POP__ You keep on thinking that.  Taylor hasn't had a new song in a long time."
