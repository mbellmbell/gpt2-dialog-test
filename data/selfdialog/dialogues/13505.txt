"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are those Panthers looking this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, you know we're gonna Keep Pounding!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see. Is Cam up to the challenge?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. He was hurt last year a lot of the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. But it did start off poorly too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he got hurt, I think in the season opener in Denver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He needs to spend less time on Nick and more time studying the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. There's a reason Brady doesn't have a TV show."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. It takes hard work to be a champ!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Cam can take them all the way though. We saw what he's capable of two years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a great season indeed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, if they had won... easily top 3 team of all-time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Sucks that they lost."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they didn't lose like the Falcons though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Amen to that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That L was so bad, it made me feel better about the Cam's previous loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about. Blowing a 25 point deficit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. That's some special incompetence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either that or Brady is just a god."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah... Brady's definitely the greatest of all-time."
