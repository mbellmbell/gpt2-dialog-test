"__MOVIES__ So what do you think about the movie Bad Moms?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I don´t have an opinion yet, I have not seen it. Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure, I have bias feelings toward it."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that so?"
"__MOVIES__ I did not like that they would prefer to be bad moms but at the end it sorta worked out."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really, no I am intrigued, I´ll have to rent it or watch it on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Please do! and tell me what you think of it."
"__MOVIES__ Which actress are on the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh the cast is really good. You have Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, then I definitely have to see it, I like Mila Kunis really much."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really, which other movies of Mila Kunis do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Black Swan, Friends with Benefits, Oz the Great and Powerful, Forgetting Sarah Marshall"
"__MOVIES__ Ohh I just realized that Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell is not their first movie working together."
"__MOVIES__ You are right! They co-stared in Forgetting Sarah Marshall."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It was funny, but I do not recommend anyone to experience this in real life, it´s heart breaking."
"__MOVIES__ You are right. My favorite one though is Black Swan."
"__MOVIES__ Really?, why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ I just love ballet and how hard the ballerinas have to work to get their part."
"__MOVIES__ Your are right, even though Mila turned out to be a figment of Natalie Portman´s imagination in the movie."
