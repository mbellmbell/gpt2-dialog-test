"__DISNEY__ Have you watched the Littler Mermaid before?"
"__DISNEY__ I have ! The best part is when she used a fork as a comb"
"__DISNEY__ I wonder how she kept her hair so nice in and out of the water?"
"__DISNEY__ I know , people always talk about how perfect her hair was."
"__DISNEY__ I liked the part when Jasper was stuck in the kitchen and the chef was trying to boil him"
"__DISNEY__ that part was funny. Ursula was awful, she had her own powers she should have left the mermaids alone"
"__DISNEY__ I know, that part when she had the dried up mermaids stuck in the ocean floor was sad and disturbing"
"__DISNEY__ ariel's dad could be scary as well, like when he destroyed her special place"
"__DISNEY__ I hated that part, he was trying to keep her safe though"
"__DISNEY__ I am glad that in the end she got to marry Eric and have her legs and still see her dad and family."
