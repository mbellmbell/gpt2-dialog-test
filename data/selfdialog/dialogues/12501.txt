"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, what's up with Kaeparnick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man, you think he's gonna get picked up by anyone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so, I just don't think he's a great player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he had a few great years when Harbough was the coach, but has been really bad since then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he just lost his weapons and coach, anybody would be bad after that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ who did he lose?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he had Crabtree, he had that Florida State Receiver, Boldin.  Plus Vernon Davis was always hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that's true, I think we're finding out that Crabtree is pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  Where did Vernon Davis end up? I think he left the Niners."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He went to the Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ooh they've got a pretty good stable of Tight ends now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that other really good tight end is still there right? Jordan Reed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he is always getting hurt. That guy can't stay on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but at least they still have Desean Jackson, Kirk has some guys to throw to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't think so man, Jackson took off to go to the Bucs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great, we paid Kirk all that money for one year, now they're gonna be terrible, and he's just gonna up and leave next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's certainly a possibility, where do you think he'll go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, someone that needs a qb."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe the Broncos, Texans, maybe the Browns. Somewhere with a decent team that just needs a quarterback."
