"__STAR_WARS__ Who is to blame for Anakin's fall?  Qui-Gon or the Emperor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's an interesting question.  I think it's a bunch of factors together."
"__STAR_WARS__ If you had to choose between the two options though?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the Emperor then.  Because Qui-Gon saw the potential and good in Anakin, which was still a path for him when they met."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess if it weren't for the Emperor, Anakin's potential for evil would not have been met."
"__STAR_WARS__ If anything though, wouldn't the Tuskan Raiders who killed Anakin's mother have more blame?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely more than Qui-Gon.  What about Padm√© you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I don't think she chose to die.  You can't blame characters for falling in love."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that's a good point.  Lots of different factors led to Anakin's demise."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's definitely sad that it happened, but it led to Darth Vader, the coolest sci-fi villain of all time."
