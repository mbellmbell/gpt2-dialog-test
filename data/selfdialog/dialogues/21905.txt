"__DISNEY__ Do you know what Disney movie I've always disliked?"
"__DISNEY__ What one?"
"__DISNEY__ The Little Mermaid. It drives me insane."
"__DISNEY__ Oh no. Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ I hate that Ariel gives up her mermaid life for a man."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's quite the sacrifice. Who wouldn't want to live under the sea?"
"__DISNEY__ I wish I could be under the sea right now!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too! Especially to escape this scorching summer heat."
"__DISNEY__ That chick's voice is annoying too."
"__DISNEY__ Wow. You've got some strong feelings about poor Ariel."
