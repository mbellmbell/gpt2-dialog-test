"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite best picture winner?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that should be obvious:  Rocky."
"__MOVIES__ What is your least favorite best picture winner?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a toss up between Chicago and Lord of the Rings, Return of the King."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Chicago wasn't very good, didn't even think it should've been nominated, much less win."
"__MOVIES__ What about Return of the King?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't really care for the Lord of the Rings movies, they were too long, and bored me."
"__MOVIES__ But you can appreciate the work, and detail that was put into the movie, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can.  Honestly, I just really wanted Lost in Translation to win.  I thought it was much more engaging."
"__MOVIES__ Ah yes, ol Scar Jo, right when she started to break out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've loved her since Ghost World.  That's an underrated movie."
"__MOVIES__ I remember when I was a kid, and watched Heavy Metal, and there were trailers before the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What were the trailers?"
"__MOVIES__ Last Supper, City of Lost Children, and Crumb."
"__MOVIES__ That's certainly an eclectic mix."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess they considered anyone who bought Heavy Metal on VHS an eclectic bunch.  Anyway, I remember I made it a point to seek out and watch all three of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Were they any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, at the very least, interested.  Crumb is a documentary, and it's really out there."
"__MOVIES__ I remember Last Supper-- it's got quite the star studded cast."
