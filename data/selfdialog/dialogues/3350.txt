"__MUSIC__ My son is in need of a new tuba."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't we all?"
"__MUSIC__ Cut the jokes. What am I looking to pay."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I need to know a few things."
"__MUSIC__ Ask away."
"__MUSIC__ How old is he, how serious is he about it?"
"__MUSIC__ He's 17 and going to college for music education, and already has a performance and academic scholarship."
"__MUSIC__ Nice! Congrats to him."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks! He wants to be a band director some day."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so looks like he's serious and won't need a 'school' instrument."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, something professional but not too expensive."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know if he wants rotary or piston valves?"
"__MUSIC__ Which sounds better?"
"__MUSIC__ They sound the same. The only real differences are appearance and that rotary springs back faster, but it's not noticeable, really."
"__MUSIC__ Probably rotary then."
"__MUSIC__ Silver, nickel, or brass finish?"
"__MUSIC__ Brass, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ CC or Bbb tuning?"
"__MUSIC__ Whatever is most common."
"__MUSIC__ For him, probably a Bbb tuba. Try a St. Petersburg 202N, it's a bit under $4,000."
