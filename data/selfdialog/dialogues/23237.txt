"__DISNEY__ Did you ever think that Disney might want to make sort of a cinematic universe for their films?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh... God, no, I... hadn't considered that idea."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure they could retcon most of the princess movies into the same world, one way or another."
"__DISNEY__ Why are you doing this? Why is this a thing you need to think about?"
"__DISNEY__ It just seems like it could be kind of cool. Like, Sofia and Elena are connected -- and Sofia keeps calling up the movie princesses."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you know this?"
"__DISNEY__ Know what?"
"__DISNEY__ I just... okay, so... you're saying they are all connected, then?"
"__DISNEY__ Sort of. Through a TV show, though, and I'm not sure if it's canonical both ways or not."
"__DISNEY__ Please, please, please tell me more of your fascinating theories. I won't use them in any kind of an embarrassing context, I assure you."
