"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Tinkerbell movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean of the recent animated bunch."
"__MOVIES__ Right, the ones actually made by Disney."
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough one.  I kind of liked the one with her twin sister."
"__MOVIES__ I believe you are talking about Secret of the Woods."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds about right."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of liked the one where she had to rescue her friends."
"__MOVIES__ That's the Great Fairy Rescue"
"__MOVIES__ Right.  I liked the human story in it with the little girl and learning to co-exist with others."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely had a more adult slant to it than some others."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't quite get that from Secret of the Woods."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was good about introducing a new fairy though."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure the toy marketers loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Who doesn't love a machine that can make snow anywhere?"
"__MOVIES__ They have those in real life you know."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but not one that can be built by a fairy in ten minutes!"
"__MOVIES__ You're kind of overreaching here a bit, don't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Just saying, Tinkerbell is a creative kind of gal."
"__MOVIES__ It's a cartoon, dude.  I live in real life here."
"__MOVIES__ You're no fun.  You need a splash of pixie dust!"
