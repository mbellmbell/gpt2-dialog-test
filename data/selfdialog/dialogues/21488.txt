"__DISNEY__ So after watching Frozen the millionth time with my daughter, we tried Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Mo anne-na. I heard good thind about it. What did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ It's Moe-Anna. Like Anna from Frozen. I made the same mistake too. It was great!"
"__DISNEY__ What did you like about it?"
"__DISNEY__ It featured a strong female character, had wonderful catchy tunes and one crazy chicken that made me laugh."
"__DISNEY__ Always have an animal sidekick. Disney movie rule."
"__DISNEY__ Is Timon & Pumba considered an animal companion cliche? Since, well Simba was an animal?"
"__DISNEY__ Umm, sure why not!? They brought that comic relief that the companion always has."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. Maybe since they are lower on the food chain as well."
"__DISNEY__ I like bacon.. Yup.. Yup.."
