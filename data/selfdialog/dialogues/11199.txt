"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football?!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hell yeah!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you looking forward to the most this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, I'm more into the fantasy football aspect of it than anything else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really? Big gambler?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We don't even place money. Just general competitive spirit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's cool. I'll occasionally play but I like to put a little extra money on it to keep it interesting - at least lose buys lunch sort of thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah I could get into that. Might have to play with you this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should. Where do you play now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the online communities I belong to sets up a league each year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're not into it at all for the actual sport?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I am it's just not my biggest reason for following. I used to watch college football and basketball almost religiously."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh? Who'd you follow?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ University of Oklahoma, of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Thought most from your town were Oklahoma State fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are... but they don't know any better. Actually my whole family supports OU so I just sorta grew up into it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool cool. My family were big Kansas State fans so I guess it's pretty much the same for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotta love family. I actually follow pro more now and the Kansas City Chiefs are on my top three teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Shouldn't be a surprise but they're my number one pro team. What's your other two faves?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas Cowboys because of similar family reasons, but it's a close tie between Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons."
