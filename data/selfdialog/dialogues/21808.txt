"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ There are many to choose from, but when I was a kid I loved Robin Hood."
"__DISNEY__ Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ Baloo and Little John were the same voice actor, Phil Harris, and he was the funniest character to me."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't Robin Hood use some of the same animation as the Jungle Book? Why not the Jungle Book?"
"__DISNEY__ The Jungle Book is great too, but the action and humor in Robin Hood was better in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that makes sense. Theres no stagecoach robbing or storming of a castle in the Jungle Book."
"__DISNEY__ What about you? What was your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I like the female empowerment of Mulan."
"__DISNEY__ Good call. She was very self-reliant."
