"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved it! It was so sad!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. It was very different having Jyn and all of the other protagonists die at the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ That made it more powerful though, because it was a realistic suicide mission."
"__STAR_WARS__ It wasn't like some of the other movies, where the heroes should have died a million times over."
"__STAR_WARS__ Return of the Jedi was so bad about that! At the very least, Han and Leia should have died on Endor while trying to deactivate the shield."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, even though Leia got shot, it never felt like she was in any danger."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that's what made it so shocking when Kylo Ren killed Han in the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I definitely did not see that coming! It will be hard for Kylo Ren to redeem himself now."
"__STAR_WARS__ Does he need to redeem himself though? In the trailer to The Last Jedi, Luke suggests that there's more to the Force than just Light and Dark."
