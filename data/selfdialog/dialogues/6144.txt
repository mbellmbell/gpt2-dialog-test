"__STAR_WARS__ I just saw Episode VII for the third time.  I like it more each time I watch it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see.  And what do you like so much about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like how the movie pays a lot of homage to the original Star Wars from 1977, A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Indeed it does.  I like that you get to see what finally happens to Luke, Han and Leia after so many years.  I always wondered."
"__STAR_WARS__ There is also a good mix of old and new characters that keeps the story exciting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  Is there anyone you hope to see in the next two Star Wars films, Episodes VIII and IX?"
"__STAR_WARS__ If somehow Boba Fett could show up in some scenes, I would be forever grateful."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree with you there.  And what do you think, at the end of the day, makes Star Wars so special?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, behind all the glitz and glamor and flashy CGI and marketing, there is still something profound.  There is a deep sense of human nature, what we consider heroic, and what we consider our weaknesses weaved into the films.  Luke is such a classical hero."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think you're right.  I think that's why the movies have such an effect on all age groups and across different cultures and backgrounds."
