"__MUSIC__ Everything new on the radio today is bad."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can't stand most of the new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ The only group I like is Imagine Dragons."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too - I wish they were played more.  I like the band Fun too."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are similar and both good, but too much time goes to pop music on the stations that play them."
"__MUSIC__ Agree,  I miss some of the classic ballad / big hair bands!"
"__MUSIC__ That time was so much fun,..listening to bands like REO Speedwagon."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly - i still sing along with 'I Can't Fight This Feeling' haha."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Any of their stuff is great, and having a hits album makes it easy to find what I like."
"__MUSIC__ I loved Boston and Rush too - so many great albums and songs!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, when I was in college I loved Boston and didn't like the Eagles then totally got hooked on the Eagles."
"__MUSIC__ I remember being so sad when the Eagles broke up.  Loved their music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, we I was travelling in Europe in the late 1980s everyone LOVED the Eagles."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I didn't know they were popular over there."
"__MUSIC__ We used to play our Eagles cassette tapes and the Germans loved it."
"__MUSIC__ That's really cool.  I wonder what they think of American music now!"
"__MUSIC__ Can you imagine what they think of Justin Bieber?  They probably roll their eyes."
"__MUSIC__ Of course the Germans have some interesting much too.  Think about Ramstein."
"__MUSIC__ Or polka haha - quite a variety. All the hard metal rock too."
"__MUSIC__ I'd be interested in trying some of that out.  Any suggestions?"
