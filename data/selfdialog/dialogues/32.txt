"__MUSIC__ Do you like Banks?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. What do they sing?"
"__MUSIC__ Not they. She. Her name is Gillian Banks."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. I think maybe I've heard of her. Is she really popular?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think so. But she's getting to be more well known."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what's one of her songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Drowning is probably her most popular, but Gemini Feed is the latest one. It's pretty popular, too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah! Of course I've heard of her. I just forgot who she was."
"__MUSIC__ She's great. I own both of her albums."
"__MUSIC__ What were they called? I kind of want to buy one. I have some money on an iTunes card I got for Christmas."
"__MUSIC__ Well, her first album is Goddess, and the new one is called The Altar."
"__MUSIC__ Which one would you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Both! But, seriously. I think you should start with Goddess. It's less sophisticated than The Altar, but it's so good."
"__MUSIC__ Why not start with The Altar?"
"__MUSIC__ if you start with The Altar you probably won't appreciate how much she grows from one album to the next."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I understand. I'll buy Goddess and let you know what I think."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, do. And you should listen to it a lot before you try the new one. Don't worry. You'll be addicted."
"__MUSIC__ You're always so great for new music."
"__MUSIC__ Aww, thanks. But you already knew about Banks, silly. You just forgot about her."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right!"
