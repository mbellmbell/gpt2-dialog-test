"__MOVIES__ Hey. Have you seen any good movies lately."
"__MOVIES__ Not any that were amazing. The last one I saw was just ok."
"__MOVIES__ What was it."
"__MOVIES__ It was called The Space Between Us."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It was about a boy who grew up on Mars and came to try and live on Earth, even though they didn't think he could."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting. Why was it just ok."
"__MOVIES__ It was a good story line but I would of just liked more from it."
"__MOVIES__ I get it. Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Asa Butterfield and Britt Robertson."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of them."
"__MOVIES__ They are fairly new. Have you seen any good movies?"
"__MOVIES__ The last movie I saw was the new Pirates of the Caribbean."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I was honestly really disappointed with it."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ It just did not have a good plot and was very slow through the majority of it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that stinks. I really liked those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too and I love Johnny Depp, but I was just disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I will have to wait to see it when it comes out on video then."
