"__BASEBALL__ How far is one base from the next?"
"__BASEBALL__ A base is 90 feet away from the next one, 60 feet in little league baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ I've seen different baseball parks have different distances to the fences."
"__BASEBALL__ True, and that actually adds interesting strategy to the game of baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, some parks have closer fences, relatively speaking, I've noticed."
"__BASEBALL__ True, and those parks favor hitters more, especially home run hitters."
"__BASEBALL__ So, the other parks, with the farther fences, favor the pitchers more, it sounds like."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. Teams that play in those 'pitchers parks' will structure their team differently than the other teams."
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds like baseball is more than just a game of hitting, throwing and running."
"__BASEBALL__ Certainly more so. There are many analytics and different strategies that can be and are used."
"__BASEBALL__ So a player who hits more home runs will be treated differently by the other team than a player who runs fast."
"__BASEBALL__ Indeed, because you have to defend against the player's strengths as much as possible."
"__BASEBALL__ So, would it pay to know about the other team and its players?"
"__BASEBALL__ Most certainly it would, but teams try to hide some information about their strategy to keep their opponents guessing."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, and that's why you'll see coaches perform hand signals that hopefully only their players know."
"__BASEBALL__ I've seen catchers give signs with their fingers to the pitcher."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, so the pitcher will know what type of pitch to throw."
"__BASEBALL__ Can an opposing player steal signs?"
"__BASEBALL__ They can, if that player can see them and he has figured out their meaning."
"__BASEBALL__ I've seen catchers try to hide their signs for that reason."
