"__ICEHOCKEY__ Can you believe the Capitals again lost before getting to the finals?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I do believe it because it happens every year. They looked bad the other night."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah they did. I guess there is a reason the Penguins won the Cup last year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They'll probably win it again this year if they keep playing like that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Even with Crosby hurt they have to be considered the favorites. Who do they have next?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They play Ottawa in the East finals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh that's right. And how long has it been since Ottawa went to the Cup finals?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I doubt they ever have. And I don't think a team from Canada has won it all in about 25 years."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who did it then?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe Montreal in the mid 1990s? I can't remember for sure."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Canada teams haven't been very good in recent years?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Edmonton seems on the way up at least. They took the Ducks to seven games."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And they have that McDavid kid, who is what? 21?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think so, and he may already be MVP. They might be getting ready for another Gretzky-type run."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well I doubt they'll win that many Cups, but I wouldn't be surprised to see them win it all in a few years."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Could you imagine a Nashville-Ottawa finals? I don't think NBC would be thrilled."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well all of Canada would be tuned it at least. Who are you predicting?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I would like to see Pittsburgh and Anaheim I guess, it seems like more of a true East-West that I like to see."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's a shame Washington ran into Pittsburgh so early. This could have been their year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They've been saying that for a decade it seems like."
