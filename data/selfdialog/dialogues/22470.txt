"__DISNEY__ Do you know if they're planning to do a Little Mermaid live action remake?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't heard anything about it. With the way they've been going this route, it's only a matter of time."
"__DISNEY__ I think they will do Pocahontas first and then perhaps something like Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ Little Mermaid would be a lot more fun to remake. The ocean setting, the world undersea would be fantastic to recreate with today's technology and CGI available to Disney."
"__DISNEY__ I think that's why it would also be difficult to do because that sounds like it would be a really big budget project."
"__DISNEY__ When have you known Disney to not go all out on a film of theirs? They're the kings of current big productions!"
"__DISNEY__ That's true, you're right, I could imagine it. I hope the Little Mermaid get's moved up the list. I really want to see who would play the new Ariel."
"__DISNEY__ There are so many options. I'm excited about how they would approach the sea."
"__DISNEY__ I need more Sebastian the crab in my life!"
"__DISNEY__ There's a slight homage to Sebastian in Moana if you caught it, the end credits."
