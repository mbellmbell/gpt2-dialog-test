"__DISNEY__ Did you see the live version of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I did."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think about it?"
"__DISNEY__ I actually liked it a lot. I didn't think I was going to."
"__DISNEY__ Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ Because I am such a huge fan of the animated version."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah, me, too."
"__DISNEY__ At first, I kept comparing the two in my head, but after a while, I really got into it."
"__DISNEY__ Well, thanks for your thoughts about it. I'm going to check it out as well."
"__DISNEY__ I think you'll enjoy it if you just take it on it's own, don't compare."
