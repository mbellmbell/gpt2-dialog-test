"__MOVIES__ I really enjoy Tarantino  movies, and I love Samuel L. Jackson movies, but I couldn't get into this one because of him."
"__MOVIES__ Really? You're like the biggest Jackson fan going? If you did not like it, there must have been some problems."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it felt like nothing was really challenging Jackson."
"__MOVIES__ Were there no antagonists in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Sort of. The only identifiable antagonist was one who was in chains. I expected her to get out eventually, but what happened in the meanwhile?"
"__MOVIES__ I would imagine someone in chains can only talk to you."
"__MOVIES__ That was the problem. All of the other antagonists were not revealed, and Jackson was not the paranoid one in the group, so he was not bothered by them."
"__MOVIES__ So you basically paid to heat him speak for a few hours?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say that aptly describes what happened. Oh, and he did not care about the prisoner and her constant babbling- he did care about the sheriff though."
"__MOVIES__ Was Jackson a criminal in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he wasn't a criminal. I think he was considered an anti-hero by the north who he was formerly employed by."
"__MOVIES__ Why, what did he do?"
"__MOVIES__ He burnt down a prison which happened to have 37 union soldiers inside. They deemed him to be a white killer."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so he was on the run from the law because of that?"
"__MOVIES__ No, they could not prove it."
"__MOVIES__ So why would he be worried about a sheriff?"
"__MOVIES__ The sheriff was like a former rough rider or something- he used to hunt black people."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so why didn't that create tension throughout the film?"
"__MOVIES__ Because he didn't want any trouble. He had gone legit and was going to become a town's sheriff."
"__MOVIES__ So he was on Jackson's side? Yeah, it sounds like Jackson didn't really have any enemies."
