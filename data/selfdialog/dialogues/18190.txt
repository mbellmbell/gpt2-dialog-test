"__MOVIES__ Would you like to watch Under the Tuscan Sun?"
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie.  I have seen it several times."
"__MOVIES__ It is my all time favorite movie.  I watch it probably once a year."
"__MOVIES__ Diane Lane is the perfect Frances.  I would love to watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ Yes she is.  It is such a touching and simple movie, but it is very moving."
"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite scene?"
"__MOVIES__ That's tough; I like so many of them.  One of my favorites is when Frances has to ride out the bad thunderstorm alone in her new villa."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, when the washing machine is hit by lightning and then the owl flies in are pretty funny.  It's comic relief in the midst of the drama."
"__MOVIES__ I also really like it when Frances collapses on the floor in her new apartment.  She just gives up."
"__MOVIES__ I think we have all felt that way.  But she is able to pick herself back up and go on."
"__MOVIES__ Sandra Oh as Patti is enjoyable too.  She becomes the family that Frances needs."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I really like it when Martini, the realtor, tells Frances that she got everything she wished for."
"__MOVIES__ I love that part.  She did wish for a family and a wedding, and she got those."
"__MOVIES__ They weren't necessarily hers, but I think the movie showed that you can make a life and family for yourself even if you don't have blood relatives."
"__MOVIES__ I love the part when Pawel, played by Pawel Szajda, wants to marry the neighbor girl, and Frances tells her parents that she is Pawel's family."
"__MOVIES__ That is a great storyline.  All of the Polish men working on her house become her family."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, as do her other neighbors."
"__MOVIES__ The whole theme of making your own family is very moving."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that the movie is based on a travel book written by Frances Mayes?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the main character is loosely based on her life.  But the book is more like a travelogue and doesn't closely align with the movie."
