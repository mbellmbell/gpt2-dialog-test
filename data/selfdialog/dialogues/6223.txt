"__STAR_WARS__ So have you heard the theory about Rey?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You're going to have to be more specific; pretty much everyone has a theory about Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean the one where Obiwan is Rey's father."
"__STAR_WARS__ What? How would that work?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The idea is that Obiwan got married on Tatooine and then had Rey really close to the end of his time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know if that timeline works out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, she could be his grandchild then!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you want it to be Obiwan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The series has always been about a Kenobi and a Skywalker, imo. It'd be so much better to keep it that way than to make it about one family."
"__STAR_WARS__ And just have it be about friendship instead? I can see the merit in that, I guess."
