"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hey, Melanie and I are starting the Harry Potter series of movies. Care to join us?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you mean all of them?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, we were going to watch the first one The Sorcerers Stone tonight?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ There are a lot of movies but I could for sure be there to watch one at a time. That's a great idea!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, and we are both going to dress as our idea of Hermoine."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That sounds fun, I can do that. Maybe we could switch characters for every movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's a great idea. And make snacks to go along with the movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can do that. What should I bring?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well how about some kind of Halloween snack since it has that feast in the movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Great idea! I will make pumpkin cookies!"
