"__HORROR__ What Stephen King adaptation is your favorite horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ The Green Mile."
"__HORROR__ Try again, I don't consider that horror, even if it's the genre."
"__HORROR__ Umm, you go."
"__HORROR__ I really liked The Mist."
"__HORROR__ What's that about?"
"__HORROR__ A fog covers a town and huge inter-dimensional spiders invade."
"__HORROR__ WOAH, nice for arachnaphobists."
"__HORROR__ The best part is the ending: they kill themselves to not be killed by the spiders but the fog is so thick that they can't see the military help that arrives 30 seconds later."
"__HORROR__ Dang, that's intense! But thanks for ruining it."
