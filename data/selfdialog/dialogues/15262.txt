"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you like about Diagon Alley?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love that it's basically right next to the Muggle world, but invisible."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I kinda like that the bar is the secret entrance."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, it's not the only entrance."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What other entrance is there?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The floo network!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, right! Harry went to that creepy shop accidentally that way."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes! I just like that the magic folk have their own little city."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ With a ton of cool shops too, what's your favorite shop?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The Weasley brothers' shop of course!"
