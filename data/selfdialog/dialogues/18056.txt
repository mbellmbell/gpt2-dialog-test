"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the movie Leaving Las Vegas?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course!  That's definitely one of my favorite Nicholas Cage movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too!  And it was actually based off of a book."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I read the book.  The book is somewhat better than the movie, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it always is.  But the movie was a great rendition of the book."
"__MOVIES__ It makes me cry at the end!  I think Elizabeth Shue and Cage do a great job in their roles."
"__MOVIES__ They really do, and it portrays the tragedy of alcoholism and love so accurately."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, true.  Didn't it win some kind of awards?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it did but I can't say for sure.  Nicholas Cage has been in so many movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I know!  He's like Kevin Bacon."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wonder who has been in more?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I'm sure we could google it and find out."
"__MOVIES__ True.  Well, I might have to re-watch Leaving Las Vegas soon."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's definitely one to watch again and again."
"__MOVIES__ It's a little hard for me to sympathize with the characters because they are such lowlifes, but on the same token I feel pity for them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's what makes it such a beautiful movie I think."
"__MOVIES__ True.  It picks up on the tragedy of human life."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it has an unexpected ending."
"__MOVIES__ I love a good unexpected ending!  So many movies these days are so predictable."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  They don't make them like they used to."
