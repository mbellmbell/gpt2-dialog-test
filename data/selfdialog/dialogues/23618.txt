"__DISNEY__ Do you remember what that movie was called where the family gets shipwrecked on an island and builds a really cool treehouse?"

"__DISNEY__ Yes. It's a really old movie but I thought it was fun to watch how the family worked together to make the best of the situation."
"__DISNEY__ The carnival day where they all race on exotic animals they've found on the island was hilarious."
"__DISNEY__ But remember that also was the day the pirates landed and they had to defend their home."
"__DISNEY__ That was kind of scary but also very exciting."
