"__STAR_WARS__ So what's your favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd personally pick A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ The film that started it all. Can't blame you for that one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I appreciate that. So what's yours?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to go with Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ A classic. I'd say that the first three films are the three best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same here. The newer ones aren't too bad, either."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really enjoyed The Force Awakens. It felt like a breath of fresh air to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ I felt the same way, but somehow I enjoyed Rogue One just a bit more."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's all well and good. It was a great film too."
