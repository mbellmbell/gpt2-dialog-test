"__BASEBALL__ Did you hear that Derek Jeter is getting his number retired?"
"__BASEBALL__ No I didn't. When will that happen?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sunday night, before the game on ESPN."
"__BASEBALL__ That's the Yankees game, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Of course! Who else did he play for?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nobody else that I know of."
"__BASEBALL__ That's right. Just the guys in the pinstripes"
"__BASEBALL__ Didn't he play shortstop?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. And he won five gold gloves!"
"__BASEBALL__ He was an all-star also, wasn't he?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not only that, but he's a future hall-of-famer without a doubt."
"__BASEBALL__ This guy must have been the best Yankee to ever play."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, he is one of the best. The Yankees have a long list of all-time great players."
"__BASEBALL__ Like Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, MIickey Mantle, and Yogi Berra?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah! But none of those guys got more hits than Jeter. He's the all time hits leader for the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow! That's saying a lot! What about all of major league baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ He is sixth all time with 3,465 hits."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh my! Did he get more hits than Hank Aaron?"
"__BASEBALL__ Actually, no. Aaron got 3,771 hits, which is third-most all time."
"__BASEBALL__ That's no suprise to me. Hank Aaron hit so many home runs in his career."
