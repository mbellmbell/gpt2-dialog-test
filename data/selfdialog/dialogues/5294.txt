"__STAR_WARS__ Do you prefer the new Star wars, the old Star Wars or the ones in the middle?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the old star wars, Luke, Leai and Hans, are best."
"__STAR_WARS__ They had a good bit of story to dig into."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was the relationships, like Han and Leai, the slow burn into love."
"__STAR_WARS__ Their relationship really played out well, I was invested."
"__STAR_WARS__ The witty come back between the two always made me smile, like they really did like one another."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like that they came from world apart."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he was a bit of a scoundrel and her a princess, it was a wrong side of the tracks love."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the part when he was about to be frozen and she said she loved him."
"__STAR_WARS__ And he said, 'I know', got me everytime."
