"__MUSIC__ Do you like U2?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. Well some of their stuff is good, some is so-so."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite album?"
"__MUSIC__ I have to say The Joshua Tree. That's a classic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like that. But Achtung Baby is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? What song do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ 'One' is great. Just classic."
"__MUSIC__ OK, it was good, but overplayed. I prefer Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's good too. That album is full of great songs."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. I love Acrobat, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's an underrated gem, I think."
"__MUSIC__ But do you like Rattle and Hum."
"__MUSIC__ I liked it when it came out, but I got sick of it after a while."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. What about the latest album?"
"__MUSIC__ It's OK I guess. It just sounds pleasant but forgettable."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we're just too old and jaded."
"__MUSIC__ Nah man, it's Bono who's old."
"__MUSIC__ You make a good point. I do like their early albums better."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the Unforgettable Fire is a good one too."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, we're just nostalgic old geezers, aren't we?"
