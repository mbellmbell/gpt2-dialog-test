"__MOVIES__ What's going on?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, everyone is gathered by the screen."
"__MOVIES__ Is that a movie trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it is, what is it for?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't see from here."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I see it. It's the trailer for the Wonder Woman movie."
"__MOVIES__ She's finally getting a movie?!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, looks like it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I didn't think it would ever happen."
"__MOVIES__ You excited for it? It looks pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I've been excited for it for years!"
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ I never thought she would get one!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it certainly has taken a long time."
"__MOVIES__ The longest. Even Spiderman got his movies."
"__MOVIES__ Then he got reboots of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, I know. How stupid."
"__MOVIES__ For real, they all sucked too."
"__MOVIES__ They really did. I'm excited!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too!"
