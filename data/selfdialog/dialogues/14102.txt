"__BASKETBALL__ The Rockets are going to win the Finals this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ There is no chance of that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Because the Spurs exist."
"__BASKETBALL__ They are going to flip this series and come back."
"__BASKETBALL__ Even if they do they have to beat the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Durant is going to go down again and leave the window open for the Rockets."
"__BASKETBALL__ Even if that does happen the Warriors would still beat the Rockets."
"__BASKETBALL__ No way their bench is too weak."
"__BASKETBALL__ OK, lets say I agree.  What about the Cavs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well I think Lebron is wearing down."
"__BASKETBALL__ What tells you that? He has been the most dominant player in the playoffs clearly."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe, OK now I am just getting depressed."
"__BASKETBALL__ I didn't mean to do that but speaking of worn down have you seen Harden lately."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hey hey! Never doubt the beard."
"__BASKETBALL__ I am doubting the beard.  He looks exhausted."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah his usage is way too high."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly."
"__BASKETBALL__ OK so maybe I'm over confident."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe, you are 100% over confident.  No chance they win."
