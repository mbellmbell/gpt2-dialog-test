"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'Wonder Woman?'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  How about yourself?"
"__MOVIES__ I did.  I absolutely loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  Finally, we got a good DC movie."
"__MOVIES__ I was going to say the exact same.  Both 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman' were so underwhelming to me."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget 'Suicide Squad.'  DC is my favorite, and I love the heroes, but until this latest movie, all were bad."
"__MOVIES__ I think that this will set DC on the right path.  They now know what works."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite scene in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think when all the men in the trenches were backing away, but Diana moved onto No Man's Land to the battle."
"__MOVIES__ That scene gave me such chills."
"__MOVIES__ It was so empowering too, to watch a woman superhero."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I think it helped that the brilliant director Patty Jenkins is a woman."
"__MOVIES__ We need more women directors to helm these movies."
"__MOVIES__ We totally do.  I mean this movie was the highest-grossing live action film directed by a woman."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I had heard that they broke records."
"__MOVIES__ Also we should give credit where it's due.  The actors were terrific."
"__MOVIES__ Gal Gadot was an awesome lead."
"__MOVIES__ She was great as Wonder Woman, though Chris Pine stole the show as Steve."
"__MOVIES__ He has grown into such a terrific actor ever since his Star Trek days."
"__MOVIES__ You're right.  He keeps on improving with each role."
