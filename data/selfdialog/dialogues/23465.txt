"__DISNEY__ Okay, so Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first Disney movie to come out, but what was the first Disney Pixar movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I believe it was Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ That makes sense, I know that came out in 1995 because I was six years old."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that sounds about right and i for sure can't remember anything coming out made by Disney-Pixar before Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ Good point. I also remember it being three dimensional and innovative at the time."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I take that for granted now that three dimensional animation wasn't always a thing."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely a game changer."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely. The whole brand of Pixar is premised on that style of animation."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that's right, huh?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, regular Disney movies can be animated or non-animated in a number of ways. Pixar's movies tend to be three dimensional animation."
