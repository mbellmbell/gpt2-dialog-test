"__MUSIC__ I hate jumping on bandwagons."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well when a new show comes out and everyone loves it I don't want to love it too."
"__MUSIC__ You're turning into a hipster. What brings this up?"
"__MUSIC__ Dear Evan Hansen."
"__MUSIC__ My name's not Evan. What are you talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a musical that opened not long ago that the world is in love with."
"__MUSIC__ The whole world?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the Broadway world and some talk shows, and TIME. I think I might be in love with it too."
"__MUSIC__ And that's bugging you because you don't want to follow the fad?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. The trouble is though the music is really good!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm having a hard time feeling sympathy for you."
"__MUSIC__ And the lead. Ben Platt, he's amazing. His acting is deep and spot on."
"__MUSIC__ This sounds like something I should check out."
"__MUSIC__ You really should. The live performances I've seen from him on tv are amazing."
"__MUSIC__ What's so amazing about them?"
"__MUSIC__ He's just really raw. His voice is awesome but he's not flawless because the character wouldn't be."
"__MUSIC__ So he's really acting the songs instead of just singing pretty?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I saw a clip of him doing For Forever and it was stuck in my head for days."
"__MUSIC__ Hipster or not it sounds like you've joined the masses, friend."
