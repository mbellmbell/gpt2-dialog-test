"__MUSIC__ What song would you say summarizes your 20s?"
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of an odd question. Do you have a song that summarizes YOUR 20s?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, and one that summarizes my teenaged years too."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, you put quite a bit of thought into summarizing your own life in music!"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, now you make me sound like a weirdo! I think a lot of people do this."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm just giving you a hard time. Let me think here..."
"__MUSIC__ The song I'd choose for my 20s is 'How Soon is Now' by the Smiths."
"__MUSIC__ That is a great song. But a sad one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, my 20s weren't all that great, really."
"__MUSIC__ Sorry, man. At least your 30s seem to be going well."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, the music that would summarize my 30s would be quite a bit happier!"
"__MUSIC__ I think for me, I might choose 'Feeling Good', Nina Simone version."
"__MUSIC__ I guess your 20s were a lot better than mine, then."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe that's overly optimistic a take, but I really love that song."
"__MUSIC__ It's a wonderful song. So many artists have covered it and done really cool versions."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever hear the version that the band Muse did of it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what's it like."
"__MUSIC__ It's more of a thrash or punk or at least hard rock version. It was pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine I'd like the Nina Simone version bettter."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I do too, but the Muse version was neat as well."
