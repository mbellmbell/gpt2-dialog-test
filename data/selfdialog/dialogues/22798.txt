"__DISNEY__ I started reading the book The Black Cauldron is based on today."
"__DISNEY__ You did? Is it any good."
"__DISNEY__ It's so-so. Very fantasy pulp."
"__DISNEY__ Well, it was used to make a children's movie."
"__DISNEY__ The book is a lot slower. I guess it's a series, and The Black Cauldron is the first two books."
"__DISNEY__ They do cover a lot of ground with that movie."
"__DISNEY__ It's unusual that I like the movie better than the book, but I think that might be the case."
"__DISNEY__ That happened to me with The Hunchback of Notre Dame."
"__DISNEY__ The original is better?"
"__DISNEY__ Much better. And much sadder."
