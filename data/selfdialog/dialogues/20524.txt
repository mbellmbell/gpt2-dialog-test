"__MOVIES__ Do you want to go see Beauty and The Beast this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it last week, but I'd love to see it again."
"__MOVIES__ Is it really that good?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! The imagery is breathtaking!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard it was really good, and I just love Emma Watson."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
"__MOVIES__ Was it comparable to the cartoon version?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually think it was even better."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow. I can't wait."
"__MOVIES__ I'm happy they waited until they had the technology to redo this one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, if they had done it even 2 years ago, it would be clunky and silly."
"__MOVIES__ For sure!"
"__MOVIES__ So how does the Beast look after he transforms?"
"__MOVIES__ Don't you want to wait to see the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm just curious if he's actually cute, because in the cartoon, he looked kind of like a tool."
"__MOVIES__ So you preferred him a Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I preferred Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Well, all I'll say is that it is REALLY similar to the cartoon."
