"__MUSIC__ Hey, Maxwell, I have a music question for you."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, Enrique, let's hear it."
"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite member of the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a good question.  I love the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ I know you do, that's why I asked you!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I know that most people would vote for either John or Paul, but not me."
"__MUSIC__ Don't tell me that Ringo is your favorite!"
"__MUSIC__ Ha, ha, of course not.  Don't be silly!"
"__MUSIC__ Whew, you dodged a bullet there! So your favorite is George?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, good old George Harrison."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you choose George?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I just appreciate George's attitude."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ He was a brilliant guitar player, and an excellent song writer, but he kinda stepped back and didn't interfere with the chemistry of the band."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting thought there, I do enjoy listening to his guitar work."
"__MUSIC__ Same here, he also has a pretty good singing voice."
"__MUSIC__ Did he sing much with the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ He sang some, but again Paul and John got most of the attention. You should listen to some of his solo work."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to check it out.  Thanks for the answers!"
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome, enjoy some George Harrison today!"
