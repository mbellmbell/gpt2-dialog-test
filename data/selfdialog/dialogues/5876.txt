"__STAR_WARS__ Are you excited to see the New Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was not a fan of the last one."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did not like the story."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it showed how the good guys got the plans."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, but we already knew what happen to them."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean in the older movies when they say the brave people all died to protect the plans."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, it was pointless."
