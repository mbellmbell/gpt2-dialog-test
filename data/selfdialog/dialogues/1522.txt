"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I pretty much like anything except new country and rap."
"__MUSIC__ What do you consider new country?"
"__MUSIC__ Anything that came out after the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ So basically anything pre Garth Brooks."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly!"
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that.  I guess he was the first major cross over."
"__MUSIC__ It's all just too poppy now."
"__MUSIC__ It is hard to tell if it's country or pop anymore."
"__MUSIC__ It's like they came up with a particular formula and just ran with it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think we will ever get back to real country?"
"__MUSIC__ Not as long as the pop country is popular."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good name for it, pop country."
"__MUSIC__ I miss Willie and Waylon being on the charts."
"__MUSIC__ Those guys are legends.  I don't think we will ever see musicians of that caliber again."
"__MUSIC__ I can't argue with that."
"__MUSIC__ It seems like no one can come up with anything original anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe it's all been done already"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. I think the next Waylon is out there someone waiting to be discovered."
"__MUSIC__ Let's hope."
