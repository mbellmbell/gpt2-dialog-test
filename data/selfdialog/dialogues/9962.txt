"__COMEDY__ Have you seen Why Him?"
"__COMEDY__ That's the James Franco movie with Zoey Deutch and Bryan Cranston right?"
"__COMEDY__ That's the movie. I watched it yesterday and thought it was pretty funny."
"__COMEDY__ What was it about because I love the actors in there."
"__COMEDY__ It's a simple modern comedy. Zoey is off in college and makes a new boyfriend, James Franco. Her father played by Bryan Cranston, is unaware of her new boyfriend until he unexpectedly gets a surprise revealing she has a boyfriend."
"__COMEDY__ I can imagine the crazy scene, James Franco is so off the wall especially in comedies. I still laugh at his role in Pineapple Express and Your Highness."
"__COMEDY__ Oh you won't forget that scene! Basically Zoey's family decides to take a trip out to Palo Alto to visit her and that's when the fun begins, because they get to stay at James house and all the shenanigans happen."
"__COMEDY__ Is James' character a student too?"
"__COMEDY__ No he plays a super rich billionaire founder for a video game company, so he basically has endless resources to spend to try to impress Zoey's family who happen to be very conservative."
"__COMEDY__ This sounds hilarious. I remember the interviews I watched and some clips, thinking this is going to be great fun. I'll have to check out Why Him."
