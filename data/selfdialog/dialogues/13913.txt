"__BASKETBALL__ Watch the Warriors last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, they didn't play that well, but got the win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, it wasn't that hard with Leonard out for the Spurs, and Parker already gone for the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ And to add to that for San Antonio, David Lee got hurt during the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ One more win and Golden State gets a rematch with Cleveland."
"__BASKETBALL__ Boy, the Cavaliers have been unbelievable."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, even Kevin Love is playing great and Thompson on the boards."
"__BASKETBALL__ And, of course there's always Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the Warriors aren't to shabby either when you add in Kevin Durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ He had a great game yesterday, and what about McGee--he's becoming a force."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but he gets tired easily and I don't think he knows the defensive rotations that well."
"__BASKETBALL__ But I think he's a lot better than Pachulia."
"__BASKETBALL__ What about Pachulia and hurting Leonard's ankle--did you think it was a dirty play?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't, but everyone else thinks it was.  Look he's a clumsy guy and stumbled in.  I don't think he has the skill to make that play intentionally."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he hurt his own player, Durant, by falling into him earlier in the year."
"__BASKETBALL__ And no one mentions that Leonard was hurt already and then earlier in the game he sprained the ankle by landing on one of his own bench players."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, anyway, if things keep going as they are, it will be quite a series between the Cavaliers and the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ It looks like it--doesn't look as if Boston or San Antonio will win a game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I'll be rooting for the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me, too; I think they can do it if Klay Thompson gets going."
