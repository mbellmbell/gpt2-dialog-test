"__STAR_WARS__ Are you going to see the new star wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably not."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I haven't seen the last one, so I would be lost."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well go see the last one then, they are cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't like the new characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ You would like them if you saw the movie, Luke Skywalker has a daughter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh really? I didn't know that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea the new girl is his daughter, and Luke will probably start to play a really big role."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that is pretty cool. I'll go watch it then."
