"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite female singer?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that would be Amy Lee. You heard of her, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes of course. The lead singer of Evanescence."
"__MUSIC__ I absolutely adore her voice. It's so beautiful and haunting."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard anything about her in a while though. Did she take a break from making music?"
"__MUSIC__ She did have a break, as she became a mother and had to focus on that for a bit. But she's actually just released a new song recently."
"__MUSIC__ What's the song called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Love Exists. It's a bit different than her other material, but still very beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to search for it and give it a listen."
"__MUSIC__ It's actually an English cover of Francesca Michielin's song called 'L'amore esiste'."
"__MUSIC__ Who is Francesca Michielin?"
"__MUSIC__ She's an Italian singer-songwriter. She won the fifth series of the Italian talent show X Factor."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. Amy Lee usually writes her own songs."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, but she heard the song while working on a project in Italy and loved it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah sounds like the song was quite special if she wanted to make it her own."
"__MUSIC__ Evanescence is actually working on a new album as well."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds great. When is it expected to be released?"
"__MUSIC__ This fall. It's called Synthesis and it will feature some of the new tracks combined with some of the older ones."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, so basically a synergy of the present and the past."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's basically the idea behind it. Should be interesting to hear it once it's released."
