"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football season is starting back up soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh joy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I take it you don't like football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's put it this way.  The Superbowl could be played in our backyard and I would still not watch it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch.  It's a cool sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool??  A bunch of guys running around and tackling each other just to get a ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they get touchdowns, fans cheer and they win games and if they're really good they can make millions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's another thing.  How are they paid so much?  It's ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They bring in the money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So??  They make more in one year than a lot of more deserving people combined"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not about who deserves what.  It's the excitement of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't it all the same after awhile??  Get the ball, run, tackle, touchdown, kick..repeat"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh and I suppose baseball is better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't say that.  I just find football really boring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's so unpredictable though.  Who will win, who will get hurt, will there be a fight?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can watch Survivor if you want that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some of these players are amazing though.  Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Joe Montana AKA The Comeback Kid"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least you didn't say OJ Simpson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he was a hell of a player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not convinced, sorry."
