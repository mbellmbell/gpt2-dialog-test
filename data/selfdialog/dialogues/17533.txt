"__MOVIES__ Okay, what is your favorite genre of action movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say crime thrillers, particularly shoot'em ups."
"__MOVIES__ ALirhgt give me some expamples of what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Scarface for one."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that's a decent example, bit more drama than action, but only just. How about another?"
"__MOVIES__ The Punisher movie, that's defintiely a shoot'em up."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, but which one? The 2004 one or the 1989 version."
"__MOVIES__ Both, and the sequel to 2004, Punisher: Warzone."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, that's supposed to be more of a reboot than a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Who cares?"
"__MOVIES__ Got me there, so what's another good shoot'em movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Shoot'em from 2007 definitely fits the bill."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, kind of literally. Any other movies you can think of?"
"__MOVIES__ Smokin Aces and Smokin Aces 2: Assassin's Ball, for example."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, another two for the genre, but what about the Untouchables?"
"__MOVIES__ Decent amount of shooting, but more of a plain old gangster film."
"__MOVIES__ You might be right there, can you think of any more shoot'em ups?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the Young Guns can fit the bill, but personally the sequel stank?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was kind of unnessecary and poorly thought out."
"__MOVIES__ It was at that, wasn't it?"
