"__MOVIES__ Hey! Did you get around to seeing Manchester by the Sea?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god, I did! It was brutally sad! Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I did even though I was crying through the whole thing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I didn't really like it because it was so sad."
"__MOVIES__ But that's the beauty of it!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'm just not a sad movies type of person. I prefer comedies."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Casey Affleck did a really good job in it."
"__MOVIES__ I did too."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad he won the Oscar for it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh he did? I didn't realize."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he did! I also loved that it was set close to Boston."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you don't see a lot of movies set in Boston."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the soundtrack?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was good! Definitely made it more sad though."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. That scene in the police station is brutal."
"__MOVIES__ I know! What did you think of the ending?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean it wasn't totally satisfying but I think that's the point."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I was pretty disappointed by it."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like you like movies with really happy endings."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, which is why Manchester by the Sea wasn't really for me."
