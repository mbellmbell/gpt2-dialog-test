"__ROCK__ What do you think about Madonna?"
"__ROCK__ She had some good songs in the 90s, like Ray of Light."
"__ROCK__ I actually saw her in concert in the late 90s."
"__ROCK__ I would have liked to see that. I wouldn't pay to see any concert of hers today, though."
"__ROCK__ Why not?"
"__ROCK__ It's just not the same anymore. I think her glory days were the 80s and 90s."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, seeing Madonna perform now wouldn't be the same."
"__ROCK__ I have some of her CDs."
"__ROCK__ I actually have cassettes still going back to the mid-80s."
"__ROCK__ You're one of her old super-fans!"
