"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, haven't talked to you in awhile!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know man, sorry I've been so busy with work."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh trust me I know that all too well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How have you been?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I've been great! Had a few days off and was able to catch some movies with the wife."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ See anything good?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes we watched Split last night."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Never heard of it!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh man, it's a crazy bizarre movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's about a guy with tons of personalities who kidnaps some teenage girls."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh I think I saw something about that, like they have to figure out his personalities to escape."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes! It's really creepy and a little controversial."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ In what ways?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There's some abuse and I guess mental illness stigmas."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I bet it is thought provoking though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh for sure! It has some very taboo issues in it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I like movies like that because as a culture it gets us talking."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes I think that was sort of the intent of the movie was to get us talking about issues we don't talk about enough."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well I'm definitely going to have to put that movie on my watch list!"
