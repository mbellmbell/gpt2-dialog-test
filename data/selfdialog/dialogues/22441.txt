"__DISNEY__ So I just saw Mulan. That movie was epic!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad you liked it. It was about time Disney set one of their movies in China."
"__DISNEY__ So was the movie based on a true historical story?"
"__DISNEY__ Most likely not. A lot of ancient Chinese legends are highly embellished to begin with. And to top it off Disney didn't even follow the source material very closely."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean? Mulan didn't actually dress up as a guy to fight the Huns?"
"__DISNEY__ Well she did, but the original had a lot more going on, and, to be honest, the original did not have a happy ending."
"__DISNEY__ Well, then it makes sense that Disney decided to change the plot. You can't movie a movie about empowering girls only to end it on a tragic note."
"__DISNEY__ Indeed, I'm not going to criticize Disney for exercising creative license here."
"__DISNEY__ So what was your favorite part of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ The Mulan Szechuan Sauce Mc'Donald's put out to celebrate the release. Don't laugh, that sauce changed my life."
