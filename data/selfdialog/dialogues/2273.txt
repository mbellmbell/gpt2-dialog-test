"__MUSIC__ Have you ever thought about what music you'd like played at your funeral or wake?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a terribly dark thought to have!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but it's something I bet a lot of people have thought about."
"__MUSIC__ I never have. If I'm dead, music is going to be the last thing I worry about."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'd like a lot of really happy music to be played. To cheer people up."
"__MUSIC__ But think about this - What if almost no one shows up? Now it's even sadder, this empty funeral and this really upbeat music playing."
"__MUSIC__ Now who's having dark thoughts? Besides, I still think happy music would be the best thing."
"__MUSIC__ What songs would you pick?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Happy' by Pharell Williams, for one. 'Don't Worry, Be Happy', for another."
"__MUSIC__ So you're taking the happy thing very literally."
"__MUSIC__ I was mostly joking. But I do think that happy music at a funeral or wake is the way to go."
"__MUSIC__ I think it would be jarring and out of place. If people are feeling very sad, they don't want to hear some peppy, up beat music."
"__MUSIC__ So you'd play depressing music at your funeral, then?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't be playing ANY music, because I'd be dead. And I wouldn't plan something like that ahead of time."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you better not let me DJ your wake, because I'd be playing nothing but Beach Boys songs."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe we're having this conversation."
"__MUSIC__ I've actually never been to a funeral where any music other than maybe religious/classical stuff was being played."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither. Because most people aren't really focused on music at times like those."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they should be!"
"__MUSIC__ I don't agree. And I don't think happy music is approriate at a time like that."
