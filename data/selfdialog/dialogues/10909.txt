"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for the NFL season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I'm interested to see what happens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team do you want to watch the most?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want to watch the Rams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a big Rams fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I want to watch them lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you want to watch them lose?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The ownership is a pathetic excuse for existence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They left a city in LA for St. Louis, signed a deal that would allow them to leave, and then fleeced St. Louis for the stadium costs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, wasn't that a business decision'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it was and it left the city of St. Louis with the cost of a stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but now LA has their team back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and they are terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they could get better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they can, the ownership and management is pathetic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't know anything about football, they just bleed their cities for money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is too bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is terrible, I don't dislike the players, but that ownership should lose a bunch of money of the team continues to perform poorly."
