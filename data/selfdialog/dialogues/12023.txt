"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, I just heard that Sammy met Peyton Manning the other day. Have you ever met any NFL players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I lived in Dallas, Texas for about 10 years, so I ran into a few of the Cowboys players from time to time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about some of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, to begin with there was Roger Staubach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You met him in Dallas? I thought he retired a long time ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He retired, but he still lives in the Dallas area."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how did you meet him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, it was a bit of a fluke. My friend and I were at lunch one day in the town of Addison and we passed Roger on the street."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was he doing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Roger Staubach has a big real estate presence north of Dallas, which is where Addison is located. He was visiting one of his properties and nearly ran into us while walking on the sidewalk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you say anything to him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not much, we just both looked at each other, realized who it was, and said 'Hello' to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else did you meet in Dallas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, there was this one time when we had lunch in the same restaurant as Troy Aikman. He was sitting at the table across the aisle from us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was just sitting there in the middle of a restaurant?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he was. It was a P. F. Chang's and he was eating lunch with someone who was an obvious business partner or attorney."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you say anything to Troy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, we didn't say much. I don't like to bother celebrities because I understand they are just people like I am."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, so you didn't say much. But what did you say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Once again, I was with the same friend. We just looked across the aisle and he looked back at us and we all just said 'Hi.'"
