"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard of nu metal?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  What's that and how's it different from other metal?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, essentially its metal, but the bands will often include elements from other genres of music."
"__MUSIC__ Could you elaborate on that?"
"__MUSIC__ For example, a band might play typical instruments and have a hip hop style disc jockey."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds interesting.  Can you give me an example?"
"__MUSIC__ I think the Deftones are considered nu metal.  Have you heard of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, yes, I have heard of them.  I have their album Around the Fur."
"__MUSIC__ I have that album too.  What's your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ The album's title song is probably the best."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite song is Battle-Axe, but it's on a different album."
"__MUSIC__ Which album?  Maybe I would like it."
"__MUSIC__ It's on their self titled album, Deftones.  You probably would like it."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'll actually go buy that right now."
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking about shopping for new music as well, do you want to accompany me to the store?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, that sounds great.  I could use some new material to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a preference on music stores?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really."
"__MUSIC__ I know the owner of a shop downtown and he'll probably give us a small discount."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome.  Good music plus a discount, let's go!"
