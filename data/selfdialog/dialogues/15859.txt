"__ROCK__ I heard that U2 is on tour this summer."
"__ROCK__ U2?! Are they still around."
"__ROCK__ Of course they are. Still rockin' after 35-40 years."
"__ROCK__ That's amazing. I would love to see a U2 concert again. It's been a while."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I once saw them live in the '80s."
"__ROCK__ It's been almost that long for me too. Where are they playing?"
"__ROCK__ MetLife Stadium in NJ on June 28."
"__ROCK__ I'm sure it's sold out."
"__ROCK__ I don't know. Ticketmaster is still advertising it."
"__ROCK__ Maybe I'll check it out. I'd love to get my hands on some U2 tickets."
