"__BEATLES__ So, are you a Beatles fan?"
"__BEATLES__ Not really.  I've never understood what was so great about them."
"__BEATLES__ Part of their 'legacy' is realizing what else was going on in music at the time."
"__BEATLES__ Like doo wop, girl groups, Elvis, and leftover Sinatra-type of songs?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes.  The Beatles moved pop/rock music away from that lighter 'bubble gum' sound, and went back to its roots.  Latching on to the rhythm and blues coming from artists like Chuck Berry and other less famous (but just as talented) black musicians, the Beatles then moved the sound into exciting new directions."
"__BEATLES__ But, really, isn't it just simple 3 and 4 chord rock songs?"
"__BEATLES__ That is part of what made them great.  If you play any instrument, you should look for transcriptions of Beatles songs and play along.  Even the simple songs use unexpected chord structures that, although they sound simple, give the music added sonic depth."
"__BEATLES__ What songs would you suggest I listen to?"
"__BEATLES__ With the Beatles, you're better off listening to full albums.  They were putting out music at a time when a great deal of care went into crafting an album in a way that the songs built one on the other to make something greater than the individual parts.  Try the albums 'Revolver' or 'Rubber Soul'."
"__BEATLES__ Ok.  I'll give the Beatles another try."
