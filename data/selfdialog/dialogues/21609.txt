"__DISNEY__ Oh my god the first 15 minutes of UP is the most emotional I've ever been watching a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah Ellie and Carl's relationship was just the best."
"__DISNEY__ You know they should make a prequel to up that showcased Ellie and Carl's adventures when they were growing up."
"__DISNEY__ I mean they kind of alluded to that and they actually did show a little bit."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but I could watch a whole movie about it!"
"__DISNEY__ Wouldn't it change your perspective now that you know that Charles Muntz is the bad guy?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm, maybe it would a little but I bet that Disney could find a way around that."
"__DISNEY__ I think I'd like to see a sequel but with Russell as the father and he has a child of his own now."
"__DISNEY__ They should make the child a little girl!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that'd be cool! And they could flashback to lessons and memories that he had with Carl."
