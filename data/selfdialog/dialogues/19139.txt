"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Moana?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  I took my kids to see it."
"__MOVIES__ How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ For a kids movie it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the songs?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the main song about how she wanted to go out on the water.  That is probably going to be the song that will be up for an award."
"__MOVIES__ I took my kids to see it too.  They wanted me to look up the song on youtube after we got home."
"__MOVIES__ Did they play it over and over?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh yes.  I am so tired of it now."
"__MOVIES__ Does this make your kids want to go see more movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they saw the preview for Cars 3 and now they are very excited to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Have they seen the other two?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  We own both of those and they have watched them a bunch."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we could take our kids together to see it when it comes out?"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds good."
"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of any other movies coming out that would be good for kids or adults?"
"__MOVIES__ I hate to admit it but I love the Transformers movies.  I want to go see The Last Knight."
"__MOVIES__ The special effects of those movies are awesome but the plots and acting always seem kind of dumb."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly how I feel.  But I love the action and Optimus Prime's voice."
"__MOVIES__ Gotta go.  See you later."
