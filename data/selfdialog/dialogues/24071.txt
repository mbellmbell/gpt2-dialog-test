"__SUPERHERO__ What's your favorite superhero movie man?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Hands down Doctor Strange. I love Benedict Cumberbatch."
"__SUPERHERO__ Good choice man, but I'd have to pick Guardians of the Galaxy 2. Both movies have really great visuals though."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah dude, I've seen them both. The special effects for both movies were amazing!"
"__SUPERHERO__ So, any superhero movies you looking forward to?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Honestly, if you haven't seen the trailer for Black Panther, watch it now. That movie is going to be sick!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Already have man! Personally, I can't wait for them to come out with the Justice League movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree too man, Wonder Woman was great. I haven't really liked many DC movies, but after Wonder Woman, I feel like they're going in a good direction."
"__SUPERHERO__ Nothing beats Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Batman trilogy man, have you forgotten about that?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Of course not, but that was years ago! Christian Bale will always be a better Batman than Ben Affleck."
