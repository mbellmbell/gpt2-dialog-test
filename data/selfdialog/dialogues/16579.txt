"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch 'Avatar the Last Airbender?'"
"__MOVIES__ You mean the TV Show?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the movie adaptation by M. Night Shyamalan."
"__MOVIES__ I did, and I completely regret it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  What an awful movie adaptation."
"__MOVIES__ Totally.  The acting was so poor."
"__MOVIES__ And the writing and pacing were awful."
"__MOVIES__ They also deviated so far from the original series in some aspects."
"__MOVIES__ Which is crazy because the original source material is so good.  Why fix what isn't broken?"
"__MOVIES__ The original series was a fun, light-hearted adventure that grew in intensity and evolved as time went on."
"__MOVIES__ Meanwhile, this version took out all the fun and made it gloomy and boring."
"__MOVIES__ Who were the actors in this?"
"__MOVIES__ Noah Ringer was cast as Aang, apparently because of his martial arts abilities."
"__MOVIES__ Which I think were amazing, but he did not have enough acting experience for that lead role."
"__MOVIES__ I did think Dev Patel was good though as Zuko."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I like that actor too.  He was in 'Slumdog Millionaire' right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  He was also in the movie 'Lion.'"
"__MOVIES__ What is that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a boy who got lost in India as a child, and adopted by Australian parents.  Years later, he tracks down his biological family through Google."
"__MOVIES__ Wow.  That's a movie I'd actually like to see."
