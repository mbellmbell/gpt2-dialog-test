"__MUSIC__ I heard a really great soundtrack today."
"__MUSIC__ What was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Take a good guess."
"__MUSIC__ Uh, okay.  Schindler's List?"
"__MUSIC__ Way off.  It's actually La La Land."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I heard that's a winner."
"__MUSIC__ Most definitely.  Have you heard it?"
"__MUSIC__ Just from the movie is all."
"__MUSIC__ You should give it a listen.  So many great songs."
"__MUSIC__ What's the best, that City of Stars song?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, most popular, but not the best."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so what's your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I think the pinnacle of the album is Someone in the Crowd."
"__MUSIC__ What's that one about?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the song you hear while she's getting ready for the party."
"__MUSIC__ Around the beginning of the movie?"
"__MUSIC__ More or less, but anyway, it's the best song."
"__MUSIC__ You should burn me a copy of it and I'll give it a listen."
"__MUSIC__ I will do that if you like."
"__MUSIC__ Appreciate it.  I need to hear some good music!"
