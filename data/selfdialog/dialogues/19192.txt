"__MOVIES__ I can't remember the last time I actually sat down to watch a movie."
"__MOVIES__ You mean at home?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I mean, we have Netflix. But I meant in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! Well it's so expensive these days."
"__MOVIES__ What was the last film you saw in the theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ The last movie I saw at the theater was Moon."
"__MOVIES__ I can't say I've ever heard of Moon."
"__MOVIES__ It was really bizarre."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ That's just it-- it only had two actors! Kevin Spacey and Sam Rockwell."
"__MOVIES__ Both really talented guys!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but Kevin Spacey just voices a robot. Rockwell is the star of the show."
"__MOVIES__ So what happens in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't want to give it away, but it's totally trippy."
"__MOVIES__ Trippy how? Like A Clockwork Orange?"
"__MOVIES__ A little, but it almost plays more like a horror in some ways. Very desolate."
"__MOVIES__ Would you recommend it?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! It's not really a traditional space movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to look into it!"
"__MOVIES__ You should. The score is great, too."
