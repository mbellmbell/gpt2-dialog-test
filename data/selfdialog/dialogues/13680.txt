"__BASKETBALL__ Are you watching the NBA playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I can't believe the Cavaliers are sweeping their way through the East."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think any team can stop them?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the only team that has a chance in the East is Boston."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think so too. Isaiah Thomas is putting on quite a performance."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about the Western Conference?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm a big fan of the San Antonio Spurs, but they're having a bit of trouble with the Houston Rockets."
"__BASKETBALL__ How about the Golden State Warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Hopefully the Spurs can give them a hard time. They're just such a good team."
"__BASKETBALL__ How are you supposed to stop that team?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Especially since they picked up Kevin Durant in the off-season last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's starting to look like another Finals rematch."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I think in the end we're going to see the Warriors play the Cavaliers again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think is gonna take it all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Warriors are gonna win this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ How come?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think if you compare the teams side by side, the Warriors are just better in almost every way."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think LeBron can give them a run for their money. He's carried Cleveland before."
"__BASKETBALL__ There's only one way to find out."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can't wait for the Finals!"
