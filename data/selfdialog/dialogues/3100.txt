"__MUSIC__ Do you remember the group that Justin Timberlake was in?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, NSync."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I couldn't remember the name.  When did they break up?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was back in the early 2000's."
"__MUSIC__ So, they were active in the late 90's right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so."
"__MUSIC__ Who were the other guys in that group?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, there was Chris, Lance, Joey, and JC."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah.  Which one is the guy that hosts all those shows now?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Joey.  I know I've seen him hosting a lot of shows lately."
"__MUSIC__ Are any of them still involved in music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  Timberlake definately is, but I don't know about the other guys."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, so they just broke up and went their separate ways?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what it seems like."
"__MUSIC__ Besides Timberlake, none of them really seems to be in the public eye."
"__MUSIC__ Well, like I said, Joey still does hosting gigs.  Lance had a radio show."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but Justin still puts out music, acts, and does all kinds of stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's true."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if they'll ever get back together."
"__MUSIC__ I doubt that.  The closest that came was the MTV thing a few years ago."
