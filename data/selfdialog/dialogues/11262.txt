"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots are going to be the best team again this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i have to agree with you, nobody is better than Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love their additions this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the best pick-up was Brandon Cooks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cooks gives them an added speed dimension they haven't had since Randy Moss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People also forget they are getting Gronk back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unbelievable, that they were able to win the Super Bowl without Gronk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's almost like they're adding the best tight end in the league as a free agent.  He missed most of the year last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love watching Gronk play - he's unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A total mismatch at tight end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We're forgetting they haven't lost anyone good and they upgraded at running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, Gillisee is an upgrade over Blount."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gillisee is a well rounded player, he can catch, he's big and he can block."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You forgot, a healthy Dion Lewis is a mismatch at times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also like Burkhead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be willing to be that they will move him all over the formation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are so loaded on offense, they're 3rd stringers would start for most teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possible they go 16-0 this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We forgot to mention Belicheck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The greats coach in NFL history."
