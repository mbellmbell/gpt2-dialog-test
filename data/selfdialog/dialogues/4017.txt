"__MUSIC__ I do too. I don't know what I like better August and Everything , Recovering Satellites, or The Desert Life."
"__MUSIC__ Eek, I couldn't pick if I had to...Long December makes me so sad and nostalgic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that music makes me think of California."
"__MUSIC__ I really like Recovering Satellites. But I can't believe it was 1996!"

"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I just can't believe it. There is a lot of stuff out there."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but there is a lot I am not loving."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. I think that's why I listen to mostly the same stuff."
