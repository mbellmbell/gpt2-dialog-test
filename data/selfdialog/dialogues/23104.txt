"__DISNEY__ Have you heard that Disney is doing a remake of Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but I can't believe that they're not including any songs!"
"__DISNEY__ I know! What is Mulan with 'Reflection' or 'Honor to Us All'?"
"__DISNEY__ And don't forget 'I'll Make a Man Out of You' by Donny Osmond!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah, that one's fun to sing along with."
"__DISNEY__ I also heard that they are removing the love interest with Shang."
"__DISNEY__ Like, they won't even have his character?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, but I think that's what I heard."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that's crazy. Will this even be the same story line? What about Mushu?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't heard about that. Hopefully they keep him!"
