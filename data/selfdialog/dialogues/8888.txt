"__BEATLES__ I read yesterday was the 50th anniversay of the Beatle's song 'All You Need Is Love.'"
"__BEATLES__ Wow, that was a long time ago. It makes you realize how fast time flies."
"__BEATLES__ 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' is also having a 50th anniversary."
"__BEATLES__ I think even more people relate to that because it was in a movie in the 70s."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yes, I remember that. The Gibb brothers were awesome."
"__BEATLES__ I think they are great singers, and I liked this better than their disco."
"__BEATLES__ The disco was kind of funny, but I liked this movie because of this really great song, Strawberry Fields Forever."
"__BEATLES__ That song gave me chills when they sang it."
"__BEATLES__ I know, I think I had a few tears during that."
"__BEATLES__ It's no wonder people still like the Beatle's music after 50 years."
