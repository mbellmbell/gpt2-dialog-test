"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Bring Out the Dead?"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that the one with Nicholas Cage?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Patricia Arquette"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it was a really long time ago."
"__MOVIES__ I just caught it on TV last night. It made me think of you."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was difficult to watch in places."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that you told me that you used to be a paramedic in Detroit."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah about ten years ago. It definitely wasn't easy."
"__MOVIES__ Did you identify with anything in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, especially about taking the people you couldn't save with you."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ When you can't save someone, there is a lot of guilt that goes along with that."
"__MOVIES__ But it's really not your fault......"
"__MOVIES__ I know, but still......"
"__MOVIES__ There was a lot of comedic moments in the movie though"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that definitely helped lighten the mood for me"
"__MOVIES__ I don't really like Nicholas Cage in most things, but I think that this was his best performance!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree, he's a great actor, but maybe his movies aren't usually my speed."
"__MOVIES__ I hear that it won a few awards."
"__MOVIES__ I think it deserves it. I was a good, pretty well balanced film."
