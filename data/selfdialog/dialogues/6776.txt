"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, are you going to see the new Star Wars movie this December?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it looks really good, i think."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I watched the trailer last month and it got me really excited about it. I hope we find out who Rey's parents are."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have any theories?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Um, I'm leaning toward Luke being her dad, but I dunno. That seems too obvious."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I read an article online about her being a Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?? That sounds cool. That would make Obi Wan Kenobi her grandfather?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Something like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, now i'm really excited to find out when the movie comes out. Let's go see it together!"
