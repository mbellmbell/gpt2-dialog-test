"__BASEBALL__ Did you see that Derek Jeter had his number retired the other day?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah! Wasn't it Saturday night at Yankee stadium?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yup, I was there with my family, the Yankees dedicated a plaque for him too."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm so jealous! I used to love watching Derek play."
"__BASEBALL__ Same here, but I don't think he's the greatest Yankee player to play the game."
"__BASEBALL__ C'mon are you serious?!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah dude lol Derek Jeter only had 260 home runs his entire career..."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok so what's your point?"
"__BASEBALL__ Babe Ruth had 714 home runs, you just can't compare the two."
"__BASEBALL__ You certainly can. Derek Jeter was a 14x Allstar player, Babe Ruth was only a 2x Allstar player."
"__BASEBALL__ Hmm but Babe Ruth was a 7x World Series Champion."
"__BASEBALL__ Derek Jeter was a 5x World Series Champion and won the Golden Glove 5x."
"__BASEBALL__ Look man I'm not disagreeing with you but Derek Jeter will never be on the same level of Babe Ruth."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess only history will tell."
"__BASEBALL__ History has already spoken, I've never seen Derek Jeter hit 4 home runs in a single game."
"__BASEBALL__ Your telling me you saw Babe Ruth hit 4 home runs in a single game?"
"__BASEBALL__ No I wasn't alive back then but it's documented that he did."
"__BASEBALL__ I still think Babe Ruth is over rated, baseball has changed so much since he played."
"__BASEBALL__ Whatever dude. Derek Jeter isn't even in the Hall of Fame."
"__BASEBALL__ Not yet, he's certainly going to be inducted though."
