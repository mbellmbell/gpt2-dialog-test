"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you heard of the Cowboys 2016 draft pick Jaylon Smith before?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The name sounds familiar but I can remember."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a stand out linebacker for Notre Dame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know who you are talking about. Didn't something happen to him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it did. He suffered what many people thought was a career ending injury in his last game as a college player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. What type of injury was it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A knee injury. I am not completely sure but I know he had nerve damage so there was a lot of concern about his future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds bad. Why would the Cowboys draft him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well without the injury Jaylon would have probably been drafted in the top five but when the Cowboys second pick came up he was still available and they took a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah! A big chance. That seems like a huge gamble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys had their personal team doctor look at his knee and he was confident it could be repaired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds promising. So that was two years ago, how is he doing now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His surgery and rehab went great and he is now practicing with the team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good but what is he saying about his knee?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is saying it feels great. One-hundred percent and he expects to be out on the field this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you seen him practice? Does he look sluggish?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all. There have been several videos posted online of him working out and practicing and he looks quick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it sounds like he will be able to come in and make an impact immediately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys need a pass rusher badly and Jaylon look like he might fit the bill perfectly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. If this gamble pays off and the Cowboys end up with a top ten pass rusher it would be one of the biggest draft steals ever."
