"__DISNEY__ I love your Moana t-shirt! Did you love that movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, even my boys love to watch it and they already know all of the songs and sing along."
"__DISNEY__ How cute! Yes, those songs are catchy....like the songs from Frozen!"
"__DISNEY__ Which Disney princess is your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ I love Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. She was always the one I wanted to be growing up."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I thought you were more of a Pocohantas type, a free spirit. Like, running through the woods barefoot and stuff."
"__DISNEY__ I remember watching Pocohontas in the theatres and collecting the figurines from Happy Meal toys."
"__DISNEY__ Are you going to see Cars 3?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't think we will go see it in the theatres, I can't get the kids to really pay attention to the Cars movies, but definitely when it comes out on video."
"__DISNEY__ We are planning to see it this week. I hope it will be good! I love hearing Owen WIlson's voice as Lightning McQueen."
