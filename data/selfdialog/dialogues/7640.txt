"__LADY_GAGA__ I just bought Lady Gaga's new album."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I didn't know she'd released a new one. What's it called?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ The album's name is Joanne. Have you heard any of the singles from it?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I've heard Perfect Illusion and Million Reasons."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love Million Reasons! I sing along to it in the car."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't know. I like her older songs better."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you mean the ones from Artpop or the ones from The Fame?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like The Fame better, but I also like Born This Way. The Fame had the most unique stuff."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'd never heard anything like Bad Romance before she made that song."
