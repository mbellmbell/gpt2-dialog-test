"__DISNEY__ Hey what did you think about the New Beauty and the Beast that they launched this year?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmmmm, there was not a big difference for me. I was actually a bit disappointed."
"__DISNEY__ Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ Well they did not do much to change the story it was pretty much the same. Belle, Gaston, the Beast. There really was not much of a different story line and I found that it was not necessary."
"__DISNEY__ You know what, I feel the same way. I actually still prefer the original Beauty and the Beast to this one. My favorite character was Chip the little tea cup."
"__DISNEY__ Yes he is cute. I think the music from the original Beauty and the Beast was more sophisticated. I was actually disappointed that they redid the original Beauty and the Beast song that was done by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah total bummer, that was a big disappointment for me too."
"__DISNEY__ Well at least they kept to the story line."
"__DISNEY__ They did but I think that that is what killed it for me. They should have done a Part 2 and made something totally new instead of trying to do this over."
"__DISNEY__ You're right they really should have."
