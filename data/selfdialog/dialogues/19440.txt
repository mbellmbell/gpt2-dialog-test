"__MOVIES__ If you will it, dude, it is no dream."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I've heard that. What's that from?"
"__MOVIES__ The Big Lebowski. John Goodman's character."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, Walter, he's saying that to the dude."
"__MOVIES__ Yep! Mr. Tron himself, Jeffrey Bridges."
"__MOVIES__ Dude that movie is a classic!"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, I just watched it again last night!"
"__MOVIES__ Dude, don't you feel bad for Donny? Walter is pretty mean to him."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but Steven Buscemi has done some tough guy roles too, like Boardwalk Empire."
"__MOVIES__ This is true. You know, my goal is to be the dude."
"__MOVIES__ 'The Dude abides.'"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! Yeah, that's the life, right?"
"__MOVIES__ There are SO many quotable lines in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know! Like, 'well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.'"
"__MOVIES__ I use that all the time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah me too. That's probably why I don't get more dates."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know there are festivals surrounding The Big Lebowski movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I know. I can't decide whether I would actually want to go to one."
"__MOVIES__ I think it would be awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ It would definitely be something!"
