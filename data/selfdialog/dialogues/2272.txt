"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Slime Girls?"
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"

"__MUSIC__ Exactly. They use the same types of sounds and make really cool songs."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds interesting."
"__MUSIC__ It is the best music to listen to when playing video games."
"__MUSIC__ That kind of music definitely seems to go hand-in-hand with video games."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't it? Before I knew about Slime Girls, I didn't listen to music when playing games."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"

"__MUSIC__ If you like 8-bit music, have you heard of groundislava?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I bet I would like them."
"__MUSIC__ It's just one guy who makes all the music. He's local to Los Angeles."
"__MUSIC__ I'll make sure to download an album or two."
