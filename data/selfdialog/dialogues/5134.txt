"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you watch The Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea I did. I was really hoping there would be more racing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea me too, they had some cool cars though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea but they didn't focus on the cars at all."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ True, but I still really enjoyed the plot"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really? The plot was terrible! There were so many holes in it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea but the movie is supposed to be silly and over the top. You're being too critical."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Maybe you're right. It did have some cool fight scenes."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, I would have loved to see The Rock and Jason Stathum finish that prison fight though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, me too! They stopped it too early."
