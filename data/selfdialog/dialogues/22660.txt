"__DISNEY__ Did you see the movie Moana?"
"__DISNEY__ No, not yet.  What's it about?"
"__DISNEY__ It's about a girl who keeps finding herself drawn to the ocean.  She goes on a quest to find a demigod named Maui."
"__DISNEY__ Maui?  Like the Hawaiian island?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, exactly.  He is a shapeshifter who stole the heart of Tafiti."
"__DISNEY__ Who is Tafiti?"
"__DISNEY__ She's almost like the Hawaiian version of Mother Nature."
"__DISNEY__ Why did he steal her heart?"
"__DISNEY__ He wanted to give it to the people, but it backfired.  Stealing her heart started to make nature die."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds cool.  Maybe I'll watch it."
