"__MUSIC__ It's a shame that musicians need to also be business people more than ever these days."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, so much creative energy is lost when a musician needs to focus so much on promotion."
"__MUSIC__ Don't they have other people to do that?"
"__MUSIC__ The few at the top do. The rest of us need to spend a lot of time promoting ourselves."
"__MUSIC__ That isn't much different from the past."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it is different because the technology and knowledge needed to do so now is very complicated."
"__MUSIC__ What is so complicated?"
"__MUSIC__ One must become familiar with how to use many social media platforms, build web sites, and then make sure they are found."
"__MUSIC__ Lots of people do that."
"__MUSIC__ Perhaps, but it has gotten over my head. Have you ever watched a video about maximizing SEOs?"
"__MUSIC__ No. What's SEO?"
"__MUSIC__ SEO refers to Search Engine Optimization."
"__MUSIC__ Is that so difficult?"
"__MUSIC__ You wouldn't think so, but once you delve into it a bit the complexity becomes overwhelming."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ There are tricky strategies, discovering that you need to spend lots of money paying for placement and ads, and it still remains a large risk."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's what people need to do for anything these days."
"__MUSIC__ For a musician or artist, this is very draining in terms of creative energy and time, making it hard to focus on one's music."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's just how it is if you want to try to make a living as a musician these days."
