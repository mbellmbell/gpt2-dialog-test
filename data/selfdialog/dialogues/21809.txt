"__DISNEY__ Did you see the really old Disney version of A Christmas Tale?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I'm sure I didn't. What was it like?"
"__DISNEY__ Well it was essentially just an update of the Dickens story, except with Disney characters."
"__DISNEY__ Ah, let me guess, Scrooge was Scrooge McDuck?"
"__DISNEY__ Obviously. And Mickey was Bob Cratchit."
"__DISNEY__ Was that were Scrooge McDuck originated?"
"__DISNEY__ I have to assume so. The character is clearly a great fan of money."
"__DISNEY__ Well he had to come from somewhere. And Duck Tales was just terrific."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he was my favourite Disney character growing up."
"__DISNEY__ Mine too. I so wanted to be one of those kids."
