"__DISNEY__ Did you like Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ I did the first time I watched it..."
"__DISNEY__ But you don't like it anymore?"
"__DISNEY__ Not since I've heard Let It Go at every single birthday party I've been to."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, me too. I still love that song though!"
"__DISNEY__ Ugh, I am so tired of it. I hope the songs in Frozen 2 are less catchy."
"__DISNEY__ I bet they'll be even more popular than Let It Go."
"__DISNEY__ Impossible! Every kid on earth knows that song."
"__DISNEY__ I just hope they get Idina Menzel to sing it again."
"__DISNEY__ True. She's the only good thing about that song."
