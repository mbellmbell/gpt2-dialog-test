"__THRILLER__ No Country for Old Men was a weird movie."
"__THRILLER__ Weird?  Not the word I'd use."
"__THRILLER__ Well, by that I mean it's creepy.  I'm not sure I get it."
"__THRILLER__ You mean the ending where he's talking to his wife?"
"__THRILLER__ No, before that where the villain guy is talking to his wife."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, he flipped a quarter and killed her."
"__THRILLER__ How do you know she's dead?"
"__THRILLER__ After he's done, he looks at this shoes.  That's a tell that there may have been blood on that."
"__THRILLER__ I never noticed that."
"__THRILLER__ You should watch it again to see what I mean."
