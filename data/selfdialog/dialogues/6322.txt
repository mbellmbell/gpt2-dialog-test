"__STAR_WARS__ Remember that scene is 'Attack of the Clones' where Yoda went all crazy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ All crazy? Oh wait, yeah, that one battle scene?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, haha, when he was all flipping and jumping everything against Count Doku! That was awesome!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was so funny. The entire series, he's all old and frail looking and then he whips out all of those cool battle moves!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, the entire theater was laughing so loud when that scene happened!"
"__STAR_WARS__ And then goes back to hobbling away with his cane after the battle. That was so funny!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Yoda is really a great character. One of my favorite Jedi in the series for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish they would have had him do more scenes like that in the other movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know right, but at least we got to see it once!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Go Yoda! haha"
