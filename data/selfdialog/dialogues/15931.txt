"__ROCK__ Dude, did you hear that Guns N Roses are back together?"
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah? Are they writing new material?"
"__ROCK__ No, right now they're just touring. But its a start! Maybe they'll write new music soon."
"__ROCK__ I've never liked Axl Rose, but they had some pretty good songs. I like Slash though."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, his solo stuff is good. Have you heard any of his albums?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I like his work with Myles Kennedy."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, Myles is such a good singer. I really like his work with Alter Bridge. His singing style really works well with Tremonti's guitar playing."
"__ROCK__ Definitely much better than Scott Stapp, that's for sure."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I agree. Myles has actual range and emotion."
"__ROCK__ I think he elevates every musician he plays with."
