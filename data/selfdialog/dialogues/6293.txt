"__STAR_WARS__ What is your least favorite part of the new Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably the bad guys."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Kylo Ren is pretty bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Just a little to whiny for my taste."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know! He's like a teen ager on a tantrum."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure I like the Emperor type guy either."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not real keen on him either."
"__STAR_WARS__ Too much CGI."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's how I feel too."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what they'll do in the next one."
