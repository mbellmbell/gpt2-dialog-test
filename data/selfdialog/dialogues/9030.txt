"__BEATLES__ I am so glad that iTunes finally has the Beatles music."
"__BEATLES__ Me too! I used to have to switch to a different app when I wanted to listen to them, which was annoying."
"__BEATLES__ What is your ultimate favorite Beatles track?"
"__BEATLES__ That is a hard question; there are so many great ones! Maybe Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, Ob-La-Di is so good! I'm actually not sure what it is about though."
"__BEATLES__ Me either, I just like song! What is your favorite?"
"__BEATLES__ Probably Strawberry Fields Forever, another Beatles song that I'm not totally sure what the meaning is."
"__BEATLES__ Strawberry Fields Forever is good, not my favorite though."
"__BEATLES__ What about Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, I love Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds! My best friend is named Lucy, and that song always makes me think of her."
