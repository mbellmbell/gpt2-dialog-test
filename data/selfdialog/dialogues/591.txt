"__MUSIC__ Why am I obsessed with JLo's 'Ain't that funny? She sounds excellent here."
"__MUSIC__ Because you're crazy. It's a nice song, but it's not that great."
"__MUSIC__ So you don't like JLo? She's a great artist. Are you a hater?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I like her. I'm not taking away that's she's talented . I'm just saying it's not that good."
"__MUSIC__ Do you hear the growl and the confidence? She's grown as an artist."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and I'm not saying it's a horrible song. It's catchy."
"__MUSIC__ However you don't think it's worthy of my devotion, right? Listen to it again."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'm just giving my opinion. It's a great song, not an anthem."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, we have a difference of opinion. I respect that. You make me want to listen to it more."
"__MUSIC__ That's fine. Just don't go crazy when I don't join in. I'm happy she has a hit."
"__MUSIC__ That's a low blow. She's always been successful. She has great music."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not denying her talent. She's a great dancer."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if JLo has a gang like Beyonce's Beyhive? What would they be called?"
"__MUSIC__ She doesn't, she lost them all after her split with Ben."
"__MUSIC__ You're on a roll with the JLo hate. She's a triple threat."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe it's because of Ja Rule's rap. I don't like his music at all."
"__MUSIC__ Okay I understand that. I don't like him either."
"__MUSIC__ He sounds like a big phony. That voice isn't real."
"__MUSIC__ You're funny. He's washed up now."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Well we might see him on a Geico commercial now."
