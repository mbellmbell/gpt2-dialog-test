"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Shawn Mendes' most recent release?"
"__MUSIC__ Are you talking about, 'There's Nothing Holding Me Back'? Yeah, I have!"
"__MUSIC__ I've been playing it on repeat the last few days. It's so catchy."
"__MUSIC__ And the message is empowering, too."
"__MUSIC__ It is, right? What other songs of his do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like his track, 'Stitches.' I feel it captures what heartbreak feels like."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard that track, too. I think it was a really big hit on Spotify."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it made one of the 'top' lists! How did you first hear about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I heard another of his songs on the radio a few weeks back."
"__MUSIC__ Which song was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was 'Treat You Better' from his album titled the same."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I actually don't like that song much."
"__MUSIC__ Really? How come?"
"__MUSIC__ The melody is nice and all, but the lyrics just sound so whiny."
"__MUSIC__ Right, the lyrics are mostly complaining about being friend-zoned by a girl."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. It's a message that's common in songs, but it still irritates me."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you like 'There's Nothing Holding Me Back,' he just recently released the music video for it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really? I'll go check that out on YouTube then."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if he'll release any new songs in the near future."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, probably not, given he just released a new single two months ago."
