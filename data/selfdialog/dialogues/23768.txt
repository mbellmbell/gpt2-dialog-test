"__SUPERHERO__ What do you think of all the superhero movies out now?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I believe they are somewhat saturating the market, but as long as people go, they will stil make them."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ddi you see Wonder Woman yet? I thought it was awesome."
"__SUPERHERO__ I saw it a few weeks ago and thought it was one of the best I can remember seeing."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too. There's just only so much I can see of The Avengers and Spiderman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Of course, it didn't hurt that she was gorgeous to look at too."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree there 100%. What about the new Spiderman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Looks good to me. I like the newer guy and that they went away from the love story from the earlier movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ It does look good to me too. I'm excited to see it."
"__SUPERHERO__ The new actor appears well suited to the role and should help it attract a sizeable audience."
