"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear Gayle Sayers might have that Concussion Condition that football eventually get?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I didn't hear that. That's sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it seems like more and more football players are being diagnosed and affected with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it should be expected that players eventually will have that condition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah? Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football is a full contact sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the players wear helmets and pads to protect themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People wear condoms not to get a disease or to cause a pregnancy but it happens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that the best analogy you got?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just saying with all that tackling and head butting there's bound to be some consequences."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah you right about that. But the pro-"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The problem is the league should have and should now protect their players even more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're saying a football helmet is not enough to protect the players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's exactly what I'm saying!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what should the football team owners do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Past or present football team owners?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both! They're both affected aren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they are. Very much so...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what should they do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pay their past players what they're worth. Start by providing lifetime Health Insurance so those players affected with the condition can live a worthwhile productive life."
