"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 59 days until the NFL season kicks off!  I can't wait!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can, I'm a Cleveland Browns fan!  Our season is over before it even begins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch that does stink.  What do you think about the rookies they got.  They seem promising, no?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't mean to be pessimistic but the Browns never draft well.  If you are drafted by the Browns it's usually a ticket out of the league!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Talk about bad luck, let's talk about the Atlanta Falcons blowing that lead in the Superbowl.  Do you think they can overcome that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yikes.  They let New England score 31 unanswered points.  Not sure how any franchise moves past that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a great quarterback in Matt Ryan.  Hopefully he keeps his head."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Julio Jones is an amazing receiver as well.  I thought for sure they would take down the Patriots!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Tom Brady really played with a concussion last year like his wife said he did?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure he did.  Although he is fairly protected with all the rule changes.  It's such a physical game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been following the legal troubles of Dallas's running back Zeke Elliott?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I haven't.  What happened?  He was so fun to watch last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Supposedly he has some domestic violence charge against him.  It's too bad if it's true, he was great and will only get better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really enjoyed following Zeke and Dak's rise to the top.  They didn't do much in the playoffs though.  Same old Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about Derek Carr's record breaking contract?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh my goodness 125 million dollars?!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really came into his own last year.  And now that they have Beast Mode, maybe they will dethrown the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's hope.  I have had enough of that dynasty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's go out on a limb and say that we are going to see a Cleveland vs San Francisco Superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In your dreams.  They two worst teams in the league will not bounce back that fast."
