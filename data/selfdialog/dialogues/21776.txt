"__DISNEY__ Hey, I like your dog! Is that a dalmation?"
"__DISNEY__ It is, yes. We had to get one after our kids watched 101 Dalmatians."
"__DISNEY__ Oh my gosh, I loved that movie when I was a kid. I even read the book over and over."
"__DISNEY__ It was the first book our son Jacob read. He wanted to read my copy after he watched the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Whenever I see a dalmatian, I think of firefighters and Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, my wife named him Pongo - just like in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Just as long as their is no Cruella de Vil around!"
"__DISNEY__ Did you see the live action movie with Glenn Close a few years ago?"
"__DISNEY__ I did! And don't forget 102 Dalmatians!"
"__DISNEY__ Hmmmm...I may pick up some popcorn so our family can watch a Disney double feature tonight!"
