"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite genre of movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like Science Fiction and Fantasy movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? Me too, I love the Lord of the Rings movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Those are some of the best movies, which one is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the Return of the King, except it is so long!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I agree, watching the extended edition it one sitting is pretty brutal."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it takes up all night just to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ So what other movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like John Wick and its sequel, John Wick Chapter 2!"
"__MOVIES__ Those movies are so cool, Reeves is almost as good as he was in the first Matrix movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the first Matrix is one of my favorite all-time movies."
"__MOVIES__ It was so cool, I remember being blown away by it when it first came out."
"__MOVIES__ If only they would have left it alone, or actually made sequels that made sense."
"__MOVIES__ I don't hate all of the sequels, but I do agree they were not on par with the original."
"__MOVIES__ That is usually the case with most movies, can you think of an exception where the sequel was better?"
"__MOVIES__ Aliens was better than Alien in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ They tie for me, Alien was more of a horror movie, and Aliens was more of a action movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but we can both agree Alien 3 was horrible."
"__MOVIES__ You got me there, I don't know what they were thinking with that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Ripley was such a cool character though!"
