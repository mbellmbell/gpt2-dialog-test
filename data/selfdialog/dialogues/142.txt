"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite ska song?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's tough. I'd have to say 'old west' by Five Iron Frenzy."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like both the lyrics and the sound. It's a really serious important subject but it's done in such a fun, happy, upbeat way, and it's sarcastic, too."
"__MUSIC__ I love sarcasm and how ska bands seem to love incorporating that into their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I think a lot of people don't get it though."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know how, I mean, a lot of times they're really obvious about it to the point of almost being corny."
"__MUSIC__ Everything about ska is a little corny though."
"__MUSIC__ Not everything!"
"__MUSIC__ But anyways that's why my sister won't let her kids listen to certain ska songs. She's afraid they won't get the sarcasm either and think they're promoting certain things."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I could understand that if it's kids who might not get it."
"__MUSIC__ But still you'd think she could just explain it to them and let them come to their own conclusions."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, especially with the amount of sarcasm and satire that's in sk, they'd be missing out on so much great music!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Who are some of your favourites?"
"__MUSIC__ Me? I like Less Than Jake, The Insyderz and Spring Heeled Jack."
"__MUSIC__ You have good taste then."
"__MUSIC__ I should hope you'd say that, you were the ones who introduced me to them!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so I was."
"__MUSIC__ I'm really glad you did. Ska has become one of my favourite kinds of music."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too."
