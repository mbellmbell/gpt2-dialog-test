"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, they were really good last year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were!  I think they will finally make it to the Super Bowl again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  You sure are optimistic?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why shouldn't I be?  Their core players are coming back, and they had a really good draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but I think their defense is lacking some."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but their offense makes up for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their offense is really potent.  Do you think Dak will have another good year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping so.  He had such a good rookie year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did, and so did Zeke!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait to see him with a year of experience.  He  is going to have a monster year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too.  What do you think their weakest position is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say defensive line, but there is hope for them there too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting.  I don't see much hope there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they have some good positional players, and will have a good rotation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's an interesting perspective."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With some luck, they will stay injury free and do what needs to be done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the key to most any team...stay injury free."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree.  I am so looking forward to the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too!"
