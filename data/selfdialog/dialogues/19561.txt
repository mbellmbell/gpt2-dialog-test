"__MOVIES__ You know what movie I never saw, Rocky Horror Picture Show."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen it either."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it a musical?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so."
"__MOVIES__ Do people get dressed up to go see it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that's what happens. And people act out the movie as it's playing."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds a little strange to me, but it might be fun to see once."
"__MOVIES__ I'd see it, but I don't want to act it out."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if they make you act it out if you go."
"__MOVIES__ I hope not, but I guess we'd have to see."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we shouldn't see it then. We'll settle for whatever movie we don't have to dress up for."
"__MOVIES__ What movie should we see for your birthday next week?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, but maybe Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that was good."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the preview and it seemed decent."
"__MOVIES__ I would be willing to see that with you."
"__MOVIES__ We could also consider seeing Cars 3."
"__MOVIES__ If we bring the kids, I bet they would love it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, both my kids loved the other two Cars movies."
"__MOVIES__ I like the Cars movies even without my kids."
