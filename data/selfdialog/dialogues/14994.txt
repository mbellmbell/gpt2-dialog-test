"__ACTION__ Have you ever seen the original Terminator film?"
"__ACTION__ Of course! It's one of the best action movies of all time."
"__ACTION__ Really? Would you say it's the best of the Terminator movies?"
"__ACTION__ It is my personal favorite."
"__ACTION__ What about Judgement Day? Everyone says that one is better."
"__ACTION__ It has better special effects and action sequences but doesn't have the charm of the original."
"__ACTION__ How do you mean?"
"__ACTION__ The low budget, sci-fi setting was a lot more appealing to me than the more polished Judgement Day."
"__ACTION__ I see. I thought the first one was a little bit campy."
"__ACTION__ That's part of the charm!"
