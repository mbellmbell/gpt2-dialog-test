"__STAR_WARS__ I heard that the original movies didn't have stunt doubles."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's probably not correct."
"__STAR_WARS__ They may have had some, but not many due to lack of money."
"__STAR_WARS__ What scenes did the actors have to do?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You remember the one where Luke and Leia swing across the gap?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, I remember it."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was really the actors doing it."
"__STAR_WARS__ But I'm sure the gap wasn't bottomless."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course not, was only 30 feet or so, but interesting nonetheless."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do my own stunts in real life!"
