"__DISNEY__ Do you get the meaning of the balloons in the movie Up?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, they were the way the house flew up in the air."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but it seems like they're everywhere in every advertisement for the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Well yeah, they should be. They're kind of important in the story."
"__DISNEY__ Well why don't they have that funny dog in every advertisement? He's pretty important."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but he's not all that important."
"__DISNEY__ A talking dog? What could be more important than that?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess you have a point."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe they should start calling the movie: Dog."
"__DISNEY__ I doubt they'll do that, dude."
