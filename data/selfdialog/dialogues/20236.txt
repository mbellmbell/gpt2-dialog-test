"__MOVIES__ I finally got around to seeing Casablanca for the first time."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard of that I think but I don't really know anything about it."
"__MOVIES__ Really? It's one of the best films ever made."
"__MOVIES__ You hadn't seen it either until recently."
"__MOVIES__ I knew the premise and the basic plot though."
"__MOVIES__ So what's the setting of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it takes place in Morocco during World War II."
"__MOVIES__ What side was Morocco on?"
"__MOVIES__ Well that part of Morocco was a French colony."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't Germany take over France?"
"__MOVIES__ They occupied part of it, and a client government ruled the rest of it, so it's still French but somewhat compliant with Germany."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, so what happens there?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Humphrey Bogart is an American expat who owns a club there, and a bunch of foreigners are in the city trying to get visas to leave and get to America, and then a woman he knew shows up."
"__MOVIES__ What else happens?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to give you any spoilers."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Ingrid Bergman is the only other name I'd expect you to recognize."
"__MOVIES__ What else was she in?"
"__MOVIES__ She was in a lot of things, like Gaslight and Anastasia."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right, I really need to watch more classic films."
