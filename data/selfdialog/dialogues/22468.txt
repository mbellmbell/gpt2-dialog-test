"__DISNEY__ Did you hear the songs from Moana?"
"__DISNEY__ I just downloaded the soundtrack!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too! I love the song where Moana's dad is telling her that the island provides everything they could ever need."
"__DISNEY__ I like that one too!"
"__DISNEY__ Did you see the movie too or just hear the songs?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw the movie! What was your favorite part?"
"__DISNEY__ When Moana collected shells in the ocean when she was a little girl, I loved that part!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah me too! And then the ocean took her back to the beach so her dad wouldn't find out."
"__DISNEY__ That part was really cute."
"__DISNEY__ I wish I had a connection to the ocean like that!"
