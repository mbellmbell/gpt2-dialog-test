"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Beauty and the Beast is my favorite movie so far."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean the cartoon or the live action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I am referring to the Disney animated classic."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the story and I admire the character named Belle."
"__MOVIES__ What about Belle do you admire?"
"__MOVIES__ I admire her courage. She was willing to put her life on the line for her father."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think that her courage was just out of love for her father or was she also curious about the castle?"
"__MOVIES__ I suppose that she was curious about the castle. She did like to read and imagine things, but I believe her father was her main concern."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the live action movie that was recently released?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I don't think it was as good as the animated movie."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for one thing the live action movie had a whole bunch of mixed up time periods. The set design and costuming was like the 1800's but they talked about the plague which was definitely before the 1800's."
"__MOVIES__ I noticed that too. Did you notice that there were several interracial couples in the live action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, actually I did notice that. Did you like the live action movie better than the animated one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I prefer the animated movie but I am not a huge fan of Beauty and The Beast."
"__MOVIES__ What about it don't you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't like the reminder that people can be so cruel to only focus on outward appearances."
"__MOVIES__ I don't like it that people do that either but it is often the truth in real life. That is very sad to me."
