"__DISNEY__ One of my least favorite Disney movies is Peter Pan. Do you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I agree. Not much of a fan."
"__DISNEY__ Peter Pan isn't that much of a likeable character."
"__DISNEY__ No he's not. Even the villain isn't and I actually like some of them."
"__DISNEY__ I know. The best character is Tinker Bell, and she doesn't even talk."
"__DISNEY__ That's funny."
"__DISNEY__ Wendy is another one. The smaller kids are cute in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I just don't know why that one was such a big hit."
"__DISNEY__ Me either. Disney usually does real good movies."
"__DISNEY__ Well, you figure back then, maybe they didn't have as good of writers."
