"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, being a Detroit Lions fan is hard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We haven't won a Super Bowl yet!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really? Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we've had pretty good teams before, but there's a big culture of losing in Detroit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think that impacts their ability to win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I do. They're so used to losing that they can't win, even with good teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they play in a tough division too, don't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's true. We have the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Vikings too. They've been tough in the last few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair enough. But the Lions have had good teams too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they don't have a running game at all. Stafford just throws the ball down the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're running game would improve if their offensive line was any good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they have a solid defense, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, though it hasn't been as good since Suh left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't think they're as bad as you say. Playoff football is so tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is. One loss and you're done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, so it doesn't really matter how good your team is. It's just one bad game and you're finished."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So maybe they just haven't played a good playoff game yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. I suppose."
