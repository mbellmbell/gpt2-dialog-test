"__MUSIC__ What have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ You know me, all kinds of things. A lot of country actually."
"__MUSIC__ Old stuff or new?"
"__MUSIC__ A mixture. I have a country playlist of 3000+ songs and at least 500 different artists."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a lot of music. Do you have a favorite artist?"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely couldn't just name one, but Tim McGraw will always be towards the top of the list."
"__MUSIC__ Are him and Faith Hill still married?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they are. In fact, I want to say that they released a new duet within the last couple of years."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? I guess I didn't realize Faith Hill was still producing music."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I can't really say I've seen any solo work of hers lately."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe she just gets featured on some of his songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that might be all she does now. I want to look her up and see what she's up to these days."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of classic country female artists, isn't Shania Twain working on a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Is she? That's so exciting! She's one of my all-time favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! She's been around for a long time. She's definitely a pioneer."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I'll have to look her up to and see what the deal is. Do you think she'll go on tour again?"
"__MUSIC__ I hope so! That's one artist I have not gotten to see play live yet."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, she's fantastic in concert. Maybe if ,she comes to town, we can get tickets!"
"__MUSIC__ Sure! We can make a night of it."
"__MUSIC__ Dinner, Drinks, and Shania Twain! That sounds like my kind of night."
