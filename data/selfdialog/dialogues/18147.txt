"__MOVIES__ So what movies are you interested in for this year?"
"__MOVIES__ I can tell you what I'm not interested in. All of these crappy looking horror movies"
"__MOVIES__ That Happy Death Day is a total rip off of Edge of Tomorrow. Sheesh"
"__MOVIES__ And its coming off the heels of Annabelle 2, and that atrocious Bye Bye Man"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah..okay what about movies you are interested in?"
"__MOVIES__ Black Panther looks amazing. That comes to mind first"
"__MOVIES__ I'm with you. That trailer was so good. The visuals, actors, and of the course, Coogler directing"
"__MOVIES__ How lame is the news about the Han Solo film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, just shows what Disney is all about. Marvel was similar in the handling of Ant Man. I'm surprised Black Panther seems so stylish"
"__MOVIES__ It's just a trailer. It probably follows the formula. But Coogler is good at formula, just look at Creed"
"__MOVIES__ The Han Solo mess does worry me about the next main line Star Wars film. How much room will these directors have?"
"__MOVIES__ And they are just going to keep pumping these films out."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, to be negative, any film with Miles Teller is pretty much out for me."
"__MOVIES__ That guy is terrible. He's good at one thing, and that one thing is stale now"
"__MOVIES__ He also picks terrible looking films that I have no time for."
"__MOVIES__ Once again, I think the indie scene will have to produce the best films. There's been little good so far"
"__MOVIES__ Best movie is probably Get Out? I need to see now"
"__MOVIES__ No I think Get Out is clearly the best, even though I'm not crazy in love with it"
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully the summer has some more decent films and we get good stuff come Oscar season"
"__MOVIES__ I definitely have my doubts but Wonder Woman restored some hopes!"
