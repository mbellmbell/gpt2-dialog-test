"__MOVIES__ Have you  had a chance to see the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet.  Was it as good as the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was great!"
"__MOVIES__ With that recommendation, I suppose I need to see it.  I heard it had some interesting surprises."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, including some actors not usually associated with Guardians."
"__MOVIES__ Don't give it all away, but give me a teaser.  Who was in this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Sylvester Stallone put in a couple of appearances.  There were also some cameo shots with David Hasselhoff, and Kurt Russell played a key role."
"__MOVIES__ Now those are a couple of classic actors! How was the music?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was good enough to purchase the soundtrack.  There was something for everyone if you like older music."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Do you happen to remember a couple of these?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure.  The movie opens with baby Groot dancing oblivious through a fight scene to ELO's 'Mr. Blue Sky'.  It was fantastic!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard baby Groot was one of the best characters in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ He did play an important part throughout the movie.  Kurt Russell's character was something else too."
"__MOVIES__ Was he a good guy or a bad guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely a bit of a split personality.  That's all I will tell you about him - don't want to spoil the movie for you!"
"__MOVIES__ So was the music pretty much ELO style throughout?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it ranged from Glen Campbell to Cheap Trick.  Like I said, there was something for everyone."
"__MOVIES__ Nice!  I heard that you really needed to stay for the closing credits.  Did you catch those?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure did!  You're gonna love teenage baby Groot!  The rest you will have to see for yourself."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you sold me on it.  It is on my to do list for this weekend!"
