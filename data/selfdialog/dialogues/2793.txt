"__MUSIC__ Oh, I really like this song - turn it up.  Who sings this?"
"__MUSIC__ Its the singer Ms. X, she's been around for a while now"
"__MUSIC__ She has?  I've never heard of her before.  She has other songs out?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, shes actually from Country XYZ, so she's really big over there, but this is her first song in English, I think"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, I didnt know that.  How did you first hear about her then?"
"__MUSIC__ remember that exchange student from last year?  He listened to her and introduced me to her."
"__MUSIC__ I wish I know what she was saying because I really like this song.  it seems like a cool mix of styles."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I think her father is from Country ABC and her mother is from DEF, so it's an interesting mix of cultures."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, wait - her voice sounds familiar, didn't she do that song that was in the commercial recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so, I think they used that to begin her cross over appea"
"__MUSIC__ it think it must be so hard for singer to cross over and begin singing in a completely different language"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think I read  from another interview that she grew up speaking a little English, but she didnt really write any songs in English, so this was her first time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow - do you know if the complete album is out now or just the single?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I saw her on some late night talk show saying that her album is coming out next week, I think"
"__MUSIC__ Nice.  I may have to get it - will her songs be in both languages?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so - that would be awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Is she touring now?"
"__MUSIC__ I looked it up and looks like shes opening up for a few major acts at this years music festival"
"__MUSIC__ i've been wanting to go to that festival, lets try to get tickets and see her live."
"__MUSIC__ that would be really good, but lets buy her album before we see her live, though."
