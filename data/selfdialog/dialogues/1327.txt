"__MUSIC__ What genre of music has the best lyrics, overall, do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ Hard to judge. I can think of some genre's that DON'T have the best lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Classical music, for instance!"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, very funny."
"__MUSIC__ I'd maybe pick Hip Hop music. So much of the art form is bound up in the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that argument, although I'd argue that there's a lot of popular hip hop music with terrible lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. But the same can be said about Rock, or Country, or any other genre."
"__MUSIC__ I actually would pick Rock music, myself."
"__MUSIC__ When I think of the greatest Hip Hop songs, lyric-wise, and the greatest Rock songs, I think the Hip Hop songs are better lyrically."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it depends on what you like."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Though I think in this case, it's fairly clear which is better."
"__MUSIC__ I am a big appreciater of poetry, symbolism, and ambiguity. All those exist in larger quantities in Rock music lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ To some extent, I agree. At least about symbolism and ambiguity."
"__MUSIC__ But not poetry?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely not! There are some incredibly poetic MCs out there making beautiful Hip Hop songs."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Talib Kweli, Common, Aesop Rock, to name a few."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I agree with those artist you've named. But they aren't necessarily mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't really matter for this discussion, though."
