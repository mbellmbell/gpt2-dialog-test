"__DISNEY__ I am not sure. I mean I LOVE the orginals!"
"__DISNEY__ They did the Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast so far and they have done well."
"__DISNEY__ I agree but it feels like they are just trying to make some easy money."
"__DISNEY__ I heard they are going to do Aladin."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that too. I don't think they should because Robin Williams is the only person who can play Genie."
"__DISNEY__ I agree that he made the entire movie."
"__DISNEY__ It is hard to do that now with him being dead."
"__DISNEY__ Well maybe they will find an acceptable replacement."
"__DISNEY__ No one can fill his shoes."
