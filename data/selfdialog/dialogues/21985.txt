"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Really?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I had a friend who was obsessed with it when we were in the third grade, and it rubbed off on me."
"__DISNEY__ I like Aladdin myself. I thought it had the catchiest songs."
"__DISNEY__ All the animated movies from that time period were great. They don't call it the Disney Renaissance for nothing."
"__DISNEY__ That's true."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think of the Rescuers Down Under?"
"__DISNEY__ That was a pretty good one, but unfortunately forgotten a bit since it came between Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I agree with that."
