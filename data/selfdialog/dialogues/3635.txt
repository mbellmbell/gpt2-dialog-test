"__MUSIC__ What is the greatest love song ever written?"
"__MUSIC__ That's difficult to answer. So many great love songs!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, it's one of the most common themes in music."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you could say there are two kinds of love songs: happy ones, and sad ones."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. Some of the best songs about love have been about loss of love."
"__MUSIC__ A song that was immensely moving to me was 'LLorando', a Spanish cover of the song 'Crying' by Roy Orbison."
"__MUSIC__ Where have I heard that song? It sound familiar."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see the movie 'Mullholland Drive'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's where I'd heard it!"
"__MUSIC__ That's where I first heard it too. It was an incredibly moving scene."
"__MUSIC__ What a great song, and what a wonderful voice the woman singing it has."
"__MUSIC__ That's an extremely sad song about love."
"__MUSIC__ What about the other side of it - a happy love song?"
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, I've always preferred the sad love songs."
"__MUSIC__ Music has a lot of functions, and making you feel better when you're down is definitely one of them!"
"__MUSIC__ I've always like the song 'I Will Always Love you' by Whitney Houston."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, that's a great song, and another performer with a magnificent voice."
"__MUSIC__ And another song very strongly associated with a movie."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe there's something to be said for pairing a medium like music with the visual immersion of film."
"__MUSIC__ True, I think there's a multiplicative effect in that pairing."
