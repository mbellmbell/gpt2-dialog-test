"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think there is a chance for Kylo Ren to turn back to the light side like Darth Vader in his final moments?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know. I mean I wish he did, but we all know what he did to Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was brutal coming from his own son."
"__STAR_WARS__ His facial expressions during the last fight with Rey were interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ It looked like he was questioning himself."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's also the fact that his mentor is some powerful being."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he sounds more powerful than the Sith Lord from the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if Rey or Luke Skywalker will be able to get through to Kylo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would love to see that happen!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't wait for the next movie to come out, I want to know what happens!"
