"__BASEBALL__ What happened to Greg Bird?"
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__BASEBALL__ He was killing the ball but now he stinks."
"__BASEBALL__ He's had 60 at-bats. Relax."
"__BASEBALL__ I know it's early but he looks completely lost."
"__BASEBALL__ Compared to what? Like I said he's only had sixty ab's."
"__BASEBALL__ In spring training he was smoking the ball though, now it's not even the same swing."
"__BASEBALL__ Well spring training stats are worthless, everybody is just trying to shake the rust off and get going. Plus Bird got hurt."
"__BASEBALL__ Is it normal to struggle like this coming off an injury though, especially when it seemed like he had gotten it back?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well you gotta remember he's young and didn't even really have a lot of minor league experience."
"__BASEBALL__ When he first came up to the majors he was hitting awesome."
"__BASEBALL__ Right, and then pitchers get to see you often and after a while they can figure you out. It's normal."
"__BASEBALL__ So you think it's just growing pains and adjusting?"
"__BASEBALL__ To a degree, yes, and the injury complicates things. All in all he's still very green and will need time to mature."
"__BASEBALL__ I just want to see him mash again in that short porch."
"__BASEBALL__ Well the Yankees are generally young and going through it all. You have some guys really overperforming and then you have guys like bird trying to catch up."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right, I guess I should wait it out."
"__BASEBALL__ Count your blessings with Judge and those guys really turning it on, they're keeping the torch lit."
"__BASEBALL__ Got that right. I just bought some of his rookie cards."
"__BASEBALL__ Nice. Hope he keeps it up."
