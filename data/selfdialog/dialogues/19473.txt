"__MOVIES__ Do you know what movie was on HBO last night?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ Wall-E."
"__MOVIES__ Huh? Never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding me?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well. First off it's a Pixar movie. I'm not a fan of animated stuff overall, but in my opinion Pixar hasn't made a single bad movie."
"__MOVIES__ I did like Monster Inc. a lot."
"__MOVIES__ This is so much better. I don't know how, but it's a kids movie that's actually profound."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well first off, the whole first half of the movie doesn't really have any dialogue."
"__MOVIES__ Woah."
"__MOVIES__ But it doesn't even need to have any. They managed to create these animated characters that are so expressive, with just body language they convey so much."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, sounds pretty good so far."
"__MOVIES__ But the plot is also so great. It takes place in some dystopian future where we have pretty much wrecked the Earth with our wastefulness."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds dark for a kids movie!"
"__MOVIES__ It kind of is. But it's also beautiful, and uplifting, and really funny."
"__MOVIES__ Are you serious?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely, you should watch it if you have HBO. I think it's on again tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Well you're recommendations are wrong pretty rarely. Okay, I'll check it out tonight then."
