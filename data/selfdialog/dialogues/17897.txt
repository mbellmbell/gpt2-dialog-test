"__MOVIES__ Good morning!  Have you seen any movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Good morning!  Yeah I did. I went last night to the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Really, what did you see?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Alien Covenant!"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  What was it like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, very suspenseful, and action packed.  Alien movies tend to be that way."
"__MOVIES__ Was Sigourney Weaver in it again?"
"__MOVIES__ No, she was not.  This movie was before her in the movie time frame."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, that's right.  It was after Prometheus"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, this one is a spinoff from Prometheus."
"__MOVIES__ What were the graphics like?"
"__MOVIES__ The  graphics were stellar.  The creatures themselves were new and so frightening."
"__MOVIES__ Did they have a queen in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, one did look like a queen, but it was a soldier one."
"__MOVIES__ How many new creatures were in this one?"
"__MOVIES__ At least 3 new creatures were in it, very grotesque!  It was scary!"
"__MOVIES__ I want to go see it now!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you should.  Go see it on Tuesday."
"__MOVIES__ Why Tuesday?"
"__MOVIES__ Because that is when the movies are at a discount."
