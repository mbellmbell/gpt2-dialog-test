"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you say is the best wide receiver in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You ask me, knowing I'm a Cowboys fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, yep, I'm asking!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dez Bryant, of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A predictable answer, but not a ridiculous one. Dez Bryant is really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy does it all. He's big, he's fast, great hands, explosive after the catch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a heck of a player, but I'm not sure he's #1."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then who would you pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe one of A.J. Green or Julio Jones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not going to say that either of those are bad players. I still like Dez best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dez is a little bit of a wild card in terms of his emotions and stuff like that, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's had his issues, but I look at production on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think some of the mental stuff has spilled over into his production at times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibly, but I think he's matured the longer he's been in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Give me a guy like Julio Jones who puts his head down and goes to work on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And I say, give me a guy who wears his heart on his sleeve and has passion for the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the main thing is, give me a guy who's 6'3' and runs like the wind!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that always helps!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's weird to think about a league where Megatron isn't in the conversation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the NFL is less cool with him retired."
