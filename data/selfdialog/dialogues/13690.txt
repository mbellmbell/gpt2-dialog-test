"__BASKETBALL__ Did you like that playoff matchup between the Celtics and Wizards last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it was ok, but I wish it would have come down to a buzz beater.  I like the extra drama of a last second shot."
"__BASKETBALL__ That definitely would have made it better, but did you see that dunk by Wall?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah! It was awesome! It looked like it floated through air for five minutes."
"__BASKETBALL__ I expected the Celtics to shoot better from behind the arc, did you notice that poor shooting?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I did.  I thought the same, since they shot so well during the regular season.  I think Thomas might be slightly hurt though."
"__BASKETBALL__ He may have been, but why is shooting that many threes when he didn't make a single one?  I thought he should have been driving and slashing more, to create open shots for his teammates."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's a good question.  He does seem to get focused on his own scoring too much."
"__BASKETBALL__ How do you think this series turns out now?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they'll end up going to seven games.  Neither team seems to be able to win on the road."
