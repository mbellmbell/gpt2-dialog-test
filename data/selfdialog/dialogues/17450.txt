"__MOVIES__ Toy Story 1, 2, or 3?"
"__MOVIES__ Toy Story 1 is the best, by far."
"__MOVIES__ No, I think 3 takes the cake."
"__MOVIES__ 3 is great. But Nothing can beat the original."
"__MOVIES__ But we can agree that number 2 isn't great?"
"__MOVIES__ Number 2 is good, but yeah, doesn't beat 1 or 3."
"__MOVIES__ Favorite Characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Buzz and Woody, of course."
"__MOVIES__ I literally just found out that the voices of those two are Tom Hanks and Tim Allen."
"__MOVIES__ I knew Tom Hanks was in it, but I didn't know about Tim Allen."
"__MOVIES__ I love them both."
"__MOVIES__ You think there will be a 4?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. I don't think there has ever been a Pixar movie with 4 different ones."
"__MOVIES__ Most of the super successful ones get a sequel, but even 3 is rare."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I doubt there will be a fourth."
"__MOVIES__ But if there is, I'll watch it opening day."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so will I."
"__MOVIES__ I just looked it up. There WILL be one."
"__MOVIES__ What, whats the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ Its not a continuation of 3, its a whole new one!"
