"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how good is your NFL trivia?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm, I think it's pretty good. Test me!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, How long do you think it would take for you to get Green Bay Packers tickets if you were on the waiting list today?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those Packers fans are fanatics! Probably a very long time but I don't know exactly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You would have to wait almost a 1,000 years! There are approximately 86,000 people on it. With under 100 people giving up their tickets per year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's insane! Okay hit me up again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wilson has been making the official foot ball since 1941...do you know how many footballs they make per day?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I got this! It's about 4,000 per day or one for every Eli Manning interception."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah, good one! How about which NFL ever three-peated and never once in the Super Bowl Era?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Back to those Packers! Vince Lombardiâ€™s Green Bay Packers of 1966-68 won three NFL championships in a row, but no team has ever pulled off the feat in the Super Bowl era."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right you are!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is fun. Keep going."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, what days of the week does the NFL play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sunday, Monday and Thursday?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, they actually have played every day of the week. Games have been moved because of holidays and weather."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I did not know that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, how much doest that Superbowl trophy cost?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a lot of metal. I'm going to say $20k?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wrong again? It's $25K."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dang, that was fun we'll have to do that again!"
