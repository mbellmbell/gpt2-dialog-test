"__DISNEY__ You know what, I think Cinderella is massively overrated."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, but everyone seems to love it."
"__DISNEY__ It's so derivative and almost anti-feminist."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah you're so right. I always hated how Cinderella's life was doomed until the handsome prince whisked her away."
"__DISNEY__ Also what's with the ugly people being bad. That's giving a terrible message to kids."
"__DISNEY__ The ugly people?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Cinderella's ugly stepsisters were horrible to her."
"__DISNEY__ Her wicked stepmother was no spring chicken either."
"__DISNEY__ That being said though, how pretty was her ball gown!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh so pretty indeed, but glass slippers would have been a nightmare to wear."
