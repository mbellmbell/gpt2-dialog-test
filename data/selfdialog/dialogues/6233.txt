"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the movie Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, that's one of my favorite Star wars movies so far. Did you like it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I was just really sad about the ending. I liked K2S0 a lot, and I didn't like what happened to him."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true but we knew this was going to be a one off. And Director Krennik was really a great character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I definitely agree. Also having Mads Mikkelson in the movie was excellent."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah the cast was pretty awesome. The last twenty minutes are my favorite part, although it made me sad."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's interesting to see the forming of the rebellion and the death star plans for sure. Who was your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to say Cassian I think. He's very cool, and he's not afraid to get his hands dirty."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the pacing with that movie was perfect. Like they did everything just right."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right, it was great. And the battle at the end while they were trying to steal the plans was really epic."
