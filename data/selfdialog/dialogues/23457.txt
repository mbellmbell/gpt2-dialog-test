"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite kind of Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I enjoy movies that teach a lesson.  What about you?"
"__DISNEY__ I like those kind too, but I really like the ones that are funny."
"__DISNEY__ Me too!  I like those better than my own kids."
"__DISNEY__ Really though, it seems like the jokes are for more of a mature mind."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, it goes right over my kids heads."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you think they make the jokes so hard for kids to understand?"
"__DISNEY__ They probably do it for us parents."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, you're probably right."
"__DISNEY__ They probably do it because they know that we will have to watch it a million times."
