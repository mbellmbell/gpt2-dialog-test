"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I think it's terrible"
"__STAR_WARS__ What? Seriously?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the characters are so boring and static"
"__STAR_WARS__ How many have you seen?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Just the first couple"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean Episode I or Episode IV"
"__STAR_WARS__ Whichever one they have the race"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh well that's the problem, the prequels are terrible. Watch the originals first"
"__STAR_WARS__ Alright I guess I'll give them another try"
