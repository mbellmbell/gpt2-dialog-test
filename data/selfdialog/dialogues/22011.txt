"__DISNEY__ Did you ever watch the movie Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't think so. Who's in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I'm not sure. It's a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Well, then no I didn't."
"__DISNEY__ It's about a daughter who dresses up as a son to go fight in war so her father doesn't have to."
"__DISNEY__ So she's not a princess in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No, she's a warrior."
"__DISNEY__ Well, women can do anything."
"__DISNEY__ That was the point. Showing how strong a woman can be, I think."
"__DISNEY__ I never actually heard of that one."
