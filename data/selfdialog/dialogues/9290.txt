"__BASEBALL__ What would be the scariest bench clearing team that you could assemble?"
"__BASEBALL__ Hmm. Let me think about that one."
"__BASEBALL__ Who would you pick to create an enforcer baseball team, a team of 9 players (pitcher included) that you would never want to bean with a pitch and have a bench clearing brawl against."
"__BASEBALL__ Stanton, machado with a bat."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know."
"__BASEBALL__ How about Mo Vaughn?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's like a teddy bear."
"__BASEBALL__ Tough crowd."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree about Stanton though. Just give him a bat and stay out of his way."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly. How tall is he anyway?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's 6'6'."
"__BASEBALL__ I thought so. He just towers over everybody on the field."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but size doesn't always make someone a good fighter"
"__BASEBALL__ True but it is great camouflage."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__BASEBALL__ I mean would you in your right mind pick a fight with someone who is that tall?"
"__BASEBALL__ No way. I'd be doing my best to stay on his good side."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly my point.  Not everyone will try a giant to see if he is tough or not."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right. Especially if that giant swings a baseball for a living."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep."
