"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, let's list our favorite battle scences in order of movie. I'll start with the Death Star fighter battle from a New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, then I respond to you with the Death Star battle from Return of the Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, that would have been my second, so I'll have go with the main battle in Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's my number two favorite as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ My next favorite is the Battle of Geononsis in Attack of the Clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's a good one, but I'm more partial to the Battle of Courscant in Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who you like vehicle battles do you? What would you rate higher, the BAttle of Scarif or the battle of StarKiller Base?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to go with the battle of Scarif, more variety of vehicles and comabt types."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, the base of Starkiller is mostly a fighter battle with Ren and Rey's saber duel inbetween."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but it nowhere near as epic as Obi-wan and Anakin's duel on Mustafar."
