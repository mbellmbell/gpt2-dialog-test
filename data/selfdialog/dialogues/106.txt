"__MUSIC__ I'm so glad I grew up listening to ska."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I can't imagine life without it."
"__MUSIC__ You know that's what made me interested in horns in high school."
"__MUSIC__ No kidding?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was all because of ska. Before that I thought horns were boring and only in Jazz and other lame music."
"__MUSIC__ But you know better now."
"__MUSIC__ Now I know, and I think it's helping make horns more popular."
"__MUSIC__ For me personally, it's inspiring seeing other females in ska bands, like One Eighty, Save Ferris, and Leanor Ortega in Five Iron."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's definitely important and I love that females are finding places in ska."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's one of the things that makes ska stronger."
"__MUSIC__ You know ska has always been a pioneer against racism and homophobia, even having whole tours called things like 'ska against racism'"
"__MUSIC__ I love that and that's one of the things that makes me proud to identify with the genre."
"__MUSIC__ Well you know it has roots in integration and inclusiveness."
"__MUSIC__ That would make sense why that's prevalent in a lot of the lyrics even today."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I love how that's something that has stood the test of time throughout that music scene."
"__MUSIC__ It's one of the things that got me interested in it in the first place."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's important. I like 2 tone ska for that reason."
"__MUSIC__ Why is it called 2 tone again?"
"__MUSIC__ It came from the record label name of the guy who led it and its mission to ease racial tensions at the time."
"__MUSIC__ Very cool."
