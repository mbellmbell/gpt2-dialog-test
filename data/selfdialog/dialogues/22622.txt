"__DISNEY__ You know, I really liked the Moana movie."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know right?  Hawaiian culture is so nice, I looked it up.  There was a lot going on in the back scenes."
"__DISNEY__ How do you mean?  In terms of making of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Exactly.  They went to Hawaii, researched legends, spoke to the people, and got their input and contribution."
"__DISNEY__ Ah that is nice!  It's really great to experience different cultures every now and then!"
"__DISNEY__ Tell me about it.  The fact that each country and nation is distinct from one another, it's so great."
"__DISNEY__ I totally agree.  You know, if there were no countries/nations, we wouldn't have any Disney princesses right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yup!  And I'm totally looking forward to the next Disney princess!"
"__DISNEY__ What culture should they focus on next?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it'll be amazing."
