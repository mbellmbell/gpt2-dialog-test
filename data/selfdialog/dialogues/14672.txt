"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So what do you plan on doing for winter break this year?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I was thinking about just taking it easy this year. How about you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I want to take it easy as well. Maybe I'll watch a lot of TV or something."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I love watching Christmas movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too! I watch Home Alone almost every year."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I love that movie. There are so many good Christmas movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Did you ever see that old one that's actually just called 'A Christmas Story'?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I love that movie!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too. I think it's one of the best ones out there."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Isn't it funny how many different kinds of Christmas movies there are?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, it's like there's different sub-genres of Christmas movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Give an example."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, we already mentioned two distinct style of Christmas movies. Then there's also movies like Die Hard."

"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ah, yes. I see what you mean."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Jimmy Stewart was great in that movie, by the way."
