"__STAR_WARS__ So do you think that Luke Skywalker is going to be killed off in the new movie coming later this year?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It kind of seems like that due to the movies title."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah the Last Jedi. Seems like it is possible."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like Luke and since we lost Han it may make me cry."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah me too. But at least we get to see him more in this movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. And I'm excited about Rey's Jedi training."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! I can't wait to see how strong Rey is in the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Seeing that she was stronger the Kylo Ren then she should be interesting to watch."
"__STAR_WARS__ This movie can't come to quickly for me."
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel the same way, we should go see it together!"
