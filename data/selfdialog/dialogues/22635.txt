"__DISNEY__ Disney has been making some pretty amazing movies lately."
"__DISNEY__ I know, Moana was one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ My daughter loved that movie, I’ve seen it 10 times already, still makes me laugh every time."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean, it’s on everyday in my household, Beauty and the beast as well."
"__DISNEY__ I haven’t seen that yet, is good for the kids?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, they go crazy for it. I can play that, finding Nemo and then finding dory and it fills the kids days."
"__DISNEY__ I know finding nemo and dory inside out, my kids finally stopped watching finding nemo and then finding dory came out."
"__DISNEY__ I don’t mind though, I love the Disney Pixar movies, toy story 1, 2 and 3 were my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ I love putting those on, I can watch them over and over again. Which one was your favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I love number 2, don’t ask me why, I just love the story."
