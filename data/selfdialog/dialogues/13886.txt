"__BASKETBALL__ Does the NBA want to change the draft lottery process?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do they need to?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think its unfair the worst team doesnt get the best pick."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think its to discourage tanking."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well theres 2 counters to that."
"__BASKETBALL__ And they are?"
"__BASKETBALL__ One is the Sixers. They have tanked for years"
"__BASKETBALL__ And have only gotten the first pick once"
"__BASKETBALL__ But are always getting top 3 picks."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ok and whats next"
"__BASKETBALL__ Other leagues do not have to worry about tanking  without having a lottery."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but I think its easier to do in basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the NBA is ripe for tanking to be honest."
"__BASKETBALL__ So you agree with me?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I just think there is not enough talent in NCAA for the entire NBA to take every year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Then maybe they should revisit eligibility."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think we are getting closer to that happening."
"__BASKETBALL__ Silver will not be able to pass much though."
"__BASKETBALL__ The NCAA has no word on whether to do that."
"__BASKETBALL__ They all collude together."
