"__MOVIES__ Don't you wish you had the spirit of Bagger Vance?"
"__MOVIES__ Will Smith in the movie The Legend of Bagger Vance, that Bagger Vance?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he had some real Yoda stuff going on for him."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed that movie, but it has been quite sometime when I last saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was made in 2000, so it is kind of old."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that movie was directed by Robert Redford?"
"__MOVIES__ He is a great director, I think I did know that but I forgot about it."
"__MOVIES__ Matt Damon and Charlize Theron were really good in it too."
"__MOVIES__ Matt Damon was so cute. I loved Adele Invergordon, Charlize's character in the move."
"__MOVIES__ She was a real spit fire wasn't she?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she was. What was the name of the golfer Matt played?"
"__MOVIES__ Rannulph Junuh, he was the narrators childhood idol."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's right. I liked the scene where Bagger could sense the movement of the grass by feeling the breeze of the wind."
"__MOVIES__ He would say little things that were sarcastic but had a real life lesson to it."
"__MOVIES__ I thought about some of his sayings about my life when I was watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Will Smith always has that cool factor about himself."
"__MOVIES__ I think he is probably like that in real life."
"__MOVIES__ Was Jack Lemmon, the one that was narrating the story."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he starts the story as a boy his name was Hardy Greaves, and he admired Rannulph Junuh so much."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, then he dies on the golf course playing golf, the game he loved his entire life."
