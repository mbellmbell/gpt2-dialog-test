"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Moana?"
"__DISNEY__ I have not. Have you?"
"__DISNEY__ No. But I want to. It looks really good."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know the premise behind it?"
"__DISNEY__ Not exactly. I think it has to do with her wanting to be on the ocean."
"__DISNEY__ I've heard the songs from it. They are really good but not as good as frozen."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know.  I personally think they are better, we just haven't heard them as much."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Frozen was wverywhere for awhile."
"__DISNEY__ I think it helped that they had a Broadway star singing the main song."
"__DISNEY__ Oh true. Idina Menzel was amazing!"
