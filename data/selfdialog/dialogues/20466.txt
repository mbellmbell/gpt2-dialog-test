"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was better than the first one, you?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure it was better. The first one was a real surprise."
"__MOVIES__ True, but the action sequences were better in number two and you got to learn more about Nebula."
"__MOVIES__ I guess, but I prefer Gamora. Zoe Saldana kicks butt."
"__MOVIES__ Can you believe what they did with Chris Pratt's character?"
"__MOVIES__ I know, right. But the clues were all in the first one. We knew his father had to be an alien."
"__MOVIES__ Who's your favorite of the Guardians?"
"__MOVIES__ Has to be Rocket. That guy cracks me up."
"__MOVIES__ I know, hard to believe it's Bradley Cooper doing the voice."
"__MOVIES__ I remember him from Alias, back in the day."
"__MOVIES__ I think GOTG 2 may be the best Marvel movie they ever made."
"__MOVIES__ Better than The Winter Soldier?"
"__MOVIES__ Tough call, but yes, I think so."
"__MOVIES__ Better than Deadpool?"
"__MOVIES__ Technically NOT part of the MCU like Never Say Never Again and James Bond."
"__MOVIES__ I get that, but it's still canon, just a slightly different universe."
"__MOVIES__ Can you imagine how cool it would be to get Deadpool on screen with the Avengers?"
"__MOVIES__ It would probably get real messy, real fast."
