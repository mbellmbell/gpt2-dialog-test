"__STAR_WARS__ We need more Chewbacca backstory!"
"__STAR_WARS__ We need Chewbacca to be more in the stories period!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, although people tend to feel that an over exposure of Chewie in the movies would ruin his mystery."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't agree with that at all. I think Chewbacca is a really interesting character. He's strong, brave, and so loyal!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you cry when he screamed in pain after Han died?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I knew exactly how Chewie felt. It was like he lost a brother not just a friend."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han and Chewie were basically family. All the adventures they went through."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. Chewie is awesome. He's like the big protective uncle in every family."
"__STAR_WARS__ The cool uncle you knew would have your back and help you out with things your own father wouldn't let you do."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a bit much, but yeah, Chewie needs his own story so us fans can really learn more about his background!"
