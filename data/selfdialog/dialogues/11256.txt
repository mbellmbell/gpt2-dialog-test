"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey did you know that football season starts soon?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I cannot wait for the NFL Draft"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know i'm hoping my team picks up some good players"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ oh yeah who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cincinnati Bengals, and yours?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same I'm a huge Bengals fan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Awesome I knew that there was a reason we got along so well"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what position do you think we need the most help in the draft for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say Quarterback but i'll give Dalton another chance"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we need another wide receiver"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Defintely AJ Green needs some help"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ agreed he doesn't get a lot of throws because he has no help on the other side of the field"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes being double teamed every game makes it tough for sure"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also think Marvin Lewis needs to be let go"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ for sure, he is mediocre at best"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mike Brown should probably get rid of him this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wont though because Marvin works cheap"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yup half what other coaches get"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ guess we will have another mediocre team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ sadly yes I agree"
