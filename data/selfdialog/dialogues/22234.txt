"__DISNEY__ Was inside out a disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes but also pixar, you know they sometimes do them together."
"__DISNEY__ Ah that makes sense. Felt a little different than regular disney animated films."
"__DISNEY__ I too notice the pixar flair in the collaborations they do."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe it is the actual annimation technique or drawings."
"__DISNEY__ Well whatever it is I enjoy it."
"__DISNEY__ Ya they seem to have a winning history. They did Up and Wall-e too."
"__DISNEY__ They have done so many good ones.  Brave was also a joint effort I believe."
"__DISNEY__ Brave was so good. Loved seeing a redhead for a change."
"__DISNEY__ Ya, I liked that aspect too. Also just how strong minded she was as well."
