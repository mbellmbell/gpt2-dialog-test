"__COMEDY__ What was the best Mel Brooks movie?"
"__COMEDY__ I would probably say Blazing Saddles."
"__COMEDY__ I would go with Young Frankenstein."
"__COMEDY__ That's a very solid choice."
"__COMEDY__ You can't go wrong with either of them really."
"__COMEDY__ I give the edge to Blazing Saddles only because it was a bit more raunchy."
"__COMEDY__ I thought it was an interesting take on race relations for sure."
"__COMEDY__ I don't think I ever saw the sheriff in another movie."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, that was pretty much his one shining moment."
"__COMEDY__ At least it was memorable for him."
