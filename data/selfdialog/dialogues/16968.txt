"__MOVIES__ Do yo like the movie versions of books?"
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes but I like to read the book first."
"__MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It gives me insight into the characters."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense actually."
"__MOVIES__ Whenever I see the movie first and then go back to read the book I learn something new about the characters."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't usually have time to read so the movie lets me at least know the story."
"__MOVIES__ No time to read?"
"__MOVIES__ Not usually."
"__MOVIES__ What movies have yo seen where you wanted to read the books?"
"__MOVIES__ The harry Potter ones definitely."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, those are great books and movies both."
"__MOVIES__ Lots of adventure but the books are so long."
"__MOVIES__ The first few aren't too bad."
"__MOVIES__ The last few books are huge."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ I work too much to get the time to read them so I watched them all last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a fun weekend."
