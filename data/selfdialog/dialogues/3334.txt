"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you like 80s music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I do!"
"__MUSIC__ What are some of your favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I really like Madonna. Her early stuff was great!"
"__MUSIC__ I like Madonna, too! What your favorite song by her?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a hard question. I guess it depends on my mood, but 'Like a Prayer' is really good."
"__MUSIC__ What about 'Vogue'?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that's a great one, too!"
"__MUSIC__ I've always liked her slower songs. 'Crazy for You' is really romantic."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me about it. My older sister used that as her wedding song."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she fell in love with it the first time she ever heard it."
"__MUSIC__ That's really sweet!"
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any of Madonna's newer stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I don't like much of anything she's done since 2000."
"__MUSIC__ I totally get that. It's always fun seeing her with younger performers though."
"__MUSIC__ You mean like Britney Spears and Lady Gaga?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ I like watching those performances, too. She's definitely a big influence on the female singers who came after her."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. She's a legend."
