"__DISNEY__ Did you watch The Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I remember Rafiki"
"__DISNEY__ He was some kind of medicine man"
"__DISNEY__ He was brutally honest with Simba"
"__DISNEY__ He put pressure on Simba that Nala may not have been able to do"
"__DISNEY__ I would have liked to see Simba stay in the jungle. At the point he returns, he was not aware of what was going on"
"__DISNEY__ There seemed to be a lack of male lions in that area"
"__DISNEY__ I think Rafiki gets credit for reconnecting Simba with his father"
"__DISNEY__ Simba's father was a positional leader to some extent"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he did not have a backup plan in place"
