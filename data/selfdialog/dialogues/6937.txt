"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, so did you see the latest Star Wars movie? The Force Awakens, I mean."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, of course. Like three times. Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, you remember that woman darth vader type? She led the stormtroopers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, you mean, Captain Phasma?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. That's her."
"__STAR_WARS__ So what about her?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I mean, I know she was the bad guy, but did you feel kind of bad for her? I mean, maybe it's sexist, but since she was a she, I don't know, I didn't want her to get hurt."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, she was kind of a killer though, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. And she's wearing armor too. Is it weird that I felt sympathy for her?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, maybe. I mean, maybe you just have a thing for bad girls."
