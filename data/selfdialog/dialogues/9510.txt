"__BASEBALL__ Baseball sure is a slow game. I don't recall it being so slow as a kid."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it is a lot slower than it was, say, 20-30 years ago."
"__BASEBALL__ I wonder why that is?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think, in part, it is due to the use of so many more specialist relievers."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean? How would that slow down the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, if you bring many more relievers into a game mid-inning, then they have to warm up and come in from the bullpen."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, yeah, that would slow down the game. Why else is the game slower now than it used to be?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, also you have to factor in reviewing questionable plays and the time that takes."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they have cut down that review time."
"__BASEBALL__ And, advertisements between innings are a little longer on average then they used to be 30 years ago."
"__BASEBALL__ All of this adds up to a much longer game and given this attention deficit-type of society, I can't see baseball being around much longer."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I don't know about that, but there are a few other ways they can speed up the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Like what?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, they could have advertisements only at the end of innings, not mid-inning."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't see that happen. The more revenue streams for broadcasts, the better. There not going to reduce their revenue."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe that's true, but there's not really a way to enforce a quicker game as the game is played today."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe it's the sports fan that has to adjust to devoting three-and-a-half hours to a game."
"__BASEBALL__ There's something to be said for that. Baseball is a past time, so we should take time out from our busy lives."
"__BASEBALL__ Who knows. It may be that they get rid of baserunning altogether, shaving game times by 30 minutes or so."
"__BASEBALL__ Only time will tell."
