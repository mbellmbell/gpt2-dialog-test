"__BASEBALL__ Do you like the San Diego Padres?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I'm not so sure about them."
"__BASEBALL__ They have a pretty young team this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, that is why they won't do very well this season."
"__BASEBALL__ At least the Padres aren't in last place!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, but being second to last place isn't something to be proud of."
"__BASEBALL__ But they do have some guys that have been banging out some homeruns."
"__BASEBALL__ That just isn't enough to be in the running for a playoff game anytime soon."
"__BASEBALL__ Now that the Chargers moved to LA who else do we have to root for?"
"__BASEBALL__ That's a good point!"
"__BASEBALL__ And you must admit attending a Padre's game is far more affordable than going to a Football game"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yes, and it is really cool how the Padres give awesome discounts to Veterans."
"__BASEBALL__ Are you a Veteran?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yes, my family couldn't afford to attend so many Padre's games otherwise."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about the pitching line-up?"
"__BASEBALL__ It really seems pretty hit and miss right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Would you agree the moral of the team is very positive this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, the guys really seem to be developing a positive, can-do attitude as a team?"
"__BASEBALL__ I for one plan to support our Padres, win or lose!"
"__BASEBALL__ Me too, it's not cool to be a fair weather fan."
