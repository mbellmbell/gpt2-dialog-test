"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think Rey's father is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely Palpatine."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Her fighting style, her aggressiveness, her Britishness."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have a better theory."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're demented, so this should be good."
"__STAR_WARS__ She's Luke and Leia's daughter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait...WHAT???"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they could have had sex during episodes IV-V, before Leia got with Han. Gotta do something for those long hyperspace flights. They didn't know yet either. Explains why she was dropped off: shamed the Jedi and the Senator."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're a horrible person. But that's good."
