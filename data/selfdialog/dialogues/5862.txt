"__STAR_WARS__ Do you know how Star Wars changed the toy industry?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They increased the sales of figure toys?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not exactly. They promoted the idea of a female character action figure, which had always been lacking before."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you mean Princess Leia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, Rey from The Force Awakens. Before her, there were rarely female action figures, because they just didn't sell well."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Rey was so popular it changed the demand?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. People had complained before about not being able to find female character figures, and even leading up to the movie there was no Rey. But after the movie came out, she was on everything, and outsold everyone except the villian character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet the times had a lot to do with the change. Girls and women are no longer shy about standing up and complaining through social media about unfair treatment."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now thanks to Rey, toy stores have all kinds of female action figures, like Wonder Woman and Batgirl."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kids have started to break molds now too about what they should be interested in playing with."
