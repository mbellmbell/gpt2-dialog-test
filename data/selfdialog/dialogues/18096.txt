"__MOVIES__ So, recently I saw the Spongebob Squarepants movie."
"__MOVIES__ Which one?  Wasn't there two of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Now that you mention it yeah... I saw the more recent one... Sponge Out of Water I think or something like that."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I was really, really disappointed.  The trailer made it look a LOT funnier than it was."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they can do that sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, it has all these quick edits, had Antonio Banderas playing an over the top villain, Guns N' Roses 'Welcome To The Jungle', all making it seem like a pretty exciting stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so what went wrong?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man, where to begin?  For starters, the part of them going into the real world does NOT occur until about an HOUR into the movie"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a bit of  wait!"
"__MOVIES__ I know!  The trailer makes it seem like all (or at least most) of the film is going to take place in the 'real' world, but it doesn't."
"__MOVIES__ I think I heard someone mention that as well..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and then get this, a lot of the jokes they had were edited so that they were less funny than in the travel."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there's a scene in the trailer where Patrick is on the beach and he looks up and sees a girl in a bikini eating an ice cream cone, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ So, he gets hearts in his eyes and he's like, 'Where have you been all my life!' And he jumps towards her and lands... right on her ice cream cone."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so it wasn't the girl he was looking at?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  But in the movie, they have that line, but they don't set it up like that.  They just have look at something off-screen, then cut to a ice cream shop.  Totally negating the joke."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like they dropped the ball on that one."
