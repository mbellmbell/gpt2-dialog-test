"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In the old movies or in the newer ones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What's the difference?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well he is a lot older when he fights with Rey, he was young before"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I like him more in the older movies"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was funnier and cuter!"
"__STAR_WARS__ My mom thinks he is still cute! That's so funny!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he was sassier and more sarcastic in the older ones"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I dont really like that, personally!"
