"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football season is almost here!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it is. Are you ready for some football!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. Falcons gonna take it all the way this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're crazy. How can they come back from that beat down in the last Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their offense is prolific. You'll see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Prolifically silly, considering the fumble they had last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Shut up! You know Matt Ryan was on fire last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but that's not enough for a ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever. Who will you root for this football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really have a team, but I like what the Raiders look like."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. They are going to be amazing, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too. Derek Carr is an amazing QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He reminds me a lot of Big Ben, actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that. I think he's better than Cam."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. He just needs a better supporting cast on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. Their offense wasn't the problem last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if anything, their offense was too good. Their defense was always back on the field so soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same issue you Falcons had in the Super Bowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, man, too soon. 28-3... I'll never forget it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good, don't! Use it for fuel next year and maybe they will win a Lombardi Trophy!"
