"__MUSIC__ What do you think of King of Limbs?"
"__MUSIC__ Is that a band?"
"__MUSIC__ No, no. I mean the album by Radiohead."
"__MUSIC__ When did it come out?"
"__MUSIC__ They put it out in 2007."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right. I was really excited when it came out. I'm a huge fan. But it left me dissapointed."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I didn't love it."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It was jarring. It wasn't the band that I recognized."
"__MUSIC__ I get that. But I was listening to it recently and was really digging it."
"__MUSIC__ But it can't hold up with their other stuff, can it?"
"__MUSIC__ No it really can. Some of the tunes on there are every bit as good as their best songs."
"__MUSIC__ Now you have me excited. Which songs should I listen to again?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say you should listen to 'Seperator' first."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Then what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, then after that you'll know that you were wrong before, and want to listen to the whole album."
"__MUSIC__ We'll see about that."
"__MUSIC__ We will. Tell me when you listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ I will. Thanks for the recommendation."
