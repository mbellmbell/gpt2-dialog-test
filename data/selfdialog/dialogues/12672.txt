"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL draft should be coming up soon. Are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, though I don't know how my Saints are going to do this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I didn't know you were a Saints fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Brees is arguably the best quarterback in the league so I represent them to the fullest!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's good but he's no Tom Brady. That's the team I'm looking forward to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots are a force but I feel like their time is up. You wait, my Saints are going to do great this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like Saints fans say that every year, but who knows."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny, but yes I am excited for the season and ready to see what each team can bring this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Other than the Saints, what other teams do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a fan of the Seahawks, as Marshawn Lynch is a beast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That he is, I'm sure even Brady was worried about facing him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, now that he's back with the Raiders it's definitely going to be a problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I forgot all about that! The NFL just got more entertaining now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, other than the Saints I'm definitely excited to watch him smash through defenses again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's always a highlight of the sport huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It certainly is. That and the way they can throw the ball so far down the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think we only have about a month before we can see other plays be drafted in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I always enjoy seeing fresh talent perform with the old ones. We saw how the Cowboys did with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely, and they only show signs of getting better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only time will tell, that's for sure."
