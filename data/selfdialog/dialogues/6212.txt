"__STAR_WARS__ So, what did you think of  Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, I didn't really like the beginning at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I agree, the first half hour of the movie was really slow."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and it seemed like there were four different beginnings all just bolted together."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the special effects were cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, everything in the movie looked really great, I just thought the plot wasn't that great."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they had to wrap everything up because it was a prequel but none of the characters are in any of the original movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, but why not just have the characters ride off into the sunset instead of killing everybody?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, I guess they wanted to make sure nobody would be expecting sequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess. I'm excited for the next side story movie, though."
