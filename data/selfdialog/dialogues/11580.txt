"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what I think is the dumbest way to use the running back is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, God Here we go. What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just letting run straight up the middle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um no that's one of the best ways"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh God, no. They either run into the asses of the offensive line or get tackled by the D line"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only if the O line didn't block properly. If they block well, the RB can pop out from the back with all the momentum and run straight through"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well that never happens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It happens all the time!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, who has the best rushing attacks this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably Falcons. Devonta Freeman, Tevion coleman,. Both beasts"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I liek those two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also like Zeke with cowboys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ zeke is a beast. You know who else is a beast?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I do.. I know who esle is a beast rusher. Le'veon Bell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Boom. Mic drop"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude is a beast. You know what we need?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I do. I know what we need. We need to get Zeke, Devonta, and Le'Veon on the same team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And just rotate them play after play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Run their defenses down, play after play"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then boom a hole will pop open and my boys go running with da ball!"
