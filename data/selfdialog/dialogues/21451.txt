"__DISNEY__ I like older, classic Disney films. Do you?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I love the classics. Lady and the Tramp is a favorite of mine."
"__DISNEY__ I loved that, too. Even though it was released in 1955, it's still one of the best in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ Jock is the cutest. He cracks me up the way he skips and buries his bones."
"__DISNEY__ I like all the characters. I couldn't stand the mean Aunt that came to stay with the baby."
"__DISNEY__ She was horrible, she was so mean to Lady."
"__DISNEY__ I also got upset with the coach hit Trusty in the end. I was worried he wouldn't make it."
"__DISNEY__ That was upsetting. He came through which is a good thing."
"__DISNEY__ I love Peggy Lee was great as Peg the shelter dog. She had such a beautiful voice in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know she also voiced the characters of Darling and the siamese cats?"
