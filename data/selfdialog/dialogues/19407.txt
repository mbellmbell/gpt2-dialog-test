"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite genre of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't really have one-- like for example, I could just watch horror movies the rest of my life.  I'd get bored of it.  I like variety."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough-- how about your favorite comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ There are so many sub-genres-- like, dark comedies, and slapstick comedies."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, well, narrow it down for me."
"__MOVIES__ Just a few I like are Big Lebowski, which I consider a comedy, but the humor isn't slapstick.  I don't know how I'd describe it."
"__MOVIES__ I like that movie too-- I think I'd describe the humor as witty, and subtle."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can agree with that.  As far as slapstick comedies, the Naked Gun series always makes me laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Me too-- Leslie Nielson was the greatest."
"__MOVIES__ I also have a soft spot for 80s teen comedies-- especially when they have a song you can tell was written for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of action movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I love Predator.  Did you know that Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally the Predator?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but they decided to make him larger and more imposing."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know how the idea of the Predator came about?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  How?"
"__MOVIES__ Some producer joked that Rocky had fought everyone but E.T."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, that's pretty funny.  I don't think I'd like to see that fight though-- I was conflicted with Rocky fought Hulk Hogan."
"__MOVIES__ I know right?  Who do you pull for there?"
"__MOVIES__ I always liked Die Hard-- especially Die Hard: With a Vengeance."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that the writers of that movie were actually interrogated because the crime was so logical and realistic?"
