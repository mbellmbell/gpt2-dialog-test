"__MUSIC__ So I know you love oldies.  Who is your favorite oldies band?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh definitely the Temptations!  Their music is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I love their music too!  I think they are on my list of favorites too."
"__MUSIC__ They were originally called the Elgins when they started up in 1960"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I had no idea!  That's random."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and did you know that even just a few years ago they were still performing?"
"__MUSIC__ All five of them together?"
"__MUSIC__ No, only one of them is still in the current Temptations but still."
"__MUSIC__ I bet they don't sound the same."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they're definitely not as good as the original."
"__MUSIC__ So what are your favorite Temptations songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I love My Girl and Just My Imagination."
"__MUSIC__ I love those too!  And Ain't Too Proud to Beg is amazing also."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were also incredible dancers."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  That made their music even stronger."
"__MUSIC__ Course so many of the Motown bands were fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I think the Temptations were some of the best that Motown brought to the table."
"__MUSIC__ No doubt!  I'd love to see the new ones perform live, even though it's not the original band."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you could probably catch them.  It was just 2015 that they were around I heard."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if they're still touring."
