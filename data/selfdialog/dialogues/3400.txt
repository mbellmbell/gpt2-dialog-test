"__MUSIC__ Who's the greatest frontman of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ By that you mean lead vocalist?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, who's the greatest lead vocalist of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Easy. Freddy Mercury."
"__MUSIC__ I can't really argue too much with that. Queen is an all time great band, and Freddy Mercury was the heart of Queen."
"__MUSIC__ It's all about that magnetism on stage. You couldn't keep from focusing on him at all times."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of magnetism - What about Prince?"
"__MUSIC__ Does Prince even count as a frontman?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he was the lead singer in all his songs."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I just think of a frontman more in the context of vocalist, lead guitar, rythym guitar, bass guitar, drums. Prince's music is a little more outside the box."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, but I still think he could count as a frontman."
"__MUSIC__ Prince was pretty electric himself. But I'd still take Freddy Mercury."
"__MUSIC__ How about Keith Morrison?"
"__MUSIC__ The Doors were a little bit before my time. Plus, how much of that was lifestyle and hype versus actual musicianship."
"__MUSIC__ For a frontman, the lifestyle and hype can be just as important as the music."
"__MUSIC__ I don't agree. The bottom line is always the music."
"__MUSIC__ I just think that Rock n Roll as a concept goes beyond music. It's a lifestyle, a spirit or attitude."
"__MUSIC__ For sure, it is. But the music is the foundation."
"__MUSIC__ I can't disagree. And Freddie Mercury's music was wonderful."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's sad he's not with with us anymore."
