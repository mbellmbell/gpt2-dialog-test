"__STAR_WARS__ Who was the baddest bad guy in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Easy, Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Nah, he goes soft in the end"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well who do you think was the baddest?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Maul. That guy was pure evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way! He dies super quick in the first prequel."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well yeah, but he was like really evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ If that's your qualification then the Emperor was the baddest."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, I totally forgot about him. Yeah he's the baddest."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm still going with Vader."
