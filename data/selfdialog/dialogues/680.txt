"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to Dr. Dre?"

"__MUSIC__ Well, he's definitely one of the best hip hop artists of all time I would say."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard a few of his songs.  What makes him so great?"
"__MUSIC__ He was the producer of Death Row Records, which had so many great artists such as Snoop Dogg, 2pac, Xzibit, and many others."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, yeah that is impressive.  Tell me more about him!"
"__MUSIC__ He had a solo album in 1992 called the Chronic, it was pretty amazing too."
"__MUSIC__ I might've heard of that one, what were some songs from it?"
"__MUSIC__ Let Me Ride was the hit single, I think it won a grammy."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I think I've heard that."
"__MUSIC__ And you may not have known that Warren G was his step-brother.  He helped him rise to fame."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, that's wild!  No, I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  He created the careers of so many great artists."
"__MUSIC__ That's really impressive."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and he's been in a bunch of movies too, like Set It Off and Training Day."
"__MUSIC__ So what's unique about his music style?"

"__MUSIC__ What is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's hip hop music with low bass beats.  It sounds great."
"__MUSIC__ I'll definitely listen to him a little more now that I know all this about him."
