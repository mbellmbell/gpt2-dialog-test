"__STAR_WARS__ Are you excited about the new force awakens movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I am glad they finally came away from all of that nonsense Episode 1, 2 & 3."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean? It was great to see the back story of Darth Vader and Obi Wan having the lead."
"__STAR_WARS__ Anakin, aka young Vader was so dreadful to watch, not to mention even Samuel Jackson's part couldnt liven things up much."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see what you mean. I am excited about the new characters. It is great to see Chewbacca return, and BB-8 is so lovable."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do like seeing the old school movies mixed with the new story line. Po and Fin are both entertaining characters to watch."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like what they have done with all of the storm troopers, too. They aren't just one kind, like in attack of the clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the storm troopers have all kinds of different weapons and obvious ranks, it makes the fight scenes that much more intriguing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't wait to see who the new ultimate bad guy is. I think Snoke may be his name."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yes, he sounds like a good nemesis. Hopefully he is very powerful and gets a good story line."
