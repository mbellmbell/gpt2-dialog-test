"__LADY_GAGA__ It's so nice to see Lady Gaga branch out in her music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. I think people underestimated her singing ability when she first became really popular."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh I think so too, but her album with Tony Bennett really shows of her vocal ability."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What was that called again?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Cheek to Cheek. It won a Grammy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wow, that's amazing."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She sounds great in her new song Million Reasons, as well."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. I like her songs that have a slower tempo like Dope."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love that song. I think I heard it was about her battle with addiction."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wow, it must be such a meaningful song to her."
