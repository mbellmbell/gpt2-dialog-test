"__MOVIES__ You've got to have at least a top five list of all-time favorite movies, let me hear them."
"__MOVIES__ I guess Caddyshack, Super Troopers, Anchorman, Step Brothers, and The Hangover. Yours?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh shoot I have so many! The Hangover and Anchorman I can agree with but you forgot Superbad, 21 Jump Street and Shaun of the Dead!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, 21 Jump Street was hilarious, 'Use your words, use your words!' But 22 Jump Street or whatever it's called was horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Horrible Bosses with Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis? Funniest matchup but what did you think of the sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, not as good but it had its moments. I forgot about This is The End! That was a nice surprise but Hot Tub Time Machine was better."
"__MOVIES__ Best part of that one was Craig Robinson but the 2nd really stunk. You know what other sequel was a dud?"
"__MOVIES__ There are too many but I'm going to go with Anchorman 2 - what a waste of time! Oh what about Dumb and Dumber Too?"
"__MOVIES__ Anchorman 2 was painful to watch and Dumb and Dumber Too was a fat waste of awesome talent."
"__MOVIES__ I'm really surprised that Will Ferrell and Company allowed that one out there. What were they thinking?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know but I do know how fast they like to get these crappy movies out there."
"__MOVIES__ True Story! Hey, what's one of your favorite quotes from Wedding Crashers?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha! That's tough too, let's see...oh yeah when that lady said, 'You shut your mouth when you're talking to me!' I use that all the time!"
"__MOVIES__ What about Caddyshack? 'Don't sell yourself short Judge, you're a tremendous slouch.' Classic!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Ty is completely underrated! So sad that Harold Ramis is actually gone."
"__MOVIES__ And Ted Knight! I think his innotation was spot on!"
"__MOVIES__ So was Carl's, 'Cinderella story, outta nowhere!' Bill Murray is still pretty good with a kind of dry humor."
"__MOVIES__ He was in Stripes wasn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah - who else was in that who died young?"
"__MOVIES__ John Candy! Yeah, rest in peace big fella."
