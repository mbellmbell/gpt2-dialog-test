"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about those Jets this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh, don't remind me! They look bad!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They ever get their quarterback situation squared away?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck no! That offense is going to be putrid!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What a shame, they have a really good defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they definitely know how to build a defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they even have a mediocre offense, that team's a contender."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotta get that Patriots monkey off their back, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're gonna have to wait until Brady retires."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady's going to die before he retires at this rate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, that may be true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus I think whoever may take over for Brady may be effective in Belichick's scheme."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what makes him a great coach, he knows how to play to players strengths."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They get a lot of these guys, and they always seem to work, no matter who they are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's really amazing, the guy's a Hall of Fame coach"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First ballot, for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least Buffalo and Miami aren't serious contenders right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You might be right about Buffalo, but I dunno about Miami, they just need to get over the hump themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a lot of talent!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if it wasn't for New England and Brady and Belichick I think the Dolphins are the best team in the AFC East,"
