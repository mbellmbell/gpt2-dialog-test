"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, when does the NFL season start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think preseason starts in mid-September."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Awesome, I can't wait.  Who's playing first?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Chiefs and the Patriots are the first game in preseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That'll be an easy win for the patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think so? I think the chiefs are looking pretty good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so, who do they have that's any good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding me?  They've got Travis Kelce and Kniles Davis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but a team isn't going to succeed with a good Tight End and a decent running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've got more than that man, I'm not a chiefs fan, but I'm not going to deny talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else do they have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Spencer Ware is going to break out and Nick Foles gets better every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nick foles is garbage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No he's not, he's much better now than when he was on the Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll give you that. But doesn't make them good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Andy Reid will do some good things this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Super Bowl good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not at all haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, so at least we can agree on that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, alright man, have a good one."
