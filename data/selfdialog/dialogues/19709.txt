"__MOVIES__ So then what is a 'movie' in your view?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think we should go back as far as the beginning of the motion photography in order to discuss what a movie is, That's just goes too far"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, then how far back is necessary?"
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't even go back to silent motion picture era."
"__MOVIES__ And, now you're just being stupid. Don't be silly. of course we have to include the silent pictures"
"__MOVIES__ How do you figure that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, one of the greatest actors bridged both the silent and sound era. Chalie Chaplin"
"__MOVIES__ So?"
"__MOVIES__ Now you're just being stubborn. if our definition of movies do not include silent picture becaue you don't like it, then  Charlie Chaplin is one the greatest actor of all time!"
"__MOVIES__ I am totally Ok with that."
"__MOVIES__ There is no talking with you."
"__MOVIES__ Ok Fine, then what do you say a movie is?"
"__MOVIES__ A movie is an art form, by consensus, most film historian agree that the very first movie was introduced around 1900"
"__MOVIES__ That's a convenient, nice, rounded number."
"__MOVIES__ Well up until that point, the footages were quite limited, it wasn't until 1896, when melles built his studio and began distributing short films, that the industry really took shape."
"__MOVIES__ Well, i've never heard of Melles."
"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of 'A trip to the moon?'"
"__MOVIES__ No."
"__MOVIES__ I really have no idea why I even started this conversation with you..."
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea either. And I still think silent movies aren't even movies and they suck."
