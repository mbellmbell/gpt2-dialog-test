"__MUSIC__ Are you a Jennifer Nettles fan?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. Who is she?"
"__MUSIC__ She used to be the lead singer of the group Sugarland, but she's done a lot of solo stuff the past few years."
"__MUSIC__ I like Sugarland. I know who you mean."
"__MUSIC__ Sugarland started in Atlanta and consisted of Jennifer Nettles, Kristen Hall, and Kristian Bush in the beginning."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, didn't Kristen quit the group a few years ago?"
"__MUSIC__ She did, 'supposidley' to write more rather than performing."
"__MUSIC__ Jennifer has a very noticeable voice."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I have followed her since about 2001 when she was still a part of the Jennifer Nettles Band, just before Sugarland."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a long time."
"__MUSIC__ She was in another band before that called 'Soul Miner's Daughter.'"
"__MUSIC__ I think I remember hearing of that band. Didn't they have a kinda hippy vibe?"
"__MUSIC__ Sorta. They were excellent, and some of my favorite music is from them."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she have a baby recently?"
"__MUSIC__ She had a little boy about 3 years ago named Magnus."
"__MUSIC__ That's a rather odd name for a child."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I feel like motherhood has somewhat changed her music too."
"__MUSIC__ Really? How?"
"__MUSIC__ The content and songs on her newest album are not as edgy and more subdued. I think there's even a song or two on it about being a mom."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that sounds like a change."
