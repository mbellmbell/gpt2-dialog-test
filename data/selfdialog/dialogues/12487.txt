"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL Season is upon us. Who do you think will win it all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate to say it, but you gotta go with the Patriots right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know but I'm a little tired of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand that, but how can you bet against Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really can't but hopefully some other teams give it a go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I believe the Steelers still have a chance to take them down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking Dallas had a chance this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might have a chance but they are still a young team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are an exciting team, and have some talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand that, but I don't think Dak, and Zeek are ready for that next step."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you don't think they can take it then who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only a handful of teams look good enough. Maybe Atlanta, Steelers like I said, Seattle, or Green Bay"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't stand any of those teams. Hopefully there will be surprise this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There always seem to be a team or two who comes out of nowhere in the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that is why I love the NFL, more than any of the other major sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sports has been very dull without NFL over past few months."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has been but only 2 months before we get NFL Countdown on ESPN."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also only a month before we start drafting our fantasy teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man all this talk is just getting me excited, I really can't wait...Just hate winter will follow with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha. That is the only downfall of the football season, is it does get cold."
