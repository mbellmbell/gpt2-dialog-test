"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you know the band Blue October?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so, the name doesn't sound familiar. What are some of the songs they sing that I might recognize?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, a few of their most popular songs are Hate Me and Into the Ocean. Do they sound familiar?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, yes, at least I know Hate Me and I really like that song, didn't realize that was the band that sang it though."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I know they are an Alternative rock band, but they have several songs that really touch me. Not your typical alternative rock songs."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I think Hate Me is actually a pretty song, but it is definitely alternative rock."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they released a song in 2013 named Fear and I really find it to be an inspiring song."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, well, now I want to listen to it for sure! Why do you find it inspiring?"
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics encourage you to conquer your fears in life, that if it knocks you down to keep getting back up. It also tells you to turn to God during this time and he will help you."
"__MUSIC__ Well, cool! That isn't the kind of lyrics you usually expect from an alternative rock band, to be perfectly honest."
"__MUSIC__ I know! I was pleasantly surprised with the message when I really listened to the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I am definitely going to listen to it when I get home. Any other good ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Home was released in 2016. The album is also named Home."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, what do the lyrics tell you in this one?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, this is about the enduring, constant love between husband and wife, children and parents. Basically, the family unit."
"__MUSIC__ Well, sounds pretty, and different. Is it a slower song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, beautiful melody and I love it. Sends the message of a happy, life-long love."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so sweet and touching. Do you cry when you hear it?"
"__MUSIC__ Every time! I bet you will too."
"__MUSIC__ I am sure I will. I will think of my parents love for one another, and their family."
