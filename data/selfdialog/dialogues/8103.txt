"__POP__ You know what's funny?"
"__POP__ What?"
"__POP__ I really try not to like Justin Bieber's music and I actually like a lot of it. I wish he didn't sing pop music so I wouldn't hear it on the radio all the time."
"__POP__ I understand how a lot of people are turned off by his personality."
"__POP__ That's exactly my problem, but I like a lot of his music."
"__POP__ I thought he was done being popular but then he came back in 2015 and released that song Sorry and I knew that was going to be a big hit."
"__POP__ I have to admit, I do like the album Sorry is on. That one is named Purpose right?"
"__POP__ Yes, that album is Purpose and it also has What Do You Mean and Love Yourself on there as well."
"__POP__ Is that his fourth album?"
"__POP__ Yes, plus he's done a ton of collaborations with other artists on their records, like DJ Snake and too many others to name."
