"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen any Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course, I am a huge fan!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh sweet! Me too. Which movie is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would probably have to say Prisoner of Azkaban."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's definitely a good one. Are you a big Sirius Black fan?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No. I mean I like him, but I really like Lupin."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Lupin is a great guy. Is he your favorite part of the movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm not sure. He's one of them anyway. I love the scene when they are practicing fighting Boggarts."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah really. That one is funny. Snape dressed up as Neville's grandma had me laughing so hard."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ha! 'Riddikulus' and Draco says 'This class is ridiculous.' Too funny!"
