"__MOVIES__ Do you have Netflix?"
"__MOVIES__ I do, why?"
"__MOVIES__ You should at least check out some of the documentaries on there, even if you don't use it for movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I have actually seen a few!"
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, which ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Princess of Versailles was a really interesting one."

"__MOVIES__ I think I've seen every documentary on Netflix!"
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, especially anything having to do with politics."

"__MOVIES__ Do you remember what it was called?"
