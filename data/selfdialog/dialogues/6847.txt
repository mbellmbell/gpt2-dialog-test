"__STAR_WARS__ So do Han and Leia ever have a child?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well they cant now"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right but in the time between the 6th and 7th do you think theyll write in they had a child?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sort of like how Luke found out he was Vader's child?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, can you see that happening?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be too easy of a plot line."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Rey would serve as a good one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I dont think they would pick that low hanging fruit."
"__STAR_WARS__ Could you see them having a child on the dark side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be more of a probability for this film series"
