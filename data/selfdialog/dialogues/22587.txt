"__DISNEY__ I think Inside Out is Disney's deepest movie yet."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you think that?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it looks at all the human emotions and puts a classic disney twist on it."
"__DISNEY__ That's true, but what about the movie The Chronicles of Narnia."
"__DISNEY__ Why was that movie deep?"
"__DISNEY__ Well there were tons of symbols in that movie that everyone was talking about."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I guess maybe that could be a prett deep movie as well."
"__DISNEY__ It might even have more symbols that Inside Out!"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe we should watch the both of them again. What do you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure, how about tonight?"
