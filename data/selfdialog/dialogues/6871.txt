"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I have and a I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was you favorite character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jynn Erso, because she's kind of a croos bewteen Han Solo and Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean, how is she a cross between those two?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, like like Leia she is a strong, confident woman, but like Han, she starts out fairly mercernary, but becomes a beleiver in the cause."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, I see your point. Any of the new elements added for the film that you particularly liked."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Death trooper, those black armored elite Stormtroopers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, how come?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because they put the threat and menace back into the Stormtrooper. I mean, after being defeated by Ewoks, did regular Stormtrooper intimidate you anymore?"
