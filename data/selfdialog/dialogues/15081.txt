"__ACTION__ The Raid: Redemption is one of the best action movies ever."
"__ACTION__ I saw it, it felt like the movie barely slowed down."
"__ACTION__ The first half is so depressing, with all the heroes run through a meat grinder."
"__ACTION__ And then when it did slow down after that, with the guy hiding in the wall and the machete cutting him, the tension was so unbelievably high."
"__ACTION__ Oh god and then after that it just keeps on being this relentless martial arts movie."
"__ACTION__ It just didn't stop."
"__ACTION__ That last fight with Mad Dog was wild."
"__ACTION__ I know; I felt like the actors were just as exhausted as the characters."
"__ACTION__ I can't believe the skill and stamina they had. That was a nonstop movie."
"__ACTION__ I wish more action movies were like that!"
