"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Cincinnati Reds baseball game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, it was another poor performance by their starting pitcher."
"__BASEBALL__ I know.  Its sad that they have everything they need to win except the starters."
"__BASEBALL__ It has really hurt them that Bailey and Desclafani have been injured all year."
"__BASEBALL__ That is so true!  The Cubs aren't nearly as good this year so the Reds could have contended with even a marginal starting staff."
"__BASEBALL__ I know.  Its going to be another long year."
"__BASEBALL__ At least we have Votto and Cozart to watch."
"__BASEBALL__ Votto is always great but where did Cozart learn to hit all of the sudden?"
"__BASEBALL__ The announcers were saying Cozart had a new stance that allowed him to be much more relaxed at the plate."
"__BASEBALL__ Whatever he is doing is working.  He should be the All Star shortstop this year."
"__BASEBALL__ He should be but with all those Cub and Cardinals fans voting for their players he probably won't be."
"__BASEBALL__ They start a series with Colorado tonight so that probably means a lot more runs scored.  Those guys can really hit."
"__BASEBALL__ At least it is at home.  The Reds play much better there."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, we can be thankful the game won't be in the thin air of Colorado where the Rockies really hit."
"__BASEBALL__ How about we see if we can catch a game on Sunday?"
"__BASEBALL__ That sounds great to me.  I haven't had a chance to see them live this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Great! I'll check to see what tickets are still available."
"__BASEBALL__ I wonder who the starting pitcher for the Reds is Sunday?"
"__BASEBALL__ I am not sure it matters; they are all bad."
"__BASEBALL__ That is sad but true."
