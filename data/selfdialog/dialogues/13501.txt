"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team in the NFL is your favorite?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I live in New York City, so I should like the Giants or the Jets, but instead I like the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?! Why don't you like the Giants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know... I just don't. I'm not a fan of Eli Manning or any other players on that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think Manning's just OK but they do have some superstars, actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like who, for instance?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Odell Beckham, Jr., one of the greatest wide receivers in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, all right. I guess you have a point there. Who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Weston Richburg and Jason Pierre-Paul."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, you've made your point. But whenever the Patriots play the Giants, you know who I'll be rooting for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it tough to be a Patriots fan in New York?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, no. You'd be surprised how many there are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the Jets are the Patriots' big rivals... not the Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but the Patriots have faced the Giants in the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's gotten ugly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, the Patriots are better than both of those teams, you have to admit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I admit that the Patriots are better than the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's pretty obvious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets have been terrible for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They actually had winning seasons in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2015, but they've been struggling overall for years and years."
