"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to anything by Great Big Sea?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ They are really good, think of a modern folk music group."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? Like what kind of songs?"
"__MUSIC__ They do a lot of variety, I originally started listening to them for their sea shanty type songs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, those are always good."
"__MUSIC__ They do other stuff too, covers of various songs like 'End of the World'"
"__MUSIC__ A good song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like their music because it tends to tell a story."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of stories do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, a lot their songs tell stories about the sea as I mentioned earlier. One of my favorites is about a mermaid."
"__MUSIC__ How does that go?"
"__MUSIC__ It is a goofy song. It tells the story of a sailor who sees a mermaid falls in love with specifically her top human half"
"__MUSIC__ That seems pretty normal."
"__MUSIC__ It is, but then it goes on to talk about how he sees her sister, who is a fish on the top and human on bottom. And you can see how that would help."
"__MUSIC__ Heh, I can see how. That sounds pretty neat, I may have to pick up an album from them."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely recommend it, they have a lot of good songs."
"__MUSIC__ Any suggestions on which to pick up?"
"__MUSIC__ Sea of No Cares is a good one. Safe on the Shore is also nice."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I will have to look into that."
