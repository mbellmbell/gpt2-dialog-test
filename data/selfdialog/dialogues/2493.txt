"__MUSIC__ Hey B! What are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Just some funk music, old school tunes mostly."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by funk music?"
"__MUSIC__ You know, old school Parliament Funkadelic, Red Hot Chili Peppers..."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of both of them!"
"__MUSIC__ You like p-Funk or RHCP?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the new Chili Peppers album, the one that came out a couple years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Ah yeah, I gave that a listen. They've kind of strayed from the funk."
"__MUSIC__ I think that is why I like them now, they are more pop rock which is cool."
"__MUSIC__ That works, but I'd recommend checking out their earlier albums."
"__MUSIC__ Which one's do you like in particular?"
"__MUSIC__ Mother's Milk, By The Way, all really emotional albums."
"__MUSIC__ Those have weird titles, I might give them a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, tell me if you like them! And don't forget Californication!"
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard that song before!"
"__MUSIC__ It's arguably their best track, and in my opinion for sure their best album."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite Chili Pepper's song?"
"__MUSIC__ Ahh that is a tough one. I'd have to say Parallel Universe."
"__MUSIC__ That is a great track title!"
"__MUSIC__ They are great period!"
