"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, man. About a month left before football starts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More like about a month left before Brady get shis sixth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, man, here we go. They won't even take the AFC this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, you're crazy. Who's gonna beat them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know... Just potentially the Chiefs, Ravens, Raiders, Steelers, or Bengals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the team they beat to go to the Super Bowl last year is somehow going to beat them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a new season, man. Anyone can win!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, besides the Bills!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That much is true. That's a universal truth: the Bills are terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But seriously, the Pats have the best team. How can you deny this?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not denying it. But there are some other great teams in the NFL this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys look great too, I will admit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Them. Also, I think the Falcons are gonna stay consistent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Blah, blah, blah. They can never recover from that last Super Bowl embarrassment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see! They will definitely be in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where they'll fizzle out! I wonder if they can even beat the Panthers this year!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, come on. Cam is done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How is Cam done? He was MVP two seasons ago!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he peaked, if you ask me!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I guess we will see in about a month!"
