"__LADY_GAGA__ I think they are great! They both are good at sharing time and making sure that their styles are incorporated."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you like Video Phone or Telephone?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I prefer Telephone because it has a better dance beat, but Video phone is fun and sexy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I really like the Video Phone music video, personally, because of all the different styles Beyonce wears."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me too! I just mean that I like to work out and dance to Telephone better, but the Video Phone video is better than Telephone."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree totally. Which vocals do you like better Beyonce's or Lady Gaga's in Telephone?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like Lady Gaga's more because she has a bit more energy. What about you?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like Beyonce's a bit better because she sounds like you don't want to mess with her. What about the vocals in Video Phone?"
