"__DISNEY__ What did you think of the live-action Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, I think I like the animated one better."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I thought the live-action one was pretty good."
"__DISNEY__ It just felt like it was copying the animated movie. It had all the same songs."
"__DISNEY__ They're great songs, though!"
"__DISNEY__ They are! But if you want to hear 'Tale as Old as Time,' why not just watch the animated movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought Emma Watson was great as Belle."
"__DISNEY__ She was pretty good. But I thought the special effects looked kind of weird."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I like them both."
"__DISNEY__ The live-action one wasn't bad. But the animated one is a true classic."
