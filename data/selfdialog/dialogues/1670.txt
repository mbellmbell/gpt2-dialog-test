"__MUSIC__ Like we saw in Genesis and Chronicles, there is a lot of examples of music in Biblical times."
"__MUSIC__ Are all of them as uplifting as the ones we have already reviewed?"
"__MUSIC__ If your look at Exodus chapter 32 and verse 18, you will find an answer of sorts."
"__MUSIC__ 'But Moses replied: 'No, it's not a cry of victory or defeat, but singing''."
"__MUSIC__ I notice you have an American Standard version in your bookcase. Can I borrow it just one moment, please?"
"__MUSIC__ No problem, would you like to read the scripture from there?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, I found it. 'And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear'"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I perceive a more colorful verse in this one."
"__MUSIC__ It's interesting that in here, the singing of the israelites was referred to as 'noise'"
"__MUSIC__ I remember when my daughter was a baby, she would start singing out loud and I said, 'come on ,stop that noise!'"
"__MUSIC__ So it means this time God was not pleased at all when his chosen people started singing."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they did not have any singing talent at all?"
"__MUSIC__ It is actually related with the subject of their singing."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember the story of the Golden Calf?"
"__MUSIC__ I remember having seen it in the 'Ten Commandments ' movie."
"__MUSIC__ Remember why Moses broke the tables of stone when he heard them singing?"
"__MUSIC__ If I'm right, he was displeased they were singing to a golden idol that was not approved by God."
"__MUSIC__ So it is very interesting that music has a lot of power and influence in the things we do."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a power that should be mastered carefully"
