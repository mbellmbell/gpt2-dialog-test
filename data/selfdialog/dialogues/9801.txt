"__COMEDY__ Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite?"
"__COMEDY__ I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever."
"__COMEDY__ You think so, how come?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, Superbad is super funny."
"__COMEDY__ You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ I didn't know that you saw Superbad before."
"__COMEDY__ I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out. I love Michael Cera."
"__COMEDY__ I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie. I especially loved the scenes at the party."
"__COMEDY__ I was laughing hysterically the whole time; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards."
