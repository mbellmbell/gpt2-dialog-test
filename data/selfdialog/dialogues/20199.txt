"__MOVIES__ The horror genre intrigues me, but I have to admit that I don't know many good horror movies to see."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you could start with The Exorcist, considered by many to be the best and scariest movie of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know if that's a good one to start on for a novice like me. It might be too scary."
"__MOVIES__ Perhaps. Maybe you can let me know if you like gore, supernatural, or monsters."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I do find supernatural movies to be interesting - ghosts and the like, but I like the other subgenres you mentioned, too."
"__MOVIES__ Well, in terms of ghost or haunting movies... I found the original Paranormal Activity to be very scary. It kept me up for days."
"__MOVIES__ But is that considered a classic?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it might be in time. In terms of a classic supernatural movie, you might try The Shining."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have heard a lot about that one. Do you like it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's an extraordinary movie that can be watched over and over. There are some many different levels to this movie. You should see it."
"__MOVIES__ What about monster movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, since it seems like you are into classics, you should try either the Universal movies of the 30's and 40's or the Hammer moves of the 50's and 60's."
"__MOVIES__ What's the difference between Hammer and Universal?"
"__MOVIES__ Universal is the studio that introduced the world to Dracula and Frankenstein. Hammer is a British studio that also incorporated their own spin on these movie monsters."
"__MOVIES__ I guess to round it out, what about gore or slasher movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there's always the Halloween and Friday the 13th movies - they really started the slasher movies of the late 1970's and early 1980's."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I'm not sure about those."
"__MOVIES__ Well, a more sophisticated movie might be Silence of the Lambs."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that - it creeped me out! So many avenues which to pursue."
"__MOVIES__ Horror is the gift that keeps on giving!"
