"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it too, but it wasn't my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ None of the characters seemed really fleshed out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I thought that way too."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was fine, but I didn't understand the huge hype."
"__STAR_WARS__ Neither did I, to be honest."
"__STAR_WARS__ Still, it was good."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree."
