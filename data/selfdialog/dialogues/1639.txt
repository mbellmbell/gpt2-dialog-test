"__MUSIC__ Man, k-pop is pretty weird."
"__MUSIC__ What's k-pop?"
"__MUSIC__ It's Korean pop music, and I think I'm going a little crazy watching these music videos."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, if they're anything like Japanese animation videos, I know what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ They're not, they're a lot different and feature hot girls in cartoon bubblegum lands dancing around."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds fine to me. What's the music like?"
"__MUSIC__ K-pop is like pop on steroids, and it sounds like it's made in a computer."
"__MUSIC__ So why have singers at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Because the 'singers' are really just dancers and make your heart flutter."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe all music should be like k-pop then."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not, I think the world would go crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Have a favorite k-pop group or song?"
"__MUSIC__ Fantastic Baby by BigBang is really cool. It's a story about the start of the universe."
"__MUSIC__ I thought they would just sing about love and happiness and stuff."
"__MUSIC__ No, k-pop can be pretty heady stuff sometimes. That's what I mean when I say I'm going crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Well don't go too crazy! You need to be sane for when I show you my favorite music."
"__MUSIC__ I don't even want to know."
"__MUSIC__ It's k-metal. It's hot Korean girls playing heavy metal with giant wigs."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I believe you, but that sounds great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, let's check it out, I have it on my computer here."
