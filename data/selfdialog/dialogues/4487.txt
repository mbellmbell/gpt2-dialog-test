"__MUSIC__ Do you remember The Fat Boys?"
"__MUSIC__ You talking about those three heavy weight rappers from the eighties?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's them."

"__MUSIC__ They had a few. I like the one called In Jail."
"__MUSIC__ I like All You Can Eat."
"__MUSIC__ Really I think those are the only two that were worth listening to."
"__MUSIC__ I remember the light-skin one tried to go solo."
"__MUSIC__ You talking about Marky-D."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was him. He made a solo slow jam type love song."
"__MUSIC__ What was the name of it?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember. I can google it real quick."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah do that."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. It was called I Don't Want To Lose Your Love."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Why'd you say wow?"
"__MUSIC__ Because he made a few solo albums. I thought he only made one."
"__MUSIC__ Good ole Prince Markie Dee. Too funny."
"__MUSIC__ I know right."
"__MUSIC__ I guess we didn't know he made more than one solo album because the music was wack."
"__MUSIC__ And he is still alive. I know one of them died and for some reason I thought it was him."
