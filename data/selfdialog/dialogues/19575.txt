"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite actor?"
"__MOVIES__ That is way too broad a question."
"__MOVIES__ How is that Broad, it's a basic Question?"
"__MOVIES__ No, cause you didn't specify genre or medium."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, you've lost me now."
"__MOVIES__ Well I have a few favorites, but they work in movies, TV, horror, comedy, etc. and you didn't ask me any of that."
"__MOVIES__ Fine, Movies, Comedy, anything else mister picky?"
"__MOVIES__ Ok then, no we have a question. Comedy Movies, definitely Jim Carey."
"__MOVIES__ That was not worth you going through all those details."
"__MOVIES__ Well if you had said Action Movies then I'd have said Gerard Butler."
"__MOVIES__ Ok now you're just making it weirder."
"__MOVIES__ Hey you're the one that's going around asking unanswerable questions."
"__MOVIES__ So you're saying if Jim Carey and Gerard Butler were in a movie together, you couldn't pick your favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that is exactly what I'm saying, but I watch watch that movie many, many times."
"__MOVIES__ Well in any case, Jim Carey was actually my favorite too, ever since he was the Riddler."
"__MOVIES__ That was a great Batman, he was the only option for that too."
"__MOVIES__ Well he does have a great ere of enthusiasm around him in pretty much all of his movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well even though he's not my favorite thriller actor, I did love him in the number 23. It was incredible."
"__MOVIES__ We're not starting that again, but I agree that movie was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ It's not my fault that narrowing the range of talents we see on those twinkling screens to a generic skill set is just wrong to me."
