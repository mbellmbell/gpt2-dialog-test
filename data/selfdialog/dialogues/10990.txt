"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jacob, what's going today with the watch party?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the football watch party?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah man the Panther game, I have to see them win!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are they playing today?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are playing the Saints, I have to invest time into this team with their new rookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the new rookie?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You haven't heard they picked up Christian McCaffrey?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hadn't heard, what position does he play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a swift running back and I can see him doing well the blitz play offense of the Panths."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish you guys luck in that one, come over soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks man, will do!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget that there are some Saints fans that might show up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is alright, I will just keep my jersey at home to remain neutral."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You won't be neutral when the Saints score!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How dare you say that, I got faith in the rookie squad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carolina is solid but the Saints run the East now!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody runs Tom Brady, but they are definitely good with Drew."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It should be a good matchup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Indeed, see you soon?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I'll bring the chips!"
