"__BEATLES__ Are you a Beatles fan?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm not a die hard fan but I do like some of their music."
"__BEATLES__ They are seriously one of the best selling bands in history.  There were just so many hits.  What songs do you like?"
"__BEATLES__ I mean, probably my favorite is Imagine."
"__BEATLES__ That isn't really a Beatles song.  That one was by John Lennon."
"__BEATLES__ But he was in the Beatles right?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah he was but he came out with that one in the 80s after they'd already broken up."
"__BEATLES__ Why did they break up again if they were doing so well?"
"__BEATLES__ A lot of people think it was because of Yoko but I think they were kind of just done.  John Lennon said he was leaving in 1969."
"__BEATLES__ I'm surprised they haven't made like a huge blockbuster hit going over their life story."
