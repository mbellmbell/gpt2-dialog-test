"__MUSIC__ What have you been listening to recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Lots of instrumental stuff. I don't like hearing lyrics when I'm working or reading."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Anything you'd recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to this guy who goes by Rival Consoles a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ I hadn't either until recently; he popped up randomly as a Spotify recommendation."
"__MUSIC__ Gotta love those Spotify recommendations!"
"__MUSIC__ Heck yeah! So anyway, Rival Consoles is cool if you're into instrumental electronic stuff that's kind of dark and not super 'dancey'."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like it'd be right up my alley."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think you'd dig it."
"__MUSIC__ Anything else? Maybe something a little heavier?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, Blanck Mass' album came out a few months ago, and it is intense."
"__MUSIC__ Dude, I loved Blanck Mass' last one. He has a new one out?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, came out in March, I think."
"__MUSIC__ So many good albums came out in March, I guess I just missed it."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite thing that came out in March"
"__MUSIC__ Probably the new Real Estate album."
"__MUSIC__ That was a good one."
"__MUSIC__ I know it's kind of just Real Estate doing what they do, but I dig it."
"__MUSIC__ I feel you; me too man."
