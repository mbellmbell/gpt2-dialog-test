"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite song by Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ I like 'One'."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I would have thought you would have said the unforgiven."
"__MUSIC__ I like that one off their black album, but for their older work, I like One the best."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen the video?"
"__MUSIC__ No, can't say as I have."
"__MUSIC__ It is about a solider that is wounded; he lost his legs, arms and sight. He can't even talk."
"__MUSIC__ That is awful !"
"__MUSIC__ It is really. As the doctors are standing over him, wondering aloud how he is even alive he hears how bad he is and starts to lose it."
"__MUSIC__ Well who won't?"
"__MUSIC__ So what did he do?"
"__MUSIC__ The only thing he could really, he kept blinking trying to signal them."
"__MUSIC__ Did it work?"
"__MUSIC__ In the lyrics, we hear his internal monologue about trying to hold his breath inside and pray for death."
"__MUSIC__ wow, thats some powerful stuff."
"__MUSIC__ After a really long guitar solo, the lyrics say that another docotr comes in to have a look and tells them it is not a eye spasm, but Morse code."
"__MUSIC__ What was he trying to say?"
"__MUSIC__ Kill me, please kill me... over and over."
"__MUSIC__ I just got chills, but it makes you listen to the song in a whole new light."
