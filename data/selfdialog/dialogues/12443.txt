"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have one major sticking point though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their offensive line.  It might be the worst in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the thing about Pete Carroll is they're all in on the defense at the expense of their line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really hurts them though."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think their defense will be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They get Earl Thomas back which is a huge plus."
