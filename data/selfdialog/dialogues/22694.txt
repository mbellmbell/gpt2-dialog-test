"__DISNEY__ Did you hear that Disney is adapting Jack and the Beanstalk?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I loved that story as a kid!"
"__DISNEY__ I did too! I think it's a good choice."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know anything else about the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ It's going to be called 'Gigantic.'"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm. Sounds like it'll be a lot about the giant."
"__DISNEY__ The giant living in the clouds was always such a weird part of that story to me."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's weird but you have to take stories like that with a grain of salt."
"__DISNEY__ Anyway, it comes out in 2020, so we've got a while to wait."
"__DISNEY__ I'll be excited when it comes out!"
