"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch the Superbowl last night?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was an insane game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe the Patriots came back from from that deficit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! Tom Brady really had to carry his team to victory in the second half."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At the same time though you have to feel for the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that must have been rough to lose that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you throw away a 21-3 lead though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right. All you have to do is play a really conservative defense and you should be fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually stopped watching at half time because I though it was over. But then my brother called me back in after the 3rd quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it's a good thing you dint miss the fourth quarter!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! It was crazy to watch the Patriot score 19 points in the last quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess Brady just really wanted it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I'm not a huge fan of Brady, but credit where credit it due. That guy is insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He completely took over that game that last quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not just the last quarter! The entire second half!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was playing really well in overtime too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he really just outclassed Matt Ryan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think outclasses everyone in the NFL at the moment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets hope the next Superbowl is as good as this one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish every game was as good as this Superbowl."
