"__MUSIC__ Hi, have you heard the new Art of Anarchy CD?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I heard one of the singles from it, sounded good."
"__MUSIC__ I really love the album, quite a band, lots of experience!"
"__MUSIC__ Anyone I'd know?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably, there's Ron 'Bumblefoot' Thal, from Gun's n Roses, John Moyer from Disturbed, and Scott Stapp from Creed."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't Scott Weiland in that band?"
"__MUSIC__ He sang with them, but evidently didn't consider himself part of the band."
"__MUSIC__ He died, didn't he?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and it was later the next year before Scott Stapp joined them."
"__MUSIC__ So who do they sound like most, do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Scott Stapp described it accuately as 'So, it's like Disturbed meets Guns N' Roses, meets Creed.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's d be band I'd like to hear!"
"__MUSIC__ The music is good, and Scott sounds great, I think it's a good mix."
"__MUSIC__ Think they'll hang together as a band?"
"__MUSIC__ Time will tell; I suppose part of it will depend on what else the bandmembers have in the works."
"__MUSIC__ You have a favorite song on the album?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a lot like asking me if I have a favorite child!"
"__MUSIC__ Tough decision?"
"__MUSIC__ No kidding! Guess I might go with 'Echo of a Scream.'"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like I need to give that album a listen!"
