"__DISNEY__ I was reading an article online the other day about the new Disney movie Star Wars Episode 8 that's coming out at the end of this year."
"__DISNEY__ It's amazing how popular Star Wars is. It's one of those franchise movies that seems like it will never end."
"__DISNEY__ People will probably be really nostalgic about it since Carrie Fisher died this year."
"__DISNEY__ I think people will always think of her as Princess Leia."
"__DISNEY__ I was thinking about how it was kind of depressing when I read about the new movie."
"__DISNEY__ Star Wars is depressing?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw the very first Star Wars when it came out in 1977 at a drive-in movie theatre."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that was 40 years ago, and drive-ins are practically extinct."
"__DISNEY__ I know, and Carrie Fisher was only four years older than me and now she's gone."
"__DISNEY__ I can see why the movie might make you kind of depressed!"
