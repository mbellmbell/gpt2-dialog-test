"__STAR_WARS__ Luke and Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, yeah. That was bizzar."
"__STAR_WARS__ They kiss in the second, and then in the third Leia indicates that she's always known they were siblings."
"__STAR_WARS__ Gross."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Lucas just came up with the siblings bit in the third movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Writing off the cuff?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he's pretty infamous for that."
"__STAR_WARS__ True."
