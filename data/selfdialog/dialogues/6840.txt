"__STAR_WARS__ What was the best 'Star Wars' movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, 'Empire Strikes Back' is definitely the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you like about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ So much happened in the movie.  And it actually had real stakes."
"__STAR_WARS__ What stakes in particular?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father, Luke loses his hands, Han is frozen, and we're all left with a major cliffhanger."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now that you mention it, that was so unique of Star Wars.  And viewers at the time must have left the theater with so many questions."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think I could have waited years to see the next one."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's especially impressive when you think about it because the second movie is always the toughest to make."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree.  Yet, somehow 'Empire' was an excellent standalone movie that also tied the 1st and 3rd movies together seamlessly."
