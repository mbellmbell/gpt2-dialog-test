"__MUSIC__ Okay, possible unpopular music opinion about to be stated here."
"__MUSIC__ Leave my girl Beyonce out of it and I'm sure you'll be fine. Proceed."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't dream of taking on the Beyhive. But I do think No Doubt is better than solo Gwen Stefani."
"__MUSIC__ Ouch. Although I guess it'd probably be meaner to the guys to say she's better without them."
"__MUSIC__ It would be meaner. I just think the group had better songs."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I'm not sure that's such an unpopular opinion."
"__MUSIC__ So you agree?"
"__MUSIC__ I agree that 'Hollaback Girl' can't hold a candle to the iconic 'Don't Speak'."
"__MUSIC__ Or 'Just a Girl' or 'Sunday Morning' or 'Ex-Girlfriend' or..."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa, you are really not a fan of 'Hollaback Girl' are you?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha, I just think the No Doubt stuff is so much better."
"__MUSIC__ There is a different style between that and her solo stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. No Doubt had so much more of the ska vibe."
"__MUSIC__ Are you really into that genre?"
"__MUSIC__ Not particularly. It just seems superior when comparing it to straight pop."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe that's the issue; you're comparing things that aren't really comparable."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right. It just seems a shame that she left to do worse music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, in your opinion anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, yes. Isn't that all that should matter?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you're a funny one. Funny and delusional."
