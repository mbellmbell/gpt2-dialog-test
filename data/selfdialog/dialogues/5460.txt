"__STAR_WARS__ You know, I've never been into Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're kidding."
"__STAR_WARS__ No. It's just... I've tried, but they feel so pandering. They pick and choose and appropriate so many things, then blend them together and pretend they're new."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well. I mean. They're not high art, but they're not really trying to be. You got to admit that Empire is kind of ambitious, at least."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess, for what it is. I thought the turn to an out-and-out serial format was kind of cynical. Hey, we're onto a successful franchise! Let's just assume you're going to tune in next time!"
"__STAR_WARS__ But, it was successful. I mean, it's a pretty good gamble to take that people will want to see the next movie. Even if it was Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's just it, though. It's cynical. It's a gamble. It's a product contrived to suit a perceived consumer market. I guess most film has been, but this is really gratuitous about it. Though... uh. Jedi was clearly the best one, anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ What."
"__STAR_WARS__ Seriously, it's the only one I kind of enjoyed. Most of that is down to the Ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ What is wrong with you?"
