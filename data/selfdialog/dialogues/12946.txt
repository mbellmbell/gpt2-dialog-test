"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which NFL team do you think has the best mascot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever the Colts mascot is called seems to be pretty entertaining to watch"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do always see him behind the end zone during games reacting to plays on the field"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what mascots are supposed to do to entertain people, even if the mascot itself isn't all that interesting"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't the Jaguars' mascot parachute into the stadium once?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Someone did, and I would put it past Jaxson to do something like that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Florida's teams have pretty cool mascots, like the Buccaneers guy who is literally just a pirate"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And it's too bad the Dolphins don't use a real dolphin as a mascot, but I suppose that wouldn't be a great idea"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember the Seahawks' live hawk that landed on someone's head before a game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't expect a dolphin to do something like that, but I get your point"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Ravens have a pretty cool mascot named after Edgar Allan Poe"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes sense, since he wrote The Raven and both the team and mascot are based on that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There used to be three mascots named Edgar, Allan, and Poe, but now there's just Poe"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder why they did that, but I imagine it saved money and was easier to manage"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do the Green Bay Packers have a mascot, or is it just cheese?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the fans are the mascot, since the team is community-owned"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't have cheerleaders either, if I remember right"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well some people might argue that NFL cheerleaders don't really serve a purpose"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do a lot of work in the community, though, so I still think it's a good idea to have them"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And I'm sure the NFL is glad to have people who will help sell merchandise, if nothing else"
