"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So are you thrilled about the upcoming NFL season or what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm getting there!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are you rooting for these days?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being that I live in North Carolina now, it's hard not to root for the Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand.  I've loved the Broncos for as long as I can remember!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  My friends call me a turncoat but I can't help it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You used to be a Dallas fan, correct?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but that was a long time ago!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I gotcha.  I wonder how the Broncos will do this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet that will do well.  I can tell you that Panthers fans here are rabid!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  How bad is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's everywhere!  Tee shirts, caps, bumperstickers..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That seems to be everywhere though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's even worse here, I promise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So will you be going to any games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might.  It really depends on my finances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes sense.  When was it that the Panthers went to the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was in 2003 but I didn't live here then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They must really hate the Patriots there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got that right!"
