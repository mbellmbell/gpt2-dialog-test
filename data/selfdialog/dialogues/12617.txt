"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can recall seeing the December 1967 NFL Championship game on tv when I was 4 years old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh my gosh! That was the 'Ice Bowl', the Cowboys against the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, in Green Bay. Minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit! Then it dropped to minus 20..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's considered to be one of the greatest games in football history. Lucky seeing that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember wondering why people were sitting there on stone benches in Lambeau Field, trying to stay warm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. Fifty-one thousand people! They could have been home in Milwaukee or where ever watching on tv."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Vince Lombardi was the coach, Bart Starr the Quarterback..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of the Green Bay Packers had a hard time getting to the game. Their cars wouldn't start!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's right. I think it was the a Linebacker who had to hitch a ride to get to the game on time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Referees wore ear muffs! The opening whistle actually stuck to the Ref's lips!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. They had to use voice commands for the rest of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Shame no regular person had a video recorder back then. No full copy of the tv broadcast is known to exist."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? You're kidding me! How stupid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only the Cowboy's radio broadcast, and the Green Bay radio recording."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember Don Meredith, the Cowboy's Quarterback, handing off the ball in the fourth quarter, and the RUNNING BACK making the pass!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, a 50-yard pass to make the score 17-14 for the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember Packers slipping on the ice near the 1-yard line! They said one player actually scored, but the Ref didn't see it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some players on the COWBOYS years later said they thought that Anderson scored a touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Bart Starr ran the ball in himself, making the score 20-17 for the Packers, 13 seconds left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Game ended 21-17. Bart Starr didn't even tell his own players that he was going to try running it in. Only Lombardi knew!"
