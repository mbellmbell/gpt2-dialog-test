"__MUSIC__ What do you like to listen on XM radio."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Depends on my mood."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what are your favorite music stations?"
"__MUSIC__ The decades channels, 90s and pop2k are both pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed, although I haven't listened to pop2k much."
"__MUSIC__ You really should give it a shot. It has some great old school jobs. Smashmouth?"
"__MUSIC__ ohh so it's a lot of stuff like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Not just alternative. Lots of old school hip hop. Like Fat joe, ashanti, etc."
"__MUSIC__ I can see myself being in the mood for that."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Any other channels you suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ Umm, some of the other channels like XM cafe are good if you're looking to just relax."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm not into that as much."
"__MUSIC__ There's also studio 54 which is like disco. That's pretty funny. Also a new beatles channel."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe they have a beatles channel. It's like there are so many other bands."
"__MUSIC__ I know right, seriously, where's a Michael Jackson channel or something."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'd be down for that. The beatles are just so overrated."
"__MUSIC__ Totally agreed."
"__MUSIC__ Well thanks for the suggestions."
"__MUSIC__ No problem."
