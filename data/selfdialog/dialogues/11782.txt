"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only thing I don't like about summer, no NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. So what team will you go with after Oakland moves to Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's going to be really horrible. I've been an Oakland fan my whole life. I guess a Vegas Raiders fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that the name they will be using?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure. I don't think they have released the name details yet, but they usually keep the team name and just change the city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. When are they actually supposed to start playing there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not until 2020. It takes awhile to build a stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's really not that long though considering all of the work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm curious how they plan to play in that heat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I assume they will have an enclosed dome like the Arizona Cardinals do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're probably right. No one could play in that heat without having serious problems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would give them a great home advantage like Minnesota has for weather though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and Green Bay. I don't know how they stand to be in that cold weather anymore than the heat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They get used to it like Denver player do with the thinner air because of altitude."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think I would want to go all the way to Vegas to see games though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not that far away is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a pretty good trip by car but there are short flights from Los Angeles to Vegas all day that aren't too expensive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There were so many teams in California though that it's probably better for the team that they got out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, and they will be the only team in Nevada so hopefully they will get a better fan following."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Derek Carr made out better by staying with them because his taxes on his pay will be much lower."
