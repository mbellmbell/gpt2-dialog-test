"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you know about the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know a little bit. The Steelers are my favorite team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh nice, I don't really have a favorite team. Who does Aaron Rogers play for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He plays for the Green Bay Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wasn't he in the news for something recently?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he broke up with his girlfriend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right! Who was he dating?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it was Olivia Munn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's right. How are the Steelers doing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did pretty well last season. They went 11-5."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that is pretty good! Who are their best players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown are both pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I have heard of them. Who is their biggest rival?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People in Ohio are pretty serious about the Browns-Steelers rivalry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh interesting. The Steelers are much, much better that the Browns though, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Correct. The Browns have not had a winning season in a very long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is that one player for the Browns who is always getting in trouble?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, do you mean Johny Manziel?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! That is who I am thinking of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he actually doesn't play for the Browns anymore, but there are rumors that he might play for Dallas this year."
