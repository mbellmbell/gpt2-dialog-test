"__MOVIES__ Did you go see Rogue One when it was in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course I did. I'm a huge Star Wars fan."
"__MOVIES__ Are you? I am too. I started when I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, I grew up on the three original. I would watch them over and over again at a friend's house every weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Which one was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably The Empire Strikes Back. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely the first one. I'm a purist."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Rogue One then?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was amazing, like they really nailed the style of the old films."
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree. It felt more like one of the originals than the new ones like Force Awakens."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it's because it was set in the old plotline, with Darth Vader even."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right! And there was that crazy scene at the end linking the two films?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! With new Princess Leia footage that they made digitally. Amazing technology."
"__MOVIES__ It was. It was a little creepy to make new Grand Moff Tarkin scenes when they actor is dead."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wonder how Peter Kushing's family felt about it."
"__MOVIES__ Other than that it was a really impressive film!"
"__MOVIES__ I can't get over how great the effects were."
"__MOVIES__ That death star in the sky scene was so awesome, and scary really."
"__MOVIES__ Right? Like imagine staring that down on your planet."
"__MOVIES__ What a great scene!"
