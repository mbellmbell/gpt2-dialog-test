"__STAR_WARS__ What's your theory has to who Rey is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Perosnally, I think she's the daughter of two Jedi that broken the rules."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the whole ' No attachments thing'."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, so they were expelled from the Order, so they missed being caught in the Purge."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, why did they have Rey and then leave her on Jakku?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because, even after the fall of the Empire, they were in danger."
"__STAR_WARS__ From who?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Snoke and the early First Order, I think he was hunting for Rey because of her strength, so her parent left her in the most out of the way place they could find and disappeared."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, so that's how Kylo Ren seemed to know something about her?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, Snoke told him about her, so that he'd recognize her if he ever ran into her."
