"__STAR_WARS__ Did you ever watch The Clone Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Was that the cartoon?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it was"
"__STAR_WARS__ No I did not watch that"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it was weird to see  the movie in cartoon shape"
"__STAR_WARS__ I dont think it mattered that much to the storyline right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No it didnt have any bearing."
"__STAR_WARS__ If it did I would have watched it"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the point of the film was to appeal to a younger audience"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that does not make much sense."
