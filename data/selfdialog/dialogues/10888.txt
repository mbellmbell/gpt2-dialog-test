"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe it's time for preseason football in a couple of weeks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know...where does the time go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been watching the Philadelphia Eagles practicing? What do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am excited about the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like their new young quarterback. I think he may just put a fire undef the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but what do you think of the coaching?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that may be a problem. I am not sure about the offensive coordinator."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, me too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think of their draft choices?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought they were pretty good, but time will tell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope they do better this year. Last year was disappointing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. Do you think you will get to any games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so. I would like to see them play the Dallas Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. Let's try to get tickets for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will have to get them early, They sell out quickly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's spend a little more and get some really good seats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. But I think they play them in December,it will be cold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's ok, we will bundle up.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And we will do a lot of yelling and jumping up and down so it will be ok...cool!"
