"__THRILLER__ Hey John, have you ever gotten to see the movie Seven with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in it?"
"__THRILLER__ No, I have not. What was it like?"
"__THRILLER__ It is very scary and thrilling.  The detectives try to find a serial killer before he strikes again."
"__THRILLER__ I have seen things on it, but never took the time to watch it yet."
"__THRILLER__ Gwyneth Paltrow plays the wife of Brad Pitt, and it really is sad the whole movie is well done."
"__THRILLER__ That's right, I heard she played in that, now I really want to see it.  I hope I can see it on Netflix."
"__THRILLER__ You can view it on Demand on cable if you want."
"__THRILLER__ I will look for it.  Did you watch it on Showtime?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I did. Try it there."
"__THRILLER__ Ok, thanks, I will check it out!"
