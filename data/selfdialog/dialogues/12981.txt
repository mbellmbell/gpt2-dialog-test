"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey guess what!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL Training camp starts in three weeks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! It feels like the season just ended!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited to see what happens with the Giants this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. They didn't improve their offensive line in the off season though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not too worried about it. We made it to the playoffs with a terrible offensive line last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your right! And Eli's legs appear to be made of stone, because he doesn't move in the pocket."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's amazing they got as far as they did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Eli's a smart quarter back and that's what carried them through the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli is a smart quarter back, but I honestly feel like he only shines in the post season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he's saving it all for when it really counts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I just think he performs better under pressure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's pretty clutch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's also got OBJ catching his passes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That dude is a beast! Definitely one of the best in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he's one of the top three receivers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Might be the best receiver in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's also got Marshall and Shepard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Might be the best receiving core in the league!"
