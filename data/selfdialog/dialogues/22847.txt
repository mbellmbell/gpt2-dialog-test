"__DISNEY__ Can you believe Frozen is getting a sequel?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, yes I can. Everything is getting a sequel whether it needs it or not."
"__DISNEY__ Is that really such a bad thing though?"
"__DISNEY__ It can be, but as Finding Nemo and Finding Dory has proven sometimes they can get it right. Though as The Little Mermaid 2 indicates... not always."
"__DISNEY__ Frozen was insanely popular forever so I'm honestly not surprised either. Haven't seen the first one yet, but hopefully it's not one of those sequels for money's sake and they can actually do the original story's feel justice."
"__DISNEY__ I'll give Disney the benefit of the doubt as they've been pretty consistent in recent years with both their live action and animated films."
"__DISNEY__ There any sequels you ARE looking forward to being released?"
"__DISNEY__ Actually, yes. The Incredibles 2 and Wreck It Ralph 2 in 2018 then Toy Story 4 in 2019 but I have mixed feelings and concerns about that one."
"__DISNEY__ I noticed there were some untitled Pixar films coming out from 2019 to 2021. I wouldn't mind if one of them was a sequel to Inside Out."
"__DISNEY__ That or another Monsters or Finding whatever would probably be good if they can keep the momentum they did with their prequel and sequel films. Was quite pleased with how Monsters University and Finding Dory turned out."
