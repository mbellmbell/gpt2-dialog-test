"__FASHION__ I wish I had more money so I could be more fashionable."
"__FASHION__ I don't think you need money to be fashionable."
"__FASHION__ Really? But all the best brands cost so much!"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, but haven't you seen people combine cheap clothes in interesting ways before?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, but -"
"__FASHION__ And there are people who actually alter their own clothes. And even make their own from scratch."
"__FASHION__ I can't do that."
"__FASHION__ Well, have you ever tried?"
"__FASHION__ No, I guess not. And if nothing else, I can try to do more with what I have."
"__FASHION__ That's the spirit!"
"__FASHION__ But do you think I can ever look fashionable considering I'm a little overweight?"
"__FASHION__ Of course! Anyone of any race, gender, weight, whatever can be fashionable if they have confidence in what thy're wearing and choose interesting outfits."
"__FASHION__ Do you really think so?"
"__FASHION__ Definitely. And there's no one type of fashion."
"__FASHION__ What do you mean?"
"__FASHION__ Everyone has different ideas about what's fashionable."
"__FASHION__ But aren't some people right and some people wrong?"
"__FASHION__ Not necessarily. Think about Project Runway. Sometimes the judges legitimately disagree."
"__FASHION__ Oh, you're right."
"__FASHION__ I think what matters most is that YOU like what you wear."
