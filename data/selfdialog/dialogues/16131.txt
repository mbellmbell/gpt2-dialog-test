"__ROCK__ Same, I think they've been a really consistent band."
"__ROCK__ A lot of people seem to want them to just put out samey stuff unforutnately."
"__ROCK__ Which is a shame because they have evolved in so many ways and they're always interesting."
"__ROCK__ Agreed, Rivers Cuomo is very good as exploring new sounds."
"__ROCK__ Some people feel though that if you're in one genre you have to stay there."
"__ROCK__ I can definitely see why some people might not like Thank God For Girls."
"__ROCK__ Yeah it has a modern pop sound that Weezer isn't typically known for."
"__ROCK__ But that's also what makes it so good right?"
