"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What's goin' on, schmoopy?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What does it look like? I'm listening to my i-pod."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I-pod? Those are still around?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What can I say? I'm old school."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok, Old School. Whatta listening to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Kiki Dee's Greatest Hits."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Did she do that 'Chuck E.'s in Love' song?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That was Rickie Jones. Did you know that she was related to Davy Jones? Distant cousin."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ If she's a distant cousin then it isn't likely that her last name would be the same so I think that's b.s."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It wasn't originally. It was Birkowitz. Rickie Birkowitz. She changed it when Mr. Davy became the man."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Right. So, did Kiki Dee actually have any hits?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ She did that song with Elton John. You remember--'Don't Go Brokin' My Heart'."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I hate that song. Anything else?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't have a copy of this but I think she did a duet with Tom Petty called something like 'Even Losers Can Get Laid.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm a little suspicious of your sources. Where did you hear that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Tiger Beat magazine."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Tiger Beat is still around? I thought it collapsed after Sean Cassidy was caught in that compromising position. Remember? When he had that clown costume on."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nope, they still here and still tapped into the youth of the nation."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Anyway, back to Kiki Dee...."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, I'm off her now."
