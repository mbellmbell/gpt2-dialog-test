"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No I haven't."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really, that is so odd. Most people have."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ya, I just ever got around to it. What are they about anyways."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They are about a boy who finds out he is a wizard and ends up having to attend school at Hogwarts."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh. Who is in them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They all have a lot of the same characters. One of them is Daniel Radcliffe and another is Emma Watson."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, I like them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ya, you probably watch them grow up on screen."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, thats cool."
