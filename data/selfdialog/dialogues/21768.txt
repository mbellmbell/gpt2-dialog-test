"__DISNEY__ What are you talking about?"
"__DISNEY__ You know... that scene from Beauty and the Beast where Lumiere starts singing and dancing during dinner?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yer, I remember that now."
"__DISNEY__ If that was me and I was magically turned in to a spoon I would be disappointed."
"__DISNEY__ What would you rather have been turned in to?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know.... probably Mrs Potts because I would never be thirsty!"
"__DISNEY__ I would be the beast myself, it wouldn't bother me that I was ugly."
"__DISNEY__ But he almost gets killed by Gaston at the end!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, almost but he eventually gets the girl!"
