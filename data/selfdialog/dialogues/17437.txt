"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the second Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__MOVIES__ I said 'good' movies."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think it was that bad!  There were some redeeming parts!"
"__MOVIES__ The soundtrack was... fine.  The rest of it was pretty vague."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, are we really supposed to believe that Starlord has the same power as Kurt Russell?  If that was the case, then why couldn't he just build his own little planet thing?  If it wasn't the case, then how could he survive outside a planet thing?"
"__MOVIES__ I think you're overthinking this, but just to play devil's advocate, his genes were a combination of a human and a... planet thing... or whatever Kurt Russell was."
"__MOVIES__ Biologically, that doesn't really work, right?  How many times can you see biologically related things mate and produce offspring that have all the qualities of both of those things?  Ligers and Tigons are sterile."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, but biologically, you do get traits of both of the parents in the offspring."
"__MOVIES__ But not wholly different traits that are substantially different!  Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not even sure they could possibly have compatible gametes!"
"__MOVIES__ You've really taken this about as far as you can take it.  I want you to consider another possibility for me."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ How about, instead of analyzing the specifics of the reproductive possibilities within the movie, you try to capture some broad thematic elements that carried across all the storylines."
"__MOVIES__ Like their overuse of the theme of families being formed by the people who are closest to you?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a good one!"
"__MOVIES__ I think you're really missing the most important part here.  A good movie can incorporate broad thematic elements organically in a story that engages the person watching it.  If the person watching it is constantly being drawn out of the narrative because it's posing ridiculous or unbelievable plot points, the movie is already a failure."
"__MOVIES__ Do you really think that?  That's an incredibly high bar for any movie to get over.  Didn't you enjoy The Lord of The Rings?  That was entirely fantasy and entirely unbelievable."
"__MOVIES__ That's not true!  It was set in a different world that operated on a different set of physical rules than earth did, but the conflicts that the characters engaged in were entirely believable.  The heart of the story rang true."
"__MOVIES__ There's lots of people who'd make the same argument about the second Guardian's of the Galaxy... fortunately for you, I'm not one of them."
