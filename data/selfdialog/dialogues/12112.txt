"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, Paulito, do you plan on going to any NFL games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, but I sure hope to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You travel a lot for work, have you been able to visit any stadiums when you travel?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I have been to games in Denver, Arizona, Dallas and Houston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's pretty good.  I have only been to a couple of games in Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas has my favorite stadium, I love all of the technology that's there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I really enjoy it too, but I would like to visit an outdoor, cold weather stadium as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, do you think it would be fun to watch the game in the cold?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, it would be even better if it were snowing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if I could handle it, I am to much of a Southerner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, I know what you mean, but I think the atmosphere would be amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't argue with that.  Which stadium would you like to visit?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Chicago and Green Bay would be a lot of fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are two classic stadiums...Soldier Field and Lambeau Field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I think a game in New York would be fun too, though I think I would enjoy Buffalo more than NYC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree there, I'm not a fan of either NYC team, but I could handle watching the Bills play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here.  I think it would be fun to tour all of the NFL stadiums."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that sounds awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is so much history in those stadiums."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We should plan a five year expedition to visit them all."
