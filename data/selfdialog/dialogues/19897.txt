"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie that I'd never expect you to love?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely You've Got Mail."
"__MOVIES__ Really? The Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Indeed. Nora Ephron wrote it and she's great."
"__MOVIES__ I always found it funny that Dave Chappelle was in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't think he's done many romantic dramas."
"__MOVIES__ Is that your favorite Tom Hanks film?"
"__MOVIES__ It really might be. And Harry Nilsson is all over the soundtrack and he's great."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it very much like Sleepless in Seattle?"
"__MOVIES__ People say that, but I think it's quite different. The emotional feel isn't the same."
"__MOVIES__ And Meg Ryan has shorter hair."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and You've Got Mail has Parker Posey. Sleepless in Seattle wishes Parker acted in it."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I recently saw Heather Burns in Manchester by the Sea. I recognized her from You've Got Mail."
"__MOVIES__ How was Manchester?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good. It wasn't quite as depressing as I expected, but some sequences are so heartbreaking."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet so don't tell me anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. I've become one of those people who avoids watching film trailers."
"__MOVIES__ Me, too. You can't watch a trailer without having a bunch of quality moments spoiled."
"__MOVIES__ Teasers have become the way to go."
"__MOVIES__ I do have an appreciation for teasers that leave you thinking, 'I'm not sure what this is, but I want to see it.'"
