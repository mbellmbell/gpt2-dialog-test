"__HORROR__ Have you ever seen The Exorcist?"
"__HORROR__ You bet I have. Scared me so bad I had nightmares for weeks."
"__HORROR__ Did you watch it as a child or more recently?"
"__HORROR__ Oh I saw it as a child, so I appreciate the horror of it now."
"__HORROR__ Yeah kids who see it for the first time today think it's cheesy."
"__HORROR__ Oh they have no idea the seriousness of the subject matter."
"__HORROR__ I agree. When Reagan turned her head all the way around... that was it for me."
"__HORROR__ That's one of the scariest scenes along with when she was levitating."
"__HORROR__ I felt so bad for the old priest Marin. He walked into that house knowing he was about to give his life."
"__HORROR__ I've seen the uncensored version with the spider walk down the stairs. That was absolutely terrifying."
