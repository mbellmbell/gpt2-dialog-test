"__MUSIC__ Have you seen any good bands live lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I saw Cake a few months ago, and just last week I saw The Protomen."
"__MUSIC__ That's neat! I haven't been out in a while, so I haven't had a chance to catch up with the scene."
"__MUSIC__ That's fair. If you can see Protomen, totally give them a chance, though!"
"__MUSIC__ What kind of band are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty geeky actually! They're basically a rock band, but all their music is based off of the Mega-Man series."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, huh. Like how?"
"__MUSIC__ Basically they made up their own story for each of the albums with the characters from Mega-Man."
"__MUSIC__ Can you follow it easily?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, but the music is really cool, so it doesn't matter that much to me."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, haha, that's fair. Are they expensive to see?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all, and their shows are often all ages so there aren't a lot of drunk people."
"__MUSIC__ That's so awesome, I'll totally check them out. Do you know anyone else like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Bit Brigade?"
"__MUSIC__ Who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Their music is pretty different, but it's a similar theme. They opened a few times for Protomen."
"__MUSIC__ Different how?"
"__MUSIC__ They play instrumental rock versions of the actual Mega-Man soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my god, really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I saw them live with Protomen, and they even had someone playing the game on a little TV as they played along!"
