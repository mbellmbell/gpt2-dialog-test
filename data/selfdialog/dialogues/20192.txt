"__MOVIES__ Hey I just finished watching a great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ What was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Dr. Doolittle!  Do you remember it?"
"__MOVIES__ From when, the nineties?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it came out in 1998.  It starred Eddie Murphy."
"__MOVIES__ I remember the one!  I haven't seen that in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I hadn't either.  It is a great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't he save a lion at the end or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes he does, but there's a lot leading up to that.  He goes through things with his job and his family."
"__MOVIES__ It's based after an old movie, isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think the original came out in 1967 so it was a long time ago."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what it's all about."
"__MOVIES__ I doubt it was as funny as the Eddie Murphy remake.  That one was hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everything with Eddie Murphy is funny though."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much.  Who else was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I know Kristen Wilson and Oliver Platt were in it.  I didn't recognize anyone else."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure who they are."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and of course all the animals.  Most of them could talk remember."
"__MOVIES__ Yes of course I remember that.  I just watched it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to re-watch it myself!"
