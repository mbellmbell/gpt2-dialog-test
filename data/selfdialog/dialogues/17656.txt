"__MOVIES__ Do you think Step Brothers is the most quotable comedy of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ If it isn't it's definitely up there with them."
"__MOVIES__ Right, it has a dumb quote that you can fit into so many situations."
"__MOVIES__ I find the same thing to be the case with movies like Airplane."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah even if it isn't totally relevant to the conversation, they're so quotable."
"__MOVIES__ That's the thing comedies compared to other movies, quotable."
"__MOVIES__ But then you get stuff like The Wicker Man, serious movies that become comedies."
"__MOVIES__ I think you and I have quoted The Wicker Man more times than we've spoken normal words."
"__MOVIES__ That and Kung Pow, Kung Pow might actually be the most quotable movie of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think we have to take that crown away from Step Brothers."
"__MOVIES__ The sheer genius that is Kung Pow knows no bounds."
"__MOVIES__ It's a shame we never got a sequel but maybe it's for the best."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think it's something that is a flash in the pan, don't attempt it again."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah don't want to ruin the legacy of the first one's greatness."
"__MOVIES__ Look what happened with Anchorman 2, good but nowhere near as good."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, comedy sequels don't tend to stick the landing."
"__MOVIES__ Unless you're 21 Jump Street."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah 22 Jump Street was actually a really good sequel."
"__MOVIES__ But for every one of those you get Caddyshack 2."
"__MOVIES__ I thought we agreed never to speak of Caddyshack 2."
