"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My Bengals were trash last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huge trash.  What happened there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Things just fell apart.  Couldn't score, couldn't defend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like a good recipe for losing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And lose they did.  I thought Marvin Lewis was a goner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was on the hot seat for quite a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm glad they didn't fire him though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a good coach, but you can only do so much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think that Andy Dalton is the right answer though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's the definition of an average QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not bad, not great, but not somebody who will get you to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they have nobody behind him right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  He's the best you can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think he's got a real weapon to throw to though in AJ Green."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, straight beast and a top 5 receive in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was injured a lot last year I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, bad year for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like a bad year for all the Bengals in general."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think if they stay healthy, they'll be in the thick of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully.  I can't stand the Steelers in that division."
