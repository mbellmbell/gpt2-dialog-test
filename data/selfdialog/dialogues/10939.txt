"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know some people call football an American past time, but it seems popular all over the world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read about how the prime minister of Israel met with a bunch of NFL Hall Of Famers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Netanyahu? I didn't know he was a football fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriot's team owner took a bunch of them for a tour."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be really cool to see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Apparently the team owner was joking with the prime minister about him playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, Netanyahu actually plays football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the owner gave him a ball and they were tossing it back and forth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder where he learned to play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Netanyahu went to school in the States, and that's where he picked up football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always thought it was funny how in Europe they call soccer football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does seem confusing. But really, soccer is playing with a ball with your foot, so it is more logical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As devoted as they are to soccer, Europe has built some really great teams with great players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are VERY devoted to soccer in Europe. It's like the MAIN sport, whereas here you have competition between football, basketball, and baseball as to which is the favorite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the way they are spread out over the seasons, it makes it easy to be a fan of all three."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. And there's hockey, but that always falls behind the big three for favorite sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally love baseball the best. I think most people would pick it as number one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be a toss up I think between baseball and football. Basketball would probably be in third place."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, basketball defintely falls behind baseball and football."
