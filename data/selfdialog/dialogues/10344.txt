"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So, do you like rap and hip-hop or not? I've been thinking lately that it still gets a bad reputation."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, I definitely like it. It totally depends on the style though--I'm not into really violent imagery."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I totally agree--but it's important to remember that with the good stuff, that imagery serves a purpose."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh no, definitely--I just don't want it to feel cheap or unnecessary, you know?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you listened to Kendrick Lamar yet? I know that's an obvious one, but he's just great."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ha--of course I have! He's great. He's an exception to that for sure."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You know who he reminds me of? Atmosphere. It's really sentimental but also hard and intense, you know what I mean?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ For sure. You grew up in Seattle, do you like Blue Scholars?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I love their shtick! It's a great take on the love-of-hometown theme."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Of course, everyone needs some Nicki Minaj too--can't forget the ladies!"
