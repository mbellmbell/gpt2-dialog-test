"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's almost football season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes indeed. You ready to see my Lions finally take home the crown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lions!? I believe the Browns before that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns!? Now you're just purposefully trying to offend me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, okay. Maybe that's a bit far, but the Lions have a way to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we got it this year, man. Stafford is maturing every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, and he's talented, but the supporting case is terrible!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All we need is a good offense and decent defense, and I think we have that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, no. You need an extraordinary defense!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not for every team. You just need to put up more points than the opponent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell that to the Falcons!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch! That's too soon considering the Falcons are my number two team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't know that. They should be good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but I think the Bucs are on the come up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes indeed. I love some Winston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's gonna be good one day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He reminds me of Cam, for sure. Has a ton of potential."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure about that. He reminds me more of a QB like Big Ben."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. He's not as fast as Cam."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And certainly not as big as Cam!"
