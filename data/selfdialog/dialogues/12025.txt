"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you going to watch the Chiefs and the Patriots game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably so, when is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ September 7th"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh..where are they playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gillette Stadium!  I wanted to get tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I'm not a huge fan of the Chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither, but the Patriots are awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they're both good teams, I just don't like watching the Chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not a fan of Alex Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I don't even know who he is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's their passing yard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh.  That's Tom Brady for the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I like him a lot better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a great player!  I think he does better than that Smith guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well his stats are definitely much better.  He had almost twice as many touchdowns last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder what new players they will have this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  I'm hoping to find out at the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well maybe I will watch it after all.  I don't know."
