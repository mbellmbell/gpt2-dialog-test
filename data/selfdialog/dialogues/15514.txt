"__HARRY_POTTER__ So who is your favorite character from the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh gosh, I don't know. There are so many!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But if you had to choose just one, who would it be?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ This may be unusual, but I like Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, that is different. Why him?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He sacrificed so much in order to help people."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And he got little to no recognition or thanks."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly, he is such a great character that way."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It is funny because you hate him for almost all of the movies until the very end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is why he is the best character."
