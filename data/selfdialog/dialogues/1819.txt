"__MUSIC__ I think it's crazy that more people our age don't like Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ I know right? Just because we're almost 30 doesn't mean she doesn't rock!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! It's so crazy that people tend to think it's childish or something that I think she's amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, her song 'Mean' makes me cry."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, I listen to that song almost every morning, I love it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like her new stuff as well as her older stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually like both the same."
"__MUSIC__ I do too. I like her country phase and her new darker stuff as well."
"__MUSIC__ So do I!"
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song by her?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I like the remix of Bad Blood."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I like the original better. I think the rapper messed it up."
"__MUSIC__ I completely disagree! I think it is so much better with the rap. It's way more catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Well, agree to disagree! I also really like the song, where in the music video she is all crazy and stabs portraits of her ex lovers. What's that song again?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you're talking about Blank Space! I love that song too!"
"__MUSIC__ It's just so cool and it's like she doesn't care how she is perceived."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think her music videos have largely influenced me to like her more. They're so intense and she always has great acting in them."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I also like how much she seems to care about being a good role model for young girls"
"__MUSIC__ I do too! That's one of the best things about her, that she always has strong messages in her songs and really cares about being a positive influence."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but it must be a lot of pressure on her not to mess up or ever do anything the public may perceive as 'bad'"
