"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, only a few more weeks and football season is here. Are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! What team do you think will win it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm rooting for the Texans this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they have a superstar young quarterback Deshaun Watson"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they also have an amazing defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This year, hopefully JJ Watt stays healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they can beat New England?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Texans have a better team.  Hopefully, the coaching is good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, there have been issues with O'Brien but he is a great guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O'Brien needs to be more aggressive this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also love the Panthers.  What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Panthers are good.  Cam Newton didn't have a great year last year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but this year should be better if he's healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone was after him last year.  He kept getting sacked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the offensive line needs to do a better job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ However, between the two, I want the Texans to win the superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm with you, the Texans deserve a chance to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they've given up a lot for Watson."
