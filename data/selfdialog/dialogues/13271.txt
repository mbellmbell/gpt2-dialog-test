"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey which teams do you think will go to the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a tough one, but I think the Patriots and Cowboys will make it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys? Really?  They always lose in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but I think this year will be different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think so?  History says otherwise!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott make for a tough matchup for any defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are great players, but they are too young.  I don't think they have developed the necessary leadership skills yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I disagree.  You saw what Dak did in his rookie year alone.  He is a natural leader at the quarterback position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did well, but I think it was a fluke.  Rookie luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess this year will be the true test then!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you are right about the Patriots, though.  They never seem to lose!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely.  Tom Brady is a beast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Brady is the best of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You certainly could argue that.  He has won so many championships."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure.  He has a competitive drive like no other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be hard for any quarterback to replicate what he has done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unless it's Dak Prescott!  Haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah yeah, he has a while to go before he gets to Brady's level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right, but they are both good quarterbacks at this point in time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  Ok, I have to go.  Take care!"
