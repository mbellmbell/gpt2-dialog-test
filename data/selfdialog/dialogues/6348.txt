"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the character Captain Phasma?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes!  She should have had more screen time in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, hopefully she will remove her helmet at some point in The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think some great actions scenes with her, Rey, and Kylo would be great in the next movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I often wonder if Luke Skywalker is doing to die sometime in the next two movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's a possibility to bringing balance to The Force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Supposedly Rey is going to be a Grey Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I think that will be really neat - or perhaps Kylo will be redeemd?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I just don't know - I hope they have some epic lightsaber battles during the next two movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I can't wait to see Luke's green lightsaber again."
