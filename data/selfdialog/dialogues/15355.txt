"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hi, what movie are we watching tonight?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought I'd pick up Harry Potter."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh good, I love it. Which one?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I want to watch Deathly Hallows, is that okay?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Uh, remind me of which one that is again!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's the one were Snape goes in the mansion and the Death Eaters and Voldemort is at the head of the table."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Is that were he tells Snape he has to kill Harry?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes! That one!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, that one is sad. I cried when Hermoine does the spell to make her parents forget."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh my gosh yes, that is so emotional!"
