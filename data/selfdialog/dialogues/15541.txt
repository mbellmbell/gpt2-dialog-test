"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just finished the Deathly Hallows, Part 2."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What'd you think of the ending?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was so sad when Harry was walking to the forest to die, but there was one part that I really loved."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which part is that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ When Malfoy's mother goes to Harry and asks if her son is alive or not."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, I forgot about that part. What else happened?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry nods really subtly and tells her that Draco is still alive. Then, she announces to the rest of the Death Eaters that he's dead."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think they would've done to him if she said he was alive?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They probably would've killed him. Maybe with a knife or another weapon rather than just a spell."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry Potter really is the boy who lived. He survived the killing curse twice in his life!"
