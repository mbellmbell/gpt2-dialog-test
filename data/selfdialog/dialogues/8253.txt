"__POP__ Britney Spears. Is she still around?"
"__POP__ I believe so. I've heard a lot of people talking about listening to new music from her. I believe it's new music."
"__POP__ Oh. She seemed to go disappear a decade ago."
"__POP__ She's definitely not as popular as she once was."
"__POP__ That's for sure. She was the top pop artist at one time."
"__POP__ Yes, late 1990s and early 2000s."
"__POP__ Yes, that time period. She's getting older as well. That must be why I haven't heard much from her lately."
"__POP__ Other artists that are younger seem to be getting much more play time it seems."
"__POP__ I couldn't name any of those new artists. I guess I'm getting older as well."
"__POP__ We all are. Our lives get busier as well and it's more difficult to keep up with the latest music."
