"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favorite character from Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked the K-2SO a lot. He was pretty funny."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes that movie had a very serious tone so it was good to have a comic relief character in the story."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely. Some people say that his jokes seemed a little forced and shoehorned in but I disagree."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is he your favorite droid overall from the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's hard to say he's better than the awesome droids like C3PO or R2D2 of course. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was better but he was a good character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who did the voice for K-2O? Do you know?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Alan Tudyk actually did the voice for him. They also used motion capture so the actor actually acted out the role and not only used his voice."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's impressive! I had no idea, I thought it was CGI or  a puppet or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it was CGI but they used the actual actor as a reference for the CGI so it looks very natural."
