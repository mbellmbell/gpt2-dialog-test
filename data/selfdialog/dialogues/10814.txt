"__FASHION__ Are you wearing those earrings to your brother's wedding?"
"__FASHION__ The skull ones? Yes."
"__FASHION__ It's a wedding, not a funeral. Wear something appropriate."
"__FASHION__ Okay. I'll wear my black rose earrings."
"__FASHION__ That's not much better. What else are you wearing?"
"__FASHION__ My gothic cyber retro dress."
"__FASHION__ You're not serious are you?"
"__FASHION__ What? My brother knows what I like to wear."
"__FASHION__ That's not important. It's a wedding, wear something nice."
"__FASHION__ What do you suggest then?"
"__FASHION__ I'm glad you asked. I bought you this lovely teal dress with matching heels."
"__FASHION__ Teal? Really?"
"__FASHION__ It came with a lovely handbag and lace gloves."
"__FASHION__ Teal isn't my color, you know that."
"__FASHION__ Too bad. You're wearing it."
"__FASHION__ Maybe I can mix it up with something in my wardrobe."
"__FASHION__ With what? All you have is black."
"__FASHION__ That's not true."
"__FASHION__ Isn't it?"
"__FASHION__ No. I wear blood red colors too."
