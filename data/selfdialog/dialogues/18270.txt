"__MOVIES__ 2017 is looking like a good year for the movies"
"__MOVIES__ oyeah that's so true so many big movies out and most of them making it to top 5 in the box office."
"__MOVIES__ which are your best so far  this year?"
"__MOVIES__ quite a handful lol 'wonder woman' 'star trek:the last jedi' 'justice league' and 'allien covenant' how about you?"
"__MOVIES__ i have seen all you've mentioned and 'wonder woman' is sure on my list as well then 'spider-man: homecoming' 'get out' and 'ghost in the shell'."
"__MOVIES__ oh damn you've seen 'ghost in the shell' the preview was something else, i was already dying to see it,oh now yo saw it before me lol."
"__MOVIES__ man the movie was great just what you'd expect from a 'Rupert Sanders' directed movie."
"__MOVIES__ oh rupert directed that movie i thought i saw Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger as co directors."
"__MOVIES__ no mate probably you saw the names of the writers as it was co written by those three you mentioned."
"__MOVIES__ oh i see, Rupert is a great director so i am no longer surprise why the movie was an instant box office hit."
"__MOVIES__ too much suspense and intrigue filled in the movie and the Japanese Motoko Kusanagi played his role to perfection."
"__MOVIES__ oh that guy i swear i have seen him on another movie before but just can't pick the movie."
"__MOVIES__ that should be 'Rangers'"
"__MOVIES__ great he is the 7th ranger with the sun power right?"
"__MOVIES__ yes that is Motoko Kusanagi."
"__MOVIES__ i said it, i knew i have seen him on another big movie before."
"__MOVIES__ 'Rangers' was his first successful movie and 'ghost in the shell' is a follow up, but would be his biggest thus far going by the acceptance."
"__MOVIES__ 'Rangers' was kinda criticize for its too much focus on a particular ethnic group hence its poor reviews."
"__MOVIES__ yeah 'Rangers' would have been even bigger than what it achieved if not for that and the reviews were so poor from first time critics, but by and large i enjoyed watching it."
"__MOVIES__ i did enjoyed watching it as well,"
