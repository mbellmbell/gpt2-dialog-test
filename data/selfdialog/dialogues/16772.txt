"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite absolutely terrible movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'The Room'?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh no, I don't think so."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably my favorite awful movie. It's just... awful. I'm still not sure how it ever got made."
"__MOVIES__ Oh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was made by this really odd-looking dude named Tommy Wisseau who I think is from Eastern Europe? His accent is kind of weird, but somehow he got his hands on a bunch of money and made his dream movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really. And that's bad?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, coming from him it is. It's like this really ridiculous almost Lifetime Movie-esque story about a guy who is seemingly perfect and his awful fianc√© is cheating on him... and Tommy plays the perfect  guy himself."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. And he wrote it himself, and it's just so  cheesy and bad but also hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like it could be!"
"__MOVIES__ He threw in lots of totally ridiculous and over-the-top love scenes, and insane dialogue and just weird performances from all the supporting actors."
"__MOVIES__ I kinda want to see it now."
"__MOVIES__ You should! It's a lot of fun to go see in a theater with a crowd."
"__MOVIES__ Do they still show it in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ All the time! It's actually gained a huge cult following the last couple of years and is often shown in theaters at late-night screenings."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of is. It's the kind of movie you'd think would have been buried soon after it was released  and never allowed to see the light of day again, aand yet here it is, with all sorts of fans."
"__MOVIES__ Well it's kind of neat when that happens though, and something good comes of something that initially seem so bad."
"__MOVIES__ It is. There's even a fictionalized movie about the making of it coming out soon, from James Franco and Seth Rogen, who are apparently big fans of it."
