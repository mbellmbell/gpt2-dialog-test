"__DISNEY__ My kids broke their Frozen DVD today."
"__DISNEY__ Oh no!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it created a mini-meltdown in the house.  My daughter was in tears."
"__DISNEY__ What are you going to do about it."
"__DISNEY__ We bought the DVD/Bluray combo so we have a backup."
"__DISNEY__ Crisis averted."
"__DISNEY__ Problem is it's really scratched up.  Any ideas?"
"__DISNEY__ You should clean it with a wet towel to see if that helps."
"__DISNEY__ You don't think it will make it worse, do you?"
"__DISNEY__ No worse than Elsa freezing it!"
