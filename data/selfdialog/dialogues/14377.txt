"__HORROR__ Guess what I'm watching? Yes, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter."
"__HORROR__ Wasn't the last chapter was it? It kept going past that."
"__HORROR__ it's still good for a slasher film. And Corey Feldman is in it."
"__HORROR__ Oh he was great in that movie. He should of made the next film that used Tommy."
"__HORROR__ Jason kills so many innocent victims. Why is he so unreasonable?"
"__HORROR__ When you're left to drown by irresponsible teens, things go haywire. Do you blame him?"
"__HORROR__ Tommy's sister is the best survivor. She screams her head off."
"__HORROR__ She's beautiful and pretty smart for a blonde. I don't think I saw her again."
"__HORROR__ I don't like when we don't witness how they die. We don't get to see how Jason gets that bike riding twin."
"__HORROR__ It was most likely a boring kill. We see the most creative damage done."
