"__MOVIES__ I'm going to the Traverse Film Festival next month... I'm so excited."
"__MOVIES__ I've never been to a film festival. What kind of movies will you see?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's heavy on foreign films and documentaries."
"__MOVIES__ I pretty much just see big box office movies, like the Oscar nominees."
"__MOVIES__ I like some of those too, as long as they have great characters and well developed narratives."
"__MOVIES__ So I thought film festivals were mostly 'art movies.'"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I suppose some would be classified like that, but it offers a lot of genres, and some great classics too."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm, well maybe I should take a look at it. So like any films I would have heard of?"
"__MOVIES__ One of the people's choice films they will show on an outdoor screen is 'What About Bob?'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow... I loved that movie. Bill Murray is one of my favorite actors."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke. They show several cult classics like that... really iconic films along with independent films no one has ever heard of."
"__MOVIES__ So what is the weirdest film you are going to see?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I might see Brigsby Bear. It has some great people in it, like Greg Kinnear and Claire Danes, but a really strange storyline."
"__MOVIES__ Alrighty then. Anything more mainstream?"
"__MOVIES__ My number one choice is 'Paris Can Wait' with Diane Lane and Alex Baldwin. I watched the trailer...looks very gorgeous and enjoyable. A good contrast to some of the more bizarre films I'll probably see."
"__MOVIES__ Well, let me know how you like the festival. Maybe you can talk me into going with you next year."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I forgot: my favorite genre is 'shorts.' And... wait for it: Melissa Gilbert and her husband Tim Busfield made one of the shorts, and they are going to be speaking after the presentation of it... in person!"
"__MOVIES__ Really??? I love Melissa Gilbert. Alright, can I come with you?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I'll send you the brochure and schedule and we can pick out some ones we want to see together."
"__MOVIES__ Fun. Thanks."
