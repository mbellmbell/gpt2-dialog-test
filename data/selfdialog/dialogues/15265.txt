"__HARRY_POTTER__ The happiest part of the movies for me is the epilogue, seeing everyone send their kids off on the train and everything is calm."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's my favorite part too. I love when Harry reassures Albus Severus."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that Albus Severus and James are both happier versions of the people they are named after."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, exactly. Albus is so reassured by his dad that he's not afraid of being in Slytherin."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's like Harry gets to be the dad he always wished he had."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's cool to see how Ron and Hermione are so proud of their kids. Ron is finally confident and Hermione is probably famous and still hardworking."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Their kids seem like they are all best friends on the train."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What about Scorpius Malfoy?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ His parents seem like they are very loving too. They hug him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, the vibes in the epilogue do seem like Draco Malfoy would be a better parent."
