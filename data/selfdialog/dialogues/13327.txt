"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did Seattle run Lynch up the middle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ eck no they did a fake reverse handoff throw back to Russel Wilson to get down to the 5."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First play after the fumble. I mean, That's creative play calling right there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If it hadn't been for denvers safety, the only guy who wasn't fooled, it would have been an easy TD."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've seen a lot of creativity from a lot of teams, especially in the red zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i would always scratch my head wondering why can't the Texans do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We were so basic and predictable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only creative play was that wide receivers screen to Fuller in week 2."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wasn't O'Brien the offensive co-ordinator at Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i  think so. It would be interesting to watch video of their plays near the line to see what O'Brien might be aiming for if he gets the QB capable of the required throws."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The line is a big part of it but the QB can help the line out big time by getting rid of the ball faster - enter Watson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Osweiler and Savage are both a bit slow at getting rid of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Two fresh and dangerous backs will also add some firepower."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the offense will be better and likely improve from week to week - barring key injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fido will likely be our big bodied receiver near the line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The reason why the O was so bad can be summarized in a word; Brock."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He didn't know the system well and in general he is just not that good. That's why Fitz and Hoyer (to name 2) played better at QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The OL is still the biggest question, secondary being second."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No good OL play will mean QB play won't be as good as it can be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The running game will not have the impact it should with Foreman and Miller."
