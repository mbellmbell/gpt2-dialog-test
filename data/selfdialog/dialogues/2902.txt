"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like all kinds of music, but mostly metal I think."
"__MUSIC__ Why metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the guitar sounds a lot, it is very energetic and lively."
"__MUSIC__ Lively is one way to put it. I don't like metal a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Well you might've not heard the right bands then."
"__MUSIC__ What are some good metal bands?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't listen to any of the stuff that people are like, 'Oh this is the heaviest band out there!'"
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of that heavy stuff just isn't very musical, at least most of what I've heard."
"__MUSIC__ That's my main complaint actually, I don't usually hear a lot of music in the songs if you know what I mean."
"__MUSIC__ Some bands are definitely like that. What about Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of their stuff I like."
"__MUSIC__ Did you listen to the Kill 'Em All album?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, I'm not very familiar with them though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah listen to that album and Master of Puppets, both of those are very good."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe if I'm in the mood I will."
"__MUSIC__ Or if you don't want to listen to them at least listen to something lighter."
"__MUSIC__ What's a lighter metal band?"
"__MUSIC__ Iron Maiden is like classic metal that never gets too heavy and is very melodic."
