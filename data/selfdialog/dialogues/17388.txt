"__MOVIES__ Have you read anything about Baby Driver?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of like Boss Baby?"
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ An SNL sketch where a boss is literally a baby."
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think it's about that."
"__MOVIES__ Hold on, I'll look it up."
"__MOVIES__ Okay."
"__MOVIES__ It looks like a driving movie, like fast and the furious, but with some mental issue."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wait, it's a gangster/heist movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what I'm seeing."
"__MOVIES__ Looks good?"
"__MOVIES__ The reviews are awesome, 100%."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but with how many reviews? It's not out yet."
"__MOVIES__ 40."
"__MOVIES__ 100% with 40 reviews and a week to go?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup!"
"__MOVIES__ This will be great, then. Let's go see it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay...want to drive...baby?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not Baby Driver."
"__MOVIES__ Drat!"
