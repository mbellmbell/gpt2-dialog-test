"__MUSIC__ So, what the heck is 'shoegaze' anyway?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know. It's... basically any band that tries to sound like My Bloody Valentine."
"__MUSIC__ That's a genre now? Do they all engineer it in the same bizarre way, so you can't hear anything that's going on?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of them, I guess. It's part of the aesthetic, to a certain extent."
"__MUSIC__ It seems to me any genre is basically a whole bunch of people who say, 'I like what this guy does, so I'm going to imitate him.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's what they are, exactly. It's not like anyone plans these things out rationally -- let's fill this sonic niche!"
"__MUSIC__ But it's getting absurd now. I can't understand what anyone is talking about, because of all this ultra-granular jargon."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you're just getting old. It's a thought."
"__MUSIC__ You don't think this is super annoying, that three people decide they want to copy another artist and so suddenly that's a legitimate genre that everyone else has to keep track of?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you don't have to do anything."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I understand why bands almost never self-identify with a genre. And if they do, there's probably something phony going on."
"__MUSIC__ Phony how?"
"__MUSIC__ Like... okay, there were a few bands in Seattle that made it big around the same time and shared a few loose commonalities, so people lumped them together as 'grunge' music. None of them thought of themselves as grunge, because what the hell is grunge; they all had different influences, were doing their own things."
"__MUSIC__ And they're all dead now, except one. 'Oh ai-hi, o-oh, I'm still alive...'"
"__MUSIC__ Classy. Point is, okay, they're described as grunge -- but if you start a new 'grunge' band, with the ambition of sounding like those other guys, there's something inauthentic about that."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what's authentic? All art builds off all other art, and nothing is ever totally new."
"__MUSIC__ There are degrees, you know. Not everything is some nihilist black-and-white shrugfest."
"__MUSIC__ So you're saying anyone who deliberately starts a 'shoegaze' band is automatically lesser somehow because they're buying into something that already exists?"
"__MUSIC__ That's not quite it. It goes back to form and function, I guess. All art is functional, in that its pieces all serve to communicate something -- but this is more formal than functional."
"__MUSIC__ Formal, like a champagne flute wearing a tuxedo?"
