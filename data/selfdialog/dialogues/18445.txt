"__MOVIES__ Do you like Western movies? And do you have any favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't really like the old westerns but I like The Quick and the Dead."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the newer one with Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and also Leonardo DiCaprio was in it. It was really suspenseful and well acted."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, I loved it. I saw Tombstone just recently too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah I like that one. What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it was okay but it was a little long for my taste. I loved Val Kilmer's character though."
"__MOVIES__ Right. I didn't care for him as Batman though."
"__MOVIES__ Everyone knows Michael Keaton is Batman. I don't really like Christian Bale either."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither. I love the Dark Knight movies but don't care for him as Batman."
"__MOVIES__ He needs to do something about that voice. I know he meant well but it's annoying."
"__MOVIES__ The directing and cinematography are what make that movie great."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Batman Vs Superman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did and it was just ok to me. I'm more of a Marvel fan."
"__MOVIES__ I like the fact that they're building up to The Justice League."
"__MOVIES__ Now that I am definitely excited about. Wonder Woman was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ It was but it was a little on the boring side for a superhero movie."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, they could have done more. Have you seen Deadpool?"
"__MOVIES__ One of my favorite movies now. I watched it like five times in a row when I bought the dvd."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, almost as many times. It was hilarious, well acted, and so much action packed in."
