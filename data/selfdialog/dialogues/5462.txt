"__STAR_WARS__ So, how would you have changed The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I would have added more of TR-8R.  Heck, maybe even made him a secondary protagonist."
"__STAR_WARS__ What.. who's TR-8R?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not surprised you don't know him, they never gave his name.  He's that Stormtrooper Finn confronts, who calls him a traitor, drops his blaster and shield and pulls out a baton type weapon."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, yeah, I remember that scene!  That was pretty cool!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, but it was waaaay too short.  The should have built that guy up a little more, maybe have something interrupt the battle and them have them fight to the death later or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did he get shot or something like ten seconds within the fight?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not sure it was even that long, but yeah."
"__STAR_WARS__ Man, it's a bit like Darth Maul, cool villain, but little development."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and they both died in a pretty lame fashion as well."
