"__BEATLES__ Are you listening to the Beatles again?"
"__BEATLES__ When am I not listening to the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Good point. I like their music, but never really understood the hype."
"__BEATLES__ They had class and talent."
"__BEATLES__ Sure, don't get me wrong I like them, Yellow Sub and Sergent Pepper's are both great."
"__BEATLES__ Those are the most popular, but they have a lot of more technical songs that are better."
"__BEATLES__ Really? Do you think they achieved such stardom because of all the controversy and the untimely dying."
"__BEATLES__ Well, the music industry loves a good controversy and artists are always more popular after they die."
"__BEATLES__ So, John Lennon wouldn't be as much of a legend if he were alive."
"__BEATLES__ Maybe, but Paul McCartney is still a legend and he is alive. So they are just that good!"
