"__MOVIES__ Give me a recommendation of a dumb, but funny movie."
"__MOVIES__ Watch The Hot Chick."
"__MOVIES__ Is that a new movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, its from like 2002."
"__MOVIES__ Who all is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think the only well-known actor is Rob Schneider."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ This deadbeat guy who gets turned into a hot chick. Its hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds odd."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you said you wanted a dumb, funny movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Is it just a bunch of sex jokes and whatnot?"
"__MOVIES__ There are some, of course, but its not full of them. Just try it."
"__MOVIES__ I will. When did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it in like 2005. I watched it a few times because it was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Its not a chick flick, right?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I assume most of the people who like it are girls."
"__MOVIES__ I'll watch it tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me how you like it. I know it got bad ratings."
"__MOVIES__ This is like the 3rd movie with Rob Schnieder turning into something else."
"__MOVIES__ The other one I know of is The Animal"
