"__MUSIC__ What have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been feeling a little nostalgic lately, so I've been listening to a lot of singer-song writer stuff that kind of reminds me of home."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I like that kind of music, but I don't listen to much of it! Can you suggest some artists?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! I really like Sufjan Stevens and Bon Iver."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of Bon Iver, but not Sufjan Stevens."
"__MUSIC__ His stuff is amazing! 4th of July is probably my favorite song off of Carrie & Lowell."
"__MUSIC__ Where is he from? Sufjan isn't a name you hear every day"
"__MUSIC__ He's from the US! I think he's from Michigan."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll have to check him out. Any other recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, are you interested in music that's not in English?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't mind! What do you suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the band Soy Un Caballo - their name is in Spanish, but I think they're from Belgium, and they sing in French."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that all sounds awesome. Can you recommend a song?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely listen to Volet. It's really soft and pretty and the singer's voice is really calming."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! I'll check it out!"
"__MUSIC__ Fantastic. Who are you listening to in that genre?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to Squalloscope lately! Have you heard of her?"
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't! Can you tell me about her?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Her music is very moving and emotional and has unique lyrics. Check out their song Bloodbath for Birds or Big Houses."
"__MUSIC__ Will do! She sounds awesome"
