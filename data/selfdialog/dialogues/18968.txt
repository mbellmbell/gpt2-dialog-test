"__MOVIES__ Hey, do you want to go watch a movie tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ Is there anything good out?"
"__MOVIES__ There's the new King Arthur movie and Guardians of the Galaxy 2."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2, it was a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really better than the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, you can't beat the original origin story but this one was a different kind of movie. Both were great though."
"__MOVIES__ Different? How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It was very personal movie especially for Peter Quill."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I heard you find out who his father is."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's crazy but I don't want to spoil anything for you. But I will say that it was an emotional ending for him."
"__MOVIES__ Ok stop it don't spoil me. Is the movie funny though?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, rocket, baby groot and Drax are all very funny. Especially Drax which is surprising."
"__MOVIES__ Nice, I'll be sure to check that out soon. Should I stay for the extra credit scene?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, there's like 5 of them."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. So do you think King Arthur is any good?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. The seems like some lame Hollywood remake but I'm a fan of Guy Ritchie."
"__MOVIES__ Guy Ritchie does know how to tell a great story and Jude Law is a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like the trailer though. It made it seem like a bad fantasy movie."
"__MOVIES__ The review online seems to say it's good though."
"__MOVIES__ True, ok let's go watch it. It's worth a shot."
