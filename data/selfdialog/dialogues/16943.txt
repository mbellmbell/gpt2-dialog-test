"__MOVIES__ Do you think there is something special about movies from the 80's and the 90's?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by special?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it seems like they are from an era that is a hundred years ago, not a few decades ago."
"__MOVIES__ Like the quality is bad in them?"
"__MOVIES__ No I mean everyone seems much more relaxed, confident and people just overall smiled more."
"__MOVIES__ I think I know what your saying, something like a time before the war on terror where people were more trusting?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, exactly. It seemed like there was a period of time around there were race was not a big deal, sexuality was not a big deal and people got a long much better."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I see what your saying now. Yes, I totally agree."
"__MOVIES__ I think that movies are representative of the time periods they were made in and the movies in the 90's were much more happy go lucky."
"__MOVIES__ Have any specific films in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Hm.. I don't know. Maybe something like 'While you were sleeping' or 'Santa Clause' with Tim Allen."
"__MOVIES__ Also there was 'Hook'. That one is one of my favorites, its a classic."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, I know there are others that are probably more representative of the idea I'm trying to convey but I can't remember them off the top of my head."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm.. Well they will come to you. Just don't overthink it."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, what era is your favorite period of films?"
"__MOVIES__ I like 50's the most."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there were stars like Elvis Presely and Maryilin Monroe and there is something about them, like they have a sparkle in their eye."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean, its almost as if they knew something secret and important and it gave them a broader perspective."
"__MOVIES__ I think they had an insight into the future as well, they knew that they were embodying something that captures peoples attention and would do so for decades maybe even centuries."
