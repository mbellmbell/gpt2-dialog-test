"__MUSIC__ I just saw a Facebook memory the other day from high school. It was about some Scene/Emo bands I used to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Scene phase, What an embarrassing phase, worse than the 80's trends."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it was like Emo 80's vengeance,"
"__MUSIC__ So what did you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Lot's of weird myspace stuff, like Jeffree Star, Geoffrey paris, Millionaires, 3o3, Medic Droid, hollywood undead, blood on the dancefloor..."
"__MUSIC__ So much noise and color and candy and makeup and hair....wasn't really my scene. I listened to 303, gaga, kesha...whatever was on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ speaking of kesha...what's she been up to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ well she got out of her contract or whatever with that weirdo producer, but I don't think I've heard any music from her recently, and it would be an opportune time to drop a single."
"__MUSIC__ when I first hear of her, I didn't really like her. she was part of that remake of 'you spin me right round'...I hated it."
"__MUSIC__ but, tick tock was catchy?"
"__MUSIC__ yeah, I can agree with that."
"__MUSIC__ What is a Jeffree Star?"
"__MUSIC__ Don't be rude...Jeffree Star is a dude that feels comfortable presenting himself in a very feminine way. He's gotten famous as a makeup artist and even launched a rather successful line of cosmetics. He also performs, and sings."
"__MUSIC__ Well I respect the success, I just don't like the look."
"__MUSIC__ That's what caught my eye, but I feel that Jeffree star has Stagnated as a musical artist."
"__MUSIC__ I do like his tattoos of Elvis and Kurt Kobain."
"__MUSIC__ That's a true artistic homage that I think anyone can appreciate Two legends from very different ideas."
"__MUSIC__ My grandmother used to faint at the sight of Elvis"
"__MUSIC__ My sister fainted at the sight of Kurt Kobain!"
"__MUSIC__ That is too funny!"
