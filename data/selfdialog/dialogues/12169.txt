"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dolphins had a pretty good year, don't you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they weren't bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't they make the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, but got bounced by the Patriots or something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sometimes forget that Suh is on their team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That guy is a menace."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is, but I'm not sure he's worth the money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they paid him a truckload."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he's not really producing a whole lot with stats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's probably freeing up some other defensive players more I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like Cameron Wake.  He's underrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like him, but he's on the wrong side of 30 now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On the offensive side, Tannenhill seems like he's doing okay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was pretty solid last year.  Had some trouble with accuracy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he always has."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he's got young legs and that keeps them in some games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like their running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean Jay Ajayi?  Yeah, great pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's speedy, makes good cuts, just a good player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a good example of drafting running backs low and getting maximum production from them."
