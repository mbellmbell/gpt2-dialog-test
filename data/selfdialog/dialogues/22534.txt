"__DISNEY__ Hey, have you heard the Japanese version of that song from Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ No. No. No! Stop right there! I don't want to hear anything about any songs from Frozen!"
"__DISNEY__ Why not? The movie and those songs were amazing!"
"__DISNEY__ Do you have kids? Everywhere we go in the car, we're constantly playing that soundtrack. And we play the Blu-Ray at least once a week"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, that would probably wear on you after a while."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think I'm ever going to want to 'build a snowman' ever again."
"__DISNEY__ Well, you have to admit, Disney really created an instant classic with that movie."
"__DISNEY__ I don't care, in my book, that movie will never be as good as Lilo and Stitch."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you say that?"
"__DISNEY__ There wasn't any singing in Lilo and Stitch."
