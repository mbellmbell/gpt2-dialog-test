"__BASKETBALL__ I can't believe the Wizards lost in the playoffs against the Celtics."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can believe it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Any team with Isaiah Thomas is a threat.  He is amazing"
"__BASKETBALL__ He is definitely a good player.  A very hardworker."
"__BASKETBALL__ If you combine his talent with the talent that the Celtics have on the bench, you get a great team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed.  I just thought John Wall would be able to do enough to take out the Celtics."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Wizards problem is that they don't have the deep bench that the Celtics have."
"__BASKETBALL__ You don't think the Wizards have a deep bench?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I don't.  The Celtics bench outscored the Wizards bench throughout their playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hopefully, the Wizards can pick up a few guys in the offseason to help John Wall."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep.  Isaiah Thomas has plenty of help on the court."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is too bad Isaiah Thomas got injured."
"__BASKETBALL__ He got injured??? What happened?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He has a hip injury."
"__BASKETBALL__ Will he play against the Cavaliers?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No.  He may be done for the season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, that is disappointing for him.  It is also disappointing for me as a fan."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  We will see have to see how they perform against the Cavaliers without Isaiah."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe they have enough talented to get them past the Cavaliers.  It will be a challenge."
