"__BASEBALL__ How are the Nats doing this season?"
"__BASEBALL__ Pretty well! Leading their division."
"__BASEBALL__ Think they'll make the postseason?"
"__BASEBALL__ Pretty confident."
"__BASEBALL__ Who else could knock them out?"
"__BASEBALL__ The NL East isn't looking great this year, I think they'll win the division pretty easily."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I saw the Mets aren't doing nearly as well as last year."
"__BASEBALL__ No, not at all."
"__BASEBALL__ Bryce Harper's contract is ending soon, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, it was supposed to end after this season, but they managed to sign him to one more year."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, how much?"
"__BASEBALL__ 21.6 million. Quite a contract."
"__BASEBALL__ That is a ton of money."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I hope he's worth it. Nats need to win a pennant while they have him, Scherzer, and Strasburg."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they've got quite a bit of talent, it'd be a shame not to capitalize now."
"__BASEBALL__ The team is in great shape, I think they can compete. The Cubs look good too though."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, making the postseason is just the first step. Think they can make it to the World Series?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I was worried about the Cubs after last season, but they seem to be underperforming so far."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, maybe they'll make it."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope so!"
