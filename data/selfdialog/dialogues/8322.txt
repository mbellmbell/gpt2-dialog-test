"__POP__ My favorite pop song of all time is Hit Me Baby by Britney Spears."
"__POP__ That's an odd but respectable classic pick."
"__POP__ When you hear it you can't help but sing along."
"__POP__ This much is true, Britney was good at that."
"__POP__ We're even seeing her song Toxic kind of make a comeback."
"__POP__ Yeah which is odd out of nowhere."
"__POP__ Out of nowhere indeed, my kid sister has been blasting it."
"__POP__ Has it been getting radio airplay again?"
"__POP__ Not that I know of, just seems to be an internet thing."
"__POP__ Leave it to the internet for dig up old tunes."
