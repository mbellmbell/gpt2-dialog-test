"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So do you think they will keep having success on the Fast and Furious movies without Paul Walker?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I would say yes, they sitll have the Rock and Vin Diesel who are both headline actors"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ True but the whole series without Paul just doesn't seem right and its missing something dont you agree?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I do agree but look at Tokyo Drift, noboby was in that one except for Lil Bow Wow and it did pretty good at the box office"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah that one I don't even consider as part of the Fast series it should just be called Tokyo Drift and drop the Fast and Furious logo"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you know that a new Fast is being released sometime this year?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No I didn't but I guess i'll give it a chance and see if it's any good"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Should be like I said they still have The Rock who is a great action actor"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes I really liked him in Faster and The Scorpion King"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Aw Man those movies were awful what bad examples of his better work."
