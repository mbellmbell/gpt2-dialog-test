"__MOVIES__ I finally saw The Lego Movie the other day."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely, very alright."
"__MOVIES__ That's it? Just alright."
"__MOVIES__ It was okay. It wasn't as deep or funny as I expected."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what did you expect? It is a children's film after all."
"__MOVIES__ Just because a movie is made for kids, that doesn't mean it can't shoot for the stars."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose. What didn't you like about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Mostly all the live action stuff involving Will Ferrall and his kid. Not his kid, but you know, his movie son."
"__MOVIES__ But that's the best part of the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ No, no, no, it's all cheesy and kind of takes you out of it."
"__MOVIES__ But it's really meta! It shows how ultimately Legos are just toys to encourage kids to grow and have fun."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I get it. It's still stupid."
"__MOVIES__ You've gotta be the only one that feels that way."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just feel like the movie is trying to be deeper than it is. It doesn't help that everyone hyped it up and it didn't live up to expectations."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. I felt the same way about Avatar."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I would've enjoyed it more if I hadn't heard all the praise for the movie. The Peanuts Movie was sort of similar."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was better than The Lego Movie. If nothing else, it was beautiful; really stunning how they captured the look of the cartoon."
"__MOVIES__ I'll agree to that. It's a great looking movie, especially on Blu-ray!"
