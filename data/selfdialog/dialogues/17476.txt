"__MOVIES__ I'm excited to see the third Planet of the Apes movie coming out soon."
"__MOVIES__ My wife won't watch those movies with me - she is afraid of jumping monkeys."
"__MOVIES__ That's an oddly specific fear. I think those movies are surprisingly well done."
"__MOVIES__ I guess we know that the apes will win the war, so that won't be too big of a surprise."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I wonder if we will find out how humans lose the ability to speak as they do in the original Charlton Heston movie."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard a lot of bad things about the new Transformers movie that just came out."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe it is the fifth movie in that series. Hopefully it will be the last."
"__MOVIES__ It's too bad Shia Labeouf isn't in the movies anymore. He's a pretty underrated actor."
"__MOVIES__ Now they are starring Mark Whalberg. He does a good job at playing sort of an every man."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear the news about Disney firing the directors of the young Han Solo movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, I didn't hear that - what happened?"
"__MOVIES__ They were pretty far into filming but then the two directors got fired. Apparently it was due to creative differences."
"__MOVIES__ Who were the directors?"
"__MOVIES__ It was Chris Miller and Phil Lord. They had previously done The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what the creative differences were?"
"__MOVIES__ The rumor I heard was that they were changing too much of Lawrence Kasdan's script and doing too much improvisation on set."
"__MOVIES__ Who are they going to have be the new director?"
"__MOVIES__ They got Ron Howard to come in. Should be interesting to see how the final movie turns out."
"__MOVIES__ I guess with so much riding on the Star Wars franchise there isn't a lot of room for experimentation."
"__MOVIES__ The same thing happened on Rogue One where they brought in Tony Gilroy for reshoots."
