"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think there are any teams that were as good as the Patriots are nowadays?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There were quite a few great teams in the past, but none of them has lasted as long as the Patriots' dynasty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did any teams come close?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers and the Cowboys probably came the closest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did they do? Did they win a lot of Super Bowls?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Back then it was a little harder to win it every year or every other year. The schedules were a little tougher and medical technology wasn't as good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then why do you say they were so good if they didn't win it every year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because they could have won it all every year without injuries and such. The Steelers won the Super Bowl 4 times within a 6 year period."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's pretty good. How about the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys were one of those teams that was good every year, year in and year out, for decades. In fact, I think two of the Steelers' victories came against the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Were there any other teams like that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Vikings were great every year, but they always lost when they made it to the Super Bowl. They won it one year, but lost all the rest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure. Green Bay was a solid dynasty rivaling the Patriots, but they were on the decline by the time the Super Bowl became a 'thing.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then why do you say they were great?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, before the Super Bowl there was the league championships, and Green Bay was always winning their league championship. It culminated with Green Bay winning the first two Super Bowls and then they went into decline."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that it? Were there any other great teams besides the Steelers, Cowboys, Viking, and Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There were the Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did they do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were one of those 'almost' teams that constantly dominated their division, had a great defense, terrorized everyone, but always managed to lose in the playoffs. In fact, they never made it to the Super Bowl until XIV, when they lost to that great Steelers team."
