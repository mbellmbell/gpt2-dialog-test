"__BEATLES__ This is a random question but did you ever listen to music from the 50's and 60's? You know, groups like The Beach Boys and The Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ I listen to those artists all the time!  My favorite group was the Beatles.  Did you have a favorite song?"
"__BEATLES__ They had so many hits, where do I start?!  If I was forced to choose one I'd have to say 'I saw her standing there.'"
"__BEATLES__ That's a good song! They really don't make music like that anymore do they?  The lyrics were so meaningful."
"__BEATLES__ Did you have a favorite songs by them?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, my all time favorite was 8 Days a Week."
"__BEATLES__ That was in my Top 5!  Wouldn't it be cool if there was a group like that day?"
"__BEATLES__ That would be awesome!"
"__BEATLES__ I know a couple of them are still alive-- Isn't Paul McCartney still going on tour?"
"__BEATLES__ I think he is.  I wonder if he plays Beatles songs or if he mostly focuses on his newer stuff?"
