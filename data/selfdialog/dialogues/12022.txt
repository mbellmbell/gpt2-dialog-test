"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you seen the series 'All or Nothing' about the Los Angels Rams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the one on Amazon Prime?  I haven't seen that one but I enjoyed the one about the Arizona Cardinals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well in the latest series they cover the move of the Rams from St. Louis back to L.A. and the entire season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know it was a very disappointing season for the Rams.  They were expecting much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The move was disruptive but they didn't use it as an excuse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I recall that they fired Jeff Fisher with about three games left in the season, which is unusual because head coaches usually don't get fire in the middle of  a season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jeff Fisher is highly regarded around the league as one of the better head coaches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think they lost so many games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One problems was a quarterback controversy, which always hurts a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  They gave up some higher picks to draft a new young quarterback and wanted to give him a shot sooner rather than later."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still don't get their losing records.  The Rams have one of the best running backs in the game and their defense features some All-Pro players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree.  They have a lot of talent on both sides of the ball so that's why the head coach got the blame, I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their new head coach is very young, under 40, but he did a smart thing in bringing in Wade Phillips to coach the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is smart.  Wade has been around the NFL for years and has forgotten more about defense than most coaches know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They held onto their special teams coach and couple others but all the other coaches were let go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I remember that the special teams coach was the interim head coach when Fisher was fired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  He coached the last 3 games but didn't do so well although the players seem to respect him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to wonder what their records would have been if they had stayed in St. Louis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll never know but I think they'll do better once their new permanent stadium is finished."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That will probably help from a morale standpoint but a winning records would help even more!"
