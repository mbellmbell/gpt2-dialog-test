"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she's weird."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Of course, that's why she's Lady Gaga."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I mean what kind of name is that any way?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It fits her. So you don't like her?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she's okay. I like the song Paparrazzi."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like that song, too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm not really a big fan of pop music, though. Why do you ask?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I was just wondering. She's coming to town I hear."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think I'll pass on that!"
