"__ROCK__ Why do The Rolling Stones keep making music?"
"__ROCK__ Not sure what you mean."
"__ROCK__ They haven't produced a good album in probably 30 years."
"__ROCK__ I have to admit, I can't think of a single song that's come out recently."
"__ROCK__ In my opinion, they're just old and don't care."
"__ROCK__ Well, they have their money, their fame, their women."
"__ROCK__ At this point, it's just kind of creepy."
"__ROCK__ Drugs probably caught up to them too."
"__ROCK__ Yeah.  Mick Jagger might explode if he tries to dance anymore."
"__ROCK__ That would be pretty cool to see."
