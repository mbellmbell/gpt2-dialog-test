"__MOVIES__ What are you watching?"
"__MOVIES__ A comedy. It's called Multiplicity."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's good, especially if you like Michael Keaton."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, he's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he plays, um... several of the lead roles."
"__MOVIES__ That's odd."
"__MOVIES__ Well the whole basis of the movie is that he multiplies himself, so you have all these versions of him going around."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly like him?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the problem, each one is slightly different with their own quirks."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like that could be trouble."
"__MOVIES__ It is, it gets him into some trouble. That's where the comedy comes in."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting."
"__MOVIES__ There's one version of himself that's a bit mentally handicapped, one I believe is gay.. but the mentally handicapped one is my favourite."
"__MOVIES__ Is it an older movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Relatively. It's also relatively new when you think about it."
"__MOVIES__ Well I've liked Michael Keaton in other stuff."
"__MOVIES__ I loved him as Batman."
"__MOVIES__ I thought he was the best Batman ever!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
