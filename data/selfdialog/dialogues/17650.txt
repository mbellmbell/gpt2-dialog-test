"__MOVIES__ Do you like The Shining?"
"__MOVIES__ I love it. It's one of my favorites of all-time."
"__MOVIES__ Did you read Stephen King's book the film is based on?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It's a rare instance where the book and movie are equally good."
"__MOVIES__ Stephen King does not agree. He dislikes Kubrick's film version."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Kubrick did not use King's screenplay and called his writing weak."
"__MOVIES__ Ouch. That's cold."
"__MOVIES__ Harsh, right? Also, he did not like Jack Nicholson being cast as Jack Torrance."
"__MOVIES__ Nicholson is one of the best parts of the film!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, King's argument was that Jack Nicholson appears a bit crazy immediately."
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe a bit true."
"__MOVIES__ The character's madness is supposed to be gradual."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, brought on by the hotel."
"__MOVIES__ I am undecided about Shelley Duvall in that film. I kind of like her but  also feel she is the weakest link."
"__MOVIES__ Kubrick was really rough on her."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I read that the filming was quite traumatic for her."
"__MOVIES__ That film scared me so much when I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ I remember when I saw those twins I ran to hide under my bed!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I am going to re-watch it tonight!"
