"__ROCK__ What do you think is the worst rock band of all time?"
"__ROCK__ Nickelback, hands down. If you can even call them a rock band."
"__ROCK__ Haha! I would have to agree."
"__ROCK__ I mean all of their songs sound the same."
"__ROCK__ I feel like the say he sings and his voice makes him sound like he's trying too hard."
"__ROCK__ It's just like generic wannabe rock music. There was nothing unique about them."
"__ROCK__ Yet, their songs like 'How You Remind Me' and 'Photograph' were huge hits."
"__ROCK__ Yea and they overplayed them so much. It was so annoying."
"__ROCK__ Maybe that's why everyone loves to hate on Nickelback's music, because it was just generic rock songs that were highly overplayed."
"__ROCK__ Probably. Or people just have bad taste in music."
