"__MUSIC__ The music in Spike Lee's films is always so good."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't really paid attention to it, well, I guess I've only seen a few of his films."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see Do the Right Thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I remember Public Enemy in that."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but his father was a jazz musician and he did parts of the scores to many of Spike's movies and there is always great music in each scene."
"__MUSIC__ I remember Mo' Better Blues.  That was kind of jazzy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, jazz and blues, his father had some influence on that but I think it was the Marsalis brothers, Wynton and Branford, that arranged it."
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember the songs."
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking of Crooklyn, especially.  There was a lot of 1970's soul in that film, because it took place in the 70's."
"__MUSIC__ What songs were in Crooklyn?  I don't think I've ever seen it."
"__MUSIC__ Pusherman by Curtis Mayfield, Mighty Love by the Spinners, Thin Line Between Love and Hate by the Persuaders.  Just fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ I love Curtis Mayfield and The Spinners.  I'm going to have to check out the soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of soundtracks, do you have a favorite?"

"__MUSIC__ That Julee Cruise song I remember, was really good.  What was it called?"
"__MUSIC__ Falling."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was kind of spooky."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that This Mortal Coil is going to cover it for the new Twin Peaks."
