"__HORROR__ Have you seen '28 Days Later'?"
"__HORROR__ No, what's it about?"
"__HORROR__ It's about a zombie takeover of England. There's really creepy footage of London just completely empty."
"__HORROR__ I like zombie movies, I'll have to see it."
"__HORROR__ It was directed by the same guy who did 'Trainspotting', too."
"__HORROR__ Oh I love that movie. That's scary in its own way."
"__HORROR__ There's a sequel too called '28 Weeks Later', but in my opinion it's not as good."
"__HORROR__ Same director?"
"__HORROR__ No, it's a different director and I think that's why it's not as good."
"__HORROR__ Always best for horror franchises to keep the same director."
