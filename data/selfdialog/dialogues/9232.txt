"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Tigers play the Rangers last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, too bad they lost."
"__BASEBALL__ What was the final score? I didn't see the end of the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Rangers beat the TIgers 5-3"
"__BASEBALL__ Too bad they lost!  Don't they play the Rangers again today?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, at 7:15 tonight."
"__BASEBALL__ I'll have to watch that game.  I think next week they play the Astros."
"__BASEBALL__ I think so too.  So when I was watching the game the tigers only had 2 runs.  When did they get the third?"
"__BASEBALL__ They didn't get the third run until the 9th inning."
"__BASEBALL__ Too bad they didn't pull it together a little sooner. Tigers usually play pretty well, but this season isn't going so good."
"__BASEBALL__ I wish I knew what was holding them back.  They have some great players!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they do.  I'm a big fan of Verlander."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh me too!  He's a favorite but I like Cabrera better."
"__BASEBALL__ Wouldn't it be great if they got it together and won the world series?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it would.  When was the last time they held that title?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think it was back in 1984."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow!  That long ago huh?  I think they've held the World Series title only 4 times."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they could do it again.  It wasn't that long ago that it looked like a good possibility that they would go far again."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, if they are going to get any title, they need to bring a stronger game."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree!"
