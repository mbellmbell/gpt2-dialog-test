"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to oldies?"
"__MUSIC__ Oldies? Of course, they're one of my favorite styles of music!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I didn't know that about you.  What types of oldies do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly the old fifties doo-wop songs, but I like all types of old music."
"__MUSIC__ I love the Temptations.  I think they're my favorite for old music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the Temptations are great, but so are The Four Tops."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, they're great, too."
"__MUSIC__ I think that old music has a style to it that just can't be duplicated today."
"__MUSIC__ No, it really can't.  Their voices were great, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they really seemed to focus on the music more.  Today it's more about the production."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a lot of music seems overproduced today."
"__MUSIC__ I think they had more talent and skill back then."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't necessarily say that, but it seems like they had to work harder."
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't as easy to fix bad music with production techniques, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'll take a good oldie anyday over some of the new stuff I hear."
"__MUSIC__ I tear up when I hear the Righteous Brothers."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, their music has always been amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I think Unchained Melody is one of my favorite songs ever."
"__MUSIC__ It's one of mine, too."
