"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Bill Belichick will retire when Brady does?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to say. I'm sure Belichick has a ton of respect for Brady, but he is really a next man up kind of guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that's what he says but he and Brady have been together for years now. Don't you think it's a little different with him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would assume so, but you never know with Bill. He's very much a business, not personal, kind of guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but with the success they've had together I think it'd be hard to have one without the other going forward."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be strange for sure, but I could see him continuing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, then that brings up the question, how much longer do you think Brady has?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know but I can't see him being a Brett Favre. He has too much respect for the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Brett Favre was an amazing quarterback, but he decided to come back and he just wasn't in his prime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I see. Yeah, I can't see Brady playing if he's not 100%."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither. But as long as he feels good and is playing well, who knows how long he will go!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How old is the oldest quarterback to play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there were a handful to play at 44, almost 45, but not many."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And how old is Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He will be 40 in August, so he'd have to hold out for a few more years to beat that record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he will try?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I honestly don't think he cares about being the oldest, I think he just still really likes the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The key will be not getting hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. At that age, knees can be a major issue."
