"__DISNEY__ Are you excited for Cars 3?"
"__DISNEY__ Not really. I am not a fan of the first two. You?"
"__DISNEY__ What, you are kidding me! The Cars movies are so fun!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not really sure, they just didn't pique my interest. I have heard Cars 3 is better than the second one though."
"__DISNEY__ I think it has a chance to even be the best, from what I've heard."
"__DISNEY__ I will probably see it when it comes to video. Are you going to see it in the theater?"
"__DISNEY__ I will definitely go to the theater. I might even wear Mickey ears!"
"__DISNEY__ Haha, you are so silly. Who is your favorite character?"
"__DISNEY__ Mater! He makes me laugh."
"__DISNEY__ I don't get Mater. I just don't think he's funny."
