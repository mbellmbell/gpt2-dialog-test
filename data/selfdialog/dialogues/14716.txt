"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You studied music in college, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, I have a few degrees in it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What were your favorite- and least-favorite courses?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ SO many favorites, but I'd have to choose Advanced Analysis."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It introduced me to higher-level theory as an undergrad and really opened my eyes to alternative interpretations and how to use mathematical systems to understand music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ WOW. That sounds like a lot."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was, and the graduate-level courses for it, like transformational and set theories, are insane."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What about your least favorite?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, I have two."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ And they are?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Aesthetics and The Science of Music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You seem like you'd like The Science of Music. Why was it bad?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, it was mostly just studying properties of sound waves, rather than interesting things like acoustics. It was a let-down."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I see, that would bug me too. What about aesthetics?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I hated that class to death because it's all philosophy. You know I can't read that crap."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's not crap, but I understand."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Plus, the professor was awful to me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, not awful TO me, just that I couldn't follow him. I could never understand his ways of thinking and his mannerisms."
