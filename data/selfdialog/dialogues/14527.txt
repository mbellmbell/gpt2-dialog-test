"__HORROR__ Have you seen the movie Dead Silence?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, I loved it. I thought it was very creepy!"
"__HORROR__ I agree, I thought the effect of everything going silent when Mary Shaw was about to attack was an excellent effect."
"__HORROR__ It was, the poem created a very creepy ambiance as well."
"__HORROR__ Yes it really did. The twist ending really surprised me as well."
"__HORROR__ Oh you mean when you found out that Edward was dead all along and Ella was the perfect doll?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, that was a real surprise to me!"
"__HORROR__ Me too! I find ventriloquist dolls very creepy, so it was a good overall premise for the movie."
"__HORROR__ Yes it was, the scene in the theater when they find all the dolls and Mary Shaw is possessing them is so scary!"
"__HORROR__ Yes it is! Especially the clown doll."
