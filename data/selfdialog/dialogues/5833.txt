"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Kylo Ren can be forgiven for killing Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He slayed his father. It seems like he's made his choice."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but he felt conflicted about it. Maybe he'll turn out to be a good guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ He seems to have taken a side in the conflict decisively, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ But he was just being manipulated by Snoke."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Darth Vader was just being manipulated by Palpatine."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader died in redemption."
"__STAR_WARS__ He only saw redemption in death, so maybe that's what will happen to Kylo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ I could see him sacrificing himself to make up for it."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would leave the Solo family with no surviving members, though."
