"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think Kendrick Lamar could beat Eminem in a rap battle?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Kendrick is very good, but I don't think anyone is going to beat Eminem."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I actually feel like their styles are similar, but different in a way."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but Eminem is a battle rapper. Kendrick would be scared."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True, I doubt he would even accept the offer."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know if anyone would."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No rapper ever says anything bad about Eminem. He's like untouchable."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They know he could end any of their careers."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Still, I think Kendrick would put up the best fight."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That I can agree with. It would be interesting, for sure."
