"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man. That's a tough one. Definitely not the first or second."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ They just seem a bit long and draggy to me. Plus, they're a little more childish."
"__MOVIES__ So, out of the rest then, which one?"
"__MOVIES__ I would probably have to say The Half-Blood Prince."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool. I really like the Goblet of Fire."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah? Is it because of the whole Tri-Wizard Tournament thing?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not really. Mainly because David Tennant is one of my favorite actors."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, but not just focusing on actors. When you think about the plots or movie, which one do you like the most?"
"__MOVIES__ In that case, it might be the third."
"__MOVIES__ Prisoner of Azkaban?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think that director was really creative with the little additions, like the bird with the Whomping Willow."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. It seemed much more artistic than the rest. But it seemed to change the atmosphere a little too much from the novels for me."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you mean. But isn't that what can be done with movies? It's only an interpretation, after all."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so, but I like it to have the same feel."
"__MOVIES__ I think J.K. Rowling had a role in approving things that went into the movies, though, so it's not like they could get out of control with any changes."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I think that was more related to plot lines and character facts, not necessarily the artistic direction of the film."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ That's why I like the later films a bit more. I just think David Yates did a better job staying true to the spirit of the books."
