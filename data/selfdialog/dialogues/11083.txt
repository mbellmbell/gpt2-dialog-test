"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the NFL should have more games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure why they would want that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, there is always more money in 18 regular season games"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but would the players  like Tom Brady allow it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am sure they could change the rules to make them happy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How would that be possible?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe the rosters could be expanded."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is there enough talent to go around?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so.    After all most teams carry three quarterbacks now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?     Give me an example."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Cowboys have Dak Prescott, Appleby and Rush."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, I guess that makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they could also change the rules to help out the players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How would that work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe a rule that each player must be given a week off during the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How would that help things?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would keep the amount of contact level, and a week of rest during the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would the coaches go for that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they might.     It would help everybody out to some extent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I guess I agree, particularly if they reduce the preseason."
