"__DISNEY__ What did you think of the storyline for the movie WALL-E?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought that it was very realistic and sent a good message about environmental conservation."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think that it went over the heads of kids?"
"__DISNEY__ No because WALL-E was a very relatable robot that kids really loved and they just happened to learn about protecting the environment along the way."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. The fact that WALL-E goes to rescue EVE, a plant, is very important to the plot."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and in the movie the existence of EVE shows that life on Earth is still possible."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I think it shows that humans should never let the Earth fall into disarray to begin with."
"__DISNEY__ In the end, WALL-E has to visit the large ship to rescue EVE, and it shows the future race of humans as extremely lazy, all of them with robot butlers."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, these scenes are funny but I think adults see the ominous warnings about dependence on technology more than kids would."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. That's one aspect of the movie that adults would find more interesting than the kid's would."
