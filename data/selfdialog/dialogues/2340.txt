"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you want to go see Twenty One Pilots next month?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that sounds like fun. I didn't know you were a fan."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious? I've liked them ever since 2009."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. I didn't realize they'd been around that long."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they didn't really make it big until Blurry Face came out."
"__MUSIC__ I always thought that Blurry Face was their debut album."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people tend to think that, but it was actually their 4th."
"__MUSIC__ I never knew!"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, they'd released 2 self titled albums before that and an album called Vessel."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check out their old stuff. So when is the show?"
"__MUSIC__ Its on the 23rd."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if they'll be shooting any videos there."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't hear anything yet, but its totally possible."
"__MUSIC__ I know, they love to have their fans in their videos."
"__MUSIC__ And we'd love to be in one of their videos!"
"__MUSIC__ I know that's right!"
"__MUSIC__ I hope they have a good opening band."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure they will, they usually do."
"__MUSIC__ This is very true."
"__MUSIC__ Alrighty, well, let's go order our tickets!"
