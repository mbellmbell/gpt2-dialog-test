"__MOVIES__ They are doing another werewolf movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? What is this one called?"
"__MOVIES__ Lycan."
"__MOVIES__ I hope the movie is better than that plain title."
"__MOVIES__ I just saw the trailer and I don't think it will be."
"__MOVIES__ Why can't they create a seriously good werewolf movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think because it is expensive."
"__MOVIES__ How?"
"__MOVIES__ CG."
"__MOVIES__ I guess. What is the story behind Lycan?"
"__MOVIES__ Six college kids in a sleepy Southern town are assigned a group project to rediscover a moment in history."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess. One of them starts all of this?"
"__MOVIES__ One of them sets in motion a horrific fate when he proposes they head into the Georgia backwoods to tackle the legend of Emily Burt."
"__MOVIES__ Who was Emily Burt?"
"__MOVIES__ The Talbot County werewolf."
"__MOVIES__ They can do better than this."
"__MOVIES__ True, true but I'm a sucker for anything werewolf-related, so I'll watch it.ï»¿"
"__MOVIES__ So am I but from what you just told me, this one is bad."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I'm all about a good horror movie.  This isn't it."
"__MOVIES__ Agree."
