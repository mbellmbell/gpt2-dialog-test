"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know the Packers are named after a meat company?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ...What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they sponsored them somehow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like the workers played for the team, or?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, it was like a local factory that paid for their jerseys and such."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, like coke does now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but local. They're one of the oldest teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet they're worth a lot, then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they're one of the few professional teams you can still buy stock from."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how come you can't buy stock from other teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if you can't, it's more that you can't just do it from a stoke broker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh. So how do you do it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well there's only a small amount, and it's not really seen as an investment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you can't make money off it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could, but it's more of a family heirloom thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fan cred?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly; it's like how most people don't scalp tickets because they actually want to go to the game. It means something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's actually really cool. So are you looking forward to them this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, no. In fact I just read an article about how they're probably doomed this next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch. Well, at least they've still got that sweet, sweet fan cred!"
