"__DISNEY__ Did you see the live adaptation of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, it was horrid."
"__DISNEY__ The Disney version has always been a childhood favorite of mine, but they totally butchered the new version."
"__DISNEY__ I had always imagined a real-life version of Belle would be someone with sweet, gentle features. I don't know, Emma Watson's pretty, but she's not what I had in mind."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed, plus her acting just made me cringe."
"__DISNEY__ Nothing beats the Disney version."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think of the cinematography?"
"__DISNEY__ Some of the casting members might have been poor choice, but the scenery was absolutely stunning."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the director did a nice job there. It reminded me of the French version of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ If I were to compare the two, I'd go with the French version."
