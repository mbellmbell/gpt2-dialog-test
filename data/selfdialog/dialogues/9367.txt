"__BASEBALL__ Boy the Mets really needed that win last night."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes they did. They got a great performance from DeGrom"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he turned in a quality start just when they needed it."
"__BASEBALL__ I mean to silence those Angels hitters is pretty impressive."
"__BASEBALL__ For sure. To shut them out is a great feat."
"__BASEBALL__ Now they just have to try and build from this victory"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah one win is not a turn around, so they still have a lot of work to do."
