"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ The one with Emma Watson as Belle?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that one!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I thought the singing was great!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too. I can't believe they made that guy look like the beast the entire movie."
"__DISNEY__ I know! It was wonderfully cast with Emma Thompson, Kevin Cline, and all those famous people."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I thought so too! Do you know when it will be on DVD?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, it's already out on DVD!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh good, I wonder if Target has it?"
"__DISNEY__ I heard they were selling out quickly, so you may want to go soon!"
