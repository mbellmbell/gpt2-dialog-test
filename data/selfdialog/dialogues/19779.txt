"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw The Mummy with Tom Cruise."
"__MOVIES__ Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ No. It was boring and mediocre."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Tom Cruise is usually in great movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree to some extent. He used to be in good movies. Maybe he has lost his passion for acting."
"__MOVIES__ Was he not good in The Mummy?"
"__MOVIES__ He was lackluster. His attempt at comedy in the movie was awful. The script didn't help."
"__MOVIES__ Can you explain?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, all the comedy in the movie was the characters screaming back and forth at each other."
"__MOVIES__ I still don't get it. What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ The comedy was basically the actors repeating what was said to them and pointing out that the situation is absurd."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is a supernatural movie and the situation is absurd..."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. The audience already knows the basic situation beforehand. There's no reason to constantly point it out."
"__MOVIES__ What else didn't you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ The clips of Ahmanet in Egypt were shown over and over again. It seemed like filler to me."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Universal making more movies after this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think it's called The Dark Universe or something. They introduced Dr. Jeckyll in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ So, you're not going to see the other movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No way. The Mummy has turned me off. Really can't think of anything positive about it. I love The Mummy franchise with Brenden Fraser."
