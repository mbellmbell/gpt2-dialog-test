"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen Misery?"
"__THRILLER__ Is that a newer movie?"
"__THRILLER__ No, it was probably from the 90s?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, what was it about?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, a writer gets in a wreck in a desolate area.  One of his biggest fans takes him in, but she's crazy."
"__THRILLER__ Doesn't anyone realize he's gone?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, the police come to ask about him, but she kills them."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, she's really crazy!"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it's a pretty good movie."
"__THRILLER__ I might need to look into it."
