"__MUSIC__ What country besides USA has provided the most to world music?"
"__MUSIC__ You kind of have to go with England, right?"
"__MUSIC__ That'd be my first thought."
"__MUSIC__ English Punk, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath... the list goes on."
"__MUSIC__ It's tough to think of another country that even comes close."
"__MUSIC__ What about Canada?"
"__MUSIC__ Alannis Morrisette and Justin Bieber. Not quite stacking up!"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, that's not quite fair to Canada. They have produced some fine musicians."
"__MUSIC__ How about Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen?"
"__MUSIC__ OK, decent musicians, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Neil Young? Celine Dion?"
"__MUSIC__ Celine Dion isn't really my cup of tea, but she's a talented singer. And Neil Young is legit."
"__MUSIC__ How about Rush?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty decent band, sure."
"__MUSIC__ And what about The Guess Who and the Band?"
"__MUSIC__ Hey, I'm not saying Canada hasn't produced good music. Just not like the UK."
"__MUSIC__ That's fair. I just think Canada kind of gets overlooked sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I hadn't thought about all those singers until you mentioned them."
"__MUSIC__ Our neighbors to the north have made some great music."
"__MUSIC__ Here's to Canadian music!"
