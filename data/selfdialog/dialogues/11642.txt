"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ aside from Tom Brady, who do you think the best quarterbacks were in the 2016 season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you definitely need to include Aaron Rodgers on the list"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would agree with that. he had like 40 touchdowns in 2016"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan obviously deserves to be on the list, even though he lost the big game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yes, he put some monster numbers. he averaged something like 309 yard per game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ that is insane. most quarterbacks would kill for those numbers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ who else do you think should make the best of 2016 list"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ this might be controversial, but Dallas Cowboys Dak Prescott had an excellent rookie year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ lets see if he can repeat that performance now that there is some game tape of him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ he had about 23 touchdowns and only 4 interceptions. he does a really good job of protecting the football, and found ways to help the cowboys win games"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ plus he is a rushing threat. he racked up close to 230 yards per game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ another quarterback to watch based on his 2016 performance is Derek Carr"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ he made the Raiders look really good last year. Their offense was pretty high power all things considered"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ he completion rate was pretty solid at 64%, and his 28 TDs were pretty impressive"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Raiders get a few more offensive weapons next year they could be really dangerous"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ back to QBs... another one that makes the 2016 list is Drew Brees"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure. he really spread around the football among his receiving core. it feels like he was always finding different targets in the endzone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ha. so true. he would throw 5 touchdowns in a game, to 5 different receivers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ an honorable mention should probably go to Ben Roethlisberger as well. he put up 29 TDs and about 272 yards per game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go Big Ben!!!"
