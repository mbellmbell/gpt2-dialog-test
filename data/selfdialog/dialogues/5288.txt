"__STAR_WARS__ When did you first see Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw it in 1977."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wasn't even born then! Did you have a crush on either Han Solo or Luke Skywalker?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Neither, really.  But when I got older, I thought Harrison Ford was good looking."
"__STAR_WARS__ I get that. But I think I would have liked Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ I did want to look like Princess Leia, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about her appealed to you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She was beautiful AND strong AND capable."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  So sad that Carrie Fisher passed away, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. And it makes me feel old!"
