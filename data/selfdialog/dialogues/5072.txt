"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen all of the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, I have seen all of them. Sad to see Paul Walker Die"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, it sure was a tragedy"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you have a favorite movie?  Mine was the last one 'Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Not really, I am not a huge fan of the movies.  I watch them, but only once they come to DVD"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What don't you like about them?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, I love the Rock so I'm glad they added him, but the stories are lame as hell."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really, I think they are cool.  I love the action in the movies and the car scenes are great."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I guess if your a car guy you could.  I'm not and the chase scenes are ridiculously fake"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Aww, come on man.  They are just fun to watch."
