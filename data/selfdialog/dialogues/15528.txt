"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would probably go with the last one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're talking Deathly Hallows Part 2, right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah.  Part 1 was super boring."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It wasn't that bad, it was trying to build up the action."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but how many times can you camp in the wilderness?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The whole point was to show that no place is safe."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But did we really need two hours of that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Again, it was a slow burn.  I realize it's not for everyone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't think it's for anyone.  Part 2 forever!"
