"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah. I've seen most of them. I think they are getting repetitive though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really? I kind of like them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It just seems that the whole premise has been lost."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you mean? There are cars, drugs, racing, seems all legit."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, after Tokyo Drift, it seems like they were just rehashing the same story over and over."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The newer ones are really different though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know, and I don't like it. They moved away from racing and more to trafficking."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I guess. They aren't so much just racers now. They are into more criminal acts."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Exactly. I don't really like it."
