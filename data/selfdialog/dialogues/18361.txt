"__MOVIES__ Do you like Disney movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I love them. I grew up watching them so they are a huge part of my childhood."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ That's like asking someone if they have a favorite child!  I guess if I had to pick, maybe the Lion King."
"__MOVIES__ That is such a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ It really is. And the music was great."
"__MOVIES__ Aren't they creating a live action version of it."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I hear. That seems to be the new thing lately."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, the Snow White Movies, and most recently Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ I know and for as much as I love Disney, can you believe I've only see Alice."
"__MOVIES__ Really? You didn't see any of the others?"
"__MOVIES__ No. I want to, but unfortunately my husband isn't into Disney."
"__MOVIES__ Well they are worth watching for sure. He may even like them."
"__MOVIES__ That's doubtful, but I can try."
"__MOVIES__ I'd recommend it. The effects are so good and it is nice to hear the music again."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure. What is your favorite Disney movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say the Little Mermaid. I always loved that one."
"__MOVIES__ That was a good one. There is a mermaid live action movie coming out too, but I don't think it is Disney."
"__MOVIES__ How is that possible?"
"__MOVIES__ Because the Little Mermaid is a fairy tale in the public domain, not just a Disney movie."
