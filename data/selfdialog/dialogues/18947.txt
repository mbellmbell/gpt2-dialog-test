"__MOVIES__ Did you ever get a chance to see Florence Foster Jenkins?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I think it's on Amazon now. Should I watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I liked it. It's both funny and sad."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the previews. How terrible is Florence's singing?"
"__MOVIES__ Incredibly terrible. It's impressive that Meryl Streep can sing that badly on purpose."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. And this is based on a true story?"
"__MOVIES__ It is. Apparently the real Lady Florence was equally terrible at singing."
"__MOVIES__ So it's a comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of. The singing is funny, but the story is more serious."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Her husband is trying to protect her from finding out she's a terrible singer."
"__MOVIES__ Aww, that's kind of sweet."
"__MOVIES__ He loves her even though she's ill and they can't be together as husband and wife."
"__MOVIES__ So he's trying to make her think she's actually great?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. He gets all their friends to help."
"__MOVIES__ So what happens after that?"
"__MOVIES__ Eventually she wants to give a public concert, and that's a big problem."
"__MOVIES__ I see that, if she can't sing!"
"__MOVIES__ But it's really a sweet movie about what people do for love."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out!"
