"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite Star Wars spacecraft?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely the X-Wing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I prefer the Imperial Star Destroyers from the original movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ The X-Wing is like a fighter jet in space, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Imperial Star Destroyers are like battleships. That's really cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ They're more like aircraft carriers. They carry TIE Fighters."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. But X-Wings kill TIE fighters so effortlessly one wonders why they bothered."
"__STAR_WARS__ Imperial Star Destroyers are at least effective in the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Their triangular shape looks cool, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ X-Wings look sleek and pointed, like a fighter."
