"__MUSIC__ I found a really fun Heavy Metal group."
"__MUSIC__ Fun? How can heavy metal be 'fun'? It's supposed to be grim and violent."
"__MUSIC__ The group's based in Switzerland. They're called Black Eagle."
"__MUSIC__ Black Eagle? Oh, brother."
"__MUSIC__ Unlike most heavy metal, you can understand every word they sing."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that is strange."
"__MUSIC__ Their language is mostly clean, so I think they'd be great for video game soundtracks or action movies."
"__MUSIC__ Like what kind of songs do they do?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they do a few cover songs, including 'House of the Rising Sun', and a bunch of Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, even Deep Purple songs."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have anything original?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. They've got a few songs they've written themselves."
"__MUSIC__ They're on Soundcloud or somewhere?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if they're on Soundcloud, but I found them on Reverbnation. Really fun, punchy guitar work and vocals."
"__MUSIC__ I've got to look this up."
"__MUSIC__ They have a great song called 'Pieces Of Pain'."
"__MUSIC__ 'Pieces Of Pain?' Sounds like lots of fun, if you like getting an earache."
"__MUSIC__ No, it would be really great in a video game."
"__MUSIC__ Like a soundtrack to blowing people up?"
"__MUSIC__ There's really no violence in their songs, strangely, and you can understand every word they sing."
"__MUSIC__ That does sound like a pretty odd group for heavy metal."
