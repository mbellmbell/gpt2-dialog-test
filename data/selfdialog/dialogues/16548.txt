"__MOVIES__ So did you see the new Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't even know there was one!"
"__MOVIES__ I have to say that it was pretty horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Why was it so bad?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the acting was OK but the story was just sad without really being compelling..."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, that doesn't sound like it's worth watching..."
"__MOVIES__ It's a terrible feeling to have wasted close to two hours!"
"__MOVIES__ I know the feeling!  Was there anything redeeming about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Like I said, the acting was better than I thought it would be."
"__MOVIES__ I can't picture Arnold being good in such a movie..."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, his range is limited."
"__MOVIES__ At least an older action star is trying to branch out."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure he has a choice!  I mean, he can't really do solely action movies anymore."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Stallone was alright."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it felt a bit like a B movie to me."
"__MOVIES__ I understand.  What was the name of the new one anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called Aftermath."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'm hearing the aftermath of Aftermath, then!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, do yourself a favor and skip it."
"__MOVIES__ I think I will!  Thanks for the tip!"
