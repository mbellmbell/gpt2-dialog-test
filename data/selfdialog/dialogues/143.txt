"__MUSIC__ You know what a really good band I haven't heard anything from in a while?"
"__MUSIC__ Who?"
"__MUSIC__ The band Fun!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Some nights and We are young are two great songs."
"__MUSIC__ Without a doubt.  I wish they'd get something new."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I still listen to those songs.  I bet they're great in concert."
"__MUSIC__ I'd have to look into that.  I've never known anyone to go to one."
"__MUSIC__ They're so energetic though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know what you mean.  Like at the end of Some Nights."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, how could they not be great?"
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget Carry On."
"__MUSIC__ Oh great song.  I like the way their music is structured."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds so great.  It always has good building to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a lot of music has two speeds.  Loud, or really loud."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me about it.  Fun has good dynamics though."
"__MUSIC__ They were at Boston Calling a few years ago."
"__MUSIC__ And I missed it?  Awe man, that's always a good concert."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I went when they had the Pixies."
"__MUSIC__ You're a lucky guy."
