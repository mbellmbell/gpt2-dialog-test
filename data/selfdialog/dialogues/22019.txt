"__DISNEY__ What cartoon should I take my nephew to?"
"__DISNEY__ Cars 3!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, is that out?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it just came out last weekend. It's really fun!"
"__DISNEY__ I think he was too young for the first one, so I don't know if he knows about it."
"__DISNEY__ He doesn't have to have seen the first one. He will love it!"
"__DISNEY__ He does like race cars a lot."
"__DISNEY__ The music is fun and the voices are good, too."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, this sounds like a hit!"
"__DISNEY__ Let me know how he likes it!"
