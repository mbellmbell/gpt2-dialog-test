"__DISNEY__ Who was your favorite Disney character as a kid?"
"__DISNEY__ I never really liked the human characters as a kid, so I think it must have been Simba."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Mine was Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ That is a real rags to riches story."
"__DISNEY__ What about any that aren't the protagonist."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm. Cruella DeVille was a really good villain."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. But so was Jafar."
"__DISNEY__ It sounds like you just really like Aladdin!"
"__DISNEY__ I guess I do!"
"__DISNEY__ We can watch it later, if you want."
