"__THRILLER__ I saw Woman in Black yesterday."
"__THRILLER__ Wasn't that the creepy movie that came out a few years ago?"
"__THRILLER__ Right.  Had Daniel Radcliffe in it."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah.  His wife died and he went to some old estate I think."
"__THRILLER__ My wife jumped so many times in that movie."
"__THRILLER__ You kept seeing the woman in the background in the shadows."
"__THRILLER__ Right, it was very unsettling."
"__THRILLER__ The ending is a bummer to as he died."
"__THRILLER__ His kid too, both hit by a train.  He was reunited with his family which is kind of an odd happy ending."
"__THRILLER__ I believe they made a sequel too, but haven't seen it."
