"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you watched all of the Harry Potter movies yet?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I have. I don't know how I feel about the Ginny-Harry love thing."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really??  I love Ginny!  She's a kick-ass girl."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but I mean, how many people marry their high school sweethearts?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hello!  It's a movie!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I know, but isn't it a little creepy to marry someone who was so crazy about you that she was lured to the chamber of secrets?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You do have a point there . . ."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And her brother was a pseduo-brother for Ron."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I get your point.  Like they were kind of like family."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah.  I mean, he didn't have to end up with anyone from Hogwarts."
