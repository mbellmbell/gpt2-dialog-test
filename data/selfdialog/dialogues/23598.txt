"__DISNEY__ I just re-watched The Lion King last night."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, was it the original or one of the sequels?"
"__DISNEY__ The original. It just brings me back to my childhood."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I have fond memories of that movie too."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know they have a musical on Broadway for the Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but that sounds fantastic! Would you want to go see it?"
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely. It would be a big trip to get to New York City, but it would be a highlight."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder how they represent all the characters like Simba since the characters are all animals."
"__DISNEY__ Good question. They must do a great job. I hear it has been on Broadway for a while."
"__DISNEY__ Well, let's plan to go!"
