"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, what did you think of the Phantom Menace?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was okay, but it's could've been better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it could've been. Did you know that's why Geroge Lucas started Star War's at Episode IV rather than I."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, is that true?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, George was afraid that Episode I wouldn't grab the audience strong enough to succeed, so he moved forawrd to Episode 4"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that seems to have been a smart move on his part."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but I think part of Phantom Menace's problem was casting Anakin as a little kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, you think so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Absolutley, when Obi-wan talks to Luke about his father, he was soupposed to have been 'the best pilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior'."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I see. How could a nine year old slave kid be that?"
