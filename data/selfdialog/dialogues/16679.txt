"__MOVIES__ Did you happen to catch 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?'"
"__MOVIES__ I did, but I'm not sure if I liked it. It was just so different from the other 'Harry Potter' films."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you have to expect that. It's a different time, setting, characters, story, everything."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but it didn't feel the same for me, like they were part of the same world."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it did. I thought the acting was so great and the story was very charming."
"__MOVIES__ I hear they're going to make more."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, supposedly five more are on the way."
"__MOVIES__ Five?! I hope they don't get all weird like 'Transformers' or 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think they will. There is good source material."
"__MOVIES__ Have they named any new cast members?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, obviously Eddie Redmayne and Johnny Depp are in it, but they've also cast Jude Law as Dumbledore."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, I can't even imagine. That's a big change from what we're used to."
"__MOVIES__ Well, he's a lot younger in this."
"__MOVIES__ So are they going to tell how he got the Elder Wand?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. I'm pretty sure that'll be part of it since Johnny Depp is coming back as Grindelwald, and that's who he got it from."
"__MOVIES__ Are they going to bring in any of the original cast?"
"__MOVIES__ I doubt it. None of them were really alive back then."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad. I think it would be good to have that connection."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree. I like that it's the same world but all new people, or somewhat new."
"__MOVIES__ To each his own then."
