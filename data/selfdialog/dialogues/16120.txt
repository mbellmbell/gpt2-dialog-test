"__ROCK__ I just discovered a new band that doesn't use any guitar, but they still rock! They're called Royal Blood."
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah! They're just a bass player and a drummer right?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, but they still know how to rock. The bassist put a guitar pickup in his bass to flesh the sound out a bit more. I just saw them at a big festival."
"__ROCK__ Oh that sounds cool! Who else did you see?"
"__ROCK__ I feel lucky, because Soundgarden played, and it was one of Chris Cornell's last performances before his passing."
"__ROCK__ I'm still really upset about that. I can't believe that happened! Did he sound good when you saw them?"
"__ROCK__ He sounded amazing. Very energetic, and he talked to the crowd a lot. I was just so stunned by this."
"__ROCK__ Me too. I saw them many years ago, and they put on a killer show. Definitely one of the best grunge bands."
"__ROCK__ I agree. I love Soundgarden and Pearl Jam the most, so of course I absolutely adore Temple of the Dog."
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah! I heard they reunited last year and went on tour! I bet that was something else."
