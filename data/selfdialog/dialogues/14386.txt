"__HORROR__ So, I caught The Void the other night and I'm still trying to figure out what was going on with it?"
"__HORROR__ Is that the new horror film with Ellen Wong, Kathleen Munroe, and Aaron Poole?"
"__HORROR__ That's the one, it started out really creepy. Really mysterious and unsettling, then it gets really weird!"
"__HORROR__ What do you mean? Was it a ghost story or more of an invasion horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ It was more Love Craft if you're familiar with that genre. It's kind of similar to Clive Barker's Hellraiser."
"__HORROR__ Oh I loved that series! Tell me a little more about The Void."
"__HORROR__ It's a simple premise really, a group is trapped in a hospital in a small town. Outside there is a group of hooded members circling the hospital. They try to figure out how to escape but inside the hospital something even more sinister is happening."
"__HORROR__ That sounds pretty scary. Were there a lot of jump scares, because I can't do jump scares a minute type of horror films anymore."
"__HORROR__ There really wasn't a lot of jump scares but there was a lot of unsettling imagery. The practical makeup effects in this film are top notch, a real throwback to the 80's."
"__HORROR__ I'll have to give this movie a watch. I'm really intrigued by the practical special effects and makeup work. It's been awhile since we've had that, mostly it's been heavy CGI."
