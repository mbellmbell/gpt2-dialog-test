"__MOVIES__ Superhero movies have been so popular in recent years."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. At least that movie Logan was kind of a different twist."
"__MOVIES__ Which superhero was that based on."
"__MOVIES__ Logan was based on Wolverine. He's one of the X-men, and they've done plenty of X-men movies."
"__MOVIES__ So what was different about Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ Hugh Jackman, the character who plays Logan, plays a slightly older character. Patrick Stewart's character becomes quite fragile, as you probably saw in the film's advertisements."
"__MOVIES__ I noticed that. Isn't there also some sort of little girl in the movie, too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I don't want to ruin it for you; she has powers that are kind of similar to Logan's."
"__MOVIES__ I don't mind if you tell me what happens. What happens to Patrick Stewart's character?"
"__MOVIES__ His character actually does die."
"__MOVIES__ I figured. Patrick Stewart played in some sort of cartoon movie recently as well, didn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ He does voice acting for a movie coming out called The Emoji Movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is that a cartoon movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Technically, it's computer animated."
"__MOVIES__ Who does Patrick Steward do the voice of?"
"__MOVIES__ He's the poop character, if you can believe it."
"__MOVIES__ That's so funny. What would he do that character?"
"__MOVIES__ Perhaps it was the only type of character he could find that was a difficult stretch for him."
"__MOVIES__ When does that movie come out?"
"__MOVIES__ It's scheduled for the summer of 2017."
