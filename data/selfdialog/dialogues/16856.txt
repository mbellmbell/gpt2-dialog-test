"__MOVIES__ Did you ever end up watching The Martian?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did finally."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was OK, it felt a lot like Gravity to me."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was much better than Gravity."
"__MOVIES__ In what ways?"
"__MOVIES__ Gravity may have looked better but this seemed more plausible."
"__MOVIES__ Both seemed to be pretty over the top in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ What in the movie did you think was impossible?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the gravity on Mars is way lower than Earth, but he was walking around normally."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, that is understandable, it is a movie after all."
"__MOVIES__ Also that wind storm in the beginning would be impossible."
"__MOVIES__ The author of the book actually talked about that being one of the few impossible things in the story."
"__MOVIES__ Also how he walked all over the potatoes he was planting."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, none of those potatoes would have grown."
"__MOVIES__ Is it even possible to use human feces as fertilizer?"
"__MOVIES__ I am actually not too sure on that point."
"__MOVIES__ I think I remember reading you cannot."
"__MOVIES__ I still had a fun time with the movie and enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was fine but over hyped."
