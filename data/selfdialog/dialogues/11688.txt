"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think the chances of the Buffalo Bills are?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like what they are doing long term, but this is a rebuiliding year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I like their talent and depth, I think they are a darkhorse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least rex is gone, but i think they are one year away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mcdermott is for real, the team had playoff talent with terrible coaching, with a good coach, I think that will be enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If not at least we have that extra first rounder and can get a franchise QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dont think we need that, Taylor is good, and we have two good young QB's behind them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is another issue, if taylor gets hurt or doesnt work out, Jones or Peterman are not experienced enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ McCoy is always good, the the reciever group is better form top to bottom if Watkins stays healthy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree Zay Jones was a steal in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only real hole on offense is right tackle and Dawkins may fill that void."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Defense is a bigger concern."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They arent the same since 2014 but I still like the talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Front 7 is good if Dareus donest get in trouble again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ill admit, the defenisve backs worry me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah me too, especially safety, after hyde, it is very thin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully everyone stays healthy, going to training camp?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wont be able to make it, but I think I can get to a couple regaular season games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, I always try to catch one, maybe we can go to one together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that would be a good idea."
