"__BASKETBALL__ I'm excited about the Los Angeles Lakers' future."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too. I love the direction that the organization is going."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean bringing in Magic Johnson will definitely help this team"
"__BASKETBALL__ I concur. He is just what this organization needs going forward."
"__BASKETBALL__ They have some tough decisions to make on this roster though"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they do, I mean Metta World Peace is gone"
"__BASKETBALL__ They will probably get rid of Tarik Black and put D'Angelo Russell on the trading block"
"__BASKETBALL__ You think they will trade Russell? Why?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they are going to draft Lonzo Ball and he will be their point guard of the future"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I can see that, but it seems too early to give up on Russell"
"__BASKETBALL__ Unless they decide that he can be their full-time shooting guard"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know if I see that out of him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah me too, but he has to either play the one or two"
"__BASKETBALL__ Right, but he doesn't seem entirely comfortable in either position."
"__BASKETBALL__ So maybe they start the beginning of year with Ball at the point and Russell at the 2"
"__BASKETBALL__ See if they can play together well before they make any decisions."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly. Both players are pretty good size, so you could play both at the same time."
"__BASKETBALL__ They are both pretty weak defensively but they have time to get better"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it's an experiment worth trying."
"__BASKETBALL__ I do too. It's going to be an exciting year for the Lakers"
