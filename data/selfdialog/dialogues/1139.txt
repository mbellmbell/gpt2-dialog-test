"__MUSIC__ So, I started listening to k-pop recently."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? How did you hear about k-pop?"
"__MUSIC__ A friend I  spoke with a couple weeks ago introduced me to k-pop."
"__MUSIC__ Oh you never heard of the genre before then?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I never have."
"__MUSIC__ That's to bad. I'm glad your getting into it now. I listen to a few k-pop bands."
"__MUSIC__ Which ones are those?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite is 2NE1 but i also have some music from SHINee and Exo."
"__MUSIC__ I've listened to 2NE2,  I think they are great. They are an all girl band."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, they have been around for awhile too. I think since 2009 or so."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you're right. It has been awhile for them. And they are still rocking in 2017."
"__MUSIC__ Which song do you like from them?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I would have to say Lollipop. I think it just has that beat that I love."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, like that song as well. what do you think of the vocals? Who do you think is better?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they are all great and their intonations are on par with the others' But out of them all in the 'look' factor, i think Sandra Park is the cutest."
"__MUSIC__ They are all pretty hot, but I have to agree. Sandra is hella sexy."
"__MUSIC__ I wish they would come to the States, I would definitely go to their concert no matter where it was."
"__MUSIC__ You would have to count me in to that. Cause so would I."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to check out more k-pop bands, I will let you know if i find anything else worth listening to."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that sounds good. Thanks."
