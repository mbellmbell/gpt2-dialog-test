"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked it, but it was a little of a let down."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?  I loved it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was very similar in plot to A new Hope... The first one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I understand where your coming from, but that didn't detract from my overall enjoyment."
"__STAR_WARS__ I did make me anxious and excited to see the next one...."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too; I think Rey is going to get some serious training from Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope so.  That new soccer ball robot is so cute as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Gotta' love the advent of quality CGI that makes it possible; total eye candy."
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure... Rey is cute too!"
