"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the game between the Yankees and Red Sox?"
"__BASEBALL__ I did! It was intense!"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure was! How about that double play in the 2nd inning!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh man, I couldn't believe they almost let him score!"
"__BASEBALL__ I guess that's what happens when you forget there is a runner on 3rd!"
"__BASEBALL__ I guess, but how can you not remember there is a runner in scoring position."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, right! They almost had the game tied."
"__BASEBALL__ Good thing they got him out, the yankees don't do well when they get behind."
"__BASEBALL__ No they don't. Remember the last time they got behind in the 4th inning, spent the last 5 innings playing erratically."
"__BASEBALL__ So true, it's like they can't figure out where to throw the ball! The center fielder tries to make a play at home and doesn't use their cut-off man."
"__BASEBALL__ I know! It's like all fundamentals go out the window!"
"__BASEBALL__ It's a good thing they beat the Red Sox this time, it will put them in the playoffs!"
"__BASEBALL__ Playoffs are already coming around? Wow, that's crazy!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know, I wish the season could last longer."
"__BASEBALL__ The guys need some rest though, they are getting up there in age."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that makes me think of Derek Jeter, man I miss him!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh I know, he was the best 2nd baseman of all time!"
"__BASEBALL__ That, and he was in general just a good guy."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm glad he mentored new players to be role models for today's youth."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too, my son has always looked up to him, and tries to act just like him. That is one pro athlete I am okay with him acting like."
