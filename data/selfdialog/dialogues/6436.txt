"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen Episode VII yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did. I thought it was pretty good."
"__STAR_WARS__ My only complaint is how derivative it is of Episode IV."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was at that. But all I asked was that it be better than the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, my expectations were set very low as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the new generation of the cast, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ How did you feel about Han Solo's death?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I understood why it happened, but there will be a real hole in the sequels without Harrison's charisma."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't like that we only saw Luke Skywalker for a few seconds, but I suppose you don't want to cram too much into the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, overall I'd say the movie was the first solid Star Wars movie since Episode VI."
