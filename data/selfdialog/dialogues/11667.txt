"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking today about first round busts in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are plenty of them to consume your thinking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. For sure. Wonder how many first round busts there will be this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be interesting to see. I'm guessing that Trabisky player may be a bust."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that. So many quarterbacks have been busts in the past."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Akili Smith, Tim Couch, Johnnie Manziel, and the bust of all busts Ryan Leaf."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ryan Leaf. Wow. What a shame the way his career turned out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He brought a lot of it on himself with his attitude and locker room conduct."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, but I still feel bad for the guy a little bit. Remember the choice between Leaf and Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their careers couldn't have been more polar opposite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Imagine if the Colts picked Leaf instead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it wasn't as hard of a choice as the media made it out to be. A household name, Manning, versus a guy who nobody heard of till his final year of college football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I think a lot of people believed they were equally talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the talent was there with Leaf, he just never adapted to the NFL game pace."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunate. There were other big quarterback busts in the 1990s that get overshadowed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Akili Smith. Ha ha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Akili Smith is definitely one of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was another quarterback nobody heard of until his final year of college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bengals really had a lot of busts in the nineties. No wonder they haven't won a playoff game since 1991."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's part of the reason."
