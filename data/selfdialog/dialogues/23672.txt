"__DISNEY__ Which are cuter, the puppies from 1001 Dalmatians or the kittens from the Aristocats?"
"__DISNEY__ I like dogs better than cats, so I'm biased."
"__DISNEY__ I get it, but the kitten that plays piano is so cute."
"__DISNEY__ Aw yeah, that's a great scene."
"__DISNEY__ Overall I think the Aristocats is the better movie."
"__DISNEY__ Cruella de Vil is such a great villain though!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I hated her."
"__DISNEY__ That's sort of the point."
"__DISNEY__ No, I just thought she was mean, and not in a fun way."
"__DISNEY__ True. Killing puppies is way too cruel."
