"__BASKETBALL__ Man, How about the playoffs this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know right.  But it feels repetitive anymore."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree.  It is always Golden State and Cleveland"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, though this year they haven't made it yet."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but they will.  No one can stand up to either team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Basketball has about become unwatchable because players just join teams to play with the best, not against them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Everyone wants their championship. Ya know?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I understand.  It just makes it boring to watch sometimes."
"__BASKETBALL__ So who do you have winning it all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Cleveland was a fluke in the Championship last year.  So I have Golden State"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah me too.  Plus I just can't stand LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ I actually like him.  I wouldn't say he is the goat, but he is dang good."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't doubt his talents.  It is his flopping and constant complaining."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he is very bad about that.  He would make a great Soccer player!"
"__BASKETBALL__ No doubt!  All that flopping around."
"__BASKETBALL__ How many games do you think the finals will go?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am going 6 games. Golden State 4-2"
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree on Golden State winning it.  But I have it 4-3 in 7 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ It very well could end like that again."
"__BASKETBALL__ It would at least make it somewhat interesting!"
