"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So are you excited for this year's fantasy football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah man. I can't get enough fantasy football!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you take number 1 overall this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Standard or PPR scoring?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Standard. I'm old school."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, I'm not giving away any secrets man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if he's your number one overall, there really isn't a way I can steal him from you! Plus there's only like 4 people it can actually be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmmm. Okay I'll tell you. I really like Le'Veon Bell. He's been a beast and won me the championship last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he's great. So explosive and a true bellcow. Bellcows dont even exist anymore which makes him so much more valuable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus he's in a great offense... and the Steelers' lackluster defense kinda helps them by getting into high scoring games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah you can't go wrong with Bell, but I'm going to go with David Johnson if I get the chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ David Johnson. Oh whoa whoa whoa. Yeah he's great and doesn't have the injury history that Bell has I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and nothing against Bell, but Johnson also just seems like an awesome dude. Like I could hang out with him and fit in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, well he might have some humble beginnings coming from Northern Iowa."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm yeah youre right. So it sounds like we are both feeling RBs early this year and not WRs or QBs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well its not smart to take QBs early ever. There's so much value to be found in the later rounds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But WRs? I think last year the first 3 or 4 picks were often WRs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but I think last year peole almost undervalued RBs too much and now we're returning to the mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps, but I don't think we're back in the 2001-2008 days where RBs were king!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha no way. We're a long ways from the days of Priest Holmes, Jamaal Lewis, Clinton Portis, and Ahman Green!"
