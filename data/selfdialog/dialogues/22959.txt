"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ It's one that most people haven't seen.  My favorite is The Brave Little Toaster."
"__DISNEY__ You're right, I haven't seen that.  What is it about?"
"__DISNEY__ It came out a while ago, back in the 80s I think.  Basically these appliances are trying to find their owner."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds a little weird.  I'll have to check it out though.  You know another Disney movie I don't hear talked about? The Great Mouse Detective."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah I've seen that one.  I remember liking it as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite has always been The Fox and the Hound."
"__DISNEY__ That one used to always make me cry when I was little."
"__DISNEY__ Me too but the little fox and hound are so cute!"
"__DISNEY__ It was always really sad when the lady had to take the fox and leave him in the woods."
