"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the pirates baseball game against the yankees last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes I did. that game was amazing!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know. The way it ended with a grand slam was unexpected."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. that was one the longest home runs I have ever seen."
"__BASEBALL__ yeah, it was crushed! the sound it made off the bat you knew instantly it was a home run."
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds like you were at the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ I was at the game. Sat right behind home plate. It was awesome"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm jealous. I have always wanted to go to a game, but just watch on TV"
"__BASEBALL__ I would recommend it. The pitching was great for seven innings."
"__BASEBALL__ seemed like a pitchers dual for most of the game until the 7th when the bats woke up"
"__BASEBALL__ the last three innings took forever to play."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. so many pitching changes and no one could get an out."
"__BASEBALL__ The worst part is that they stop serving beer after the 7th inning. It's a law I guess."
"__BASEBALL__ I didn't know that! I had more beer from the 7th inning on then I did in the first part of the game"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that's the benefit of watching at home. If was still cool to be there and see the walk off grand slam"
"__BASEBALL__ It looked like a fun time."
"__BASEBALL__ You should come with me next time. i have season tickets"
"__BASEBALL__ I would love to. let me know when the next one is."
"__BASEBALL__ Great. I hope the Pirates make the playoffs this year"
"__BASEBALL__ Me too. that would be neat to watch! Go Pirates!"
