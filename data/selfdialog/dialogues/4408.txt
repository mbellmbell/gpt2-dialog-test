"__MUSIC__ I can't stand screamo-"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, totally agreed."
"__MUSIC__ Just the worst, alarming sounds coming out of the vocalist's mouths."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. But I'll admit I dug it in college."
"__MUSIC__ Really?! How?!"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Like we're thinking 30 Seconds To Mars-type stuff here, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, something like that. I was thinking Thursday."
"__MUSIC__ Okay so yeah. I don't know I just went through a phase of loving emo-"
"__MUSIC__ Emo and screamo are different, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but I'd forfeit the screaming chorus in favor of the other lyrics of the song."
"__MUSIC__ That's a huge sacrifice. Choruses are sort of important."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It's whatever. I loved Taking Back Sunday and Bright Eyes."
"__MUSIC__ Dude... I can't imagine you listening to them."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right? I did anyway, though."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have memories attached to them?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh, being sad and alone in my dorm room?"
"__MUSIC__ That's sad."
"__MUSIC__ I had my emo music, though, hahaha."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I kinda thank god I never hit that phase."
"__MUSIC__ Eh, it wasn't that bad. It was fun learning new genres, at the very least."
