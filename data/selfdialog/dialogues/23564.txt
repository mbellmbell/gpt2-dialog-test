"__DISNEY__ My mom loaned me the DVD of the original Snow White and The Seven Dwarves."
"__DISNEY__ Oh ya, we should watch it later."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and see how it looks compared to the ones they make today."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder how long it would take to make a movie like that back then?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, it must have taken a long to time to draw each frame of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes I heard that they kept bare frames of sequences to be used in other movies."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Then they could paint over them for a different movie."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that is why a lot of the early Disney movies had the same dancing parts in them."
