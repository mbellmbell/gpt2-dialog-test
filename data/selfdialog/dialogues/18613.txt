"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I've got 3, you wanna hear them?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, what are they?"

"__MOVIES__ Ahh, so you must be a big adventure buff."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Titanic, sorry I know it's probably not one of your faves."
"__MOVIES__ No, but it was ok. I found myself wanting to be the 'Jack' character after awhile."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, up until he took the plunge into the Atlantic ice bath."
"__MOVIES__ You know that movie was not only 'Romantic' like boy girl romantic. It was 'period' romantic."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It romanticized the time period. Got it."
"__MOVIES__ It was good. Who could forget the balcony shot with everybody in suits."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, I agree and that's why it's up there for me."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear they are making a part 2?"
"__MOVIES__ What, you're kidding and how would that be possible."
"__MOVIES__ I don't believe it is. We'll see."
"__MOVIES__ And how about those 3 favorites of yours? Which one would you choose?"
"__MOVIES__ Can't do it. It's a package."
"__MOVIES__ Indiana Jones?"
