"__MOVIES__ What are your top five favorite movies of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's see. There's going to be a couple John Wayne movies in there."
"__MOVIES__ Oh geez! YOu're not one of those, are you?"
"__MOVIES__ One of what?"
"__MOVIES__ One of those people who think all old movies are great and all the new ones suck."
"__MOVIES__ You got sonny. These new movies, all they have is sex, drugs and cussing."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. Stop screwing around. Seriously, what are your favorite movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if you'd asked a year ago, John Wayne's 'McClintock' would have been up there."
"__MOVIES__ Never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a comedy western."
"__MOVIES__ Like 'Blazing Saddles'?"
"__MOVIES__ No, nothing like 'Blazing Saddles.' It can be a comedy western without being like 'Blazing Saddles.'"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so what other movies do you love?"
"__MOVIES__ 'The Fifth Element' with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I watch that movie all the time. Never thought of it as a favorite though."
"__MOVIES__ That's how I determine my favorites. The ones I watch all the time."
"__MOVIES__ So, what else? Anything new and modern?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved 'Star Trek Into Darkness.' Walked out of the theater and told my wife 'Best movie Ever!' You can ask her."
"__MOVIES__ I might. What else?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Starship troopers!'"
