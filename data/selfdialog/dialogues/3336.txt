"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite heavy metal band?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a few but Metallica, Pantera, and Tool are my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ I've always been a huge Pantera fan."
"__MUSIC__ Same, but the band was never the same after Dimebag Darrel was killed."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man I know. Dimebag Darrel is without a doubt the greatest guitarist of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Dimebag could shred better then anyone in the world. Phil Anselmo is also one of my all time favorite vocalist."
"__MUSIC__ I love Phil. The entire band had some serious personal problems. I think drugs played a huge role in the band's demise."
"__MUSIC__ Couldn't agree more. Those guys loved to party. I still drink Blacktooth Grins in Dimebags honor on occasion."
"__MUSIC__ What's a blacktooh grin?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a drink that Dimebag Darrel created, still somewhat very iconic in the heavy metal world."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of it before, do you know how to make one?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! It's a double shot of Seagram 7 and a double shot of Crown Royal on ice, splashed with just enough Coca-Cola to give it a darkened look."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to make one rite now and jam to some Pantera."
"__MUSIC__ Do it brother! What's your favorite Pantera album?"
"__MUSIC__ Cowboys from Hell! That entire album is insane."
"__MUSIC__ Cowboys from Hell is also one of my favorites but their album Vulgar Display of Power is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Don't get me wrong, I love Vulgar Display of Power but the album is a little too heavy for my liking."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean, it's not the easiest album to listen to. You have to be into that heavy bass sound to really enjoy the album to the fullest."
"__MUSIC__ RIP Dimebag Darrel, I think Pantera is greatest heavy metal bands of all time."
"__MUSIC__ I'm torn between Pantera and Metallica, I can't pick one or the other. I love them both equally."
