"__MUSIC__ Did you ever listen to the music group Live?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah!  I actually saw them live in concert a long time ago."
"__MUSIC__ That's crazy, so did I!  They had great music, didn't they?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I remember Lightning Crashes and I Alone being amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I think that was from the Throwing Copper album.  That one came out in 1994."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was around the time I saw them in concert.  They were great live."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, did you know they actually formed in 1980 though?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, so they had already been around awhile when Throwing Copper came out?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was just their first really successful album."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a long time to go unnoticed!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think they changed their name to Live around 1991 and then they went on MTV and became mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy, I had no idea.  What happened to them after Throwing Copper?"
"__MUSIC__ They had several other albums.  I think the Secret Samadhi and The Distance to Here were the names of several."
"__MUSIC__ I never heard of either of those."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they weren't as well known.  Then I believe they toured with the Counting Crows."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, they were a great band back then, too!"
"__MUSIC__ I know.  Remember their song Mr. Jones?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's the one everyone knows."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it had a good video too."
"__MUSIC__ I liked the Counting Crows!"
