"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Spurs Rockets game tonight?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I sure did and the Spurs spanked them."
"__BASKETBALL__ It was awful, I bet on Houston."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why would you do that? The Spurs have so much history of success."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wasn't, but right before game time their best player Kahwai Leonard was not going to play."
"__BASKETBALL__ Still risky bet don't you think for a game 6."
"__BASKETBALL__ Frankly, no. The home team has won ever game of the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, then what happened? Why did Houston lose?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Because I think Houston felt the game would be a breeze to win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Because they had won all their home playoff games?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, because with the Spurs two best players out, they just mailed it in."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, who is to blame?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The whole team and coaching staff. They got sucker punched into thinking San Antonio would not try and wait til game 7 when they would be at full strength"
"__BASKETBALL__ That makes some sense, but still the wrong way for a professional to behave."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'll say it was despicable frankly. You should have seen the crowd."
"__BASKETBALL__ What did the fans do?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They Boo'd the Rockets like crazy for a lack of effort."
"__BASKETBALL__ Were the boos directed at anyone in particular?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep. James Harden, A potential MVP and he gave no effort. Played awful."
"__BASKETBALL__ I always felt Harden was not a championship caliber player."
