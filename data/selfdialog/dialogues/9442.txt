"__BASEBALL__ What time are our tickets for the Dodger game?"
"__BASEBALL__ 1pm at Chaves Ravine!"
"__BASEBALL__ Awesome!  Who do you think was the best Dodger manager of all time?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh! No question, Lasorda."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree.  Shall we take our seats in the stadium?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure.  Wow!  I always forget how big the field looks from the cheap seats."
"__BASEBALL__ (After the game has stated) Wow!  A 91mph pitch?  That's crazy!  He's going to pitch a no hitter."
"__BASEBALL__ Na!  His arm gives out near the sixth inning. Here comes Gwynn.  He always gets a piece of the ball."
"__BASEBALL__ STRIKE!  You were saying?"
"__BASEBALL__ Just wait.  He'll get a piece of it and it'll get him on base if not get the Dodgers a run."
"__BASEBALL__ (Ball is hit)  Oh, that's going over the fence!"
"__BASEBALL__ YES!!  That's 2 RBIs and a Home Run!"
"__BASEBALL__ How far do you think he hit the ball?"
"__BASEBALL__ It looks like it went over the right field fence, about ten feet in from the foul pole."
"__BASEBALL__ That was a thing of beauty.  Who's on deck?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sosa.  If they keep playing like this, the Phillies might as well go home."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he can leg out a triple?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know.  He's a hitter, not a runner."
"__BASEBALL__ OH! I gotta' give it o Philadelpia - that was a great catch by the center fielder."
"__BASEBALL__ Man! I bet his hand stings after catching that one."
