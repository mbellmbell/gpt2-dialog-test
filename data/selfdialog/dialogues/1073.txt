"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite music these days?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't narrow it down to one top artist."
"__MUSIC__ Just give me a few current faves."
"__MUSIC__ Grimes and Chvrches."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard of them, but I'm not sure."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Grimes is just one person, and Chvrches is a trio."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Grimes is electronic, but a bit avant-garde."
"__MUSIC__ And what about Chvrches?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they're considered synth-pop.  People say they have an 80s sound."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check them out some time."
"__MUSIC__ I've seen Chvrches live once.  It was a great show."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah?  You must really like them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's strange though, because the music is probably meant for younger people."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics have a lot about young love in them."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you're still young at heart."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe.  I mainly just ignore the lyrical content and focus on the sound."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever works for you."
"__MUSIC__ Enough about me.  What are you listening to lately?"
