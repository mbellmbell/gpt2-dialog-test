"__STAR_WARS__ Is it true that Gary Kurtz left after Empire?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he did not want to do another attack on the death star movie and him and Lucas left each other"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. He wanted Luke to ride off into the sunset at the end too."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would have been cooler"
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did not like the Ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ They were okay, but they did not belong in Star Wars"
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Gary Kurtz left cause of them too?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe. That seems like it would be one of the reasons."
