"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team do you see winning the NFC North division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going with Green Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to bet against Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. When in doubt, take the best Quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Green Bay has shown some cracks in the armor, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, but I'm not convinced that either Detroit or Minnesota quite have what it takes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You didn't mention the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For a reason! They're probably going to struggle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, probably another tough year for Chicago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think the Vikings have a chance to be special."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense has the potential to be great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love their defense. A lot of solid playmakers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the question is whether they can figure it out offensively."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which translates to the Quarterback position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Is Teddy Bridgewater healthy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bridgewater's out for all of 2017. And he's a free agent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sad. He was a promising young quarterback, but that injury was terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's another NFL injury story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without stability at the QB position, I think I agree that Green Bay is winning the NFC North."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the end, always bet on the Quarterback."
