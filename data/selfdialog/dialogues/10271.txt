"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you been watching the new Fear Factor? I can't believe it's being hosted by Ludacris."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ludacris the rapper?? Why would he be hosting a TV show??"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Lots of rappers are into acting nowadays."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess once their rapping career fails they move into acting, if they get the opportunity."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Maybe you're right, because he hasn't had a big hit since maybe 2009 or 2010 when he sang My Chick Bad"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Let's be honest though, that song only was a hit because he did it with Nicki Minaj."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True, people really love her. I know I do."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think they were great together. I was hoping they'd do more tracks together."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And be like the new Jah Rule and Ashanti?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nah, I was more thinking like Fat Joe and Remy Ma. They're both rappers. Ashanti isn't a rapper!"
