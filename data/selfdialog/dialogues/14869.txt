"__ACTION__ What is your favorite action movie?"
"__ACTION__ My favorite action movie is probably Dirty Harry."
"__ACTION__ That's an interesting choice."
"__ACTION__ How so?"
"__ACTION__ Well it's not very politically correct in these times because of all the police incidents."
"__ACTION__ I could see that point of view, but Dirty Harry never killed or hurt anyone that didn't have it coming."
"__ACTION__ That's true, he never killed an innocent person."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, Harry was just out to stop someone he knew for sure was a serial killer."
"__ACTION__ I could see how one might break the rules in that situation."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, it's somewhat easy to sympathize with Dirty Harry in that film."
