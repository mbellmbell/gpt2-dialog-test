"__STAR_WARS__ I just watched The Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely the best of the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Seeing Darth Vader emerge for the first time was definitely a great moment."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't understand why Yoda gave up on the Emperor though.  It looked like me might have been stronger."
"__STAR_WARS__ It had nothing to do with strength.  It was because Palpatine had the high ground and Yoda couldn't defeat him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see that.  Basically the opposite of Anikan and Obi Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, now you got it.  Even though Ani is stronger Obi Wan had the better position."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know what else I liked?  How they really played the fall of Vader to be more tragic than betrayal."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's the genius of Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure, great plot writing to go along with the effects."
