"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to Arcade Fire?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't. Are they any good?"
"__MUSIC__ I like them a lot, I just started listening to them."
"__MUSIC__ Nice, what album would you recommend I check out first?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like their Funeral album"
"__MUSIC__ Cool, what is it like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's sort of like indie rock, but it's pretty heavy on electronic instruments."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool, I'm not big on electronic music but I'll check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Their Neon Bible album is really good too, but it's a little out there."
"__MUSIC__ I see, I might have to check that out."
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Tame Impala at all?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, I really like them."
"__MUSIC__ What album is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Currents, it's a really good album to listen to all the way through."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check that one out, I've been meaning to get into their music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it's really cool, kind of weird though."
"__MUSIC__ I'm always down for some weird music, I do enjoy Captain Beefheart from time to time."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, I've never been able to get into his music. It's feels like an acquired taste."
"__MUSIC__ You should check out Safe As Milk, that's probably his most accessible album."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I've never listened to that one, I'll give that a shot later."
