"__BEATLES__ I loved listening to the Beatles when I was younger."
"__BEATLES__ Me, too.  What was your favorite song?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh man.... are we talking early Beatles or adult Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Both!  What about Sargeant Pepper era?"
"__BEATLES__ Uh no.  I'm not counting the Sargeant Pepper era!"
"__BEATLES__ I'd say Dol You Want to Know a Secret was my favorite early Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah, that's a good one.  I liked that too."
"__BEATLES__ Adult Beatles is harder because they did solo stuff as well."
"__BEATLES__ Yep.  Sometimes it's hard to know if you're listening to a solo record or not."
"__BEATLES__ Agree.  They were all so talented though, it doesn't matter."
