"__MOVIES__ What are the top three worst ever movies you've seen, and why?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh dear, that's a hard one. First off, is Star Dust."
"__MOVIES__ What made it so horrible?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was long and cheesy and long . . ."
"__MOVIES__ So it was too long?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it also just didn't make sense and didn't have a lot of good plot and everything."
"__MOVIES__ What's the second one?"
"__MOVIES__ I really didn't like the Goonies."
"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding? That's like - a cult classic!"
"__MOVIES__ I know. I feel really weird admitting that I don't like it but I didn't like the attitude the kids had."
"__MOVIES__ Attitudes?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah - the older kids were just bullies and rude and disgusting. I had a lot of none pleasant emotions watching that one."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I guess whatever goes for you. What's the third worst movie you've watched?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I've watched part of Gone With the Wind, and I realize it's supposed to make you feel appalled, but I didn't like it."
"__MOVIES__ What is with you, all these cult classics!"
"__MOVIES__ I know. It's just that there is so much at stake during the war time and so many things hung in the balance."
"__MOVIES__ It opened a window for people to see and understand what was going on."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, entirely, and that's good. The main character, what's her face, just drove me up the wall."
"__MOVIES__ Scarlett O'Hare?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. She's so immature and selfish!"
