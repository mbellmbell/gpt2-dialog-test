"__MUSIC__ Don't know about you, but I loved the new Killswitch Engage album."
"__MUSIC__ Incarnate? Hey, same here!"
"__MUSIC__ What did you like most about it?"
"__MUSIC__ I really enjoyed the vocals. Jesse Leach is a great singer."
"__MUSIC__ True. His screams are awesome, and his cleans are just beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like this was shown perfectly on Embrace the Journey."
"__MUSIC__ That song definitely had the strongest lyrics on the album. I cried at the end of it."
"__MUSIC__ Not to mention Adam D's vocals. He's so underrated."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Both as a vocalist and a guitar player."
"__MUSIC__ And a songwriter. He's basically kept the band sounding as good as they have the whole time that they've been around."
"__MUSIC__ I'm a big fan of the stuff he wrote for As Daylight Dies."
"__MUSIC__ I don't care what anyone says, but that's Killswitch's best album, period."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Every time I listen to it, I can't help but remember how amazing Howard Jones was as a vocalist."
"__MUSIC__ He was awesome. Jesse is great without a doubt, but Howard was just on a whole other level."
"__MUSIC__ It's such a shame that he had to leave. His voice would have been great on the last two albums."
"__MUSIC__ You know that he's still making music, right?"
"__MUSIC__ No way! With who?"
"__MUSIC__ His band is called Devil You Know. They sound very different from Killswitch, but they still sound great."
"__MUSIC__ I'm about to look them up right now."
"__MUSIC__ I have a feeling that you'll like them."
