"__MUSIC__ Do you like Radiohead?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. Who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ This rock band from the UK."
"__MUSIC__ What songs are they known for?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the song Creep?"
"__MUSIC__ How does it go?"
"__MUSIC__ 'I'm a creep, I'm a loser, what the hell am I doing here...'"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, that sounds familiar."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was one of their early hits in the 90s"
"__MUSIC__ Well, that was a long time ago. Anything more recent?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess their music recently hasn't had big hits. They're more of an album kind of band."
"__MUSIC__ OK, what albums do you reccommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I think OK Computer is a great place to start. That was their groundbreaking album in 1997."
"__MUSIC__ What's that like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's got great songs like Karma Police. But the sound is getting more experimental, less poppy, more epic."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty interesting. What else?"
"__MUSIC__ Their latest album is A Moon Shaped Pool. I like it but it's not super catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, I should give it a listen. What other bands sound like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Alt-J?"
"__MUSIC__ Cool. Thanks"
