"__MOVIES__ You remember the Gremlins movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Weren't there two of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I think there were.  I just don't even remember the second one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the first was so much better."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a pretty good movie."
"__MOVIES__ What was the name of the first gremlin?"
"__MOVIES__ Gizmo!"
"__MOVIES__ Why was it named that again?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, cause the man was an inventor.  I always figured that was why."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay, because he made gizmos."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it made sense to me."
"__MOVIES__ I always felt bad when the other Gremlins started popping out of Gizmo."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he looked like he was in pain."
"__MOVIES__ He knew this would happen though.  Why did he eat the food?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  I wondered that too."
"__MOVIES__ Gizmo was good.  It's not like he wanted anything bad to happen."
"__MOVIES__ It's funny how much different he was than the other gremlins."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was so clean."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the others were so gross looking."
