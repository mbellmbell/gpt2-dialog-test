"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if the Redskins and Kirk Cousins will agree on a long-term deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Washington can't afford to keep going with this year-by-year franchise tag, can they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They can get away with it this year, but it will cost a fortune - at least $35 million, I believe - to use a tag for the third consecutive year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do the Redskins do, then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cousins seems set on testing free agency in 2018, and it seems there is mutual interest between him and the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Cousins obviously has the previous connection with San Francisco's new coach, Kyle Shanahan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, and it's not like the 49ers have a franchise quarterback on the current roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it seems like a natural fit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nothing is that easy, though, because the Redskins could still use the transition tag on Cousins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How does that work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For around $29 million, which would easily be enough to make Cousins the NFL's highest paid player, they can use the tag to keep the option to match any other team's offer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a ton of money though, why would the Redskins use this tag but not just come to terms on a normal long-term deal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read an article that the owner, Dan Snyder, would rather overpay for Cousins then to see him leave for the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it's personal, then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty much, it goes back a few years when Shanahan and his father Mike, then the head coach, had a falling out with Snyder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if I'm the 49ers, I don't know that I'd want to overpay for Cousins anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point because he's a good quarterback but is he really elite?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He hasn't won a playoff game yet and he's 28 years old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides, the 2018 draft is apparently loaded with promising quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would prefer that route for San Francisco, especially since the team is clearly in rebuilding mode at this point."
