"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Kill Bill?"
"__MOVIES__ Volume one, or two?"
"__MOVIES__ Both; They're fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ I think I caught a bit of volume one but I can never find them."
"__MOVIES__ They're amazing, I think they might be the best movies ever made."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I wonder where I can find them."
"__MOVIES__ I found both on television; but they were toned down."
"__MOVIES__ How toned down?"
"__MOVIES__ A lot of the Bride stuff was missing from the first volume, at the beginning?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I think I know what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so what I did was I went out and bought a copy of both of them."
"__MOVIES__ Were they really worth that?"
"__MOVIES__ More than, plus, they've got bloopers."
"__MOVIES__ I love bloopers, in such serious movies too?"
"__MOVIES__ They're the best, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely, I think I should go pick those up."
"__MOVIES__ You honestly should, they're so great."
"__MOVIES__ Then I definitely will, how much were they?"
"__MOVIES__ Twenty for both, a bargain I'd say."
"__MOVIES__ Then it's settled, I'm definitely buying them."
