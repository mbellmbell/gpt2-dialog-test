"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you heard Lady Gaga's new album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, Joanne? What do you think of it?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's certainly different than her usual style."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, she's really breaking away from what she established."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I mean, it's nice to hear her branch out from pop."
"__LADY_GAGA__ True. Like her performance of Somwhere Over the Rainbow."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, now, THAT was an impressive expose."
"__LADY_GAGA__ For sure! She doesn't even need autotune; I don't see why they use it all the time on her albums."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, it's less about correcting her voice, and more about creating an effect."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Okay, yeah, I can see that."
