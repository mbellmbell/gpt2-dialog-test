"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know if Christian Ponder is still in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The dude from the Vikings.  Married a hot chick.  Took over from Worm-Killer McNabb."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Worm-Killer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Used to bounce passes to the receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok.  Well, never heard of him.  Don't know where he is and don't care."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You missed out; he was awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't care."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Air balls all over the place.  Scared to take a hit. Just plain bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe the line wasn't any good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you try to make excuses for him!  He stunk in high school, he stunk in college, and he stinks in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you have against him?  Lots of QBs stink."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL is a big boy league.  If you can take it like a man then you oughta quit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are we still talking football?  I'm sensing that you are drifting into some personal stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm talking Ponder.  He's a stiff, a has-been, a never-was, a I'm-running-home-and cryin-to-mama kind of player.  Just like Jim Everett."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He made it to the NFL so he must have had some skills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Blackmail was his skills.  He had something on something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just read that he's earned almost $11,000,000 in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not worth a penny!!!  He's a bum!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Keep in mind, that's $11,000,000 more than you earned in the NFL."
