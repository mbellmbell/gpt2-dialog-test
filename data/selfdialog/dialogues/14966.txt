"__ACTION__ The all-time best action movie ever made is actually a remake. It's The Magnificent Seven."
"__ACTION__ Oh yeah, I love that flick. Seven heroes ride into town, and save all the little people."
"__ACTION__ That's true, but first you get to know them one by one. Yul Brenner is introduced as the cagey old gunslinger Chris Adams."
"__ACTION__ Un-huh. Then Steve McQueen plays Vin Tanner, who loses his shirt gambling, and signs up."
"__ACTION__ Then there's Charles Bronson, playing Bernardo O'Reilly, who's down and out."
"__ACTION__ No, you left out Brad Dexter, who plays the conniving Harry Luck."
"__ACTION__ Okay, then we see James Coburn demonstrate his knife and gun skills as Britt."
"__ACTION__ Great stuff. Next we meet gentleman Robert Vaughn, plays Lee, who's afraid he's a coward."
"__ACTION__ And the last to join up is the tag-a-long kid Chico, played by Horst Buchholtz, who wants morethan anything to be a gunslinger."
"__ACTION__ Then they all ride into town, and save the day."
