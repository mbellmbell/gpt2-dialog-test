"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Preservation Hall?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a place in New Orleans where old musicians perform concerts for really reasonable rates."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of concerts do they perform?"
"__MUSIC__ They perform original New Orleans Jazz music. They want people to experience what traditional New Orleans Jazz was like."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been there?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, when I was in college we went to New Orleans and I stood outside half the night to get into Preservation Hall."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! Was it really that busy?"
"__MUSIC__ There was a line half way around the block and the hall was full when I got there."
"__MUSIC__ You must really like Jazz music. Did you ever get in?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, after the musicians finished their final concert a group of students including myself were still outside. One of the musicians asked us why we were still waiting and when he heard we were musicians he invited us in."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. Did you get to talk with him about music."
"__MUSIC__ Way better than that! The men put on a private concert for us. They showed us their instruments and we got to ask questions."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds very educational. Was it fun?"
"__MUSIC__ It was amazing to listen to how much they loved Jazz and New Orleans and performing for people."
"__MUSIC__ When was Preservation Hall built?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was established back in the 1960's to help keep New Orleans Jazz alive."
"__MUSIC__ That's a great idea but where do they get the musicians from? Surely they aren't the same people who played back in the 60's!"
"__MUSIC__ To be honest I'm not sure. All I know is that the guys I heard were really old and really good at playing Jazz."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad you liked it but I don't really like Jazz that much so I don't think I'll ever go there."
