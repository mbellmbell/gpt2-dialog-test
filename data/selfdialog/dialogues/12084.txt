"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that JJ Watt is going to have a good season this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think as long as he is healthy, he has a chance at being the defensive MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure that he is the most dominate defensive player in the NFL anymore, there are some great younger guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that JJ has the experience and the work ethic that continually makes him elite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, he doesn't have the championships and now he is coming back from significant injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the quarterback situation in Houston is likely getting better, but it's more about the young guys on Houston's defense that will influence how much time he sees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think that his playing time is going to decrease because of the injury and younger guys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not nessecarily. Look at a guy like Julius Peppers, in his 30s not playing on a limited snap count."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Julius Peppers is the exception, not the rule though. He takes really good care of himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So does JJ Watt. He trains hard and keeps focused during the season so that his teammates can count on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be interesting to see how he compares with some of the rookies that were drafted this year and some of the younger guys in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think Myles Garrett is going to be a big disrupter in the NFL, but I also look to guys like Taco Charlton to make a difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there are two vets who are better than JJ and will likely show up bigger than Garrett and Taco; Khalil Mack and Von Miller."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mack and Miller are no doubt in conversation for the most talented, but JJ has potential to make a huge comeback this year because he will have a chip on his shoulder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think both Mack and Miller have the same chip, even without serious injury. Both played for a team that should've played deeper into the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially Mack! Oakland is ready to challenge this year with both their offense and defense!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Derek Carr and Amari Cooper have made Oakland exciting to watch, but sometimes I think Mack is all alone on defense out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a lot like JJ Watt. Even with talent on the defensive roster, sometimes it felt like only he was playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will likely look even more like that this year because of Wilfork's absence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! He added a much needed veteran presence and really pushed JJ in terms of leadership and awareness."
