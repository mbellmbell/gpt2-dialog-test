"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the movie Death Wish 3?"
"__MOVIES__ No, tell me about it"
"__MOVIES__ Charles Bronson plays a man named Paul Kersey, a architect turned vigilante."
"__MOVIES__ How'd that happen?"
"__MOVIES__ His wife was murdered and his daughter raped, then in the second film his daughter is raped again then murdered."
"__MOVIES__ I take he didn't tell either situation well."
"__MOVIES__ Nope, he was a Korean war vet and he hunted down and killed all the ones responsible in both previous films."
"__MOVIES__ So what's going on in this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Paul is visiting a old war buddy in New york, but a brutal street gang has taken over the neighborhold. They kill this old buddy of his and Pauls gets arrested for it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so what happens next?"
"__MOVIES__ Ed Lauter, who is a police inspector, recognizes who Kersey is. He makes a deal with him, take out as much of the gang as he can and see the police get credited with the decrease in crime."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds, interesting, so what does Kersey do?"
"__MOVIES__ First, he designs and builds a couple of anti-gang body traps for the old war buddy's apartment building, which he moves into."
"__MOVIES__ Booby traps, what kind of booby traps."
"__MOVIES__ One is a piece of drywall with nails in it and another is a board rigged on a spring that shoots up into the face of anybody trying to enter a specific window"
"__MOVIES__ What happens after that?"
"__MOVIES__ He then buys a car and leaves on the street. When two gang members try to steal it and threaten him with a knife, he shoots both of them."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of a bait car situation, but wihtout the jail trip."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, and eventually he winds up in a massive fire fight with the gang, using a .30 Browning machinegun and masive handcannon."
"__MOVIES__ I love shoot'em ups, I'm in."
