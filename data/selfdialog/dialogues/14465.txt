"__HORROR__ Have you watched any good horror movies?"
"__HORROR__ I saw the Witch."
"__HORROR__ Oh, I heard good things about that one."
"__HORROR__ It was really good. I have no idea how the writer got them to sound like they're from the early colonial era, including even the accents."
"__HORROR__ Will I have to watch it with subtitles?"
"__HORROR__ I think you might. It could be hard to understand without."
"__HORROR__ Was it very depressing?"
"__HORROR__ It was, but that was necessary. There are tons of touching moments too."
"__HORROR__ I might check it out."
"__HORROR__ You should. The Witch was about fate and the slope of corruption."
