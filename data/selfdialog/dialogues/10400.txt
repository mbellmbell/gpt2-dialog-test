"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm really happy to see more foreign hip hop available streaming nowdays."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, it's still pretty slim pickins though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There definitely should be more but I feel it's an improvement."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And often times there's no info given on the artists."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly, so you can't find out more about them and support them if you wanted to."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah. I was looking for Polish rap the other week and only 3 or so decent songs came up."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a shame."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There has to be more of an active rap scene in places like Poland than are being represented."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I've had more success following established artists on social media and then looking up who they advertise than I do searching on my own."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I may have to try that."
