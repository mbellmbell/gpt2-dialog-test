"__HORROR__ Did you ever seen 'night of the living dead' ?"
"__HORROR__ Oh, yeah.  That's a classic."
"__HORROR__ I got scared watching it as a child."
"__HORROR__ I didn't see it until I was an adult."
"__HORROR__ I snuck into the living room where my parents were watching it."
"__HORROR__ It would be pretty scarry for a kid."
"__HORROR__ It was.  I had nightmares for a long time after that."
"__HORROR__ Really, was it the zombie's climbing out of their graves like in Thriller?"
"__HORROR__ Exactly, I still don't watch horror movies because of it."
"__HORROR__ Wow, I can't get enough of them."
