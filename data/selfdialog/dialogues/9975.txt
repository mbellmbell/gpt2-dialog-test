"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you remember Tupac?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who could forget him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I know just didn't know if it was before you time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Tupac's music and ideas will live for a hundred years past his death."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Possibly, anyway I was just thinking about him today."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What about?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I remember him on tv always preaching how we need to be nice to eachother and stop killing one another."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah that stuff was deep, do you think that's what got him killed?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think it was because he was convincing the world that just because you're one thing doesn't mean you have to be this or that and to stop doing it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah he was deep and I loved him."
