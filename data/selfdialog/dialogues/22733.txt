"__DISNEY__ What do you think is the best Disney song?"
"__DISNEY__ 'I'll Make a Man out of You,' from Mulan.  Musically, it is the best written song."
"__DISNEY__ That's a great choice.  Mulan was also my favorite movie overall."
"__DISNEY__ Likewise.  It was empowering to women, and also the first Disney movie with such a big Asian cast."
"__DISNEY__ Now that you mention it, Disney really didn't have that much Asian representation.  I hope they do so more."
"__DISNEY__ I hope so too.  Representation matters, and I'm glad Disney is at least making an effort."
"__DISNEY__ Who was your favorite character?"
"__DISNEY__ Mooshoo was so funny to me as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ As an adult, I still find him funny."
"__DISNEY__ Eddie Murphy was the perfect person to voice Mooshoo."
