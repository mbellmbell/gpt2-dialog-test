"__ACTION__ Have you heard of the new Transformers movie that's coming out?"
"__ACTION__ No I haven't, what is the name of it?"
"__ACTION__ It's Transformers: The Last Knight and is directed by Michael Bay."
"__ACTION__ Awesome, I hope this one lives up to the hype from the rest of them."
"__ACTION__ Me too, the last couple of movies that Michael Bay put out have been hit or miss."
"__ACTION__ Ya but they action in them have still been good. I have high expectations for this movie."
"__ACTION__ Why is that? The last one that came out was a disappointment for me."
"__ACTION__ I think that Mark Wahlberg will do another good job of acting in this movie. Michael Bay does make good movies at times."
"__ACTION__ You're right, I will go into this movie with an open mind and hopefully the movie turns out good."
"__ACTION__ Awesome! I look forward to seeing it with you when it comes out."
