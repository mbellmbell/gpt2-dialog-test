"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the NFL should favor expansion?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm leaning that way, but not as strongly. Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL teams are a massive burden on the cities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They use taxpayer money to build the stadiums, but the taxpayers have no say in how the team is run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think it would be better if the city could vote out staff?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's an insane amount of power and I'd love to have it. Fire coaches after bad seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like expansion but am cautious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Over-saturation. We don't need a ton of teams, and there are already enough"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, that would then make team quality go down overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. The Texans went from nothing to pretty good after just a few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they're the only ones in the past 20 years or so for that to happen to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be fine with them moving to a big city in the Midwest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's a slight problem with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the Midwest, the cities aren't actually that big, and fans would have to travel great distances to get there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're devoted!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but now you have people driving 200 miles after five beers."
