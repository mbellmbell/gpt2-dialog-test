"__MUSIC__ Who's your favorite music artist or band?"
"__MUSIC__ The Offspring. I liked them when I first heard their song 'Come Out and Play.'"
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty good. I know the song you're talking about and I remember other songs of theirs that got played on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they also had 'Pretty Fly for a White Guy,' and some other songs off of later albums that made the radio."
"__MUSIC__ What was their stuff like before 'Come Out and Play,' came along?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Come Out and Play' was off their third album Smash, released in 1994. It's much different from their first album, which came out in 1989."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard that the first album is much more raw and more punk."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's fast and hard, the songs have a garage sound. The lyrics are very full of angst and mad at the world, which is something I identified with."
"__MUSIC__ I might have to check that out. Which songs are your favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ I think you would like it. Demons is a good song, as is Elders."
"__MUSIC__ Are those the songs that had lyrics you identified with?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Elders is about how the older generation made promises they haven't kept and has ruined things for young people."
"__MUSIC__ Wow that sounds interesting. Any others you'd recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ The best part of that album is three songs on the second side, Thousand Days, Blackball, and I'll Be Waiting."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about those songs?"
"__MUSIC__ They flow together so well and they really pump me up. I can't tell you how many times I've listened to them together."
"__MUSIC__ You sound pretty knowledgeable about them."
"__MUSIC__ Like I said I liked them from the first time I listened to them. Their later albums like Conspiracy of One and Ixnay on the Hombre are so different from their early stuff, but I like them a lot too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to have to check them out. Any other of their stuff that you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, the 2003 album Splinter is great. I used to use some of those songs as my alarm in the morning."
