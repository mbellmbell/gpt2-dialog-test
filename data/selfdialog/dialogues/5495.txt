"__STAR_WARS__ Did you hear about the new Star Wars spin-off?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The one that's all about Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ That scoundrel.  Cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  It takes place before he met Luke and Leia in the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ That should be interesting!  Is Chewbacca going to be in it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course!  What is a Han Solo movie without Chewie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Cool.  Who's directing the film?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard it was Ron Howard!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh my God!  He's a great director!"
