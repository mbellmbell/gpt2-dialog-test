"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you see the Fast and Furious 7?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes! I saw it in the theatre. It was one of their best yet!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know. I can't believe that Paul Walker's brother finished his character out for him."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea I know, I could barely tell which brother was playing Brian."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I loved the last scene where they sort of did an homage to Paul."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you mean where Dom went to race him one last time?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea and then they showed a video montage of Paul Walker and Brian."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It had me crying! It was so sad."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh me too, I am going to miss that character in the movies. He was so great."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree it is very sad to see him go."
