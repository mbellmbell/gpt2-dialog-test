"__MOVIES__ Can you recommend a film to watch on Netflix or On Demand or something? I'm kind of stumped."
"__MOVIES__ What genre are you interested in?"
"__MOVIES__ Comedy, I think. I need a pick-me-up."
"__MOVIES__ New or old?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably a newer one. I want one that's just going to make me laugh out loud over and over."
"__MOVIES__ Then I recommend 'Spy.'"
"__MOVIES__ 'Spy?' That sounds familiar but I don't remember it."
"__MOVIES__ It's with Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham. It's hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Melissa McCarthy is kind of like this secret agent assistant but ends up having to go into the field."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, then what?"
"__MOVIES__ They keep giving her these aliases of these dowdy, frumpy women and figure she's totally unfit to be a secret agent."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess: she ends up impressing them?"
"__MOVIES__ She does but not without adventures and errors. Seriously, you need to see it. I couldn't stop laughing."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give it a shot. Any other suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ It's an older one but try 'Saving Grace' with Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson."
"__MOVIES__ I've never even heard of that one. What's that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ Brenda Blethyn is a widow facing eviction until her gardener asks for help growing a marijuana plant."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that already sounds like it has great potential."
"__MOVIES__ You won't be disappointed."
