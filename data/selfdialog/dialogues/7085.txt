"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ok, Coach, I'm sure you know what you're doing, but my son is missing a lot of shots"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah. I've noticed. he just has to get used to playing off wing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Isn't it too early for him? He's only 10. He's barely getting used to his left wing position. Last year was the first time he started."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Nah. I started off wing when I was his age. Once he's used to it, he can switch easily between positions which is a skill the recruiters always looks for."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He's 10, I'm not worried about his college plans."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, I want to develop all my players to the best of my abilities."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I understand that when he comes home after practice, he's just..."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Demoralized? Discouraged? Down?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah. And I hate seeing him like that. I kinda want to put him back in the left where he can pass, receive without missing as much."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Listen. Of all the starters I have your kid does better as an off wing than anyone else. That's a great skill. It needs to developed and you should encourage him more."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And how do you supposed I do that coach?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Practice. Teach him how it's easier to protect the puck if you're lefty in right winger position, because you can just back hand it. And you still have a free hand"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Um. That's your job, coach."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hah, so, you're right. Then why are you complaining?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I just thought... I should do something, his mother was concerned, you know."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Understandable. Give me this season and him at the right winger position."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And if it doesn't work out?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Learn to stay posiitive. Your son has great skills as a right winger. He's just not as accurate"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If it doesn't work out this season, or by the middle of the season, will you change him back?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If it turns out I'm wrong, then yes, I will change him back. No problem, but I'm right. Your kid has potential as an off wing"
