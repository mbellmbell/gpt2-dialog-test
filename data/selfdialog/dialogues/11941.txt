"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team in the AFC do you think can beat the Patriots and stop them from another ring?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there are two that have a really good chance, Pittsburgh and Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those two have the talent to top the AFC, but it also depends on the health of the team and how their meetings during the regular season go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that Roethlisberger is nearing the end of his career because of health reasons, but he is definitely a quarterback who can take Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he gets on the same page as Antonio Brown, it's touchdowns for days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Add in their explosive running game with Bell and it's near impossible to stop them once the offense starts clicking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's more of the defense that I worry about with Pittsburgh, while I see so many pieces coming together for Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Pittsburgh's offense scores a bunch of points, it doesn't really matter how their defense is, much like how the Saints are successful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but Oakland is more of a complete package with their young QB talent, dynamic receivers and running back, as well as hungry defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think Khalil Mack should be a player that Tom Brady worries about because he is younger and more athletic than Tom, a combination that's hard to avoid when dodging sacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's interesting though to see the coaches of those three AFC teams though because they all have a lot of experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just not sure that Tomlinson or Del Rio have what it takes to out coach Belichick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They both have a talented roster though and enough experience playing against Belichick that it may be easier to game plan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only thing predictable about Belichick is that he will do whatever it takes to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really noticed that last preseason and beginning of the season when Tom was suspended, both backup quarterbacks executed well against some tough teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is probably why Jimmy Garoppolo's trade stock is so high, even with limited professional tape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No matter who is at quarterback, the Patriots are tough to beat with Belichick calling the shots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their roster also improved this year because Belichick had several good hits during both free agency and the NFL draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My guess is that Pittsburgh and Oakland picked up a few good guys that will address their problems and only make them more of a contender."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would still guess that Patriots make it to the Super Bowl, unless Oakland or Pittsburgh can bring their roster to the next level."
