"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's your rap guilty pleasures?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I have so many, I identify primarily as a conscious rap fan, which is nothing to be guilty about. However, I really like Soulja Boy and Chief Keef."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ha! Those young dudes, I guess Soulja Boy isn't that young anymore, make fun music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, it's fun. The lyrics aren't deep, but the confidence, the cadence, the beat are all there."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's also really nice to see these kids who grew up in poverty make some cash."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, I can't hate on it. They're doing good for themselves and their family."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Except Bobby Shmurda."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, Shmurda didn't take peoples advice about getting away from crime seriously and now he's in jail."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'd hate to see the same thing happen to Kodak Black."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It could happen, but I really hope it doesn't. He's a prodigious talent."
