"__COMEDY__ Hey, did you ever see Mrs. Doubtfire?"
"__COMEDY__ Oh, God. Yes, I loved that movie when I was a kid!"
"__COMEDY__ Me too! What was your favorite part?"
"__COMEDY__ Ahhh, geeze. It would have to be when Robin Williams fills the house with all those animals for his kids birthday party."
"__COMEDY__ His wife was so mad."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, she was. What's your favorite scene?"
"__COMEDY__ When they're at the pool and Mrs. Doubtfire grabs a lime out of a fruit tray and pitches it like a baseball at the back of the boyfriends head."
"__COMEDY__ Yes! And she goes, 'It was a run by fruiting!'"
"__COMEDY__ Absolutely classic."
"__COMEDY__ No doubt."
