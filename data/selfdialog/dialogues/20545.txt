"__MOVIES__ Have you see Tangled?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea it was really cute!"
"__MOVIES__ Unpopular opinion, I think its way better than Frozen"
"__MOVIES__ No way Frozen is great!"
"__MOVIES__ Tangled is so cute though, I think it was highly underrated"
"__MOVIES__ I mean it was good but not compared to Frozen, Frozen's songs are just so catchy."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's why Tangled didn't do as well, the songs just weren't as catchy. I think the humor was way better though"
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ I just really love the sarcasm and dry humor in it! It was just really funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Yea it is pretty sarcastic. and has some pretty funny re-occurring jokes. but Frozen is just so cute and I love the snowman!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that Rapunzel from Tangled actually shows up in Frozen?"
"__MOVIES__ No way! When?"
"__MOVIES__ When they open the gates and everyone is entering the ball, you can see Rapunzel for a quick moment walking into the castle!"
"__MOVIES__ No way! Does that Mean they're related in someway?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there's a theory that they're cousins and Anna an Elsa's parent died going to Rapunzel's wedding"
"__MOVIES__ No way that makes so much sense now!"
"__MOVIES__ Yea and there's a theory that Hans is related to the two bad guys in Tangled that capture Flynn because they all have red hair and Hans says he has 14 siblings."
"__MOVIES__ Woah that actually makes so much sense, I wonder if its true?"
"__MOVIES__ I dont know but  it's really crazy how supposedly all of the Disney Movies are in the same universe"
"__MOVIES__ yea that's really crazy, I wonder how they come up with all of that stuff"
