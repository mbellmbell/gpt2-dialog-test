"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Split?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't.  Isn't that about the person with a split personality?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, its the one with the guy from x-men.  It's pretty crazy."
"__MOVIES__ Was it scary?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not too scary.  It was interesting though how they explained the mental illness that causes his 'split personality.'"
"__MOVIES__ Huh.  I want to see that.  I just haven't gotten to it yet."
"__MOVIES__ You should definitely go and see it.  I don't like the boundary issues with the psychiatrist.  Otherwise it's great."
"__MOVIES__ What's up with the psychiatrist?"
"__MOVIES__ She meets with her patients out of her house."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's scary.  Why would she do that?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  It's even crazy because she only meets people with dissociative identity disorder."
"__MOVIES__ That's creepy and dumb of her."
"__MOVIES__ That's the part that I had a hard time getting over.  She even tells the patient that she lives alone."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy.  I would never tell a client that."
"__MOVIES__ Me either.  It was all pretty believable until the end."
"__MOVIES__ What happens at the end?"
"__MOVIES__ The main character actual turns into another person."
"__MOVIES__ So, it's a fictional movie."
"__MOVIES__ Parts were fictional.  Parts of it could be real."
"__MOVIES__ I definately want to check it out still."
