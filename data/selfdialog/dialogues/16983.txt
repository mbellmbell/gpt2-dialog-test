"__MOVIES__ Hey, you ready for the next Marvel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Already? Didn't they just have one come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 came out earlier this month."
"__MOVIES__ Man, there's so many I can't keep up. Which one's next?"
"__MOVIES__ Spider-Man Homecoming, I think in Mid-July."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, wow, I can't believe they're rebooting Spider-Man for the fifth time."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's only the third time--there was Toby McGuire's, Andrew Garfield's, and now Tom Holland."
"__MOVIES__ You get my point, that's a lot of Spider-Mans in like fifteen years."
"__MOVIES__ True, but I think Tom's going to do a great job."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't he already in a movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he had a cameo in Captain America Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I saw that! Yeah, he was funny."
"__MOVIES__ I loved his snark in this so much, I think they're really going to nail him this time."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I thought the Garfield one was good, it just had bad writing."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Good writing will really make or break a film."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give it a shot, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ It should help that RDJ's in it too."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, pulling star power!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, having his acting expertise should help the film."
"__MOVIES__ Sweet, then I'll put it on my calendar to go see!"
