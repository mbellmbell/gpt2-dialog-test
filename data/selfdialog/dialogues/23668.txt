"__DISNEY__ Peter Pan is one of best Disney films."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I saw the new live action movie the other day."
"__DISNEY__ I think it's one of those Disney movies that translates well to a more adult movie. Like Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think it would be hard to adapt Bambi to attract a more adult audience."
"__DISNEY__ Oh don't get me started on Bambi. I don't feel like crying today."
"__DISNEY__ You mean when mom dies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, when the mom dies. Okay?"
"__DISNEY__ Don't think about the mom. You should think about Thumper."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I adore Thumper."
"__DISNEY__ Eating greens is a special treat, It makes long ears and great big feet. But it sure is awful stuff to eat."
