"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see the movie BFG? It's a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! Oh my gosh, I absolutely loved it!"
"__DISNEY__ Really? I haven't had the chance to see it yet. What did you enjoy about it?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved how BFG, which stands for Big Friendly Giant, by the way, would sneak through town without being seen by anyone."
"__DISNEY__ What's so great about that? I don't understand."
"__DISNEY__ Well he was huge, for starters. Taller than most buildings."
"__DISNEY__ How did he avoid being seen then? I'm trying to picture it."
"__DISNEY__ He would kind of morph into some of the things he would be standing by or be near. A lamp post, for example."
"__DISNEY__ Oh how cool! Now I'm curious to see it."
"__DISNEY__ You really should! It was a really fun movie and it had a great storyline."
