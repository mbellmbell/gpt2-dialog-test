"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think will win the NBA Finals this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not sure. Who's playing in it again?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors are in the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Again? That's crazy."
"__BASKETBALL__ They're the best teams in the league by far."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Warriors will win this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They have the best team, I think. Curry is unstoppable."
"__BASKETBALL__ But what about LeBron James?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the Warriors have Curry, Durant, and others. Cleveland can't rely on just LeBron!"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. But I think the Cavs will repeat this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's possible. Whoever wins, it's sure to be a great series."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it was smart of LeBron to leave Miami and come back to Cleveland."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think so too. He made a lot of fans angry when he left the first time."
"__BASKETBALL__ He wanted to win a championship and he couldn't do it in Cleveland."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. But now the Cavs have a team that could win."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're right about the Warriors though, they have a lot of talent on their team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but they need to make sure to put pressure in the key. They can't rely on offense."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs too. Basketball is so offensive these days."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, every team could stand to learn better defense."
