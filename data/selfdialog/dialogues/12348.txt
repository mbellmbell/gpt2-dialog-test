"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, could you teach me about football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, what do you want to know? Offense or Defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to learn about offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, offense it is. I'm sure you know what the quarterback does right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kind of, he throws the ball right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, kind of. The quarterback is basically in charge of the field. He decides the plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok, so he tells everybody else what to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, so he might throw the ball to someone, or he might run the ball himself or hand it off to another player. It all depends on the play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok I get it. The quarterback is the general and the other players are his soldiers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. Next we have the running back . This is usually a really fast player that can do everything. Run, block, whatever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, he's like a second quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, no, because he doesn't call the play. Remember, the quarterback decides on the play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok, but after the play is decided, the running back is pretty important?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, absolutely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, got it. What else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, then we have a fullback, which is like a runningback, but normally stronger. The fullback does a lot of blocking and protecting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok so like a buff version of the runningback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, kind of. Which is crazy because they are all so buff already."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea no kidding. This sounds complicated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's easy once you start watching games."
