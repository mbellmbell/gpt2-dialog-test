"__DISNEY__ I re-watched Lilo and Stitch today, before I let the kids watch it.  Now I can't stop crying."
"__DISNEY__ Oh my goodness.  Just hearing the name of the movie makes my eyes tear up."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah it does.  With the 'leave me alone to die' and the photograph..."
"__DISNEY__ And the doll! And Jumba telling Stitch he can't be good!"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's extra touching, because the storyline is so real."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. The real threat isn't the aliens or dragons or monsters, it's being separated from your family."
"__DISNEY__ Have you decided if you will let your kids watch it?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't decided yet.  The kids would be fine, but I am worried I'll start crying my eyes out in front of them."
"__DISNEY__ Fun fact that might cheer you up.  When Stitch shocks everyone with what he licks on his cage, it's the Disney logo he licks."
"__DISNEY__ Hilarious!  Now I'm laughing through my tears."
