"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! Are you excited about football season this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am.  I can't wait to root for the Bengals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you really think they will even be decent this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. It isn't much fun rooting for a losing team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they will bounce back and be in the playoffs this time.  Third in their division wasn't terrible, but wasn't great either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! I hated watching them lose so much.  How do you think the Panthers will do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am excited for the Panthers this year.  I think they will be fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you get to go to any games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, I think I do!  I am actually off a couple of weekends they play at home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is great! I wish I lived closer to Cincinnati, then I could actually see the Bengals play in person."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they were playing the Panthers this year I would say come with me, but they aren't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks for the offer, but you are right.  The schedule just isn't on my side this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets hope the schedule is one their side and they play better than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now that is funny."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, we could say the same thing about the Panthers.  They weren't so hot last season either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but I think they are due. I really do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they get some awesome drafts picks or something?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got a few prospects and a few promising trades too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I guess we both can keep our fingers crossed for better seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I will be crossing my toes too."
