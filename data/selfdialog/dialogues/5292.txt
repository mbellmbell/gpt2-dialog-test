"__STAR_WARS__ If you could be one character from star wars movies , who would it be?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Since I am female  I would have to say lea."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really why? The new females are so much more empowered."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I loved the original star wars movies the most. I also love that gold bikini and adore Han solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Fair enough reasons. The other newer females don't really have any love interest do they?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well with rae she sort of does, but not as clear if that will develop or not. But not as overt."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is true, I was just thinking we left out the whole romance of queen amidala."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yes, I did blank on that. She was not as fun or witty but did have beautiful costumes."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. Much stiffer character than lea. But great costume design."
"__STAR_WARS__ I forgot to ask your favorite star wars  movie character, sorry."
