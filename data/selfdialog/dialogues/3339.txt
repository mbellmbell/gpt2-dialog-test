"__MUSIC__ I kind of like classical music, but am unsure about what 'classical' music actually is."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what kind do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like those big pieces for orchestra."
"__MUSIC__ So maybe you like Romantic era music?"
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Pieces of music that were usually written sometime between 1830 and 1914."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I had no idea. So would Tchaikovsky be Romantic music?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I do like his Piano Concerto. What else would I like by him, you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I bet you'd probably love his Symphonie pathétique, his sixth symphony."
"__MUSIC__ What's so cool about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Lots of stuff. It's in a minor key, b minor, so it sounds really dark and sad. And it has really nice writing for low register instruments like cello."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that sounds promising."
"__MUSIC__ Also, there's a lot of debate about whether there's a 'secret' program associated with this piece. Like whether Tchaikovsky was trying to tell some sort of specific story through the music."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. Have they ever proven that in any way?"
"__MUSIC__ No. In fact, Tchaikovsky didn't even call it the Pathetique at first—that was only added right after he died."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting! When did he die?"
"__MUSIC__ Right after this piece premiered! That's another reason people find it interesting. It's sort of his last great hit."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa, people were obsessed with that kind of plot line even in the 1890s?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, we've been obsessed with dramatic stories about music for a long time!"
