"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just read that Knile Davis is learning the playbook for this year. It's about time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he is. With his speed, the Packers will rule this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He didn't play much last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably because he didn't know the playbook well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't Aaron Rodgers say something about him not being ready?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, but I read that the coach mentioned it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I knew someone said it. Do you think they'll do good this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think with his speed and Aaron's abilities, they'll make a great pair!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't Aaron getting old?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's only 33! I think he's still got some great years ahead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll stick with my Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has Cam recovered for this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read that he's doing well at practice and should be playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a pretty good quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he is. He's always underrated though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That happens a lot. He's no Aaron Rodgers, but I still recognize his abilities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's getting better and better!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt he'll ever be as good as Aaron, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess time will tell, my friend!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we shall see!"
