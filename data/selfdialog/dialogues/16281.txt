"__ROCK__ I am very happy that blink-182 is still around."
"__ROCK__ Yeah same, Matt Skiba has done a great job filling in for Tom DeLonge."
"__ROCK__ The deluxe edition of California was even better than California itself."
"__ROCK__ Agreed, the collection of songs on there were really strong."
"__ROCK__ Especially so, and when stacked up against the original CD it's one of their best albums."
"__ROCK__ I completely agree with you, the deluxe edition tracks have a harder edge."
"__ROCK__ Yeah they contrast really well with the brighter songs on the original release."
"__ROCK__ Do you think we'll get another album with Skiba?"
"__ROCK__ They've found themselves in immense success with him, I can't imagine they wouldn't."
"__ROCK__ I'm really curious to see what Tom puts out with Angels and Airwaves as a response to blink's newfound success."
