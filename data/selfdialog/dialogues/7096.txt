"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you watch the Pens Caps series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea Dude, the pens always seem to have the caps number in the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That is true, I am not sure why the pens can't ever close them out before game 6 or 7 though, it makes me angry."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I wonder if Crosby's injury will affect him in the conference finals?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I would imagine that it would man, that looked brutal."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, hockey is a violent game, but I love it."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What was your favorite series of all time as a pens fan?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I liked the 2009 stanley cup finals when we came back to win game 7 on the road."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ My favorite game though was in 2008 in the 3OT match with the red wings. That seeme to go on forever."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ WHat a great series that was as well, at least Pittsburgh got them back the next year at their place."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I believe the pens were only one of 2 teams to that point to win a game 7 on the road in a major league final, the other being the pirates in 1979. Both Pittsburgh teams."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But didn't the boston bruins win at vancouver in game 7 in 2011?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, but as I said, up until 2011. That was also a great series, a lot of fighting and a beat down at the end."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ha! Nothing like angry Canadians swearing at a short handed goal down big in a hockey championship."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I can't wait to see  how the penguins do this year in the conference finals. I hope the conference finals aren't as hard as last year when we played the lightning."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am not looking foward to playing Montreal though, I hope we do better than last year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think we will be fine if we can get healthy and score."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The power play will be key."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ We need Crosby and Malkin to really step up to win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe he can score a hat trick like back in January. Should be a good series!"
