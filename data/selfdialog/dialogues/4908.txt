"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite band for lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite band for lyrics has gotta be The Mountain Goats?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? Why The Mountain Goats?"
"__MUSIC__ Their lead singer slash lyricist John Darnielle writes brilliant lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Can you give me some examples?"
"__MUSIC__ He can capture a scene so evocatively. For example, in 'This Year' he sings: 'I played video games in a drunken haze I was 17 years young / Hurt my knuckles punching the machines, the taste of scotch rich on my tongue.'"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so he sings about childhood, what else does he sing about?"
"__MUSIC__ He has a lot of fun lyrics about love. From International Small Arms Traffic Blues: 'Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania / Trucks loaded down with weapon, crossing over every night, moon yellow and bright / there is a shortage in the blood supply, but there is no shortage of blood.'"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not your typical pop song lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Not at all. His lyrics are super unique, he actually recently wrote a novel."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, what was it called and what's it about?"
"__MUSIC__ The book is called Wolf in a White Van and it's by John Darnielle, who is essentially The Mountain Goats. I don't want to spoil too much about it, but it's about an isolated man named Sean Phillips."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, that's really interesting that he wrote a whole novel. Okay, so what Mountain Goats album should I start with?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there are two main periods for the Mountain Goats. There is the lo-fi period and the hi-fi period."
"__MUSIC__ Let me guess, the lo-fi period is recorded cheaply and the hi-fi period is not."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's essentially it. The hi-fi period also has more intricate arrangements."
"__MUSIC__ Which period is better?"
"__MUSIC__ They both have some really great stuff, it's hard to say."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, can you recommend me an album from each of the periods?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, from the hi-fi period you should check out The Sunset Tree. From the lo-fi period you should listen to All Hail West Texas."
