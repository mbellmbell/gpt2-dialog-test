"__POP__ Who do you think is the best pop artist of all time?"
"__POP__ I think some people would say Madonna, but I'm still gonna say Britney."
"__POP__ Britney Spears? She doesn't have the durability of Madonna!"
"__POP__ She may not, but I think she will still be forever the world's best and most popular."
"__POP__ Well, she does have commercial value, I just don't know if her music can really be called great."
"__POP__ Well, music tastes are always subjective, but I bet everyone can sing along to her music."
"__POP__ More people than can sing 'Like a Virgin'?"
"__POP__ Sure, sure. But 'Hit me Baby' and 'Oops I did it again' will get there in another ten years."
"__POP__ I still don't see them lasting the test of time."
"__POP__ They have already lasted almost twenty years. That's a long time for music."
