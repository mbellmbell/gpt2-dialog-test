"__MUSIC__ Would you consider Creed the worst rock band around?"
"__MUSIC__ They arent around anymore I dont think"
"__MUSIC__ OK but of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah maybe but their album sales dont reflect that"
"__MUSIC__ Their music was so corny"
"__MUSIC__ I agree that it was but still, you cant really fault them for that."
"__MUSIC__ I can, I think it was sort of boring for the most part."
"__MUSIC__ They made commercial sounding songs"
"__MUSIC__ Higher was an anthem for awhile, you have to admit it was catchy at first."
"__MUSIC__ I think the singer wanted to sound like Pearl Jam too much"
"__MUSIC__ You mean Eddie Vedder because none of their songs sound like Pearl Jam."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I would just say the singer specifically."
"__MUSIC__ Nickelback was equally as terrible"
"__MUSIC__ Again they also sold a ton of albums"
"__MUSIC__ Do album sales in rock mean that much anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ Nowadays no but back in their day they do"
"__MUSIC__ What was the name of the song Nickelback"
"__MUSIC__ They had a ton but How You Remind Me was the one that broke them in"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that song was terrible and I dont get its appeal"
"__MUSIC__ I can see it, had a very catchy chorus"
