"__POP__ Do you listen to pop music?"
"__POP__ Sometimes, I don't really like anything too ridiculous like most boy bands or bubble gum pop though."
"__POP__ Ha, I know what you mean. Do you like Halsey? She's popular lately."
"__POP__ I do actually, but not as much as a lot of people I know. I think I like her fashion and hair better than her music."
"__POP__ I like the song she did with the Chainsmokers."
"__POP__ Oh, closer? That was pretty good. The Chainsmokers have been putting out some hits lately."
"__POP__ I know, I like their song with Coldplay too. They do a lot of collaborations."
"__POP__ Yes, Something Just Like This. I like that song a lot."
"__POP__ What's their newest hit called?"
