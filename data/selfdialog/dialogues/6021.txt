"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen Rogue One yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I haven't."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh man, you gotta see it!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I'm really slacking."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's my favorite Star Wars now."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really! That's pretty high praise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I definitely like it better than any of the prequels, and also the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ But better than Empire?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe. I've watched that one so many times, and Rogue One was the most exciting film I've scene since I don't know when."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow. Well I'll definitely have to move that one to the top of my list of movies to see next."
