"__MOVIES__ I think the original came out in the fifties."
"__MOVIES__ Well I wouldn't have seen that version."
"__MOVIES__ No I never did either."
"__MOVIES__ I think Vincent Price was in it."
"__MOVIES__ Then you know it was old.  He was a good actor though."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I don't know the actors names in the newer version, but I've seen them in other things."
"__MOVIES__ Chris Kattan is in it briefly and I knnow I saw the wife in other movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, me too."
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely creep inside that house."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, they did a good job and it was kept simple too, not a lot of effects."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes you don't need them."
