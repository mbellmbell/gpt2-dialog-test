"__BASEBALL__ How in the world are the Minnesota Twins leading the AL Central"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah this is a great surprise to me too."
"__BASEBALL__ Right now they have been road warriors. They have one of the best road records in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they have won 11 and lost 5 on the road so far."
"__BASEBALL__ Not bad. Not bad at all. This is what has allowed them to be in first place."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they shouldn't be jumping for joy because they are only .500 at home."
"__BASEBALL__ Indeed. They are also only one game ahead of the Tigers and Indians."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah those teams are right on their heels. No time to sleep."
"__BASEBALL__ For sure, this maybe a battle all the way to the end of the season between these teams."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but I have to believe that the Cleveland Indians may be the best team in this division."
"__BASEBALL__ These guys were really close to winning it all last year. People have forgotten that quickly"
"__BASEBALL__ I agree with you. This is a dangerous team that is not getting the respect that they deserve."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I think they will overtake the Twins in no time."
"__BASEBALL__ The Twins are just not good enough to sustain this division over 162 games."
"__BASEBALL__ However, if they keep playing this well on the road and begin to hit at home anything is possible."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but that is a lot of 'ifs'. I just don't see it happening."
"__BASEBALL__ It would be a really cool story though if they could pull it off."
"__BASEBALL__ Well don't hold your breath because the Twins are going down."
"__BASEBALL__ Sometimes baseball is funny and the best team doesn't always win."
"__BASEBALL__ I couldn't have said it better myself."
