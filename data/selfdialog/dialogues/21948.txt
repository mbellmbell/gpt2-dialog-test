"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the Walt Disney movie called Bambi?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, vaguely though. What was it about again?"
"__DISNEY__ It was about a young deer growing up in the forest. His name was Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, I think I remember now. Didn't his mother die at the end of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I believe that's what happened in the movie. I do remember the young rabbit Thumper."
"__DISNEY__ Thumper was a interesting character. Wasn't he Bambi's best friend or something?"
"__DISNEY__ I do believe they were best friends in the movie. They were pretty much in all the scenes."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. Those types of movies would teach so much to young children right now."
"__DISNEY__ Tell me about it. I remembered when Bambi first learned to speak. It was so sweet seeing him try to say birds...'B-burr'."
"__DISNEY__ Thumper was such a good friend to him, teaching him how to speak."
