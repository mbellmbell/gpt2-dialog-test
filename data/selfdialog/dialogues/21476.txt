"__DISNEY__ Did you see the Disney version of Pocahontas?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. It was some great animation. Maybe not my favourite Disney movie though."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, didn't you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ It was good, but the subject matter was a little heavy."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, what, the whole native american subjugation thing?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's some deep stuff for a kid's movie."
"__DISNEY__ No doubt. I think it had some historical inaccuracies too."
"__DISNEY__ Well of course, they needed to take some liberties. They made John Smith seem much more heroic."
"__DISNEY__ Not surprising. Authentic history doesn't make for a great narrative."
"__DISNEY__ Precisely. It was still a well done film though."
