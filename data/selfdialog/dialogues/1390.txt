"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the way music is going?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't even know. There are so many genres and sub-genres I literally can't keep up."
"__MUSIC__ What about radio music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well more than ever it's poppy and taking more and more notes from each other to the point I almost can't differentiate between some songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know what you mean. But hip hop has been keeping it real. There's some good pop, too."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, obviously, it's meant to appeal to the masses."
"__MUSIC__ Well, yes, but besides that it's actually good like a lot of it is quality stuff, from Lady Gaga to Lorde to Adele to Beyonce."
"__MUSIC__ You just named all women, are you saying there aren't any good male pop artists?"
"__MUSIC__ No, there may be, just none that appeal to me much, besides like Mac Demarco or Weeknd."
"__MUSIC__ I see, so, what? You're saying I should broaden my horizons?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't see the harm in it, that's for sure. But if it's not for you then it isn't for you."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but I'll give it a shot. Seems to me there's more variety than ever before."
"__MUSIC__ That's for sure. A lot of people currently labeled as hip hop don't believe they should be labeled as such, yet they are and continue to be. In itself it's a really diverse genre."
"__MUSIC__ Do you really think so? Or are you just so entrenched in the culture and music you can't see fault?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I see the mistakes, I see the mess ups, I hear the good and the not good, but if you were to listen to hip hop seriously, hip hop of the past 20, 30 years, you would see just how much pop music is influenced."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know the extent of that, there are samples out there I would have never thought of."
"__MUSIC__ Indeed, like Kanye sampling so many, or Pharrell sampling, Eminem sampling classic rock songs; it's really crazy and amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I have to agree, I can't wait to see where it goes. It almost makes me want to make music."
"__MUSIC__ Do it. You don't have to do it full time, but why not contribute to your genre's culture, and humanity's culture(s)."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and who knows maybe I'll create my own genre or sub-genre."
