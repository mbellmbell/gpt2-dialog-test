"__HORROR__ Are you a fan of older horror movies?"
"__HORROR__ Absolutely! Have you seen the Hellraiser series?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, I love how mysterious and demonic it is."
"__HORROR__ Me too, its crazy how they rip peoples faces apart with chains and hooks."
"__HORROR__ It is so cool how the cenobites are spawned by using a puzzle cube."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, it really adds to the mysteriousness of it all."
"__HORROR__ I was a huge fan of the first two movies in the series, but after that it just became random."
"__HORROR__ They really started just killing anyone instead of killing the person who unlocks the puzzle cube."
"__HORROR__ It fell apart from the old Hellraiser story from the comics."
"__HORROR__ Yes it did, its a shame how terrible those movies became later on."
