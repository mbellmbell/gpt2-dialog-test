"__DISNEY__ If you could be any Disney character which character would you be?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd pick the princess from Frozen. The one with the ice powers."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good choice. You get to be queen and you get cool powers. Who would you pick?"
"__DISNEY__ I would pick the Genie from Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ I'd forgotten about him. He's really powerful and he's really funny."
"__DISNEY__ You could do almost anything you want if you were Genie."
"__DISNEY__ Is there another character that you would like to be?"
"__DISNEY__ Hercules. I'd like to be a hero."
"__DISNEY__ A lot of bad things happened to him in the myths. He's much happier in the movies."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly. You get his powers but not the sad parts."
