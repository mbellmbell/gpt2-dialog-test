"__BASEBALL__ Was looking forward to watching the Beltway series today but it got rained out."
"__BASEBALL__ Same. You a Nats fan?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nah, O's all day."
"__BASEBALL__ Ah. I'm a Nats fan but I go to a lot of Orioles games too."
"__BASEBALL__ Good baseball is good baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Especially during the playoffs. I went to an O's Tigers playoff a couple years ago. Place was on fire."
"__BASEBALL__ 2014?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think so."
"__BASEBALL__ We swept them right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, then got the same treatment from the Royals."
"__BASEBALL__ Ugh. Don't remind me."
"__BASEBALL__ LOL not exactly rings over here in DC either."
"__BASEBALL__ You got Harper though. It's only a matter of time."
"__BASEBALL__ It takes more than one guy though. You got Machado."
"__BASEBALL__ Fair enough."
"__BASEBALL__ Did they reschedule the rainout?"
"__BASEBALL__ I dunno, haven't checked."
"__BASEBALL__ The rain didn't even seem that bad in the first place."
"__BASEBALL__ My brother said the same thing. I guess the field was probably just beyond play."
"__BASEBALL__ Probably easier to beat up on the Phillies tomorrow for the Nats."
