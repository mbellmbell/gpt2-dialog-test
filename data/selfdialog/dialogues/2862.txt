"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to the band City and Colour?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't heard them. What are they like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's Dallas Green who was in Alexisonfire. This is his solo project."
"__MUSIC__ I remember Alexisonfire! Is it the same type of music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it's really acoustic, almost like folk music. His voice is beautiful and his songwriting makes me cry. The album 'The Hurry and the Harm' is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I thought you liked metal music."
"__MUSIC__ I do, but my boyfriend loves City and Colour so I started listening to them. I've started listening to some other bands like that. Have you heard of This Wild Life?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't heard of them either. Would I have heard any of their songs?"
"__MUSIC__ They did a cover of 'Sleepwalking' that was really good. They're just two guys who play the guitar and sing. It's really different than the normal stuff I listen to."
"__MUSIC__ You know who I saw and I checked out their stuff and it's really good? Have you heard of Avatar?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I love Avatar! What song is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I love that song 'Let It Burn' from their Black Waltz album. It's really upbeat but still heavy."
"__MUSIC__ That song is great. Have you listened to their new album Feathers and Flesh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's the first one I listened to. What was the album before that one?"
"__MUSIC__ Hail the Apocalypse. That single was good but I wasn't crazy about the rest of the album."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to listen to it. I like that swedish metal music. Have you listened to In Flames?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I love them! I like Amaranthe too. I think I want to go to Sweden just to listen to metal music."
"__MUSIC__ Who is Amaranthe? Are they Swedish too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have three vocalists..a girl and guy singer and a screamer so it's a different sound than what everyone else is doing."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I'll have to check them out. I like stuff like that."
