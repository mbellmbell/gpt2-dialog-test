"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite Beatles song?"

"__BEATLES__ That's interesting. What do you like about that song?"
"__BEATLES__ I like the atmosphere and vibe of it."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, because of the sound effects and all that?"
"__BEATLES__ Right, it's put together very well. The song tells a story with the music, lyrics, and the sounds effects."
"__BEATLES__ My favorite song is A Day in the Life."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that's a great one."
