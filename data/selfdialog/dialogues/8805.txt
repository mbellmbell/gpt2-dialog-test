"__BEATLES__ Who is your all-time favorite band?"
"__BEATLES__ It would have to be the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, I love them, too! What's your favorite album?"
"__BEATLES__ Rubber Soul. Such great songs - especially 'Day Tripper' and 'We Can Work It Out'."
"__BEATLES__ That's just when they were starting to transcend their teenybopper pop roots. I prefer their later, more psychedelic stuff like Sgt. Pepper's."
"__BEATLES__ I enjoy that, too, but some of that stuff is too far out there for me. I like the songs where Lennon and McCartney seem to work together well."
"__BEATLES__ Everyone always talks about Lennon and McCartney, but George was great, too."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, he had a really strong solo career. Not as strong as John's, but stronger than Paul's, in my opinion."
"__BEATLES__ Did you know there was a 'Fifth Beatle', their producer, George Martin."
"__BEATLES__ I think I read that once. He was a master, too!"
