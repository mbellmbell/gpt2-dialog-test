"__MOVIES__ When did the movie 'Titanic' come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I want to say 1996-1997."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds about right."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure there were other Titanic movies though."
"__MOVIES__ No, that is the one I was thinking of."
"__MOVIES__ Why are you asking?"
"__MOVIES__ No particular reason.  I just remember seeing it in the theatre and couldn't remember when it came out."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah.  I saw it in the theatre too."
"__MOVIES__ I think everyone our age saw it in the theatre."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everyone wanted to see Leonardo DiCaprio."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much.  It was too long though."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember it being long, but I know when it plays on TV I can't sit through it."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I had a favorite part.  I liked seeing how big the ship was though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was really awesome."
"__MOVIES__ They must have done a lot of research to recreate the whole ship."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm sure it wasn't all recreated."
"__MOVIES__ What did you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean they used stages and stuff.  It's not like they recreated a boat."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I see what you are saying."
