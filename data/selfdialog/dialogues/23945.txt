"__SUPERHERO__ What was your favorite Batman movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ For me, the original one with Tim Burton was always the best."
"__SUPERHERO__ Out of the original ones, I would agree with you.  If we're talking all of them, The Dark Knight."
"__SUPERHERO__ Hard to argue that.  That movie pretty much had it all."
"__SUPERHERO__ But you'd still prefer the first one?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah.  Just had some charm to it as it was a superhero movie before they stared making them all the time."
"__SUPERHERO__ I get it.  It's hard to believe it came out almost 30 years ago."
"__SUPERHERO__ Are you serious?  Am I really that old?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Want me to really answer that question?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, please don't.  Can't believe it was that long ago."
