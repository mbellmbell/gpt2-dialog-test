"__MUSIC__ Do you like Drop Kick Murphies?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're ok.  I'm not a huge hard rock fan but I'll listen."
"__MUSIC__ I'm the same way.  But these guys are awesome in concert."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  How so?"
"__MUSIC__ They are just all over the place, very crowd friendly."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty cool.q"
"__MUSIC__ They also make the concert feel intimate.  They talk to the crowd a lot and are really down to earth and play hard."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds awesome."
"__MUSIC__ The only thing is they like to give smaller bands a try, at least that's what I heard."
"__MUSIC__ So no mega concert I guess."
"__MUSIC__ No not really, when I went they were awesome but everyone else was just meh."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad."
"__MUSIC__ Not really, shows you that you can come in last minute.  Oh I almost forgot, I had floor seats!"
"__MUSIC__ How did you get those?!"
"__MUSIC__ A girl had them and took me on a date."
"__MUSIC__ Man you're lucky."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was what I called the most Boston weekend of my life."
"__MUSIC__ How is that?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to a Drop Kick Murphies concert on St. Paddy's day weekend on a warm day after a snow storm and before another snow storm at Boston Univeristy."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that would qualify as an extremely Boston weekend."
