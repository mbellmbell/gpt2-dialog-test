"__BEATLES__ Their debut album please please me was released by Parlophone which was founded in Germany, actually"
"__BEATLES__ Yep, it started in the great britain as a jazz label in 1920s"
"__BEATLES__ Kinda funny how that's now EMI"
"__BEATLES__ Well, companies merge all the time. But EMI's label manager George MArtin is the one who signed the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ You know what they shold've done?"
"__BEATLES__ What theyshould've done... about... what?"
"__BEATLES__ They shold've released 'I saw her standing there' as the single."
"__BEATLES__ I was gonna say 'Love me do,' but ok."
"__BEATLES__ That's good too, but 'Please please me' is ranked lower than 'I saw her standing there'"
"__BEATLES__ Rolling stones rankings meaningless. It's a popularity contest. That's all."
