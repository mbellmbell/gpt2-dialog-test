"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Logan Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh God yes I have!  It was amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I thought it was the best X-men movie to date."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, although Days of Future Past was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was, but not quite to Logan standards."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think Logan was better than Deadpool?"
"__MOVIES__ No way, Deadpool had everything. However, I do  think it was better told."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the story was better but Deadpool is just hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wish they did a crossover between the 2."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they do that in the comics a lot and it is usually pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Sadly, with Jackman retiring from Wolverine, that won't happen"
"__MOVIES__ I know!  It makes me sad."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  But Oh well, maybe they will recast him."
"__MOVIES__ I hope not!  Jackman is Wolverine"
"__MOVIES__ No doubt!  Have you seen the extended scenes in Logan"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't.  Where did you watch them?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw them on YouTube.  But I am sure they will be on the DVD"
"__MOVIES__ I'll certainly buy the DVD when it comes out."
"__MOVIES__ Oh me to.  I have all the other movies already."
"__MOVIES__ Dang, you really are a fan!"
