"__MOVIES__ Do you think the American Pie franchise jumped the shark?"
"__MOVIES__ Anytime you have a right to home dvd release, yes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Eugene Levy whored himself out for all of the films."
"__MOVIES__ Poor guy doesnt get many roles."
"__MOVIES__ But none of the other main cast bothered to do any of those straight to release DVDs movies."
"__MOVIES__ They thought they could start a franchise like National Lampoon."
"__MOVIES__ I am sure there are people who are rabid fans of it that watched all of them."
"__MOVIES__ It stinks because movies like that become caricatures of themselves."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the last one with the main cast?"
"__MOVIES__ I did and thought it wasnt that good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was too long in between and the jokes and situations did not seem plausible."
"__MOVIES__ Jason Biggs still couldnt be that awkward with women."
"__MOVIES__ And Stifler couldnt be that much of a hormone driven guy much more."
"__MOVIES__ You never know there are those types."
"__MOVIES__ But has any of them actually done anything since the initial release?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, Sean William Scott did Role Models which was a great comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, its up there I forgot about that."
"__MOVIES__ I dont know who else did movies though."
"__MOVIES__ I cant remember Jason Biggs wife but she was in TV"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she was, How I met Your Mother."
