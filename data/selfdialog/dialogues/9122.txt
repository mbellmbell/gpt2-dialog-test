"__BASEBALL__ Thats always been how it is."
"__BASEBALL__ I dont think you are understanding me."
"__BASEBALL__ I am, you are saying they are locking guys up."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, so theyre cheaper."
"__BASEBALL__ Not really, arbitration years are usually inexpensive."
"__BASEBALL__ Well you dont have to pay the premium at 23."
