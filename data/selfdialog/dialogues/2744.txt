"__MUSIC__ Do you remember Duran Duran?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember? Why do I need to remember?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they are kind of an ancient group.They were hot in like the 80s, dude."
"__MUSIC__ And so? That's a golden era. Duran Duran are in my 'Girls Just Wanna Have FunTime Party Mix' at least twice. Maybe four times."
"__MUSIC__ Okay okay, don't have a hernia about it. I didn't mean to disrespect your New Romantic boy toys."
"__MUSIC__ Please. Gag me. But I do have that mix on every device I own. I hear Duran Duran like six times a week on average."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa. Committed, you are."
"__MUSIC__ Talk like Yoda, you do. What's up with that, supergeek? Anyway, what were you gonna say?"
"__MUSIC__ About Star Wars?"
"__MUSIC__ No idiot. Duran Duran."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. I was just going through some old stuff my mom saved for me the other day."
"__MUSIC__ Oh hell. Did you find the burn book? Literally. Burn it. I might want to be a Congresswoman like Maxine Waters some day..."
"__MUSIC__ No, fool. What does that have to do with D2? Jeez."
"__MUSIC__ D2? Bwahahahahahahahahaha. MY New Romantic boyfriends, eh? Okay fiiiiine."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever. Anyway I was digging through my old crap and I found this poster of them I used to have on my wall."
"__MUSIC__ Okay and? Is it worth a thousand dollars or something?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it just made me feel kind of funny. All jokes aside we BOTH crushed hard on those dudes. But in this poster they were like. Rocking full makeup."
"__MUSIC__ Oh hell yeah I remember that! Net half-shirts and bangles too! Their lips were glossier than ours, dude. So what? Were we like, gay back then?"
"__MUSIC__ No. No, I don't think so. I think we were lulled by the safety of ambiguous sexuality as our bodies slowly awakened to the possibility of carnal desire, yet we still knew that we were, to paraphrase Britney Spears, 'not girls but not yet women.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh. Deep. Okay make sense to me. Let's get a slice of pizza dude. This pontificating has made me peckish."
