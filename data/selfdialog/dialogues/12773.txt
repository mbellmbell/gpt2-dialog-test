"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, you thinking of attending any NFL games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah! I was thinking of going to a Rams vs. Seahawks game. You know those always end up pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think Goff will do with a new head coach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should do pretty good this season! Mcvay is said to be an offensive guru."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, i mean look at the Redskins in the past seasons, he made kirk cousins looks like an all star."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about you? Thinking of flying out to NY to catch a giants game this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, i want to. Eli is getting older and i want to catch him which hes still doing well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think they can win the division this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think Dak and Zeke will his a sophmore slump, Redskins lost their offensive mind to your Rams, and Phily is a joke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, we will see. I can see Dak taking a step back now that teams have studied him some, but not Zeke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see. Dallas DOES have a pretty good line, any half decent back can get a 1000 yard season runnning behind them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of good lines, Lynch to Oakland might be pretty good to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that should be pretty fun to watch. Oakland has probably the best line in the league right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, you have a well rested beast of a running back playing for his hometown. Talk about motivation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously. You think they'll win it all before they move to Las Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might. They have one of the best offenses in the league right now, and they have the defensive MVP mack so they might."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, that MVP was robbed from Von Miller."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you know how the league works, I think that Miller was slightly better but Mack got it because of the team records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably true, but Oakland looks lethal and could win it all next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they finally got some playoff experience last season, and i hope they lose again in their first round this season."
