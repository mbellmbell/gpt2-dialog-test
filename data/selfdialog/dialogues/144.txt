"__MUSIC__ Who's the best lead singer for Val Halen?"
"__MUSIC__ Is that even really a question?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it is."
"__MUSIC__ It's obviously David Lee Roth."
"__MUSIC__ Based on what?"
"__MUSIC__ Because he's the original guy who set the tone for their whole career."
"__MUSIC__ But Sammy has a better tone and voice that David."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but there's more that just vocal talent involved here."
"__MUSIC__ Really, like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Like personality and charisma."
"__MUSIC__ I think Sammy wins there too."
"__MUSIC__ I disagree, look who sang the biggest hits."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, but Sammy had some big ones too."
"__MUSIC__ Those may have never happened without David leading the way earlier."
"__MUSIC__ David really didn't lead them, he depended totally on the brothers."
"__MUSIC__ But he had solo hits too."
"__MUSIC__ That never would have happened without his stint with Val Halen."
"__MUSIC__ At least we agree that the best wasn't that other guy."
"__MUSIC__ I'm still trying to forget about him."
"__MUSIC__ Truth, we agree again."
