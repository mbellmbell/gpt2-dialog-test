"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are there any NFL teams you route against?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I didn't take you as that much of a hardcore fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more of a casual fan: I watch when it's on, but I don't care too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you root against?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants, the Jets, the Steelers, and the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why those?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants and Jets because in every sport I root against New York-based teams. That and I hate Eli Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why the Steelers? You're from Pennsylvania."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, the eastern side. Born a Philly fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they're not even the same conference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but Big Ben is a horrible person who has been involved in accidents and a heck of a lot of sexual assaults."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's sketchy. So why America's team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Precisely that. The arrogance of calling themselves America's team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You probably hate the Super Bowl, then right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because the winner is the World Champion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I HATE THAT SO MUCH."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, I know you would."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ American pro sports and arrogance go together so well, don't they. Especially the NFL."
