"__COMEDY__ What do you think is funny the hangover or bridesmaids?"
"__COMEDY__ Hangover is my favorite of all time."
"__COMEDY__ I liked hangover and hangover part 2, but thought overall bridesmaids may have been better."
"__COMEDY__ No way. I think bridesmaids was great don't get me wrong. But Hangover had so many great moments."
"__COMEDY__ Zach Galifianakis does shine in hangover. I did like the plot of the first one. The sequel I did not enjoy as much."
"__COMEDY__ I enjoyed them both. I think they did a great job a lot of sequels bomb badly or can't live up to the first. I think the second is just as good."
"__COMEDY__ It is a matter of opinion I guess, I still says bridesmaid is funnier than both hangovers."
"__COMEDY__ Melissa mccartney stood out to me in bridesmaids."
"__COMEDY__ She is really funny in it, my favorite is when she is on the plane and lifts her leg."
"__COMEDY__ That is a great moment. I was surprised she could get her leg up so high. She has lost a lot of weight since then, typical of hollywood."
