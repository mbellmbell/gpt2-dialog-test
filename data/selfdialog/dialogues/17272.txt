"__MOVIES__ Are there any upcoming movies you're excited about?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, definitely. Maybe this is unexpected, but I'm ready to see War for the Planet of the Apes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I hadn't even thought about that one."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think most people have. It's a series that has sort of flown under the radar."
"__MOVIES__ What's exciting about this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it really develops the story in new ways and fills it in. Plus, Woody Harrelson is entering the story and that's exciting."
"__MOVIES__ That's really neat."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm excited for it. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm waiting for Dunkirk."
"__MOVIES__ You're a history buff?"
"__MOVIES__ Usually I'm not. But I was recently reading a novel that references Dunkirk, and it has got me interested."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anything in particular about the historical aspect that you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Dunkirk in particular was such an improbable and heroic event. It lends well to treatment in a movie."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose it does. It was particularly scary for the British, wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was. That, plus I think the historical genre has gotten far better in recent years, with movies like The Founder, Jackie, and Free State of Jones."
"__MOVIES__ Those were certainly interesting movies, whether or not they had financial success."
"__MOVIES__ They were interesting, but unfortunately you're correct that they weren't always so successful."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that is?"
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't say. People seem to lose interest in these stories."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. Thank you for the chat."
