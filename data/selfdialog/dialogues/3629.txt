"__MUSIC__ So, have you ever heard of pop punk ?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  It sounds a little stupid though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know it 'sounds' stupid, but it was kind of the music of my time.  It doesn't sound too bad when you realize that some people call it 'emo'."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I remember emo."
"__MUSIC__ Most people think emo was just 'Dashboard Confessional', but pretty much all the bands of that time were 'emo' or 'pop punk'."
"__MUSIC__ I remember liking 'Hot Hot Heat' and a couple other songs from that time period."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it wasn't bad time period.  It just got crippled with the label emo."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of wish that had got more into what real punk was you know, rebellion."
"__MUSIC__ You know that isn't fair.  People think punk was about rebellion, but it really wasn't."
"__MUSIC__ What about Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten with their antics."
"__MUSIC__ They were just musicians.  Most of the punks were just hard working stiffs like you and me."
"__MUSIC__ I find that hard to believe.  How did they work with those haircuts ?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, most of those particular fans would grow a mohawk for months and shave it off for work the next week."
"__MUSIC__ Bunch of posers, then?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much.  You find the odd real one, but the vast majority were just wearing costumes."
"__MUSIC__ I mean looking back on it most of the punks in high school were just losers looking for attention."
"__MUSIC__ Yep."
"__MUSIC__ So you liked pop punk or emo a lot then ?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep.  It had the punk sound and I like that with less of the pretense."
"__MUSIC__ Word."
