"__ACTION__ Which Independence Day film did you like more? The orginial one released in 1996 or Independence Day: Resurgence, the one released in 2016?"
"__ACTION__ I liked them both a lot! The newest one is a sequel to the orginial, so the story line pretty much picked up where the first one left off."
"__ACTION__ You're correct but I can't help but feel more of an attachment to the first one."
"__ACTION__ Well I think the orginal film had much better acting and didn't have as much CGI as the second one but I'm a sucker for these types of films."
"__ACTION__ Do you remember President Whitmore's motivating speech in the first movie?"
"__ACTION__ Which the speech? The speech at the air base before the final assualt on the alien mothership?"
"__ACTION__ Yup that's the one! Bill Pullman's speech is actually considered one of the best actor monologues of all time."
"__ACTION__ Ha! In my acting class last semester I actually had to perform a monologue and chose this exact monologue for my presentation."
"__ACTION__ How does the monologue start?"
"__ACTION__ 'Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in this history of mankind.' Just writing it gives me chills! Imagine what would be going through your mind, knowing the fate of mankind rest on your shoulders. Bill Pullman is a great actor."
