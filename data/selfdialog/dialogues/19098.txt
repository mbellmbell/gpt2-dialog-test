"__MOVIES__ I know you're a big comedy fan. Which comedy have you watched the most times?"
"__MOVIES__ Dumb and Dumber. It's so hilarious and ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ It's been awhile since I saw that one. What's your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe when Harry uses the broken toilet. Immature humor I know, but I watched that scene over and over."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good part! There's so many funny moments though, it's hard to choose."
"__MOVIES__ I also like when Lloyd is walking around wearing that ridiculous hat. It cracked me up!"
"__MOVIES__ I think for me it's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. I could never watch it enough times."
"__MOVIES__ I love that one too, the cat getting electrocuted, Clark's tirade at the end, it's a classic. I also like the original Vacation."
"__MOVIES__ Clark Griswold getting all misty-eyed when he's stranded in the attic watching home movies is my favorite part."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that too, Clark's such a great character. What other comedies are among your favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ Animal House with John Belushi, Caddyshack with Bill Murray and Chevy Chase, and Blazing Saddles with Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a big fan of Caddyshack, it has its moments but overall it's disappointing to me."
"__MOVIES__ Really? You don't like Rodney Dangerfield and his one liners or Ted Knight's stuffiness?"
"__MOVIES__ I do like those, but overall the movie is not that funny to me. Blazing Saddles, that's a classic though."
"__MOVIES__ We can look past Caddyshack. Yes Blazing Saddles was hilarious but could never be made today."
"__MOVIES__ That's true and I understand why but it's also disappointing in a way because it was some really good comedy."
"__MOVIES__ What recent comedies are some of your favorites? Bridesmaids was good and I liked The Hangover movies."
"__MOVIES__ Wow I thought you said recent. The Hangover was made in 2009 and Bridesmaids was made in 2011."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any recent good ones you would suggest? Also, do you think there are not as many good ones these days?"
"__MOVIES__ This is the End from 2013 and 21 Jump Street from 2012, but I guess those aren't too recent either. I think they don't make as many good movies as they used to."
