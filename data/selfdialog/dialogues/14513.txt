"__HORROR__ Bye Bye Man was the worst Horror movie I've ever seen!"
"__HORROR__ Oh yeah that movie was terrible, completely unoriginal and not to mention boring."
"__HORROR__ Yeah totally, I saw Lights out though and though that was really good."
"__HORROR__ Definitely, that one was really scary, by the same guy who made the Conjuring movies right?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah I think so."
"__HORROR__ Conjuring two was pretty good I thought, did you see it?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah I liked it a lot, thought the monster looked a little cheesy though."
"__HORROR__ Yeah I think so too, the nun wasn't very scary looking. I liked the voice when the girl was possessed a lot though."
"__HORROR__ Yeah that was pretty creepy."
"__HORROR__ Still, I thought the first one was a little better."
