"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which do you think was better? Illmatic or Reasonable Doubt?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Reasonable Doubt, of course."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You didn't like the classic Illmatic? With the beats by Premier and everyone?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not saying that I didn't like Illmatic, but Jay's delivery on Reasonable Doubt was timeless."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Okay, so what exactly made Reasonable Doubt so good to you?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I loved the innocence of Jay-Z and how his perspective was so young and hungry."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can definitely feel that, especially on Can I Live and Regrets."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Also, Dead Presidents, Brooklyn's Finest, so many tracks."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Illmatic had fire too. But I can see more consistency with Reasonable Doubt now that you say that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, that's exactly what Reasonable Doubt had: consistency."
