"__DISNEY__ My students are obsessed with the Disney movie Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah? I feel out of touch, I know nothing about it."
"__DISNEY__ Well, this is one of the benefits of teaching. You stay hip to the young people stuff."
"__DISNEY__ That's 100% true. What's Frozen all about?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't actually know, but they're obsessed with one of the songs from the soundtrack."
"__DISNEY__ Would I know it?"
"__DISNEY__ Possibly. It's called 'Let It Go' and it repeats that refrain many times."
"__DISNEY__ That's honestly not ringing a bell."
"__DISNEY__ You'll have to visit my classroom sometime soon."
"__DISNEY__ Only if you're screening Disney movies!"
