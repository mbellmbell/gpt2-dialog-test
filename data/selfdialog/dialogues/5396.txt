"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Star Wars: Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked it, and how it ties in to the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do too, especially how it ends right where Episode 4 starts."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the ending with Darth Vader wrecking those resistance fighters was great."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like that ending the best out of all of the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think so, except for the ending of Empire Strikes back."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like that one too, but Rogue One was so good!"
"__STAR_WARS__ K2SO was my favorite droid out of all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, his literal, sarcastic tone is hilarious."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love Alan Tudyk, the man who does K2SO's voice."
