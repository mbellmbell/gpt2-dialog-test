"__MOVIES__ Did you see the Lego Batman Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It was really great."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too. It was cool how they included tons of 'Easter eggs' for Batman fans."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked that as well. They included elements from all sorts of Batman related media."
"__MOVIES__ Totally true. They incorporated the comic books, movies, and even the 60's TV Show."
"__MOVIES__ That was less surprising than including a brief reference from the 1930's serials."
"__MOVIES__ It was awesome to see all of the Batman characters and villains in Lego form on the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you don't realize the sheer volume of imagination that has gone into the decades of the Batman Universe."
"__MOVIES__ Getting to see it on screen all at one time is surely an impressive thing to see."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I thought it was great."
"__MOVIES__ The Lego movies in general have all been good. I really liked the original The Lego Movie as well."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Both the movies created these great immersive worlds that totally fit with the toys they are based on but provided great, fun story lines as well."
"__MOVIES__ It helps that the toys themselves are so versatile and conducive to creativity."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. The whole 'master builder' idea that is represented in both movies is pretty much defined by the toys the movies are based on."
"__MOVIES__ Well, really the whole physics and boundaries of the worlds are pretty much defined by the Lego toys that comprise them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess that's true, but it does make for an interesting reality to set a movie plot into."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think it's part of why these movies work so well."
"__MOVIES__ Right, although the stories in both movies are pretty solid as well."
"__MOVIES__ Both movies just hit well on so many levels."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they cater to kids, fans of the Lego toys, fans of comic books and a variety of other entertainment media. They're both just really good movies."
