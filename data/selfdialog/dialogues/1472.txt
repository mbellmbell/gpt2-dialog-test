"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to religious themed music?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean, like at church?"
"__MUSIC__ It could be during a religious ceremony, but there is religious music sung outside of worship services."
"__MUSIC__ I used to sing in a church choir when I was a boy, but haven't listened to too much religious music recently."
"__MUSIC__ I was curious because I think it's interesting how religion and music pair together."
"__MUSIC__ How do you think they pair together?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, music is very much something that can stir the emotions. And the concept of religious faith is one that touches on emotion as well."
"__MUSIC__ I can sort of see where you're coming from."
"__MUSIC__ It's like, feeling the bliss of connecting with a higher power, and the feeling of listening to an achingly beautiful song."
"__MUSIC__ So you're saying that music can enhance that feeling?"
"__MUSIC__ Or even create it in the first place, sure."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard the song 'Amazing Grace'?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, that's a classic song."
"__MUSIC__ It's a beautiful song, and also one that has religious concepts within it."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely."
"__MUSIC__ I think that good religious music is like good music of any kind, in a sense."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ If it's really good, it transports you into an emotional or mental state that is elevated."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I suppose it does."
