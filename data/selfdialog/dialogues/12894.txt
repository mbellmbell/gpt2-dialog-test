"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for football season to start."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting. They'll have to keep Big Ben healthy for once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. I also think the Packers can win the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think that they have a good enough defense to make it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it needs to be better but they do have Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He always gives you a chance. What do you think about the Falcons?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would be your sleeper?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would pick the Broncos."
