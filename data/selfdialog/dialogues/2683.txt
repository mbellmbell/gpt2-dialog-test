"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you ever heard of Tool?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them but haven't really listened to them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh well you should really check them out, they're a great band."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ Progressive rock.  It's some really interesting music."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm.  Give me a song recommendation."
"__MUSIC__ Start off with something like 'Sober' or 'Vicarious.'  They're awesome songs but still pretty mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'll definitely check it out.  How long have they been around for?"
"__MUSIC__ Tool has been a band for years now.  The lead singer is Maynard James Keenan, and he has two other bands also."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  What are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Puscifer and A Perfect Circle."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool.  Are they the same genre?"
"__MUSIC__ No, A Perfect Circle is a bit lighter than tool and Puscifer is hard to classify."
"__MUSIC__ Would you recommend these bands too?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh definitely.  If Tool is too hard for you, try A Perfect Circle.  They're a lot more melodic."
"__MUSIC__ Okay great, I'm definitely more into melodic music."
"__MUSIC__ You don't be disappointed with A Perfect Circle then.  They make beautiful music."
"__MUSIC__ What song do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Try '3 Libra's.'  It's a popular song and quite beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ Okay great, I'll check it out.  Thanks!"
