"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, are you a Steelers fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, I don't mind them but I wouldn't say I'm a fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like Ben Rothlisberger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Big Ben, too. He's a heck of a quarterback at times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess they resigned Le'Veon Bell to a long contract."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was hoping he would go somewhere else. They're always hard to beat when he plays well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how the Cincinnati Bengals are going to do this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the same as every year. Play great during the season, beat teams they shouldn't be able to beat, lose to teams they should be able to beat and then lose in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny. Different year, same story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Andy Dalton just never gets any better. He looks great and then folds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can think of a lot of quarterbacks who are like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, like Ryan Fitzpatrick. He looks as good as anyone and then look like a really bad rookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I totally agree with you. I wonder what the Jets are going to do for a quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. They have a couple young quarterbacks but I don't know how good they are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just looked it up. They have Josh McCown too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least he has some experience. That will help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm surprised they didn't go for Colin Kaepernick or Jay Cutler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I can understand. There's too much baggage with Kaepernick and Jay Cutler is not a team player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're probably right. Cutler is going to call games, isn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess they couldn't resist his great personality."
