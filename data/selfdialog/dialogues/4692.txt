"__MUSIC__ Do you know what instruments are in a marching band?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of them, why?"
"__MUSIC__ I was just wondering if you'd like to learn about the different instrument families?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually I would. Can you teach me?"
"__MUSIC__ You bet! There are technically three groups of instruments in a marching band."
"__MUSIC__ What are they called?"
"__MUSIC__ The first is called the woodwind section."
"__MUSIC__ Is that like trumpets and flutes?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the flute is a member of the woodwind family but the trumpet isn't."
"__MUSIC__ Why not? They are both made out of silver and you blow air in them to make a sound."
"__MUSIC__ That is partly true, but trumpets use a mouthpiece which requires you to buzz your lips together to get the sound."
"__MUSIC__ So what else is in the woodwind family?"
"__MUSIC__ Clarinets, saxophones, and piccolos belong in the woodwind family. They all use air but you don't buzz your lips to get the sound."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so what is the name of the family that trumpets belong to?"
"__MUSIC__ That is the brass family. It consists of trumpets, trombones, euphoniums, horns, and tubas."
"__MUSIC__ Is there anything else in that family?"
"__MUSIC__ Not in a marching band unless they have the type of tuba that wraps around your body. That is called a Sousaphone."
"__MUSIC__ It's named after John Phillip Sousa the composer right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes it is. Do you know what the final group is called?"
"__MUSIC__ It is called percussion because you hit the instrument with a stick or mallet. That's my favorite group!"
