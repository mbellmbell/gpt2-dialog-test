"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite, non jedi/sith character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, I would have to say boba fett. He was a real badass."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, whats your favorite then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Mine would be R2D2. I love how all he can do is make noises. I think he is just funny."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, interesting. He plays a big role in helping jedi very much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah he really does, and I feel like a lot of it goes unappreciated."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was definitely the best droid in the entire series, that's for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I liked him a lot more than C-3PO because C-3PO talked way too much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, he did, and to make it worse he was always insulting R2D2 and making him look bad."
