"__MOVIES__ A David O Russel production. She sells a self wringing mop as her first product"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wait I think I remember this one. Is Bradley Cooper in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ Ah okay. I heard about it, but never saw it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a pretty good one. Good message the end."

"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but does a good job of showing all her challenges in between"
"__MOVIES__ Does she marry Cooper?"
