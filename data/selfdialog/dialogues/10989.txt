"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been to an NFL game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I haven't. Have you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, a few. Why haven't you gone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate crowds, I hate drunk rednecks yelling, I hate the lack of space, the body heat..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Geez, quit hating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ...the cheap beer, the anti-craft beer culture, the fact that they get fined when they score a touchdown, the parking..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, I get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what was your experience like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We had really good seats in the 30 yard line, about halfway in the bottom section."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great view?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Spectacular!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, big question: how much were the tickets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ $150 each."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See, that's another reason why I don't go. I like not going bankrupt watching a bunch of spoiled children play a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where do you watch the NFL then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rarely will I go to a bar. Usually at my home or a friends'. Small and quiet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the stadiums are nothing like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus don't they take about an hour to leave?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Depends, but yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love watching NFL games, but I love peace and quiet more."
