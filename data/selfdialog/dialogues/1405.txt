"__MUSIC__ The first, I'd say, is Rollin: The Ballad of Big and Rich."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that is a a good one. What would be your second choice."
"__MUSIC__ That would have to be Save a Horse, RIde a Cowboy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that one is a pretty good song."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is. But my third favorite Big and Rich song would have to be Comin' to Your City."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that the one with the really weird music video?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Aliens, Marilyn Manson cameo, and the midgets."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, weird as anything. Anymore Big and Rick songs you particularly like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I do like Between Rasing Hell and Amazing Grace pretty well."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not familiar with that one, or I've forgotten it. Does it have a music video."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is set up like a Western movie."
"__MUSIC__ Really, what happens."
"__MUSIC__ Big Kenny plays a drunk preacher in Western town, who helps a wounded gunfighter, played by John Rich."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it seems to fit the song pretty well, theme wise."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they wind up having a shootout with the men hunting for John and Kenny helps him win."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, looks like I'll be looking for that one on Youtube."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's there and it's a bit long, so don't try to watch it between comerical breaks or such."
