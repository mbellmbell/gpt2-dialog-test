"__FASHION__ Which dress do you think I should get? The pink one, or the blue one?"
"__FASHION__ Depends where you plan to wear them."
"__FASHION__ How'd you mean?"
"__FASHION__ Well, I wouldn't wear a pink dress to a chinese take-out; I love the stuff, I'd probably make a mess of the dress."
"__FASHION__ I see what you mean, it could get stains on it."
"__FASHION__ Right. Also, what where you thinking of wearing with them?"
"__FASHION__ Well, I thought with the blue one I might wear brogues; and the pink one, trainers."
"__FASHION__ I meant in terms of, say, a cardigan; or..."
"__FASHION__ Oh, of course. Well, I'm not certain, then. Maybe a poncho?"
"__FASHION__ A poncho?... With which dress?"
"__FASHION__ With either dress."
"__FASHION__ Oh dear."
"__FASHION__ ''Oh dear?'' What's that supposed to mean?"
"__FASHION__ Well, I don't think those items would suit one another well."
"__FASHION__ That response is a little more muted compared to your initial reaction. Do you doubt my fashion sense?"
"__FASHION__ Well, yes; honestly."
"__FASHION__ I can't believe this. I thought we were friends."
"__FASHION__ We are, I'm just being honest with you."
"__FASHION__ Well you could have been a little nicer about it. You know I like to make a statement in my fashion choices."
"__FASHION__ Yes, yes. I know. Well what are friends for?"
