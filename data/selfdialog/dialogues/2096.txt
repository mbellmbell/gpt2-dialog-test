"__MUSIC__ I think I really like Beyonce, do you?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she's alright. What is your favorite song she's done?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I think I really like stuff from the Lemonade album."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. That album just blew my mind."
"__MUSIC__ Well it was a visual masterpiece as well. Did you see the last track where she's dressed in a turban?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. That was amazing. What about the one where Serena Williams was in the video?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I loved that! Did you know Saturday Night Live did a parody of that?"
"__MUSIC__ No way. What was it about?"
"__MUSIC__ It was about Melania Trump as Beyonce and she was saying 'bye' to Donald Trump. It was so funny."
"__MUSIC__ There have been other parodies of Beyonce's Lemonade album. Do you watch 'Unbreakable' on Netflix?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Why did Beyonce make an appearance on there?"
"__MUSIC__ No. The guy who lives with Kimmy pretended to be Beyonce when he broke up with his boyfriend."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! I think I saw something about that. He was wearing a yellow dress and carrying a baseball bat just like Beyonce!"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. It was really good."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think her marriage to Jay Z will last?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. That whole album was supposed to be about his cheating."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's sad. But they seemed to have made up."
"__MUSIC__ Yes and she is pregnant again."
"__MUSIC__ I know! Can you believe it? I guess she's pregnant with twins."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and if they turn out looking like Beyonce they're going to be gorgeous."
