"__THRILLER__ So I recently tried to reanalyze 'No Country for Old Men' and I must say the film is truley a piece of art."
"__THRILLER__ You have to give praise where praise is due and the Cohen Brothers deserve every bit of it for that movie."
"__THRILLER__ The Cohen brothers followed the orginial book almost to a T with the screenplay, a lot of the literary stuff in the film comes straight from the book."
"__THRILLER__ Since you said you analyzed the film, could you tell me the importance of the coin?"
"__THRILLER__ The coinâ€™s purpose is interchangeable and it can be used as currency, a weapon, a lucky token, or even a a screwdriver."
"__THRILLER__ What's the point behind it though? You didn't answer my question."
"__THRILLER__ The point of the coin is there to portray the randomness of the entire film. Remember Chigurh? Well he used the coin as a weapon but remeber the scene where Anton uses a penny to remove some screws?"
"__THRILLER__ What does the coin have to do with Chigurh and Anton?"
"__THRILLER__ Anton Chigurh is seemingly the perfect tool, nothing stops him in his quest to do whatever it is he wants to do, but he still busted by nature and this proves he is a mortal man. The same is shown by the use of the coin, it can be used in a multitude of ways, but in the end the coin is still a coin."
"__THRILLER__ So the film attempts to prove the randomness and chaotic personality of nature. Got it."
