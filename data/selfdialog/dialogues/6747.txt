"__STAR_WARS__ Here's one thing I find confusing about the Star Wars franchise... well, one of several of things, really, but this is a big one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, what's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Clone Wars.  I mean, they've got a TWO series that were called The Clone Wars and a full length movie, and it's like, could they not come up with another title?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait, they had two series called Clone Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, one was like a series of five minute shows that aired on Cartoon Network before Revenge of the Sith came out.  They kind of bridged the gap between the last two prequel films."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, yeah, think I remember something about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the other, more well known, was a full half hour series done in computer animated graphics."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, my nephew used to watch that a lot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but the short one is called Star Wars: Clone Wars, and the longer series is called Star Wars: THE Clone Wars.  I mean, seriously?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I don't think they were very creative in the naming scheme there."
