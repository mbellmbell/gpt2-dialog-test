"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Meshuggah's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  What's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's 'The Violent Sleep of Reason'.  It came out last October."
"__MUSIC__ Okay.  Have you heard it?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah.  I like most of the tracks on the album."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  What does it sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it sounds like Koloss and Obzen, but more.. thrashy?"
"__MUSIC__ I get that.  What's you favorite track?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, definitely Clockworks, for sure.  It's the first track."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that you favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ It's an instant adrenaline rush for me; the song sets the tone for the entire album, and really gets you going."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to give it a listen sometime."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely.  You'll also probably like Born in Dissonance; it's the second track of the album."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Clockworks delivers really well on the instrumentals, but Jens Kidman kind of falls flat a bit on the vocals on the track."
"__MUSIC__ I see.  And Born in Dissonance is better?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely!  It's a tight, five-minute song that I have difficulty not listening to on repeat."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to give it a listen as well.  Really, the entire album is something I'll have to look into."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely.  I really think you'll enjoy it if you've enjoyed any Meshuggah album over the last few years."
"__MUSIC__ Cool.  Thanks for the recommendation!"
