"__DISNEY__ That Hunchback of Notre Dame movies was insane, but in a good way!"
"__DISNEY__ I remember that movies, I was also so scared to watch it when I was older."
"__DISNEY__ Same here! I watched it again recently and was amazed by the animations and songs."
"__DISNEY__ There was music in this film? I guess I was really scared."
"__DISNEY__ Yah there's this song called Hellfire in it, it might be Disney's greatest song."
"__DISNEY__ Are you sure. Better than Circle of Life, Tales as Old as Time, or Let it Go."
"__DISNEY__ Well anything is better than Let it Go but it is definitely up there,"
"__DISNEY__ I guess I will give it shot. I have heard similiar things from other people so it must be true."
"__DISNEY__ I swear you will love it! The music is the greatest and it does stay true to the source material."
"__DISNEY__ Fine! Your already convince me! I think it is on Netflix or something."
