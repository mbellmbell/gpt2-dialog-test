"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the Red Sox/Yankees game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I missed it!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh that's too bad! You missed a great game."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I'm sure. It's always interesting with that rivalry."
"__BASEBALL__ It definitely was last night. It went into extra innings."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh really? How many?"
"__BASEBALL__ They played seventeen innings."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, that's a long game. What was the score going into the seventeeth?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was zero-zero."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, well then maybe not such a good game. It sounds boring."
"__BASEBALL__ Not at all! There were several bases loaded, no out situations, but both teams managed to get out of them."
"__BASEBALL__ That's tough to do. Must have been good pitching!"
"__BASEBALL__ It was for sure."
"__BASEBALL__ So who finally won the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Red Sox ended up winning with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 17th."

"__BASEBALL__ What a lucky fan who managed to grab that ball!"
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely. I wish it was me."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too!"
