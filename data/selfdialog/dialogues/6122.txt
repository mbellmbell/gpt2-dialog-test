"__STAR_WARS__ I think Episode six is the best Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I think Episode five is the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just really like that final meeting between Luke and Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that is good, but I think the famous reveal in Episode five is better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh thats definitely a great scene, hard to choose between the two honestly."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but its a lot easier to compare the new trilogy don't you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh for sure, obviously Episode Three is the best of the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah agree with that, best lightsaber battles of all the Star Wars movies probably."
"__STAR_WARS__ No question, the end fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin is classic."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah That might be my overall favorite Star Wars fight."
