"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite animated movie."
"__MOVIES__ I love Spirited Away and all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies."
"__MOVIES__ I do too! I think Princess Mononoke is my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, yes, that is also a favorite of mine. All of his movies are my favorite!"
"__MOVIES__ The only one of his that I didnt like was Ponyo."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pointlessly weird and I felt the plot was weaker than his other films."
"__MOVIES__ I will agree it was weird, although I still liked it."
"__MOVIES__ I think Nausicaa is one of his best."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one also had a really strong message about environmental degradation."
"__MOVIES__ I tend to like the ones that have messages like that -- like Princess Mononoke."
"__MOVIES__ True, but I also like his more sweet and carefree movies, like My Neighbor Totoro."
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely. I love that one. I felt like Mei growing up, the crybaby little sister."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, she is very cute. I love how she falls asleep on Totoro."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Howl's Moving Castle?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That one was different, too. Good antiwar messages."
"__MOVIES__ It was actually based on a book by a British author."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didnt know that. Are his other films based on books?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Kiki's Delivery Service was based on a children's book."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's interesting! I love Kiki and her cat Jiji in that movie."
