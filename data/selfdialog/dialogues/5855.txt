"__STAR_WARS__ Do you remember in Empire when the Millennium Falcon was flying through the asteroids field?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was pretty intense. The odds were not good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well according to C-3PO"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but Han never cares about the odds"
"__STAR_WARS__ And remember they flew into that hole"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it turned out to be a massive worm hole"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the 'walls were collapsing'"
"__STAR_WARS__ But they turned out to be the jaws of some massive space creature."
"__STAR_WARS__ And then the Empire was using those bomber TIEs to try and weed them out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, those were pretty cool. Vader really wanted that ship."
