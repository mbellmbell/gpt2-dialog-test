"__BASEBALL__ What happened to the Kansas City Royals?"
"__BASEBALL__ Man they have really fell off of the wagon."
"__BASEBALL__ They went from being on top of the world, to being in the outhouse in less than 2 years."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that is a swift drop!"
"__BASEBALL__ Their pitching has really failed them this year and they are struggling to score runs"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the good thing is that they play in a weak division"
"__BASEBALL__ True. But when I watch this team I'm not convinced that they can be division winners."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know. Maybe they can make some deals at the trading deadline."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know if they are going to want to increase their current payroll."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right. They are a small market team who probably wants to trim that payroll"
"__BASEBALL__ It doesn't help that Yordano Ventura died in the offseason"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that really cast a black shadow on this organization."
"__BASEBALL__ They were really expecting him to be the future ace of their staff"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly. I don't know what there next move will be, but they need to do something."
"__BASEBALL__ If I were running that team, I would wait to see where the team is after the all-star break"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that way you can make a determination which direction to go"
"__BASEBALL__ Then your fanbase won't scream too loud if you start slashing payroll."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that's a really good point.  A lot of fans are knowledgeable about how this works."
"__BASEBALL__ From the penthouse to the outhouse in less than 2 years. Only in Kansas City!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, well at least they won a championship. No one can take that away!"
