"__MOVIES__ Do you like any Adam Sandler movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a fan of his, but I'll watch his movies every so often."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, do you have any favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess if I'd have to watch one of his movies right now, I'd watch Grown Ups."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that was a good one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, in that one Sandler wasn't as goofy as some of his characters are."
"__MOVIES__ Well, he is getting older."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but years ago, he always had that same kid of character."
"__MOVIES__ That wild crazy type of guy."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  In Grown Ups it was more toned down."
"__MOVIES__ You know who was funny in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ There were a lot of good actors.  Who did you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked Rob Schneider's character the best."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, he was so cringy!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, with that old lady for a wife."
"__MOVIES__ That was so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ David Spader's character was funny, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was funny too."
"__MOVIES__ I can't imagine how they were all friends."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know but the movie was funny."
