"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, that's a tough one! They are all amazing in their own way."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Come on, you have to pick one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, the earlier ones are more kid-like, and the later ones get progressively darker."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That didn't answer my question, haha."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, it depends on my mood. If I want something light I would pick Sorcerer's Stone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I get that, but say you have to pick one and only one, what is your answer."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Fine, okay then I would have to pick Goblet of Fire."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why Goblet?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, it is the turning point in the movies/books. Things get serious and when Voldemort comes back and Dumbledore sees him the story actually begins."
