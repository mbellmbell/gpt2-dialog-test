"__MUSIC__ You a melodic death metal fan?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a fan of normal death metal. What's melodic death metal?"
"__MUSIC__ It's death metal with more melodic guitar riffs and choruses."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I like the sound of that."
"__MUSIC__ You should really give it a listen. The instrumental work is always a treat to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Are the vocals the same?"
"__MUSIC__ Generally, yes. They can actually very between deep growls, mid range, and high pitched screams, too."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that sounds promising. Who should I check out?"
"__MUSIC__ I take it you're a bigger fan of lower range death growls?"
"__MUSIC__ That's about right. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Alright then. I'd say you should start with Amon Amarth."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me some more about them."
"__MUSIC__ Their music's lyrics focus heavily on Norse mythology. Their guitar work is very melodic also."
"__MUSIC__ And their vocals?"
"__MUSIC__ The vocalist uses mostly low range growls, with the occasional scream."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like familiar territory to me."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly why I recommended them. I figure you should like them."
"__MUSIC__ Any particular songs you'd like to recommend."
"__MUSIC__ Just one, and that's Twilight of the Thunder God.Listen to it as soon as you can."
"__MUSIC__ I'll look it up right now."
