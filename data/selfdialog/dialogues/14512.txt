"__HORROR__ Have you watched any of those horror movies I lent you yet?"
"__HORROR__ Yes I finally watched The Cabin in the Woods. Even after hearing about the movie that ending was a twist!"
"__HORROR__ I find that to be one of the best horror movies I ever watched. It was not predictable at all."
"__HORROR__ No, that movie defied all expectation. I really liked the part where they showed the panel of monsters they could choose from."
"__HORROR__ I know when I saw that panel and heard them taking bets from different teams all over the world I was really confused, but I wanted to know what was going on."
"__HORROR__ It did a good job explaining how the objects in the basement correlated to the different monsters. Using Dana to explain it while she figures it out herself was a good method."
"__HORROR__ Yes, they did a good job providing the information we needed to understand without being boring. What did you think when that zombie family came out to attack the kids in the beginning?"
"__HORROR__ That part was kind of predictable as soon as I heard the story they were reading. It just helped set it up to be even better when it went so far out of normal horror movie territory."
"__HORROR__ I sill do not quite understand how the ritual saves humanity, but I guess this time it didn't."
"__HORROR__ No, Marty and Dana refuse to finish the ritual so that is the end of the Facility, and I assume the world if their rules are correct."
