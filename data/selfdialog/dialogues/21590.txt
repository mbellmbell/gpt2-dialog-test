"__DISNEY__ What do you think about the new Tron remake?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's good, different from the original, but good."
"__DISNEY__ The graphics and animations are so much better than the original."
"__DISNEY__ Yes but bear in mind that the original was made in 1982. Back then the graphics were cutting edge."
"__DISNEY__ Imagine if that was you and were transported on to the grid!"
"__DISNEY__ It would be crazy, especially if you were riding around on those light cycles."
"__DISNEY__ Yes but you would also have the battle tanks after you!"
"__DISNEY__ What I don't understand is how did the power remain on at Flynn's Arcade for all that time in the Tron Legacy?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know... maybe his other business kept paying the bills."
"__DISNEY__ Probably!"
