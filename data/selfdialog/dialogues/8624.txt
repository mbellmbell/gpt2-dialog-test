"__BEATLES__ Do you believe it's been fifty years since Sgt Pepper"
"__BEATLES__ It was twenty years ago plus thirty I guess."
"__BEATLES__ Unbelievable. I guess it's my favorite Beatle's album."
"__BEATLES__ I like Revolver. Or Rubber Soul. Depends which week it is."
"__BEATLES__ They're my number two and three. Where's Pepper on your list?"
"__BEATLES__ Probably three or four. I have a soft spot for Help."
"__BEATLES__ Good album. I watched the movie the other week. Great music videos."
"__BEATLES__ So what's your favorite song on Pepper."
"__BEATLES__ Iguess Day in a Life. Maybe Fixing a Hole? You?"
"__BEATLES__ For the Benefit of Mr Kite there will be a show tonight..."
