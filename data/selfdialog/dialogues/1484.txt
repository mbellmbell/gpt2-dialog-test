"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any good music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I have, I've been listening to a lot of 8-bit music."
"__MUSIC__ What's that like?"
"__MUSIC__ It takes a lot of the old sounds from like Nintendo video games and makes music out of it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's really cool! What are some of the better artists that do 8-bit?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Dubmood a lot, but Bitshifter is also really good."
"__MUSIC__ Those are some interesting names. What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Dubmood does everything from classic 8-bit video game sounding stuff to club sounding songs."
"__MUSIC__ What does Bitshifter sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ They mainly do classic video game things, but in an interesting way."
"__MUSIC__ What's interesting about it?"
"__MUSIC__ They do it in a way where they make modern sounding music with only the older noises."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. Is it expensive to get into 8-bit music?"
"__MUSIC__ It can be as expensive as you want, you can use software and a keyboard though."
"__MUSIC__ What would be expensive about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Some artists go the extra mile and get original game systems that have those sounds in them and reprogram them to be instruments."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa, that must take a lot of dedication."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, especially since those machines aren't made anymore and are hard to find in good condition."
"__MUSIC__ I bet, I haven't seen any game machines older than a Nintendo DS in a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, though some people still hang on to them and know that people in 8-bit music could use them."
