"__MOVIES__ What is your take on all these new Sci-fi films?"
"__MOVIES__ There are a few supehero ones that are good, some of the other ones are not so great."
"__MOVIES__ Like the Martian?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I really did not get into that one at all. Interstellar was better, by far."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that movie played out well. Did you see the new Alien remake?"
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, yes so boring. I think they have done too many of those."
"__MOVIES__ Alien Vs. Predator was not so boring, did you like that one."
"__MOVIES__ No, I still think the old ones were way better."
"__MOVIES__ I think Sc-fi movies have really changed in recent years."
"__MOVIES__ They are more focused on making them more real I think . like they could happen. Unlike stuff like the Matrix."
"__MOVIES__ The Matrix was the best Sci-fi film ever made."
"__MOVIES__ The first one?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one, all of them as a whole. Masterpieces."
"__MOVIES__ You think so?I liked them. I do not think they were the best."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think was the best SCi-fi film then?"
"__MOVIES__ Excluding Star Wars, of course, I would say, Wall- E."
"__MOVIES__ You are joking."
"__MOVIES__ No, I think it was a really good science fiction."
"__MOVIES__ It was not even, it was a cartoon."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but the story was played well and it was written as a Sci-fi."
