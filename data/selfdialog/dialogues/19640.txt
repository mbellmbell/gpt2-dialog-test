"__MOVIES__ it was the worst in the X men series if you ask me."
"__MOVIES__ No way. it had the best special effects, great story line."
"__MOVIES__ Special effects are not the problem, it's the premise."
"__MOVIES__ Premise that 4 horsemen accompanies the Ancient God mutant? What's wrong with that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a stupid premise. Look at the horsemen what were they..."
"__MOVIES__ The dude with the wing,"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the flying guy who gets his wings replaced with some steel wing feather thing. How is he a Horseman of the apocalypse?"
"__MOVIES__ Because he can fly and shoot his steel feathers at people."
"__MOVIES__ That's so sophomoric."
"__MOVIES__ What about that chick with light saber arm? That chick was a bad ass."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe if the character was developed more. Though that's true of all the Horsemen. Really the only thing that was sort of bad ass was her jumping off the plane and landing using her light saber arm thing."
"__MOVIES__ And the egyptian girl and Magneto?"
"__MOVIES__ I still have no idea what value that egyptian girl brings to the whole genre."
"__MOVIES__ She's Storm. They just decided it to give it a Egyptian twist"
"__MOVIES__ See that's kinda retarded."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like anything about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Magneto was total bad ass. The whole premise that Earth contains magnetic materials and that magneto can harness that is terrifying."
"__MOVIES__ That was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ The way Jean walks out form the building floating in the air. that was good too."
"__MOVIES__ That was scary good. it felt like I was there looking up at her. Total bad ass."
