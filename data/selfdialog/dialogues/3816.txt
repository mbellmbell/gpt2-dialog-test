"__MUSIC__ How would you explain the evolution of music?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, we've gone from banging sticks together to classical music to electronic music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I understand now. That's an easy question to answer."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Let me hear it!"
"__MUSIC__ Music reflects society."
"__MUSIC__ That's it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the music made before the Industrial Revolution -- classical music -- was analog. Since that change, music has become machine-like."
"__MUSIC__ I see! Because our society became filled with the noise of factories, noise became incorported into art and music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's correct. Given this hypothesis, what would you predict to happen in music in the next 10 years?"
"__MUSIC__ It will become robotic!"
"__MUSIC__ That's correct! As robots start to surround us, the sounds of robots will be incorporated into music."
"__MUSIC__ I think there will be an even greater effect."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ The robots will make the music!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's going to be interesting."
"__MUSIC__ It's already happening! Much modern music is designed by software."
"__MUSIC__ Yet, humans will always make music. It's a really important way to communicate emotion."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I don't think robots will ever truly understand the power of music."
"__MUSIC__ They may make some music, but it will never sound quite right. Truly beautiful music requires a human touch."
