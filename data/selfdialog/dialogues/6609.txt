"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of the new Star Wars Trailer for the Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it looks amazing!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! I'm really hoping they finally reveal who Rey really is."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well if you notice in the Force Awakens, when Rey finds the lightsaber, its the voices of the old and young Obi Wan Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe shes actually realted to Obi Wan and not Skywalker like everyone thinks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or it could be both."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm also curious as to whats going on with Kylo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and what Supreme Leader Snoke is doing and who he actually is."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm just excited to see Mark Hamill-Luke Skywalker again!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hopefully this time he gets to actually say something."
