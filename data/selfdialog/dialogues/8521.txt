"__BEATLES__ Here's a good icebreaker: What's your favorite Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ OMG. I love them all. I couldn't name just one."
"__BEATLES__ But if you had to, what would it be?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, I really like 'Hey Jude'."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's a great one. Mine is 'Yesterday'."
"__BEATLES__ That's almost a standard. Definitely a classic."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I tend to like Paul's songs more than the others. Paul McCartney is a genius songwriter."
"__BEATLES__ He sure is. I think he got the short end of things when compositions were credited always as 'Lennon/McCartney'."
"__BEATLES__ I agree. Another favorite song of mine is 'Penny Lane'."
"__BEATLES__ That has Paul McCartney written all over it. Great choice."
