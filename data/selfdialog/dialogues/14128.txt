"__HORROR__ Have you ever seen The Blair Witch Project?"
"__HORROR__ I did. I saw it when it first came out in theaters actually."
"__HORROR__ How did you like it? Was it hard to watch?"
"__HORROR__ It really was. I literally couldn't stomach the shaky cam."
"__HORROR__ That's what made me hate it at first, but I started appreciating it upon subsequent viewing."
"__HORROR__ That's how it was with me. You see how terrifying it is after watching it a few times."
"__HORROR__ That's true. That's why I don't go into the woods to this day."
"__HORROR__ I believe that movie started the whole 'found footage' movie fascination."
"__HORROR__ You're right. That air of mystery and possibility of it being true really draws people."
"__HORROR__ I didn't know it wasn't real until the characters came out at the MTV movie awards!"
