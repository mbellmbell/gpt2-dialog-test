"__BEATLES__ I know you're a big fan of Paul McCartney, but what was your opinion of George Harrison?"
"__BEATLES__ I think he was very underrated to the group.  he was obviously not utilized to his fullest."
"__BEATLES__ Could you provide some specifics about why you feel like that? I'm interested, because he really showed his talents, mostly, after the group broke up."
"__BEATLES__ Exactly.  once the group broke up, Harrison really came into his own.  His concert for Bangla Desh, at Madison Square Garden, was one for the ages."
"__BEATLES__ Very true.  Now i'm not suggesting the Beatles totally forgot about his abilities.  Consider the 'Abbey Road' album; Harrison had two standouts on that one."
"__BEATLES__ Yes.  more than on any other Beatles album, Harrison really came through on that one.  'Here Comes the Sun' is outstanding, and 'Something' became a standard which many other artists, even Frank Sinatra, did versions of."
"__BEATLES__ After the group broke up, Harrison released his 'All Things Must Pass' album which almost forced people, who had previously overlooked him, to notice him."
"__BEATLES__ For sure.  with that album, which was either the first or second solo album of ANY of the Beatles, Harrison was established as a mega-talent.   I'm sure it was at that point that many people felt the Beatles had not used him as they should have."
"__BEATLES__ In a way i agree with that, but again, we have to keep in mind that basically it was Lennon and McCartney's group.  They had almost always given George one cut an album; no more, and no less (with the exception of 'Abbey Road,' as we mentioned).  It was obviously Harrison's role to be a great guitarist, sing background vocals, and leave the 'heavy lifting' to Paul and John."
"__BEATLES__ And to Harrison's great credit, i don't think he ever complained about that role.  Of course why would he complain? He made so much money as a member of the group, and he never had to feel the pressure of doing a lot of writing.  Yes, rest in peace George."
