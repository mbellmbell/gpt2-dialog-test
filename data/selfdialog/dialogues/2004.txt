"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite rap artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'd definitely say Drake is my favorite artist of all time. How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a really big fan of Lil Wayne and also Kid Cudi, they're both really great."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome, you have good taste! Is rap your favorite genre?"
"__MUSIC__ Rap is for sure my favorite genre. A close second would be hip hop or pop."
"__MUSIC__ Who's your favorite pop artist? I really like The Chainsmokers."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they've got some good stuff. And also Bruno Mars is awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I'm telling you! He had a song on the radio a while back and I could have sworn the first time hearing it that it was Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say he's this generation's Michael Jackson for sure. Do you like edm?"
"__MUSIC__ EDM is all right, some of the festivals are cool. I'll listen to Dubstep sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Dubstep was okay but it seems to be a trend that has passed. I'll also listen to some rock sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ What rock artists do you like? Classic or newer stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I like a few of the older artists like White Snake, The Eagles, and The Strokes. But I also like a few newer artists like Papa Roach and Muse."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I guess you could consider those 'new'. Comparatively I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely, I love them. Papa Roach puts on a very good live show."
"__MUSIC__ I've listened to some of The Strokes, but I've never listened to much Papa Roach beyond what I've heard on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Oh they're worth it, you should check out their newest album."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Avenged Sevenfold? They're one of my favorite rock artists."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love them! Great taste, their guitar riffs are insane."
"__MUSIC__ You've got that right. Man I do love their style."
