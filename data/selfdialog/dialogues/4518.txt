"__MUSIC__ Do you like Teddy?"
"__MUSIC__ Teddy who?"
"__MUSIC__ Teddy Pendergrass."
"__MUSIC__ Man of course. Teddy was my dude. I love his music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I like that one The More I get The More I Want."
"__MUSIC__ That's a classic. You know he's the panty-bull."
"__MUSIC__ What you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Women would be at his concerts and they would start throwing their panties onto the stage."
"__MUSIC__ That's 'cause Teddy would sing Turn Off The Lights and them women would go crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Between Turn Off The Lights and then Close The Door."
"__MUSIC__ I forgot about Close The Door."

"__MUSIC__ You're talking about Joy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Joy, that's it."
"__MUSIC__ I like all of Teddy's music. Even when he was with Harold Melvin and them."
"__MUSIC__ You talking about Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Them dudes had that classic Philly sound."
"__MUSIC__ I know. But Harold Melvin was jealous because Teddy was getting all of the shine."
"__MUSIC__ And that's why Teddy went solo."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. Rest in peace Teddy."
