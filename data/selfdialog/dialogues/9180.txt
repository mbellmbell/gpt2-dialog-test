"__BASEBALL__ The Rockies are playing well this season."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. It's surprising how well they're playing."
"__BASEBALL__ It's like the Rockies are the team in the NL West that can hit left handers."
"__BASEBALL__ LOL. The Giants are awful against LHP."
"__BASEBALL__ Dodgers too. The Dodgers should be running away but they haven't been able to hit lefties."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the Dodgers are under-performing for sure. Giants are always up and down."
"__BASEBALL__ Better than the Padres though."
"__BASEBALL__ Padres actually have some good young talent too. Myers is good when healthy."
"__BASEBALL__ Still well behind Dodgers with Seager, Urias, and Puig if he has his head on straight."
"__BASEBALL__ For sure. I think LA will get on a roll eventually. Too much talent to languish."
"__BASEBALL__ If the Rockies keep playing well they'll be right in the mix."
"__BASEBALL__ Arenado is a beast."
"__BASEBALL__ Agree. It's only a matter of time before he puts up some MVP caliber stats."
"__BASEBALL__ He's had some good seasons already to be in the conversation."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but he's still got growth to have a real year of mashing."
"__BASEBALL__ Especially in Colorado."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think that helps or hurt his chances at getting MVP consideration?"
"__BASEBALL__ Good question. I mean on one hand the park inflates his numbers but on the other hand his splits aren't that dramatic."
"__BASEBALL__ Plus there's the fact he has some other talented guys in that lineup."
"__BASEBALL__ Right, but lately they weigh your club's success with it too. All the more reason to keep the team rolling."
