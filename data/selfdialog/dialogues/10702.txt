"__FASHION__ Guess what may be back in fashion this spring and summer, Sue."

"__FASHION__ Where do you come up with this stuff?"
"__FASHION__ Look at this article in the Cosmopolitan. See for yourself."
"__FASHION__ The boxy shapes seen on the Balenciaga catwalk are likely to be too extreme for us mere muggles but more relaxed shapes at Chanel and Marni gave an insight into how we could take on the trend, too."
"__FASHION__ What did I tell you?"
"__FASHION__ Just because some fashion designer had models walking the catwalk with these huge, boxy shoulders, that does not mean that is what is in."
"__FASHION__ You never know."
"__FASHION__ Look at the part about the sheer fabrics. Who is going to walk around in public with sheer pants on?"
"__FASHION__ Won't be me."
"__FASHION__ Me neither."
"__FASHION__ I think these designers are just throwing things up in the air and waiting to see which one catches on."
"__FASHION__ You think?"
