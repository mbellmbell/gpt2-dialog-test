"__DISNEY__ You know what sequel, I want?"
"__DISNEY__ Which one?"
"__DISNEY__ A Treasure Planet 2!"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know if they will make one of those."
"__DISNEY__ I can dream."
"__DISNEY__ What would be the plot?"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe Jim meets up with Silver sometime later in life."
"__DISNEY__ Like after Jim graduates from the galactic navy or something?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and they can go on another adventure too."
"__DISNEY__ If we are thinking of the same Long John Silver, the adventure may be to bail him out of trouble or find treasure."
