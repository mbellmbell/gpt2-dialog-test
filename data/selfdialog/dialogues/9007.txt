"__BEATLES__ Did you see that movie last fall about the Beatles called '8 Days A Week?'"
"__BEATLES__ No, I missed that one."
"__BEATLES__ It was about what it was like being on tour in the early sixties."
"__BEATLES__ The sixties were supposed to be crazy."
"__BEATLES__ What was crazy was they had footage in the film of their last live performance they found under some old lady's bed."
"__BEATLES__ Wow, that's like those old cars they find in barns, or famous paintings at a Savation Army."
"__BEATLES__ She heard they were making a movie and called them, and asked if they wanted some films she took of the concert."
"__BEATLES__ She had some great films she was just hanging onto?"
"__BEATLES__ Actually, she never even developed them. The movie people had to restore them and found all this great stuff."
"__BEATLES__ What better way to really hear songs than watch them actually being played by the band?"
