"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of New Medicine?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. Are they a new group?"
"__MUSIC__ Not exactly, they've been around for a few years, though their first album didn't come out until 2010."
"__MUSIC__ They were active before that?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I heard. Supposedly they used to go by a different name but I don't know if that's true or not."
"__MUSIC__ How many albums have they released since then?"
"__MUSIC__ Only one other in 2014. I'm sure they'll release another sooner or later."
"__MUSIC__ If they keep that schedule, you'll probably get a new album next year in 2018."
"__MUSIC__ You're probably right, but I would settle for some singles or something 'til then."
"__MUSIC__ I understand. Having to listen to the same old handful of songs can get boring."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, they do have one song that's really hard to find, and most people haven't heard it."
"__MUSIC__ You don't say? What's the deal with that."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. It doesn't appear on either of their albums. I have an MP3 copy of it I found online."
"__MUSIC__ It must not be too hard to find if you found a copy?"
"__MUSIC__ I got lucky. After that I tried to find it again, and it was nowhere to be found."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's gotta be on YouTube at least?"
"__MUSIC__ There's only one video of the song on YouTue, and it's acoustic. The copy I have is the full version."
"__MUSIC__ That is really strange. What's the song called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's titled 'Turning It Into This', and I think it was made back around the time of the first album. It's actually my favorite of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy how songs can get lost like that. I'm glad you have a copy since you like it so much."
