"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, have you seen all the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I've seen some, but definitely  not all. How many are there?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure. I think there are maybe seven that have been made so far."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, i definitely saw the original three made back in the day."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah me too. And i've seen three of the newer ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think i've only seen two. I know the last one was The Force Awakens, but i didn't see it"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's the one i have not seen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Great films though. There's like a whole mythology to them with some interesting spiritual concepts thrown in"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, i agree. There's definitely some philosophical stuff in them"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, thought provoking."
