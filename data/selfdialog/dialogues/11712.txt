"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, did you hear about NFL deflategate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, what is that? I don't remember hearing anything like that. What is it again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember the New England Patriot's Tom Brady? It was the 2014-2015 season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way? Really? How did I miss that? What happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it was mainly in the play-offs. The Patriots were busted slightly deflating their footballs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! How did that help them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's easier to throw and catch when the ball is just slightly softer and Tom Brady liked his footballs like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but wouldn't that help both teams? They both use the same ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, kind of, but it really worked to the Patriots and Brady's advantage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, what happened when they got busted?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was pretty major dude. Brady got suspended for 4 games in the next season and team got fined 1 mil. The team also lost 2 of their top draft picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, but wasn't that the season they came back and won the Superbowl ....again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they beat the Falcons. After all that they were still the best team to win the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, how did the Falcons make it to the Superbowl? They suck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they were considered the best team overall but they couldn't pull it together to beat New England in the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I wonder if the Falcons will be able to come back and be as good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, no kidding."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I bet we the Patriots and Brady again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that dude is super human!"
