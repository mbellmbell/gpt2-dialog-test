"__MOVIES__ I love that movie Hocus Pocus!"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Bette Midler in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but Sarah Jessica Parker was so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Who was the 3rd witch in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't she in My Big Fat Greek Wedding?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm, I think her name was Kathy Najimy."

"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I love that little town that they live in. It looks like a great place to grow up."
"__MOVIES__ No doubt, but still a small town. Can you believe the little sister was Thora Birch?"
"__MOVIES__ No really? She was in that movie Ghost World, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, now that you mention it. That was her. I don't remember much of it only it was weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, also early Scarlett Johansen."
"__MOVIES__ Really, I guess so."
"__MOVIES__ Back to Hocus Pocus....isn't the best scene when all the little kids are out trick or treating and the witches can't figure out what is going on?"
