"__MOVIES__ Hey, are you going to see the new Spiderman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding me?  I love Marvel movies!  I'm going to see it on the night it comes out!"
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Marvel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably either the first Iron Man or the Avengers.  Anything except Iron Man 3."
"__MOVIES__ What was wrong with Iron Man Three?  I liked it."
"__MOVIES__ They switched directors.  It was too different from the other two movies."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Jon Favreau was in Iron Man 3."
"__MOVIES__ He was, but he wasn't the director.  Iron Man 3 was just way too long for me and I thought the ending was cheesy."
"__MOVIES__ I forget, what happens at the end?"
"__MOVIES__ He destroys all his suits and gets into a relationship with his assistant."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wait.  Maybe I'm thinking of a different movie.  That doesn't sound right.  ...how can he destroy all the suits at the end?  Doesn't he wear a suit in Spiderman?"
"__MOVIES__ See, that's what I'm talking about!  Iron Man 3 doesn't fit with the rest of the movies!"
"__MOVIES__ So how does he get his suit back for Spiderman?"
"__MOVIES__ I assume he builds a new one."
"__MOVIES__ Is he still with his assistant girlfriend?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Gwenyth Paltrow's contract ended so her character is 'taking a break' from Iron Man."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame, I really like her.  But at least Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Favreau are in Spiderman, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.  Want to see it with me?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure.  Do they have it available in 3D?"
"__MOVIES__ I hope so!  I hear they spent a ton on the special effects."
