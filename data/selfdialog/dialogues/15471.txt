"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hey you. I saw you just watched Half-Blood Prince."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes I did indeed. That certainly was an interesting one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah. I like it on it's own, but when compared to the whole series, it doesn't really make sense."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree. Though there definitely were some laugh out loud parts."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The entire Felix Felices part was hilarious. Harry was making me laugh so hard."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ 'By all means sir, come along!'"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The part with Aragog dead and Harry says people are scared of it because of the pincers. His hand movements killed me!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah. I am a pretty hard Hermione and Ron fan, so I did like the parts that put that at the forefront."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Some of that was pretty silly though. I mean, Hermione with those fake birds? What in the world was that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah that made me laugh too because it was so ridiculous."
