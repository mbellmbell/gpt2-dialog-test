"__MOVIES__ I was thinking about movies and the Academy Awards."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of a weird thing to think about - they're not for another 7 months or so!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it just popped into my head. But I was mulling over a question."
"__MOVIES__ What question?"
"__MOVIES__ What is the best movie not to win the best picture Oscar?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm, good question. There must be some classic movies that were snubbed."
"__MOVIES__ The one that came to mind immediately was Pulp Fiction."
"__MOVIES__ Pulp fiction didn't win best picture?! I assumed it must have."
"__MOVIES__ Nope. It lost out to Forrest Gump, I think."
"__MOVIES__ Forrest Gump was a fun movie, but it's no Pulp Fiction!"
"__MOVIES__ For sure. That one stands out as pretty egregious."
"__MOVIES__ How about Goodfellas? One of the best mafia movies of all time!"
"__MOVIES__ Goodfellas is another solid choice. A great, great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Or how about the Shawshank Redemption?"
"__MOVIES__ Shawshank Redempton is an interesting one."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't all that financially successful, and critically it wasn't seen as a super great movie at the time."
"__MOVIES__ That's weird, becuase it's one of the most beloved movies today."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Just goes to show how opinions can change over the years."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of my all-time favorite movies, in fact."
