"__STAR_WARS__ Remember the Lando Calirissan character from Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he was great."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, at first a swindler and city manager of Cloud city..."
"__STAR_WARS__ ...and then a general in the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ yeah, that seemed a bit of a stretch."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess the rebellion was pretty desperate for leaders."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder whatever happened to him"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they never talked about him in the Force Awakens"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope they somehow integrate him in the next new one"
"__STAR_WARS__ yeah, that would be great"
