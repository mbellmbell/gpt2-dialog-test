"__MOVIES__ So I watched Split the other day."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it. It had it's moments."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was really long."
"__MOVIES__ Have you never watched an M. Night Shyamalan movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I have! I just didn't think this movie needed to be that long."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. Well what about the actual movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked how he used the idea of Dissociative Identity Disorder for the villain."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. It was a bold move and it turned out really well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, not cheesy at all."
"__MOVIES__ Plus it brings light to the actual disorder."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. Maybe they shouldn't have made him so evil then."
"__MOVIES__ Well when you put it like that."
"__MOVIES__ I'm teasing. Anyways, the girl was interesting though."
"__MOVIES__ She was. But it was a little bit triggering don't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I know some people would get easily offended by it."
"__MOVIES__ Well it happens to a lot of people in that way."
"__MOVIES__ So this movie was basically showing the evils of society?"
"__MOVIES__ A little bit."
