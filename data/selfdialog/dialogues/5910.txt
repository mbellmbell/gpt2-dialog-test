"__STAR_WARS__ You know, Daniel Craig played a storm trooper in The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, and it was a huge waste."
"__STAR_WARS__ What? Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because you have 007 on set and you cover his face in plastic armor? Please."
"__STAR_WARS__ What would you suggest they do?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, put a ton of makeup on him? Make him into an alien?"
"__STAR_WARS__ How is that any better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You'd still know it's him; just a distorted version. As a stormtrooper, you'd never know without being told."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I see. Like, a little 'blink and you miss it' easter egg sort of deal?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Something like that, yeah. At least let us know he was there without having to look at IMDB."
