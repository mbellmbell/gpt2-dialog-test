"__STAR_WARS__ So I heard your sister finally introduced you to the Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Just the first 3. The actual first 3 that came out, not the ones that are supposed to take place first."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think she recruited a new fan."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you liked them!"
"__STAR_WARS__ My eyes were glued to the TV the whole time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Favourite part?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, probably the whole relationship between r2d2 and c3po."
"__STAR_WARS__ They are great together. I love c3po's calm demeanor in the face of some scary situations."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah me too! And I feel like as non-humans they're almost more relateable, just because they're not the ones totally obsessed with interests of the opposite gender."
