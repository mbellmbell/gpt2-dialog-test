"__MUSIC__ I can't stop listening to the new Migos album."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I can't stand them."
"__MUSIC__ I love their music. It's so catchy and it gets me pumped up."
"__MUSIC__ I've never been a fan, and frankly I don't get why they're popular."
"__MUSIC__ They're popular because their music is fun and easy to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, but you can't even understand a word they are saying."
"__MUSIC__ You don't need to. It's about the vibe of the music and how it makes you feel."
"__MUSIC__ Personally, I think artists like them are an embarrassment to rap and hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ How? If people enjoy listening to them then they are doing something right."
"__MUSIC__ Popularity in music doesn't equal quality. Rap is a genre that started from poetry. Meaningless lyrics completely abandons the genre's roots."
"__MUSIC__ You just haven't caught up with the times. Hip-hop is different now."
"__MUSIC__ Just because it's different doesn't mean it's better than it was. There are so many terrible famous rappers."
"__MUSIC__ Like who? Migos is only one group."
"__MUSIC__ Future, 21 Savage, Young Thug, just to name a few."
"__MUSIC__ You have to admit that they make some catchy music."
"__MUSIC__ I do admit that. However, for my personal taste, even catchy music isn't enjoyable if the lyrics are unbearable."
"__MUSIC__ Well, some people don't mind just listening and not thinking about what every line means."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose. I guess many people would rather just listen to what sounds good and move on."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I do. I listen to music to enjoy it, and I enjoy listening to Migos."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. I don't ever think I will, though."
