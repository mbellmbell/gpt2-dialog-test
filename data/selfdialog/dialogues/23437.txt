"__DISNEY__ Have you watched the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't."
"__DISNEY__ Why not? I liked it."
"__DISNEY__ I lost interest after the third one."
"__DISNEY__ I guess they did change a lot of the characters, not everyone likes that."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I like the dynamic between Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom."
"__DISNEY__ Johnny Depp is pretty good though."
"__DISNEY__ He is, but I'm not a huge fan. Him on his own is not enough to keep bringing me back."
"__DISNEY__ He has enough fans to keep a major franchise going for over a decade though."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, a lot of girls are obsessed with him. He's aged very well."
