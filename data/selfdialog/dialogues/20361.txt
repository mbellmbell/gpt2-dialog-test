"__MOVIES__ So I have a movie question for you and it is kind of hard."
"__MOVIES__ Oh go ahead, it can't be that hard."
"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ What? No, you can't ask that."
"__MOVIES__ Fine-from our lifetime."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that doesn't narrow it down as much as I would like, but I would have to choose the Harry Potter series."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that's a series, not a movie. Pick one."
"__MOVIES__ Nit pickey, aren't we? Okay, I like the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you like that one the best?"
"__MOVIES__ I like how much they showcase how magical everything is."
"__MOVIES__ It does make you want to kind of jump into their world."
"__MOVIES__ I think they do the best in that movie of really leaving you with a sense of awe of how great and majestic Hogwarts is."
"__MOVIES__ I really like that one, but I really like The Goblet of Fire."
"__MOVIES__ I like that one too, of course. But why that one?"
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoy the dance scene. The scenery is beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ I like the plot of that one."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Who is your favorite character from the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like Harry, but Ron cracks me up."
"__MOVIES__ Ron is funny, but I like Hermione. She is very witty."
"__MOVIES__ That is why they make a good couple!"
