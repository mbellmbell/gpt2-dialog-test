"__MUSIC__ Where are you going?"
"__MUSIC__ To the nursing home."
"__MUSIC__ Why? I thought you hate old people."

"__MUSIC__ What's the class?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a class called Music and The Mind. It's pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ What do you do in it?"
"__MUSIC__ We study how music affects the brain, the parts of the brain, memory, et cetera."
"__MUSIC__ Did you just say et cetera out loud? That's weird."
"__MUSIC__ Sorry."
"__MUSIC__ So why are you going to the home?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, we're working with the Alzheimers and Dementia patients."
"__MUSIC__ With music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's awesome, actually."
"__MUSIC__ How's that work?"
"__MUSIC__ We custom-make iPod shuffles with music from the teens and late 20's."
"__MUSIC__ What's that do?"
"__MUSIC__ It can calm them down, bring back happy memories, put them in different states of mind, and even some of them get up and dance!"
"__MUSIC__ It cures Alzheimers?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but it's important for the patients and the caregivers. It's music therapy, basically."
