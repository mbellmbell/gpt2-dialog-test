"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, which division is driven by the best quarterbacks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my opinion there's no debate in the No. 1 spot. NFC South's QB quartet is in a league of its own right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! I'm a Ryan and Newton fan myself but what about Prescott and Manning? NFC East has a nice lineup as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Manning can't hold a candle to Brees though, he has more 5,000-yard seasons than every other quarterback in NFL history combined."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli Manning is Eli Manning. The two-time Super Bowl MVP is tough and clutch and still great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Brees, He's Canton bound ... yet still terrorizing defenses in his late 30s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok what about AFC East?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's easy Tom Brady of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For Sure! Man the Jets have the worst quarterback situation in the NFL right now!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea but on the flip side, Brady is the G.O.A.T."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You also have Taylor in that mix, I've always liked Taylor!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea and the Bills will function like an actual football team with a new head coach im thinking!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited to watch Taylor this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ AFC Wes"
