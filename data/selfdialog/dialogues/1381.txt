"__MUSIC__ I'm a bit late to the party, but I finally heard that What Does the Fox Say song today."
"__MUSIC__ Dude, that came out four years ago."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I somehow made it this long with never hearing the whole actual song."
"__MUSIC__ So you've just heard bits and pieces over the years?"
"__MUSIC__ Right.  I never actually searched and listened to the song."
"__MUSIC__ Makes sense.  So what did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of a funny song in terms of it's supposed to be ridiculous."
"__MUSIC__ Correct, they didn't take themselves seriously in making it."
"__MUSIC__ Which helps.  I'm okay if it's supposed to be stupid."
"__MUSIC__ The guy who made it is a comedy artist overseas somewhere."
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of funny how it became a phenomenon."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of normal for things like that, Gangnam Style, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I totally forget about Gangnam Style!"
"__MUSIC__ Another gem for sure.  Most viewed video ever apparently on Youtube."
"__MUSIC__ And do you remember Harlem Shake?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I hated those videos though."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Just got boring with everyone making their own versions of that crappy song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, when everybody does it, it becomes uncool."
"__MUSIC__ Indeed.  My daughter still loves all these songs though."
