"__MOVIES__ Did you like Napoleon Dynamite?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I thought it was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ I did too. A lot of people don't like it."
"__MOVIES__ Well I didn't like it the first time. It grew on me."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's what happened with me too. I thought it was stupid at first."
"__MOVIES__ His dry humor just makes me laugh so much."
"__MOVIES__ I know and all the subtle jokes like with Rex Kwon Do."
"__MOVIES__ Haha! He's one of my favorite characters."
"__MOVIES__ I quote him all the time. Break the wrist, walk away."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh, that's so funny. I always say his line about a roundhouse kick to the face."
"__MOVIES__ That's one of the best scenes in the film."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I really like all of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's hard for me to get people to watch with me. They don't laugh much."
"__MOVIES__ How can they not laugh?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I still find it funny all these years later."
"__MOVIES__ My aunt loves when Kip asks if Napoleon can pull him into town."
"__MOVIES__ And he takes him on his bike while he rides behind on roller blades!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha yes! I send her that clip from time to time."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny. I think I'm going to watch it tonight."
"__MOVIES__ I might join you."
