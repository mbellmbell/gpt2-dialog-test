"__MUSIC__ Hi, what do you think about the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ They are close to my heart and my favorite band of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Every song is so good that it is nearly impossible to choose a favorite!"
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. What are your top two favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say that one of mne would be Hey Jude."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song. Paul McCartney wrote that song for John Lennon's son."
"__MUSIC__ I did not know that, really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, He wrote it for Sean Lennon."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, how cool ! Good information and knowledge."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I love talking about music history."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, do you have any current favorite songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't stay current so I would have to say no. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I am pretty bad about that too. My current would be about twenty years old."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! For instance?"
"__MUSIC__ For example I would would say I love Elvis!"
"__MUSIC__ Right on, Love me Tender is an oldie but goodie!"
"__MUSIC__ Right, I listen to the fifties station every day while driving."
"__MUSIC__ I love when the song Mr. Postman come on because it reminds of of high school."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. I have a lot of songs that do that for me too."
"__MUSIC__ I will second that sentiment with the song My little Run Run Runaway oldie !"
