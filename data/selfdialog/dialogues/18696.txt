"__MOVIES__ What did you think about 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens?'"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it so much.  Yourself?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it a lot.  What do you think about the criticism that it was too similar to 'A New Hope?'"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say that, while they were extremely similar, this newest one brought enough different elements to make it a fresh take."
"__MOVIES__ Who was your favorite character?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Rey."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't think she was a bit too good at everything?"
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It just seems like she never really faced any issues.  She's good at everything."
"__MOVIES__ I see where you're coming from, but I think that even if she has many skills, it doesn't make her challenges any easier to overcome."
"__MOVIES__ That's fair."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like anything about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I still enjoyed the movie.  Also, Daisy Ridley is just a phenomenal actress."
"__MOVIES__ She really is.  I can't believe that this was her first major role in a film."
"__MOVIES__ I had no idea.  I'm that much more impressed after hearing that."
"__MOVIES__ I think similar to how the original cast consisted of relatively unknown actors, this movie also debuted some new faces."
"__MOVIES__ I think all those actors have bright futures ahead.  Oscar Isaac and John Boyega were great in their roles too."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I can't wait for Episode 8."
"__MOVIES__ Same here.  'Rogue One' helped satiate me in the meantime."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that one too.  'Star Wars' is such an awesome saga."
