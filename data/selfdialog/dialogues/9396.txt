"__BASEBALL__ Do you think Kershaw is gonna win the Cy Young again?"
"__BASEBALL__ I would think so but you can never count out Scherzer."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't mind Scherzer, but it's much tougher to pitch in that park."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree with that but he's still putting up monster numbers."
"__BASEBALL__ Who do you think can come out of the National League?"
"__BASEBALL__ I like the Nats or Dodgers to come out this year."
"__BASEBALL__ What about the Cubs?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think they have a bit of a hangover from winning last year. They haven't looked good."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree, it all comes down to arms and they don't have any aces."
"__BASEBALL__ Arrieta is a shell of himself."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I'm beginning to think more and more two years ago was a fluke."
"__BASEBALL__ Well he came out of nowhere and wasn't good with Baltimore."
"__BASEBALL__ What about the AL. Who do you think is coming out of there?"
"__BASEBALL__ I personally like the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ That's a bit surprising but hard to dismiss their fast start."
"__BASEBALL__ Plus they have all the money to spend at the deadline."
"__BASEBALL__ I do love what Girardi is doing with a mix of young and old."
"__BASEBALL__ Completely agree, love Holliday mixed in with Judge and Sanchez."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, who do you think wins the World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ I have to go with the Dodgers. Give me 3 starts from Kershaw in a 7 game series and I'll take my chances."
