"__MUSIC__ Yea I guess they were everyone's favorite for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember Milli Vanilli?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, but were they a boy band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea I would say so, I mean it wasn't their talent that made them famous."
"__MUSIC__ Haha yea I guess that's obviously true."
"__MUSIC__ What about Vanilla Ice? Would you consider him a boy band."
"__MUSIC__ Certainly not. He was more like a pop rapper."
"__MUSIC__ I see. Well after New Kids I was into backstreet boys for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Yea I loved backstreet boys. But I was more of an NSync person."
