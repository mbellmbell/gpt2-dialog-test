"__STAR_WARS__ Are you going to see the new Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably. Last year, I saw The Force Awakens, and it was pretty good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I liked that one too. A lot better than those three around the time with Jar Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't like those either. That character was too annoying."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think The Force Awakens felt more like the original three."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, me too. And J.J. Abrams directed it, so that's probably part of the reason it was good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he's great. I liked seeing Luke, Hans Solo and Princess Leia in the movie too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. That added a lot, for me."
"__STAR_WARS__ I probably will keep seeing the new ones if they are as good as that one was."
"__STAR_WARS__ I probably will, too."
