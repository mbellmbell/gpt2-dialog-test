"__MUSIC__ The one thing I dislike the most about the PC cafe that I go to is the loud music."
"__MUSIC__ Don't you wear headphones when you use the computers?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but they play the music at too high of a volume."
"__MUSIC__ Is it at least music that you like?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it's annoying dubstep."
"__MUSIC__ I like some dubstep."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but the kind they play at the PC cafe is obnoxious and not good."
"__MUSIC__ Can you listen to your own music to block it out?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I've been doing lately. I usually listen to hip hop when I play games."
"__MUSIC__ Old school hip hop? Or newer stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly newer, like Migos and Travis Scott."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. I have seen a lot of criticism revolving around those artists."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes you need to separate the artist from the art, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ What else do you listen to when you play games?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of Kendrick Lamar."
"__MUSIC__ I like him. What do you think of his newest album?"
"__MUSIC__ I like it. I think he managed to pick up a new persona."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I feel he is falling back to his roots."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe so, but his music is a reflection of his present self."
"__MUSIC__ That's very true."
