"__MUSIC__ What do you think of classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like some stuff, but most of it just sounds the same."
"__MUSIC__ What have you heard?"
"__MUSIC__ Just the big songs you hear in movies and commercials."
"__MUSIC__ Ah there's much more than those to listen to, those are just the well known ones."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know any other songs that aren't as popular?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't think of their names sadly, but I've heard a lot more than those popular few, that's for sure."
"__MUSIC__ What kinds of instruments do they use?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the really popular stuff is mainly piano or at least performed on piano."
"__MUSIC__ I though most classical music was on piano."
"__MUSIC__ You might be right, I'm not sure."
"__MUSIC__ They've got some orchestral music though too right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah there's a lot that is written for an orchestra."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know any groups that play classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not off the top of my head, but I like to play some."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really? What do you play?"
"__MUSIC__ Just a few small pieces, but nothing really from the classical era. A lot of newer bands have classical sounding pieces in some of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know that King Diamond has a heavy classical influence, and they mainly do scary metal."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, very strange. I'm sure some of my bands have classical influences too."
