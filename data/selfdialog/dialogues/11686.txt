"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can anyone beat the Patriots this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's rare for a team that's so strong on paper to win the Super Bowl, so we'll see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They added so many good pieces to an already great lineup!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they're a lock for the playoffs every year as it is given the perennial weak teams in the AFC East."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And now they have Brandin Cooks, Rex Burkhead, and Mike Gillislee as more pieces to that elite offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady's gonna have a hard time messing that up - 40 years old or not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, the defense is improved too. They signed Stephon Gilmore and David Harris."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kony Ealy, too. There aren't many weaknesses on this team, that's for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes me wonder if the Pats do win it all, will Brady hang it up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would give him and Belichick six Super Bowls apiece, best duo of all-time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sealed their places in NFL immortality with that crazy overtime win in last year's Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. Others may have had better stats, like Peyton Manning, but give me Brady in a big game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seeing the Pats make all these moves during the offseason makes me wonder if they're going all-in this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they have Jimmy Garoppolo waiting in the wings and he can probably lead the team at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially with the talent up and down the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a free agent after this season, isn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and I have to think that he'll be highly coveted if he enters free agency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would the Patriots put the franchise tag on him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only if Brady retires."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he says he'll play until he's 45, it will be fun to watch."
