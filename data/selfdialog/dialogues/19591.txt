"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the new Dead Pool movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it's not so new anymore, but I thought it was great."
"__MOVIES__ Yea it was so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ The fighting was cool too."
"__MOVIES__ They really nailed it, I think it's by far the best superhero movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well it certainly is the best fit. Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ Wouldn't it be amazing if they did a Deadpool and Wolverine crossover."
"__MOVIES__ Yea Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds in the same movie would be epic."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder who would win in a fight?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, in the end they would be on the same side. You know how these movies go."
"__MOVIES__ Yea that's true. Theyd start out enemies, but then in the end work together."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I really hope they cross Deadpool over into the other marvel movies."
"__MOVIES__ It isn't likely due to studio licensing contracts."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's dumb. They should find a way to make it happen."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, people would pay a lot more money to watch Deadpool with other superheroes."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, they should bring that teenage girl superhero and collassus with them too. They were great."
"__MOVIES__ Yea they were. Deadpool had a really tight budget, and they still did that good."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, it was also the first rated R superhero movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it paid off, because they made a ton of money."
