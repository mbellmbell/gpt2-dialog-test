"__MUSIC__ Do you like Devo?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the 'Whip It' guys?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they did that one, but they're so much more than that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I always thought of them as a one hit wonder from the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ Well they've been around since the 70s."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were a pretty important part of the punk movement."
"__MUSIC__ No shit, I never would've guessed."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. Bowie was a big fan of their's, and he helped connect them with Brian Eno."
"__MUSIC__ Now I know him, ambient music guy, works with David Byrne sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah Eno produced some of Talking Heads earliest and best albums, but he also  produced Devo's first album."
"__MUSIC__ What does that name mean anyways, Devo?"
"__MUSIC__ Devo is short for de-evolution. The band has this theory that humanity  reach their high point  some time ago, and is now devolving as a result of corporate domination of the culture and a push towards homogenization of the people."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty heavy for a band I always thought of as a novelty act."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's why they always dressed alike and acted alike, they saw themselves as a satirical reflection of the times, and used pop music to convey their message."
"__MUSIC__ Well I may have to listen to them more sometime."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely had a hard time with their label when they got signed to the big time. A lot of their songs featured subtle digs at their corporate handlers."
"__MUSIC__ Like which ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Well you ever hear that some of theirs 'Girl U Want'? It's all about selling pop bands to kids."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard that one before, I think it was on the Tank Girl soundtrack back in the day."
