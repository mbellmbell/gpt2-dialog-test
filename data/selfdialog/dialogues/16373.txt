"__ROCK__ You know what. I'm not sure."

"__ROCK__ Some time around 2010. Good Day to Die is the last one I remember."
"__ROCK__ Same here. Last one I remember also."
"__ROCK__ They are a band I miss. They had some great music."
"__ROCK__ Their slower, spiritual songs seemed to be their best hits. Although, I liked their more heavy stuff as well."
"__ROCK__ Definitely. Voodoo and Serenity were their greatest hits. Almost spiritual feeling you get when you listen to those songs."
"__ROCK__ Yes. Something about the beat to the songs."
"__ROCK__ You are making me nostalgic and taking me back to the early 2000s."
