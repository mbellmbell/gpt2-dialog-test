"__MUSIC__ So, what are some other 'feel good' music titles you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, one I really enjoy is 'Reach Out' by Cheap Trick"
"__MUSIC__ Dunno if I've heard that one."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm only aware of it because it was on the movie Heavy Metal."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't that the weird animated movie from the early 80s?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly.  It's really nice and upbeat and got the whole 'you can take on the world' type beat to it."
"__MUSIC__ That's neat."
"__MUSIC__ Sadly, most like that just doesn't seem as popular today as it was.  I suppose there's just too much cynicism going on in today's world."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I don't know, we got Katie Perry's, 'Firework' ."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, that's another song you could add to the list. Oh, and 'The Middle' by Jimmy Eat World"
"__MUSIC__ Ahhh. yeah, that was big when I graduated high school.  'It's just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride...'"
"__MUSIC__ Hehe... 'Everything, everything, will be just fine...'"
"__MUSIC__ That reminds me, did they ever had a hit besides that song?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh... probably, but I really couldn't tell you what it is.  That can be a problem when you have a REAL popular song you're known for."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, cause everyone keeps comparing all your next songs to that one."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. and you can get stuck in this rote of not being able to 'break out' of that one hit."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard there's some artists that got so sick of their hit songs that they actually REFUSE to play them anymore in concert."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard that story as well."
"__MUSIC__ For instance, I'm told the Beastie Boy REALLY hate their song “(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)”"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, didn't know that."
