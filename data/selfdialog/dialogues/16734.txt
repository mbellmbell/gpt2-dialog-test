"__MOVIES__ Which Jurassic movie was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably the first one. I didn't really care about the sequel, the third one or the latest, Jurassic World."
"__MOVIES__ Steven Spielberg really put a stamp on that franchise with the first one. That was my favorite but I really enjoyed the Last World and Jurassic World too."
"__MOVIES__ The Lost World was the second one right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it wasn't bad for me, I thought it was really fun. The third one got a bit over the top."
"__MOVIES__ Is the third one when they were stranded after the boat accident on that island?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember it too clearly but that's basically what happens. It was kind of boring compared to the others."
"__MOVIES__ I did like the new dinosaurs in Jurassic World."
"__MOVIES__ You're probably one of the few. Most people hated the new I-Rex. They felt the chameleon disguising and high IQ were too much."
"__MOVIES__ How about that big dinosaur fish! The one that ate the I-Rex at the end, that was pretty amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the effects were really good. I liked the way they modernized a lot of the dinosaurs but also polished up their looks. It was very realistic."
"__MOVIES__ There's another Jurassic coming out in 2018."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I'm kind of interested in that now. I'm always ready to watch a new one but I keep my expectations low going in now."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah in 2018 there will be another Jurassic. This is going to be called Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom."
"__MOVIES__ I'm guessing it picks up where Jurassic World left off."
"__MOVIES__ At least we'll still have the infamous T-Rex in this."
"__MOVIES__ The T-Rex became the hero in Jurassic World!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think they'll bring back Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard?"
"__MOVIES__ Chris is definitely back in, he's now the face of that franchise. I'm not sure about Bryce. It would be nice if she returned too, for continuity."
"__MOVIES__ I hope so! I really enjoyed their on screen chemistry in Jurassic World even though the movie itself was mediocre."
