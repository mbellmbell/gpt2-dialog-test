"__MOVIES__ I've been thinking about this. I think Magnolia is my favorite Paul Thomas Anderson movie."
"__MOVIES__ What did he direct again?"
"__MOVIES__ A bunch of stuff. Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, Inherent Vice... it's a long list."
"__MOVIES__ Those are all great movies. I haven't seen Magnolia though."
"__MOVIES__ You're missing out!"
"__MOVIES__ What makes it so great?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's a big ensemble cast with a bunch of stories taking place at once."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that could be interesting."
"__MOVIES__ And they all gradually intersect and are changed by a moment of total strangeness."
"__MOVIES__ I'd be interested in watching it. It sounds kind of like Crash though."
"__MOVIES__ It's much better than Crash. Crash was bad."
"__MOVIES__ It really was. I have no idea how it won an oscar."
"__MOVIES__ There Will Be Blood nearly won for best picture though."
"__MOVIES__ See, that's probably the one I'd pick as a favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. It's such a lurid story. It just draws you in."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it, but I didn't like it as much as I liked Magnolia."
"__MOVIES__ Should we each watch the other's favorite again?"
"__MOVIES__ Just to see if we have the same opinion?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. It could be fun!"
