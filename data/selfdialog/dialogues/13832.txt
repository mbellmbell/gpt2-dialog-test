"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think Carmelo Anthony is going to be playing in New York next year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think so."
"__BASKETBALL__ You don't think the Knicks are going to try to use him as trade fodder?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they might, but I don't think they'll get as much in return as they could have gotten two or three years ago."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's still an All-Star!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, but he's at the tail end of his prime and I think the Knicks are not going to accept that reality."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, you forget that Melo doesn't exactly seem happy in New York. He might ask for a trade."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, that would be different. If Melo pushes the issue, I could see the Knicks cutting a deal."
"__BASKETBALL__ You just don't think the Knicks will get a player of his caliber?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Not exactly. I think the Knicks are going to over-estimate Carmelo's abilities and demand someone better than he is."
"__BASKETBALL__ Surely they know he's not on the same level as a James Harden or Russell Westbrook!"
"__BASKETBALL__ No doubt, but it doesn't mean they won't act like they don't know. They might take a developing player, but they're not going to accept a medire one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think Melo definitely wants out?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know, but I suspect he'd bolt for a chance to win. His window for a championship is closing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Where would he go, if he went, do you think?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe Boston. I can't see him landing anywhere like Cleveland or Golden State because they have no room."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs always seem willing to trade Kevin Love and Melo is friends with LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Love is a way better fit for the Cavs than Melo and I'm sure LeBron knows that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why Boston, then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They're young and could use solid veteran leadership. Actually, so could a team like the Sixers."
