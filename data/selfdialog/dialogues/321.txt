"__MUSIC__ Hey - have you been paying attention to the music charts lately? It's interesting to see how many people I've never heard of!"
"__MUSIC__ I know. There's always a few that I know, but lord - I must be getting old."
"__MUSIC__ So what have you heard lately that you're really into?"
"__MUSIC__ I have to admit, the Triplicate album by Bob Dylan is pretty good"
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that the album that the recorded of Frank Sinatra songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah - and surprisingly, It's really really good! What are you liking these days?"
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, I have not been listening to really anything that is on teh radio lately."
"__MUSIC__ What have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, mostly folk music. It's kind of strange, but it's really calming when I'm doing work around my house or reading or trying to work."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that - it is calming yet doesn't take away from what you're trying to accomplish."
"__MUSIC__ That's precisely it. Are you going to any concerts lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Rise Against is playing in Kansas City and City and Colour is playing in Omaha. I'm going to both of those."
"__MUSIC__ Oh sweet. Who are you going with?"
"__MUSIC__ Nobody - would you like to go?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I could even pick you up on the way to them."
"__MUSIC__ If you could go back in time, who would you want to see live?"
"__MUSIC__ I think any of the old singer-songwriters before they had gotten so old. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Yeah, I can definitely agree with you on that one. I would like to go to some of the old festival concerts."
"__MUSIC__ Any in particular?"
"__MUSIC__ No - maybe Woodstock before people ruined it though."
