"__DISNEY__ Hey, are you a fan of Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ No, not really. But I do like musicals."
"__DISNEY__ Well, if you like musicals you'll definitely like Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really? What Disney movies do you think I'd like then?"
"__DISNEY__ The movies made during the 'Disney Renaissance' would pique your interest I think."
"__DISNEY__ Were those the ones made in the early-to-mid '90s?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, they are. Being that you're a fan of musicals, I would suggest checking out 'The Lion King'. Tim Rice wrote the lyrics for the songs."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I am very familiar with Tim Rice. Great lyricist."
"__DISNEY__ After you watch that, you may want to check out 'Beauty and The Beast'. It's another film that plays very much like a classic musical, with characters voiced by Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that sounds neat. I know of Jerry Orbach from his long career as an off-Broadway actor."
