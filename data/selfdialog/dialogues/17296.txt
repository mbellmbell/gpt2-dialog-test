"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen that recent movie with Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean the one about China or something? No, I haven't."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's called the 'The Great Wall'. It was released in 2016."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. I haven't really heard or seen much about it on social media or TV."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that true. I just saw it on the list of recent releases and it was one of the movies I haven't seen yet."
"__MOVIES__ Did you watch the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the trailer once or twice somewhere and it looked interesting."
"__MOVIES__ So, should I watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I had low expectations for the film because I thought it would be those cheesy, historical-like films. But, it was very surprising the got me on the edge of my seat many times."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What is it really about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about one of the legends of how the Great Wall of China was built. But, it includes a horde of reptile-like beasts that come over and attack after a certain period of time."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I mean that's cool but was it too predictable and was the CGI at least okay?"
"__MOVIES__ The CGI was seamless and really set the whole background, creatures, battles, and Great Wall up really well. It wasn't predictable at all because it focused on the purpose of the story while having certain instances of betrayal, loyalty, comedy, action, and romance."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, please don't tell me that they drag out the romantic scenes in this one. It's seems imbalanced when there's too much in an action film."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I was really surprised and glad that they focused on the action and adventure and not so much on romance. It just showed them having an interest and respect for each other which was a great balance for this movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I guess I should take a look at this film."
"__MOVIES__ You know what? It's so good that it makes me want to watch it twice."
"__MOVIES__ It's that good, huh? Okay, I'll watch it if you join me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, sure. You won't regret watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Great. I hope you're right."
