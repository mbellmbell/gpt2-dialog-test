"__DISNEY__ I think that Mulan had some of the best music I've ever heard in a movie."
"__DISNEY__ Which song was your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ The one that goes 'I'll make a man out of you...'"
"__DISNEY__ That's a funny song. I like how Mulan makes all the guys look like whimps."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah she's an awesome character."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think Mulan was better than Mulan 2?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh absolutely."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. A lot of times the first movie is better than the second."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know why they make sequels of some movies. They need to just leave them alone."
"__DISNEY__ You're right. Like The Lion King; number one was way better than 2."
