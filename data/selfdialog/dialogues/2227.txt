"__MUSIC__ What would you say is the most complex music?"
"__MUSIC__ Define complexity."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I mean the music that has the most going on in it at once."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I see. Maybe something like Johan Sebastian Bach's music, then."
"__MUSIC__ OK, caveat - Music made in the past 100 years."
"__MUSIC__ I think there's a lot of music that can fall into that description."
"__MUSIC__ OK, name some that you think fits."
"__MUSIC__ Radiohead makes music that is very deeply layered, sonically."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, their music is very complex."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, a genre that's often pretty complex is Heavy Metal."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't really expect that - it mostly sounds like a bunch of noise and screaming to me."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's that way with a lot of people."
"__MUSIC__ I guess they're playing their instruments really fast."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there are a lot of notes being played!"
"__MUSIC__ How about something lyrically complex, like Lupe Fiasco's lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, you could go in that direction. I was mostly thinking about the music rather than lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ For lyrical complexity, how about Bob Dylan."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't really agree. I don't think what he sang was all that complex."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of symbolism, though."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. I still wouldn't say he's that complex a musician."
