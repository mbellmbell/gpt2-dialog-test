"__MOVIES__ Do you ever watch bad movies on purpose?"
"__MOVIES__ Like to hate watch them or to have fun making fun of them?"
"__MOVIES__ To just soak in the absurd bad stuff people make, for fun."
"__MOVIES__ Oh totally, I did that with the Wicker Man remake several times."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great example of a great, bad movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yup, The Wicker Man remake is the best unintentional comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Did any of the people involved with The Wicker Man remake every comment on its cult status?"
"__MOVIES__ Not that I know of, it's so enjoyable to watch though, and I hope they're proud of that even if it wasn't their intention."
"__MOVIES__ I can quote that remake more often than some comedy movies."
"__MOVIES__ Always possible to slip a 'Not the bees!' quote into every conversation."
"__MOVIES__ Nicolas Cage movies in general have taken a turn for the unintentionally funny lately."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he hams it up big time in a lot of his recent films, in a bad way, but for me it's a good thing."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed, I can watch Nicolas Cage overact a role for days, it's so enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ Though honestly I wouldn't mind seeing him return to his Leaving Las Vegas level of esteem."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, when he wants to be he is a fantastic actor with serious chops."
"__MOVIES__ He's also a great action star, well maybe not anymore, but back in the day."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Con Air and The Rock are great films."
"__MOVIES__ Same can be said about Face-Off, he was just so fun to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe one day we'll get a great swan song from Nicolas Cage."
"__MOVIES__ The world can only hope it doesn't involve bees."
