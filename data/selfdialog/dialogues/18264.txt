"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Suicide Squad?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the new one with joker and harley quinn?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I love that movie. Harley is so funny in the movie, I seem to relate to her, in a crazy way."
"__MOVIES__ I can see what you mean.  I love Will Smith playing the sniper."
"__MOVIES__ He is such a hottie. It is kinda crazy how you can relate to the underdogs."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think that they will make another movie with the suicide squad being the main characters?"
"__MOVIES__ I would think so. Since it goes along with Superman and Batman. And we all know Superman did not really die in the last movie."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you might be right. I never thought much about that."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say when Will Smith-should them his unique skills in shooting. He tore them targets up."
"__MOVIES__ That was cool. I loved when Harley was talking about the voices in her head."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the 'Croc'. Even though he was ugly, he was cute in a way. And you did not ever feel sorry for him."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was funny when the main soldier told Will that he would be one of the first to run, when the action started. The squad had to save his butt a few times."
"__MOVIES__ Have you heard the soundtrack from the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I bought it. I has so many good songs by a variety of artists."
"__MOVIES__ Can I borrow it to see if I like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure- I also have the movie, you can borrow it, if you want."
"__MOVIES__ I would love to."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, when the next movie comes out with Superman or the Suicide Squad, when can go to the movies togather."
"__MOVIES__ I am all in, just give me a call."
