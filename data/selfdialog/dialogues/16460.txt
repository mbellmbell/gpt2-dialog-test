"__ROCK__ Did you hear who's being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year?"
"__ROCK__ No, who?"
"__ROCK__ ELO, Joan Baez, Journey, Tupac Shakur, Yes, Nile Rodgers, and Pearl Jam."
"__ROCK__ Wow, that's a really wide variety of bands. The oldies, YES, to alternative superstars Pearl Jam, to rapper Tupac."
"__ROCK__ I'm glad Pearl Jam is being inducted, they have always been one of my favorite alternative rock bands."
"__ROCK__ People say Eddie Vedder is a nice guy too."
"__ROCK__ He has a really unique voice. I was lucky enough to see the band at an outside concert once, and his voice just floats through the air."
"__ROCK__ Where was the concert at?"
"__ROCK__ Wisconsin. I drove past all these green lush fields, lots of cows, and then there was tents everywhere with concert goers and it looked like Woodstock or something."
"__ROCK__ Pearl Jam should have sang the song lyrics differently, instead of Yellow Ledbetter, they should have sung Yellow Ledbutter."
