"__BASEBALL__ Did you hear about Ngoepe ?"
"__BASEBALL__ You mean the first black African to play in the Major Leagues?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I did."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you think?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well as the industry struggles with declining participation by black Americans, I think it could go either way."
"__BASEBALL__ Some are saying having a Black African playing professional baseball is the pinnacle of achievement in baseball for the people of that race."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess you can say that."
"__BASEBALL__ It’s really an unspoken thing."
"__BASEBALL__ Let's wait and see how he does and how he is treated."
"__BASEBALL__ As a baby, in the waning days of apartheid, Ngoepe lived in a hut in Limpopo, the northernmost province in South Africa."
"__BASEBALL__ Needing a way to provide for her sons, Maureen left the children with her parents and found work cleaning houses."
"__BASEBALL__ He has come a long way. I am sure of it but this is a whole different situation."
"__BASEBALL__ He is in the Major Leagues now."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. Life as he once knew it is over."
"__BASEBALL__ He has a tattoo of Africa on his left shoulder, and I think he already knows life will be different when he returns home."
"__BASEBALL__ You know he  scored a run against the Cincinnati Reds after a wild pitch on Tuesday?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I didn't. I have been a little too busy lately to keep up with baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ One of his teammates hugged him after he hit a single off the Chicago Cubs’ Jon Lester late last month."
"__BASEBALL__ I saw that game. That was Kimera Bartee who hugged him."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he will be alright for the sport."
