"__MOVIES__ Do you have any good movies you'd recommend?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, what do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I tend to steer away from anythink dark, depressing or scary."
"__MOVIES__ I might suggest Dan in Real Life. I've watched it several times already."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably the most famous actors are Steve Carrell and Dane Cook."
"__MOVIES__ I like Steve Carrel from The Office. What's the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ Family, love, life, all that good stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a romance?"
"__MOVIES__ It is described as such. I personally find it funny and slightly depressing, but in a funny way."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, it's funny how pathetic the characters are and the depressing situations they're in. You get attached to them and sad when things don't go their way."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, that might be kind of sad for me."
"__MOVIES__ If you like romances you might like it. But you have to not be in an already sensitive place to enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ I'll take heed. Maybe we should watch it together or have you seen it enough times already?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think it's the type of movie you could ever see too many times. Plus, there's a great duet with Steve Carrell and Dane Cook doing 'Let my love Open the Door'"
"__MOVIES__ I love that song!"
"__MOVIES__ It's a really heartwarming movie. I like to cozy up in the colder months and watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Dan in Real Life it's called?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, and it's got Britt Robertson in it which is a plus. I like her in it."
