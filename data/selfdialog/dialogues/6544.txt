"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, who was the better character, Han Solo or Lando Clarissian"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, tough call, a very tough call indeed. I'd have to say they're dead even."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, how do you figure that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Han had rugged good looks and a roguish charm about him, but Lando was suave and refined, and a definite ladies man."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, Lando did feel little a Old West type gambler, while Han was more a cross between a cowboy and a pirate."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, one was a charming bad boy with fast ship, while the other was a genteel scoundrel with a gambler's flair."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus, they both could fight and fly with the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, remember Lando had some military experience and was the original owner of the Falcon."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Han Solo, according to some of his backstory, was once a cadet in the Imperial Fleet Academy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, if they haven't retconned that out already."
