"__DISNEY__ Are you a fan of Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I sure am."
"__DISNEY__ Which are your favorites, the older ones, or the newer ones"
"__DISNEY__ I think I like them both equally.  However, of the older ones, I think I life the little Mermaid best."
"__DISNEY__ Me too!  The songs are the best in that one, remember 'under the sea'?"
"__DISNEY__ Don't you think they should have had Robin Williams in that role?"
"__DISNEY__ I think that would have been a poor use of his skills. Although he was in the Aladdin one, right?"
"__DISNEY__ I know, but he would have been a great Sebastian"
"__DISNEY__ Agreed.  Now that I think about it, there was a great role for Robin Williams in EVERY Disney movie!"
"__DISNEY__ I think you are right."
