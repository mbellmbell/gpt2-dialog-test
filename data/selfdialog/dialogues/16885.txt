"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that movie with Beyonce in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ The one where she is married and her husband is being stalked by a co worker."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. You mean Obsessed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Girl, I saw that movie when it  first hit the theaters."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was good. You don't see too many serious movies with black people as leads in them."
"__MOVIES__ True. You're right about that. We are normally cast in comedy movies."
"__MOVIES__ Either that or we are killed off in the first half hour of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ But back to Obsessed. You must just saw on it on cable?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I didn't bother going to movie theaters when it came out nor did I buy it on DVD."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it? You didn't like it did you?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean the movie was okay but Beyonce is not a good actress in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I feel you on that."
"__MOVIES__ Then her character is too jealous and almost too controlling in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ You noticed that too? When she told her husband to get rid of the female temp, I was like who do you think you are?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm telling you. She acted like that man signed everybody's checks in that office."
"__MOVIES__ True plus that is how she landed him. And you know what they about what goes around comes around."
