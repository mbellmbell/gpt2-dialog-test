"__MOVIES__ I thought you said they were stupid."
"__MOVIES__ They are, but I like that kind of stuff."
"__MOVIES__ They are funny, right."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's fun watching something totally unrealistic like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and I like all the cameos."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so many people have been on those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of stupid movies in general?"
"__MOVIES__ If it's stupid, but funny."
"__MOVIES__ Give me an example."
"__MOVIES__ Idiocracy is stupid, but it's also hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ I think Idiocracy was smarter than Sharknado."
