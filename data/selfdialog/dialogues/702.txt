"__MUSIC__ Which five note do you play?"
"__MUSIC__ That depends on the pentatonic scale. There are versions"
"__MUSIC__ Start with the most common."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's not so much how common, because blues is common, which makes it minor pentatonic the most common."
"__MUSIC__ So then that's the answer."
"__MUSIC__ is that an happy answer?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't care."
"__MUSIC__ No it's not an happy answer, because that only addresses the commonality of the scale as opposed to minute nuances of the scales."
"__MUSIC__ Nuance, another BIG word for you."
"__MUSIC__ Ok.... aanyway. So minor pentatonic scale uses 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the natrual minor scale. So for A minor that's A, C, D, E, G and back to A."
"__MUSIC__ What happens if I start with c?"
"__MUSIC__ Then you will be playing the major pentatonic scale."
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ if you start with C, you get C, D, E, G, A and back to C. which is the major pentatonic scale."
"__MUSIC__ Is that the only difference?"
"__MUSIC__ yep."
"__MUSIC__ What happens if I start with G?"
"__MUSIC__ Now, if you want to know that we have to talk about the nature of the scales more."
"__MUSIC__ Fine, go ahead."
"__MUSIC__ Pentatonic scales can be classified into two categories -- hemitonic, or anhemitonic."
