"__MUSIC__ So when do you usually listen to music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm listening to music all the time. When i workout, when I game, when I do homework."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too. I couldn't function without music."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ All different kinds, and it depends on what I'm doing."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. For example when I workout i listen to EDM, and when I do homework, I listen to chill."
"__MUSIC__ Wow it's the opposite for me. When I do homework, I listen to EDM and when I go for a jog I listen to chill music or oldies."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny. I guess we have opposite tastes. What are you favorite EDM tracks?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Calvin Harris, Eden, anything mainstream really."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they're pretty good. I also listen to them, and some dubstep too when I workout."
"__MUSIC__ How do you listen to dubstep. It's just a bunch of noise."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. The chaos gets me pumped when I'm lifting weights."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that makes sense. I mostly workout by running, so all that noise doesn't really make sense."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe the dubstep will make you run faster."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe."
"__MUSIC__ One thing I used to do was do a light jog on the chorus, and when the drop came on, I would go ham and start sprinting."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting way to exercise."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's kind of like lifting weights except cardio in a sense."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's true. Go write a book man."
"__MUSIC__ Haha shut up."
