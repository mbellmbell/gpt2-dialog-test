"__MOVIES__ The Wonder Woman movie looks really good."
"__MOVIES__ I don't really like DC movies."
"__MOVIES__ Suicide Squad I could understand, but you don't like Man of Steel?"
"__MOVIES__ It was okay. Didn't much care for Batman v Superman either."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess, you like Marvel films?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha, no. I don't care for superhero pictures in general."
"__MOVIES__ Has there ever been a superhero movie you really liked?"
"__MOVIES__ I remember enjoying Spawn when it first came out. It probably doesn't hold up anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the CGI in that movie looks so bad now."
"__MOVIES__ Most '90s movies that used CGI look bad now."
"__MOVIES__ Not Jurassic Park."
"__MOVIES__ Jurassic Park didn't use much CGI. But even the CGI it did use doesn't look that good anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, I know! The Phantom Menace!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's your argument for good '90s CGI?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, things like Jar-Jar don't hold up, but like the battle droids and ships and stuff still look nice almost 20 years later."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, maybe, but you also have to remember that Star Wars had like, a hundred million more dollars in its budget compared to Spawn."
"__MOVIES__ Money isn't everything. Plenty of low-budget films look good."
"__MOVIES__ Like what? Name one."
"__MOVIES__ The original Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ Ha! I should've seen that coming!"
