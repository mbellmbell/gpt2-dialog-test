"__THRILLER__ Did you ever end up seeing that movie, 'Split'?"
"__THRILLER__ No, I think it might really freak me out. Is that the movie about the guy with split personalities?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and he kidnaps these girls and his various personalities torment them."
"__THRILLER__ But wasn't one personality trying to save them?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, and they were definitely fooled at first. But his other personalities always take over before they can be rescued by that particular one."
"__THRILLER__ That is so scary. Do you think it's realistic?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, no. Not at all. I think the disorder is very real, but it is sort of a far reach."
"__THRILLER__ That makes me feel better about seeing it. Who plays the main character?"
"__THRILLER__ James McAvoy is the lead character. He is absolutely brilliant in it."
"__THRILLER__ Wow, he is an awesome actor. I'm definitely going to check it out now."
