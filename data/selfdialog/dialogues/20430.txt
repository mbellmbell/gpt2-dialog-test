"__MOVIES__ Did you see Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and I loved it! One of the best movies I've seen in awhile."
"__MOVIES__ I know, same here! I've actually been to see it 3 times now."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Well I was actually thinking of seeing it a second time."
"__MOVIES__ You wanna go together?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you you, haha!"
"__MOVIES__ I just love how they've made a super hero movie about a woman, and she totally kicks butt."
"__MOVIES__ And without being sexist, for the most part!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! Did you know it was directed by a woman?"
"__MOVIES__ For real? That makes total sense!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, her name is Patty Jenkins. She's the one who directed Monster, too."
"__MOVIES__ Ohh, I saw that one. I didn't care much for it though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a little too dark for my taste."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. But Wonder Woman on the other hand - I can't get over how awesome it is."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, yeah, you know you mentioned Monster being too dark. Wonder Woman was the perfect balance of light and darkness."
"__MOVIES__ I loved how optimistic she is. She still believed in the good of people after all that she saw in the war."
"__MOVIES__ That's who Wonder Woman is. She really cares about people."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm officially a Wonder Woman fan now! Do you know if they're coming out with a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard Patty Jenkins is already working on the script, so fingers crossed we're going to get it soon!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I hope so! I'm legitimately excited about it - which I don't think I've said any sequel!"
