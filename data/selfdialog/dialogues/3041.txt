"__MUSIC__ Have you seen the Apple Airpods commercial?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, why?"
"__MUSIC__ It has an awesome song."
"__MUSIC__ What's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ Down, by Marian Hill"
"__MUSIC__ Aw yeah, that one's pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah my favorite part is when the dancer puts on the pods, and starts dancing to it. He just floats everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ That is pretty cool! I barely remember that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Even though the airpods themselves suck, the commercial is still pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't that air during the superbowl."
"__MUSIC__ That's right. I imagine Apple spent a lot of money on that commerical."
"__MUSIC__ It's funny that Marian Hill probably benefitted the most from that commerical."
"__MUSIC__ You're probably right. Let me check her numbers. Yeah wow, she started trending after that."
"__MUSIC__ Makes sense, Down is a pretty catchy song."
"__MUSIC__ Not to mention it's really unique. It has an awesome drop."
"__MUSIC__ Not to mention it's smooth."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Too much electronic music nowadays just focuses on the drop."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I agree. The parts in between are boring, and you're just waiting for the drop."
"__MUSIC__ I'm looking forward to Marian Hill's stuff in the future."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!"
