"__ACTION__ Hey, man what's your favorite Chuck Norris movie?"
"__ACTION__ Delta Force and you?"
"__ACTION__ Me, too! I love the chase scene in Beirut."
"__ACTION__ That's good, but when they storm the terrorist compound at the old school, that's better."
"__ACTION__ You have a point, I especially like when Chuck Norris shoots the radio after the one terrorist leaders offers to negotiate."
"__ACTION__ That is fun, and so's when the terrorist reinforcments charge the school, only to turn right around when Chuck triggers the explosive charges they rigged to it."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, that's funny, they're all gung-ho charging forward and then they are falling over each other to get away."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, but Lee Marvin has one of the best scences."
"__ACTION__ Which one?"
"__ACTION__ The one where he has that captured guy call the terrorist in the plane, and he comes out yelling ' what', and Marvin shoots him right between the eyes."
