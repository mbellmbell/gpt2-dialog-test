"__MUSIC__ What do you prefer, to stream music or own it?"
"__MUSIC__ Owning it is always preferable, but to be honest, streaming is just so much easier."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I hardly ever buy MP3s because I can just listen to songs on Spotify."
"__MUSIC__ I use Pandora myself, but Spotify is good, too. But if I buy music I try it on CD, since the quality is higher than MP3."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, it might be a little bit higher, but not enough to justify buying a whole album when I just want one or two songs, you know?"
"__MUSIC__ I get what you're saying. Buying individual songs is more convenient in the same way that streaming is."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you can just listen to what you want without having to sit through all the filler material."
"__MUSIC__ Another big advantage is discovering new music. Since you don't have to pay for each song, it's easier to find new artists you like."
"__MUSIC__ Spotify is pretty good about that. They have a whole 'Daily Mix' and 'Discover Weekly' which helps you find new songs."
"__MUSIC__ What's the difference between those?"
"__MUSIC__ Discover Weekly is just brand new songs, and it changes every week. Daily Mix is a mix of old and new songs, divided by genre."
"__MUSIC__ I'm guessing your suggestions are based on music you've listened to before?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. It's a bit like YouTube in that it recommends you new things based on your data."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, since you mention YouTube that's a pretty good place to find music too."
"__MUSIC__ True, though, I didn't use to like YouTube for music. Back in the old days, like in 2008, the bitrate wasn't so good, so music didn't sound very high quality."
"__MUSIC__ That was almost 10 years ago! The quality has come a long way since then, and YouTube is a great place to find new music as well."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, I've found a lot of smaller artists and songs you can't really find anywhere else."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, not mention covers of songs by amateur artists. It's great for that."
"__MUSIC__ You know, YouTubed Red was actually born out of Google Play Music and was meant to provide high-quality, commercial free music and recommendations before they expanded to they whole website."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard that it's actually a pretty good service, even compared to Pandara, Spotify, and Apple's offerings. I'm happy with Spotify, but if I were ever to switch I would probably consider them."
