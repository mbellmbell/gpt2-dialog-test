"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think is the NFL team of the future?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well either the Cowboys or the Texans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, with Dak the Cowboys seem to have a good future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Texans have a good coaching system, and with Watson who knows how things will look a couple years from now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets not forget they have a lights out defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man yeah they do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would be nice if they could get set at Quarterback too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, hold on to that defense for a few years and they will be a real threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys are already there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, some people say Dak is the new Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot like him, overlooked then lights out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets just see if he can keep it up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he can.  He looked pretty good out there this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Tampa Bay?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes!  Winston is pretty good and next year might be a sleeper."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Titans too.  Not too long ago these teams were trash."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and then drafted franchise QB's.  But Tampa has made the bigger turn around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think Winston is the better one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think one or both of those guys might make the playoffs next year."
