"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite Star Wars scene?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm going to have to go with, 'Luke, I am your Father.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. What a great plot twist."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. It almost made up for the movie being so boring."
"__STAR_WARS__ You didn't like Empire Strike Back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No. Return of the Jedi is my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a good one. But mine is still A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Very excellent film, but not my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who knows, maybe there'll be a new favorite in the next trillogy."
