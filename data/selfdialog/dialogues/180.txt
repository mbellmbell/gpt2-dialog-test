"__MUSIC__ So, what new bands have you found out about lately?  I know you're always finding out about something new or different."
"__MUSIC__ To tell you the truth, I recently found out about a Japanese hard rock/metal band called X Japan, and they're awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow!  So what do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ They sound like melodic metal or melodic hard rock depending on the song, at least their old stuff does."
"__MUSIC__ So they fit in with that glam rock that you always liked from the 1980s, correct?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  In Japan they are considered the innovators of the Visual Kei style of hard rock music, which is sort of the Japanese version of glam rock."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting.  So how did you stumble across them, I'm assuming on Youtube?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes it was Youtube.  I forget how it happened but I saw this video about them and Gene Simmons of KISS said they were amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ Really?  So they must be pretty big time and influential then."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes absolutely!  Gene Simmons said that if they were from America they could have been the biggest rock stars of all time!"
"__MUSIC__ Amazing.  How much have they sold so far in their career?"
"__MUSIC__ Let me check my phone...they've sold 30 million albums worldwide, and they're especially huge in Japan."
"__MUSIC__ That's not too surprising.  It's somehow strange that people just started hearing about them stateside."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it is, but one guy in the video said their drummer, Yoshiki, is a 'different level of rock star'."
"__MUSIC__ Well that sure sounds like a compliment.  It sounds like they're really good performers."
"__MUSIC__ They are!  Their old videos from the 80s and early 90s have am amazing level of energy and showmanship!"
"__MUSIC__ That makes me think about the Scorpions for some reason!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah just like the Scorpions they had an amazing level of energy back then."
"__MUSIC__ But do they take it to another level?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, why don't I show you a Youtube video I have bookmarked?"
