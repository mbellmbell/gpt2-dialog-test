"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think it was better than the original?"
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't say better, but different."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think I enjoy the Disney version more."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, because it was when I was a kid, and had a more simple animation and story."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but times evolve. Have you seen the new Alien?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did, it was dope."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought the story wasn't that good."
"__MOVIES__ It was worse than the previous, but the special effects were better."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they would come out with another prometheus."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I think the second one is coming out next year."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I haven't heard about that. I also have an alien tattoo?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, how big is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It covers my leg."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I don't have any tattoos. How much do you pay to see a movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Around 12 dollars"
"__MOVIES__ Wow the one near me only charges 8."
