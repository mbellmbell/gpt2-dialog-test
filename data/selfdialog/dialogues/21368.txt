"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen Se7en?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah.  I saw it once, I think."
"__THRILLER__ What did you think of it?"
"__THRILLER__ I thought it was really good."
"__THRILLER__ Really, I didn't care for it."
"__THRILLER__ I like stuff like that.  I just didn't expect the ending."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, the ending was really not expected.  That's what I didn't really like though."
"__THRILLER__ I thought that just sent it over the edge."
"__THRILLER__ I guess it wouldn't have had an effect without that ending."
"__THRILLER__ Well, no because he wouldn't have committed the last sin."
