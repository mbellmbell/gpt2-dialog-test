"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the Patriots as an organization?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love their consistency, but I hate their individual parts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think many people share your view."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it would be hard not to see that they are great, but that they steal and cheat to get results."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Bill Belichick is the greatest coach of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably, but I still don't like him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, he most likely is, but I feel disappointed that he is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get what you're saying about being impressed by them, but still feeling let down by them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It shouldn't be this way, and I should be enjoying their dominance and impressive control of the league for years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They kind of make it hard to cheer for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and they are boring with how they win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I think a win is a win, and ugly football still wins championships."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt, and some football purists would call their gameplan genius."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So when do you think they will fall as a dynasty?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's easy, whenever Belichick or Brady retires."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So no one else could fill their shoes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they have a perfect fit and understanding of each other, and no one else could be on the same page as them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What if they drafted a great quarterback that turned into the next Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be a nightmare for the league, and we would be stuck with more Patriot winning for the next two decades."
