"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When does the upcoming NFL Season start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The first game is on Thursday, September 7."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is playing that day?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chiefs are going to New England!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sweet! I can't wait for the season to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither. Which team is going to surprise everybody this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's got to be the Chargers! It's there first year in LA and you got to love their team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see them making the playoffs, but you don't see them getting past the Raiders, do you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a chance, you never know what you're going to get with Philip Rivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's possible but Rivers does throw a lot of interceptions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know. But you got to have faith! Who do you think will make the superbowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots and Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think it's going to be the same two teams? Come on, that never happens!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I do! The Patriots are always there so you can't bet against them. Do you at least agree on that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll give you the Patriots. But I'm going with the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks were my other option, they had a down year last year. I think they'll be back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Seahawks find a way to get Jimmy Graham involved they'll be back!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They haven't utilized him very well since they acquired him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They haven't. I bet they wish they had their starting center still. That offensive line has been horrible since."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I think that's why they've thrown the ball so much these last few years."
