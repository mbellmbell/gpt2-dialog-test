"__DISNEY__ I really think the movie Brave was a nice example of courage; how about you?"
"__DISNEY__ Eh, I don't think so. The movie was just kind of...boring. I mean, her mom got turned into a bear? Seriously?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Merida was pretty brave, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm, I guess so. but her three brothers are kind of just the comic relief."
"__DISNEY__ You're right about that, to be honest."
"__DISNEY__ Although, they were helpful when they provided a distraction."
"__DISNEY__ I really liked her Scottish culture."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, I like foreign culture movies."
"__DISNEY__ Like Aladdin, which takes place in Arabia."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah!"
