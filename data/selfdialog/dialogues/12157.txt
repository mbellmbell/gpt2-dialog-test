"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Andy Dalton will lead the Cincinnati Bengals to the Superbowl this season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! He's failed the past years how can you say that now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is going to be his year! I can feel it, with AJ Green healthy, the running game strong and the defense as strong as ever they're going to do it this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I highly doubt it. I think they'll have a good season like they always do but fall short again in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I look at their team this year and I look at the other teams in the AFC and I don't see a threat in their division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You only feel that way because Le'Veon Bell hasn't signed back with the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Steelers are getting old. Big Ben can't last a season without getting hurt and so this season I feel the Bengals have their best shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll be the same. I still think the Steelers are the team to beat in their division and I see them on the same levels as the Baltimore Ravens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're way better than the Ravens. The Ravens haven't really improved."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Ravens are well coached John Harbaugh is a very good coach and he gets the most out of his players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I won't disagree with you there but the talent level isn't there for the Ravens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's assume the Bengals win the division, they'll have to face the Patriots, Raiders, or Chiefs in the playoffs. That isn't any easy task."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're on the levels as those teams and I think you'll see Marvin Lewis really coach them to that next level this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're going to win 9 games at the most."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're underrating them! I think they're going to be an 11 win team at the least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll let you have that but I don't think they're going to win that many games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to come out of the AFC or at least challenge the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Raiders have a good shot but I also really like the Steelers once Le'Veon signs his contract."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sticking with my Bengals as the top team to come out!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're a true fan if your belief is that strong, I'll commend you on that."
