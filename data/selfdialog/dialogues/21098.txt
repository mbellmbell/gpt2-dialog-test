"__THRILLER__ Do you have a favorite particular series of thriller movies or one that you truly enjoy watching?"
"__THRILLER__ This may not be the answer you were expecting, but I’ve always loved the Scream franchise."
"__THRILLER__ I can believe that. I grew up watching those movies and always enjoyed them as well."
"__THRILLER__ Do you have a favorite movie of the four of them?"
"__THRILLER__ While Scream 2 was a good one, I don’t think you can top the original."
"__THRILLER__ I absolutely agree. That first movie had a little bit everything."
"__THRILLER__ Looking back on it years later, do you think there was a good blend of horror and dark comedy?"
"__THRILLER__ Definitely. When we were younger, we missed most of it, but now that we are older, it’s great."
"__THRILLER__ To be honest, I do not know many who are not fans of the Scream series."
"__THRILLER__ No surprise there. They aren’t the best ever, but that does not make them any less entertaining."
