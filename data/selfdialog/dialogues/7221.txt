"__LADY_GAGA__ Dude Lady Gaga is an amazing singer even a cappella."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree, and I don't even like poppy music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I feel like her music almost transcends genre."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It kind of does, I can grove to it a bit and it's not my preferred genre."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well I love her music and her so I may be biased."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm not. But her halftime show was kind of funny."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Haha, how so?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She kind of looked like spiderman coming down from the roof of the bowl."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well it's a stadium but hah, that's funny. Did you see that online?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah there were tons. But as they say, no press is bad press."
