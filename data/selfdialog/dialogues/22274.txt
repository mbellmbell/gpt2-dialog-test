"__DISNEY__ Who is your favorite Disney princess?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, easy!  My favorite princess for sure is Pocahontas."
"__DISNEY__ Really?  Why Pocahontas?"
"__DISNEY__ Obviously because she's one of the first that did not act like a complete 'damsel in distress'."
"__DISNEY__ She still ends up with the leading male at the end of the movie, just like all the other Disney princesses."
"__DISNEY__ Right, but she watches out for him and shows her father she's willing to sacrifice her life to save his when he gets captured."
"__DISNEY__ True.  I think Elsa is my favorite though because she truly does not rely on anyone but herself."
"__DISNEY__ Pocahontas doesn't really rely on anyone but herself either!"
"__DISNEY__ She's got Meeko and Flit who are her sidekicks."
"__DISNEY__ Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion."
