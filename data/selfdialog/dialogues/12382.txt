"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We've got another football team in LA!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! The Chargers and the Rams are here now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which would you rather see?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say the Chargers. I think they're going to be better this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree and the AFC West is looking really good now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No joke, I think it might be the best division in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders took huge steps this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos still have that incredible defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Kansas City is looking as good as last year too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just comes down to the Chargers then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so. I think they had too many close games slip away last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I felt like they lost a lot of games late in the fourth quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if it'll swing their way this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, I'll try and get Chargers tickets this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear they're in Stubhub."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it only seats 30,000 so the environment is more intense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure they'll take every advantage they can get."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good luck getting tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks."
