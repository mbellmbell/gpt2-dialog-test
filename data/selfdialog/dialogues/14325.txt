"__HORROR__ Were you ever a fan of horror films?"
"__HORROR__ Some yes.  I like The Evil Dead series."
"__HORROR__ I do too!  The Army of Darkness film was my favorite."
"__HORROR__ That was probably my favorite as well.  I would love to see a modern day sequel where Ash goes back to the world he was in."
"__HORROR__ Do you think Army of Darkness is considered a horror film?  I kind of look at it as just an action film."
"__HORROR__ I do believe it is a horror film."
"__HORROR__ I just don't think it has the same type of suspense that horror films typically have.  Such as a Friday the 13th movie or The Blair Witch Project."
"__HORROR__ I think it possesses the familiar subject matter of horror films.  I believe it has some level of suspense coupled with strange, supernatural monsters."
"__HORROR__ Would you say that Army of Darkness is the in the same category as The Shining for example?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, I would admit that The Shining is a different type of horror film than Army of Darkness.  The comedy in the Army of Darkness may be what sets it apart."
