"__THRILLER__ What's the difference between a thriller and a horror?"
"__THRILLER__ They aren't really that much different, except a horror movie is more about graphic depictions of violence and blood."
"__THRILLER__ I would rather be spooked or scared than grossed out or horrified. I don't get why people enjoy watching people get mangled and mutilated."
"__THRILLER__ Me either."
"__THRILLER__ Are there any good thriller movies that came out lately?"
"__THRILLER__ The only good one that I thought was frightening was 'The Babadook.'"
