"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what's the deal with football anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like, why is everyone so obsessed with it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's a pretty universal game. I don't know why American Football has taken hold the way that it has, but football goes back hundreds of years and crosses all kinds of cultures."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, right. They call soccer 'football' outside the US, don't they."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, sort of. 'Soccer' is short for 'Associated Football', and it's the most popular football variant outside of the US, so everyone else tends to use the genericized term."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait, you mean they're actually the same game? Football and Soccer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sort of, but... back it up. There's a game called Football, right, and there are a zillion parallel versions of it that people play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But which one came first?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ None... of them? I mean, there must be a common ancestor, but all of the variant rulesets sprang up at around the same time in different isolated pockets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So... okay, variant rulesets. So they really are all the same game; just, different groups of people chose to use slightly different rules for some reason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I've been saying, right. It's mostly a university thing, you know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean different schools used different sets of rules for Football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Basically, right. And different schools had different influence, so their variants spread more readily than others, until we reached a few standardized sets that most people recognize."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You say a few. What other kind of football is there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you know Rugby."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. Oh, right -- so that's actually football, then? I've always thought of it as, sorta, halfway between football and soccer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's more or less what it is... except, rephrase it for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rephrase it? Like, it's a variant of football halfway between Associated Football and American Football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ By Jove, I think he's got it."
