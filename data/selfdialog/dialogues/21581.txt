"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast Movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No I haven't. Is it any good?"
"__DISNEY__ It was fantastic! I expected it to be worse than the original, but I was surprised."
"__DISNEY__ Why did you expect that?"
"__DISNEY__ Remakes are usually pretty bad in my opinion, but not this one."
"__DISNEY__ So what did you like the most about it?"
"__DISNEY__ The Beast had the most beautiful singing voice! There isn't a song for The Beast in the original."
"__DISNEY__ Seriously? I didn't know that!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's such a shame. The song added so much."
"__DISNEY__ I bet. I will definitely have to go see the movie soon since you got me so interested in it!"
