"__HARRY_POTTER__ Guess what I'm doing right now? Hint: it involves Harry Potter."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Let me guess, you're rewatching the entire series again? Which one are you on, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You caught me! No, I'm on 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's my least favorit--they changed so much from the book. The Firebolt was given to Harry at the beginning, not the end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're right, but we get to meet Sirius."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You mean Padfoot. The Maruader's Map is revealed in 'Prisoner of Azkaban' isn't it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think so! Fred and George Weasley give it to Harry Potter so that he can sneak around the castle and even into town."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's right! And then he sees Peter Pettigrew, or Wormtail, on the map even though he's supposed to be dead."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What a twist! That jerk, Wormtail, I can't believe he is the one responsible for James and Lilly Potter's death."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can! He's a wormy Wormtail. At least Harry got to finally have family in the end of that Book and Movie."
