"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Another day passes. Another day less until we finally see some football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so excited to see what all of the teams will do this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really want to see what these rookie and second year quarterbacks can do this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Guys like Wentz are definitely going to be an interesting watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The eagles look like they may have some pretty good weapons this time around so Wentz should flourish."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything is better than Agholor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wasn't he a top pick and he has absolutely done nothing for them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you look him up on YouTube all you find are lowlights. No highlights whatsoever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if it's a mental thing or he just doesn't care to better himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those terrible drops hint at it being mental honestly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What other quarterbacks are you looking into?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am intrigued by Goff from the Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know it has only been a year, but he has me worried."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely didn't show very much last season, although his team wasn't top notch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gurley was completely ineffective the entire season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah a rookie quarterback with no running game is almost a guarantee to set them up for failure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The old saying always goes a quarterback's best friend is a running game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. They don't really have top receivers either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know they have Tavon Austin, but that's about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could be great with any other team, but he's not really worthy of that contract with a low offensive talented team like the Rams."
