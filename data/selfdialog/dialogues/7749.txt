"__POP__ Do you like Ed Sheeran?"
"__POP__ Of course! It's legally required to think of him as perfect."
"__POP__ That's kind of sadly true, actually."
"__POP__ Yeah, people go crazy for him."
"__POP__ I'm not the biggest fan."
"__POP__ Why not?"
"__POP__ Well, I recognize his talent for sure, he's a good singer."
"__POP__ But..?"
"__POP__ But his melodies don't work. They jump around too much."
"__POP__ Seriously! Ever hear people try to sing along to Shape of You? It's like a wrong-note-festival!"
