"__MOVIES__ Did you see there is a new Pirates coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw the trailers. It looks OK."
"__MOVIES__ OK?!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, just a little too much CGI for my taste."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, studios are getting a little heavy handed with that these days."
"__MOVIES__ Some times it's a really good thing, when it enhances and isn't so front and center."
"__MOVIES__ I concur."
"__MOVIES__ Like the movie Troy?"
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, set back the time machine!"
"__MOVIES__ Ha! I just mean that there is hardly any there."
"__MOVIES__ Was there any at all?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. One scene in particular. The 'thousand' ships."
"__MOVIES__ What did they do."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it wasn't cost effective to build all those ship, so they built some and filled in with CGI."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ I would even know, other that I saw a behind-the-scenes thing."
"__MOVIES__ That is interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Like I said, enhancement is good when you can't tell."
"__MOVIES__ You're such a movie snob!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, right?!"
