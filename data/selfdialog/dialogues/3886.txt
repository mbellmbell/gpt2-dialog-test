"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I can get into Japanese music."
"__MUSIC__ Do you prefer rock or pop music, though?"
"__MUSIC__ I prefer pop music. But I haven't found anything I like from Japan."
"__MUSIC__ You should start with the basics. Do you know Utada Hikaru?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't say that I do. I did check out this girl Lea Dizon, though."
"__MUSIC__ Lea didn't really do much. Utada is more prolific."
"__MUSIC__ Who would you compare her to in the States?"
"__MUSIC__ She's kind of the closest you get to a Madonna."
"__MUSIC__ That's sounds good. Are her records good?"
"__MUSIC__ Deep River is my absolute favorite. But there's a lot to discover."
"__MUSIC__ I have been able to find quite a bit of Chinese music that I like."
"__MUSIC__ More traditional or pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Both actually. Have you heard of Bai Bing Bing?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I can't say that I have."
"__MUSIC__ She does more traditional type music, but I absolutely love the way she sings."
"__MUSIC__ Japan has a similar traditional style of music called Enka."
"__MUSIC__ If it's anything like the traditional pop music in China, I'll have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ You really should look into Jero."
"__MUSIC__ Who is Jero?"
"__MUSIC__ Jero is a new Enka artist, as crazy as that sounds."
