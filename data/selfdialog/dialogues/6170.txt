"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite jedi master?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite jedi master is Qui Gon Jin, played by Liam Neeson."
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite jedi master is Mace Windu."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it seems like all the really cool jedi end up getting killed."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know right? I honestly couldn't believe that Mace Windu was killed because of Annakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ It really kills me too that Qui Gon Jin was killed in the first movie, I mean come on, It's Liam Neeson."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, at least the legacy is about him essentially creating the most powerful jedi, even though he turned evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like he was kind of forced to, He became a really good jedi but the council wouldn't make him a master."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and the council didn't even want to give senator Palpatine a trial, like they should have, and Annakin was his friend."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who could even blame Annakin for becoming a Sith Lord."
