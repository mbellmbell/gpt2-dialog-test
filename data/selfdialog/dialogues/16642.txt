"__MOVIES__ I want to watch something that feels true to life and human relationships."
"__MOVIES__ Can you think of a movie that has done that for you in the past?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh, there's this one 80s movie Broadcast News that I've always really loved."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not familiar with it."
"__MOVIES__ You should definitely see it! It's hilarious and deep, it deals with failure and there's a really fun love triangle plotline."
"__MOVIES__ That does sound pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Well, do you have any suggestions for me?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I do. There's a Lynn Shelton movie from 2012 starring Mark Duplass called Your Sisters Sister that I adore."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a character named Jack whose brother has just passed away and he's feeling quite depressed."
"__MOVIES__ So like Garden State?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not really. His best friend previously dated his brother and he's hopelessly in love with her, but he's also going through a rough time."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a pretty compelling conflict, but one I've heard of before."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, that's not all there is. She decides that he needs a vacation so she offers to put him up in her father's cabin alone on an island to get some head space."
"__MOVIES__ Then she comes and visits him and they figure otu over a period of time that they're in love?"
"__MOVIES__ Not exactly. When Jack gets there he runs into his friend's sister, whom he's never met, Hannah. Hannah is a lesbian who recently got out of a relationship."
"__MOVIES__ So no chance of love for them?"
"__MOVIES__ They actually have a one night fling and then Iris, Jack's best friend, shows up as a surprise the next morning."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, this sounds super messy and complicated."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the acting and dialog are very real. It's also super hilarious."
