"__MOVIES__ I just got back from seeing Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was actually great!"
"__MOVIES__ That's outstanding! Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. They are both great in it too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah I imagine they are. Chris Pine is one of my favorite actors."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah mine too. I loved him in Star Trek."
"__MOVIES__ I loved him in that movie. He played Captian Kirk better than anyone."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't go that far, but he played him extremely well."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like the most about Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say the action scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I could easily see that. The previews made it look great."
"__MOVIES__ There was one scene in it that looked 100% real! I couldn't even tell it was CGI!"
"__MOVIES__ I love when movies do that!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Almost everything is CGI now, but it is great when you can't tell the difference."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that most CGI that is hard to tell the difference is smoke, cars, and dirt exploding."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that too, but I don't know why."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it is because it is predictable. Smoke has a distinct path it will travel."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that makes so much sense. You should go in to movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I wish. I just read the article about how CGI goes in movies."
