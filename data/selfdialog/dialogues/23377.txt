"__DISNEY__ We watched Brave the other night with the kids."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I love that movie!  What was your favorite part?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved when Merida shot all the targets that her 'suitors' shot, and did better than them."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that was so great.  I love seeing strong girl characters in movies."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, and when she climbed to the top of the mountain, that was fantastic!"
"__DISNEY__ I know, right?  Do you think they'll make a sequel?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, it's been what, five years?  If they were going to, they'd probably have announced it by now."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, you're probably right.  It's too bad, the movie was a lot of fun."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, like the triplet brothers becoming bear cubs?"
"__DISNEY__ They were hilarious!"
