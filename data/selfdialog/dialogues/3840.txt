"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to classical guitar?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean like Andre Segovia?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard it occasionally on classical radio, but I don't buy any for my own collection."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, yes. I think the guitar is a beautiful instrument. It has a certain intimacy that touches your soul."
"__MUSIC__ I agree."
"__MUSIC__ What songs do you like for the guitar?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, when speaking about classical guitar, instrumental pieces are not songs."
"__MUSIC__ I see. What do you call it then?"
"__MUSIC__ You could refer to it as a 'piece' or 'work' if you want to use a general term. A song only refers to a vocal work with instrumental accompaniment."
"__MUSIC__ I see. Then what piece do you think is good?"
"__MUSIC__ My personal favorites are 'La Catedral' by Agustin Barrios and 'Asturias' by Albeniz."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds Spanish. Is it Flamenco music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it is more serious than Flamenco music. Flamenco is more of a folk/dance type of music, while classical guitar is in the realm of fine art."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. So are they Spanish composers?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of the important classical guitar composers were from Spain, but Barrios, one of the most important, was a Peruvian composer."
"__MUSIC__ I see. Are there any other types of classical guitar compositions that don't have a Spanish origin?"
"__MUSIC__ There are many exceptions. It's quite common for classical guitarists to transcribe the works of Johan Sebastian Bach for the guitar. There are also important guitar pieces written by modern composers such as William Walton."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I think you've sparked an interest in me to seek out some classical guitar music and learn more about it."
