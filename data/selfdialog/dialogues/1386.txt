"__MUSIC__ Hey, I was going to make a playlist for the party this weekend, what kind of music do you think I should put on it?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh awesome, we definitely need something upbeat, like some good pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I have some Taylor Swift already downloaded."
"__MUSIC__ She's great! I think I liked every song on her album 1989."
"__MUSIC__ Great I'll definitely include that. I also have some Chainsmokerz, if you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely! Can you please add that Paris song too, that one is so catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I will. How do you feel about Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus?"
"__MUSIC__ They have some catchy music for sure! I think Miley is going country lately, so if you could add some stuff from her album Bangerz, that's all good party music."
"__MUSIC__ Perfect! I keep hearing Despacito on the radio, so I'll add that one too."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song! It's such a good rhythm I can't help dancing when I hear it."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! That's how I feel about that song Slide by Migos, it's just got such a dance feel."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, we should definitely include some hip-hop! I like 2 chainz and Frank Ocean, Drake, all of those guys."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Drake has a new song called Passionfruit that I think you would like, so I'll add that one too."
"__MUSIC__ We should also include some party classics, some older songs that everyone will recognize and like."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, we could add some AC/DC, or Michael Jackson?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes to both. I also think some Prince would be good, and maybe some 80s songs like Tina Turner, Aerosmith, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Perfect, I think this list will have something that everyone will like."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, we should also probably add some birthday related songs since it's the birthday party playlist. What about that Borgore cake song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, we could also include Go Shorty, It's Your Birthday. Everyone loves being sung to by 50 Cent"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's the perfect addition! This is going to be an awesome playlist."
