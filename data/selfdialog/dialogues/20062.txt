"__MOVIES__ So i was watching this movie called Lucy last week."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Good. It was cool science fiction."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ This girl studying in Asia, her sleasy boyfriend was a drug mule and he strong-armed her to do the next run."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, tell me more."
"__MOVIES__ Well, this drug was a brain enhansing drug but only to be taken in small doses."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess, she got dosed."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Heavily."
"__MOVIES__ Hm, i guess this is where the story takes off."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, her use of her brain exceeds 10% and increases as the movie continues."
"__MOVIES__ What happens then?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, her brain starts to develop powers. She can see cell calls, the internet, move things with her mind."
"__MOVIES__ Very cool. Then what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, she reached out to a famous brain scientist to see where she was going to end up at."
"__MOVIES__ Who stared in this?"
"__MOVIES__ Scarlet Johansen was Lucy and Morgan Freeman was the Brain Doctor. Everyone else was foreign actors."
"__MOVIES__ Right on! Is it something i should get?"
"__MOVIES__ I would recomend it. It keeps you intrigued for the whole movie."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, i'll check it out this weekend."
