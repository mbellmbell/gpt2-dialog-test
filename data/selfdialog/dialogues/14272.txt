"__HORROR__ Have you ever seen the movie, It Follows?"
"__HORROR__ Yes I did, it was really freaky!"
"__HORROR__ My favorite part is when they actually shoot 'it' and realize that it can't be killed."
"__HORROR__ My favorite part is the last scene where 'it' starts throwing the electronic devices in the pool to try and kill the girl its following."
"__HORROR__ Yeah that parts really freaky, how it shows up as her dead father."
"__HORROR__ Yeah it really illustrated how much 'it' wants to hurt people both mentally and physically."
"__HORROR__ It makes me wonder how it all started following people and killing them."
"__HORROR__ It is almost like it came from a demonic ritual or some type of weird spiritual thing."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, it really does. I wish they made another movie that explained it more."
"__HORROR__ That would be interesting, I'd definitely watch it."
