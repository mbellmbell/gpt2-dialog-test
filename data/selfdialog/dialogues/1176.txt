"__MUSIC__ I just heard that song Lay With You."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's my jam. You just now hearing it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ That thing at least five maybe six or seven years old."
"__MUSIC__ I don't where I was when they made this but the video is hot."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Those two look good together."
"__MUSIC__ You know El DeBarge been that dude ever since he married Janet Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. THOSE two should have made a song together."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think they could have made anything like this one though."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I want to hear some Mariah Carey."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ I like My All. I think I might go put that on the stereo."
"__MUSIC__ What do you have, Pandora?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I got all my music on download. I have over two thousand songs."
"__MUSIC__ That's all?"
"__MUSIC__ That's all? Do you know how long it took me to add two thousand songs to my library?"
"__MUSIC__ You lame. I got over ten thousand in mine."
"__MUSIC__ I guess so when you be downloaded seven-hundred-song-playlists at a time."
