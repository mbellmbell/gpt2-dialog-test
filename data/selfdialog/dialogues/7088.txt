"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Ottawa Senators last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I did, I can't believe it was such a low-scoring game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know right? Didn't the score end up 1-0?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah it did, and the Penguins won."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Most of the games this season have been higher scoring than that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who ended up scoring the game winning goal for the Pens?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It was Kessel that made it."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He's playing really well this post-season."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ For sure, the guy is a really good player."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think they will trade him after the season is over?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't see how they can with the way he is playing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's true but you never know."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think it depends more on who they draft."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's right, if they draft a younger player with a good outlook they could trade him."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think they can go all the way this year?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think they can for sure, but the next series will be really tough."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I would like to see Crosby get a ring this year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I would too, the guy is unbelievable."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He will have a chance to go down as the greatest player ever."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't think he will ever be as good as Gretzky was."
