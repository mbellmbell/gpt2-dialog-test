"__MOVIES__ Hey, I'm looking for a World War II movie to watch this weekend. Any ideas?"
"__MOVIES__ Saving Private Ryan is good. You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks."
"__MOVIES__ Seen it a hundred times."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Who are you watching with?"
"__MOVIES__ My grandpa."
"__MOVIES__ I would recommend a A Bridge To Far. It's about D-Day."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, kind of like Band of Brothers?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but just a movie, not a series. It was made in the 1970s."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, any other recommendations?"
"__MOVIES__ There's also The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, about a concentration camp. Kind of depressing though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, I've heard about that. The son of the German commander makes friends with a prisoner or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Does not end well."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm, something lighter, maybe."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, Inglorious Basterds is less of a downer. Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and some dark humor."
"__MOVIES__ That might be good. Do you know of any old movies about WWII?"
"__MOVIES__ He has probably seen Mr. Roberts. It's an oldy but goody. Takes place on a Navy ship. Very moving."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, my mom loved that movie. Jack Lemmon right? She loved Jack Lemmon."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you have some choices."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'll queue up Mr. Roberts, for old times sake."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. Have a good weekend!"
