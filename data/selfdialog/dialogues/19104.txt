"__MOVIES__ So, I went to All Eyez on Me, finally."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? Why did you do that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Tupac Shakur, he was a giant figure in music, really. In politics too, I guess, or in culture, you might say."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. So now you feel you know him?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that. I knew nothing about him before, now I think I know a little bit."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the film seemed kind of shallow. That's what I've heard from other people too."
"__MOVIES__ He really did have an interesting life, they did show that. His mother had a strong influence on him, plainly."
"__MOVIES__ Mothers do, and she was very political. As a  Black Panther, you know."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I know, now. That's the thing, people like me know nothing about Tupac's life, really."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure you'll really get to know him from this little biopic though."
"__MOVIES__ Yet it's an introduction to his life, and his music."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if you got a real idea of his power and the strength of his ideas."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to learn more. Plainly the film was meant as a sort of sketch of the man."
"__MOVIES__ I bet it spent lots of time on his romances, too. And on his legal problems."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it did. Those were some of the more sensational elements of his life."
"__MOVIES__ But don't you think there was more to him than that? He  was an artist, with a great mind."
"__MOVIES__ I dont know if you got that from the movie. I got how much trouble he was in."
"__MOVIES__ His violent death, too, I'm sure that was a big plot point."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, of course. It's still a mystery--Tupac is still a mystery to me, really."
"__MOVIES__ Well, just listen to his music. That's how to know him."
