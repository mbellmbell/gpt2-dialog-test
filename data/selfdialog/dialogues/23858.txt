"__SUPERHERO__ So, who is the best Batman of all time?"
"__SUPERHERO__ For my money, I'll say Michael Keaton is the best Batman, but the Christian Bale trilogy are the best Batman movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ I can agree with that.  Who was the better Joker, Jack or Heath?"
"__SUPERHERO__ It's really hard to say-- both really nailed the role in different ways.  I'll say Heath Ledger, because his role is so iconic now."
"__SUPERHERO__ What about the best Catwoman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'll say that every Catwoman but Halle Berry is tied for first place, because that Catwoman movie was the worst thing to ever happen."
"__SUPERHERO__ Do you know what would be really cool?  If they could do an Avengers/Justice League crossover in the movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't ever see movie executives putting aside their egos long enough for that to happen, but it would make all the money in the world."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, it would be amazing-- Superman on screen with Captain America, Batman with Iron Man."
"__SUPERHERO__ It would be amazing, no doubt.  I wonder who the villain would be?"
