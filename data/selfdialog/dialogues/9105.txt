"__BASEBALL__ How can you watch this stuff? It's so boring."
"__BASEBALL__ What? Baseball? It's an exciting game"
"__BASEBALL__ Excting? Right. Because watching dudes run in a circle after a ball. Real fun."
"__BASEBALL__ It is! You just have to understand the game."
"__BASEBALL__ I understand the game. I don't understand how you can like it."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I use to play in high school so..."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you? Did you wear the super tight pants too?"
"__BASEBALL__ Of course. And my bum looked great."
"__BASEBALL__ Haha. So who is winning?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Braves. The are up by 4 and it's the last inning."
"__BASEBALL__ Looks like they are going to win the whole thing,"
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe. The guy up to bat now isn't very good. He could mess up the whole thing for everyone."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do they let him bat then?"
"__BASEBALL__ They have to. Part of the rules."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, that's dumb."
"__BASEBALL__ Agreed. But it is what it is."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess. The only good thing about baseball is all the food."
"__BASEBALL__ You are ridiculous."
"__BASEBALL__ What? Hotdogs and beer."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess."
