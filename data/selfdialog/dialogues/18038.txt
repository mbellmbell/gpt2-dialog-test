"__MOVIES__ Have you heard about Top Gun 2?"
"__MOVIES__ What? They made a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently they have signed on and it will be in production soon."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I never thought I'd see that happen."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I'm afraid it will be horrible."
"__MOVIES__ That's definitely a movie that doesn't really need a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the first was so good and with Goose gone, the chemistry won't be there."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they will say Meg Ryan was pregnant and Goose's kid will be all grown up now."
"__MOVIES__ That would be interesting!"
"__MOVIES__ Have they said who is going to be in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Tom Cruise is for sure signed on."
"__MOVIES__ Anyone else?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Val Kilmer tweet about it yesterday."
"__MOVIES__ Is he doing it for sure?"
"__MOVIES__ It didn't sound like he knew much about it, but he said he was ready to reprise his role."
"__MOVIES__ He would kind of have to be there wouldn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess so."
"__MOVIES__ I'm unsure how I feel about it all."
"__MOVIES__ I'm the same way. I will see it if it's made though."
"__MOVIES__ I will too."
