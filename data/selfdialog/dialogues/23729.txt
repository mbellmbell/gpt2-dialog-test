"__DISNEY__ Does your son have a favorite movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, he loves Moana. Maui is his favorite character."
"__DISNEY__ Does he already have an action figure of Maui? I saw one in the store yesterday that might be perfect."
"__DISNEY__ Nothing yet."
"__DISNEY__ Perfect! I think I found a birthday present for him then."
"__DISNEY__ I know he'll love it."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, what about the movie? Do you guys have a copy?"
"__DISNEY__ No, we can stream it from Netflix now, but I don't know how long that will last."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. Maybe I'll grab a blu-ray copy and tuck that in the bag."
"__DISNEY__ That would be amazing! I know he'd love the gift."
