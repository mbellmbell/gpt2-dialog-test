"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Founder?"
"__MOVIES__ Remind me what that was again?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a movie based on the history of McDonalds.  Starred Michael Keaton."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes!  I did, I really enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, me too.  I had no idea McDonalds was found by someone other than Ray Kroc."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither.  I did not know the full history until I saw the movie."
"__MOVIES__ The movie quietly had a really good cast."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Michael Keaton of course.  But also Nick Offerman, Laura Dern, BJ Novak, and some others."
"__MOVIES__ Keaton has had quite the career resurgence."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed, he really has some momentum now."
"__MOVIES__ It's really crazy to think about how long he's been acting and some of his roles when he was young."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  There was Batman, but he was also in a lot of other stuff in the past."
"__MOVIES__ I remember Beetlejuice, Gung Ho, and a lot of others."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I really liked Beetlejuice.  And of course Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like him in Birdman?"
"__MOVIES__ I did.  It was a tongue in cheek reference to his actual career."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, that's what made it funny."
"__MOVIES__ Anyways, back to The Founder.  Did he deserve an Oscar for this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think so.  He was terrific in it, but there were better actors this past year."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree."
