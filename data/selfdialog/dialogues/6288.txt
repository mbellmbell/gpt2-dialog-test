"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, just curious which one of the Star Wars movies is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably the Empire Strikes back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why? Jedi was a much better movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jedi had such a bad warm fuzzy ending though, it was very cheesy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why does that make Jedi a bad movie though?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, there are tons of movies with obvious happy endings, it just seemed kind of lame to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well what's so special about the Empire Strike back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke gets his hand cut off, the Rebellion is in bad shape, it ended on a negative tone."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why does that make it better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because its rare to see movies end on a negative, it was refreshing."
