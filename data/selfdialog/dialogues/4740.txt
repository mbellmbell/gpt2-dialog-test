"__MUSIC__ What kind of music are you listening to now a days?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been back to listen to 90's music.  For some reason I just can't stop listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean that was some of the best music that there has ever been,"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, they was some many different kinds to listen to.  It takes me back to my days in high school/college."
"__MUSIC__ I use to love Nirvana, Pearl Jam and some of the alternative/rock type bands."
"__MUSIC__ But then you could easily here some hip/hop and Pop and not have to change the station."
"__MUSIC__ I need to look into that Satellite radio so I can just listen to 90's or 2000's tunes."
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of expensive but well worth it."
"__MUSIC__ I try to get my kids to listen to the older music but they want nothing to do with it.  It's all Nicki M and Nick Jonas, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Today's music isn't bad, just different."
"__MUSIC__ I wish we had a station that combined all the different type of music onto 1 channel.  That would be much more enjoyable to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Have you gone to any concerts lately?  Live music is also very good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I went see Maroon 5.  They have a lot of hits and I thought it would be a good show."
"__MUSIC__ Was it a good show?  They sounds like they'd be good in person."
"__MUSIC__ They were awesome, a lot better than I expected.  You could tell Adam Levine was getting older since he couldn't hit the high notes."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, did they have anyone cool opening for them?"
"__MUSIC__ It was suppose to be Tove Lo but since the concert was delayed a few months it was a couple of nobodys."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad, Tove Lo would of made for a better show."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, my wife was disappointed but Maroon 5 made up for it with their performance."
"__MUSIC__ I bet.  I'll have to check them out if they come somewhere near by."
