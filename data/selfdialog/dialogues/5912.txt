"__STAR_WARS__ Hey Larry, that hat you are wearing looks familiar."
"__STAR_WARS__ It should. It's yours."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's where I saw it before. On my head."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but it looks better on me though. On me, it looks like a Storm Trouper's helmet"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see that."
"__STAR_WARS__ When I wear this hat, I look like an intergalactic space soldier getting ready to do some serioua damage on the rebel forces.."
"__STAR_WARS__ Welll, what do I look like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah!"
"__STAR_WARS__ You look like a damaged mushroom."
