"__MUSIC__ Do you like Fleetwood Mac?"
"__MUSIC__ I have no strong opinion either way, really. Do you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I love them, actually."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. What makes you such a fan?"
"__MUSIC__ I think the whole story of the band is great. They went through a lot."
"__MUSIC__ How is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's named after Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. They formed in England as a Blues band"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and eventually most of the members dropped and they picked up two unknowns named Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks"
"__MUSIC__ Well they're not so unknown anymore, that's for sure"
"__MUSIC__ Seriously, and at that time they move away from blue and into Rock"
"__MUSIC__ Interesting, not that many bands just totally switch styles"
"__MUSIC__ True, and the whole band had a lot of personal drama"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Buckingham and Nicks dated and broke up and were not on good terms. A few other band members dated too"
"__MUSIC__ I can definitely see why that caused some conflict"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. If you listen to most of their old songs, you can tell they're breakup songs or about them not getting along, especially on their album Rumors"
"__MUSIC__ I would have never guessed, that's crazy"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah most of the band didn't either. They kept it a secret"
"__MUSIC__ Someone should write a biography!"
