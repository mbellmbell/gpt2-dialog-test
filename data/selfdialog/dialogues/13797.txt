"__BASKETBALL__ How about the NBA lottery results the other night."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah Boston, Lakers and Sixers wents 1, 2, & 3."
"__BASKETBALL__ I had no doubt that the Celtics and Lakers would be 1 & 2."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, did you think it would be fixed."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, it's hard to ignore that."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess, but they did have a good chance to be at the top."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sucks for the Sixers because they would have gotten the Lakers pick if it was lower than #3."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, but the Sixers did move up to #3.  And they get the Lakers pick next year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I guess but I think this draft will be a lot better."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is a nice deep draft."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm guessing Fultz goes #1 to Celts, especially with Isaiah Thomas' injury this postseason."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh I have no doubt.  Will be a force for the Celts."
"__BASKETBALL__ Then I guess the Lakers take Lonzo Ball, but I could see them passing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Man, I wouldn't want to deal with the circus that is his dad."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, the kid can ball but what a nightmare."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not even sure how good he will be in the NBA."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh I think he will be pretty good.  He can distribute well."
"__BASKETBALL__ But he's slow, long but slow.  I think he has trouble defending point gaurds."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, could be, you might be right."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wouldn't surprise me to see the Lakers take Josh Jackson instead."
