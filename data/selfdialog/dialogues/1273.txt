"__MUSIC__ There's certain music or songs that you listen to and afterwards you feel like you commited a sin."
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha ha .Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Well. Rihanna. I really like her I mean I can really jam to the music but afterwards I feel so dirty"
"__MUSIC__ Really. I didn't know a song had that kind of power"
"__MUSIC__ Well it depends on the artist and the lyrics I guess"
"__MUSIC__ Well personally I don't listen to Rihanna but she's not really known for being classy"
"__MUSIC__ Meaning why am I listening to her?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah I mean your not really the type to listen to all that cursing and stuff"
"__MUSIC__ Well sometimes its by accident, like you go out somewhere and music by her is playing"
"__MUSIC__ So then you go home and you listen to her songs on your own time"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly this is how you get hooked on these things"
"__MUSIC__ They play songs that you might not normally listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Then you listen to a few more of the songs and the lyrics get bad"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. And thats when you start to feel the dirtiness"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. Then I start to feel like why am I listening to Rihanna,  when her songs just make me feel bad?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it seems like you've been suckered into it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I mean her earlier songs from the start of her career weren't too bad"
"__MUSIC__ They were innocent enough, in that song called 'Umbrella' she actually sounds like she wants to be a friend"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and there's no cussing in that one either"
"__MUSIC__ I guess you need to think twice before you listen to Rihanna's music"
