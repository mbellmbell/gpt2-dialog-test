"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey just so you know, I'm not coming to the Jets Giants preseason game this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What, why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets have no quaterback this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, the Giants have no O line again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess thats true, but still I don't think Petty is gonna get us any wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't let that keep you from a day of tailgaiting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I hate to watch my boys loose another season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We go despite knowing our teams wont do well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least you guys had 11 wins and got to the wild card game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and we lost that to Green Bay, getting to the wild card game was a gift."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We had 5 wins last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, not the best record. Still, you gonna miss a day of tailgating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just can't cheer a loosing team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think of the burgers and cold beer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were really tasty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And we had amazing seats, right over the tunnel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I still have the pictures from last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The one you got of Eli was great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, I'll come this year, at least they might win one preseason game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they'll have a quaterback by then."
