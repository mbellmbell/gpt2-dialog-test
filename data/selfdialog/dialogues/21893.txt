"__DISNEY__ Did you see Cars 2 yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No not yet, but I heard good things about it."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it has gotten some good reviews."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that it is better than the last film they made."
"__DISNEY__ Yes that one was ridiculous with the spy theme."
"__DISNEY__ This one is supposed to stick to car racing like the original."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds good. I will probably see it tomorrow."
"__DISNEY__ It is nice that Disney put out a movie that is not just princess themed."
"__DISNEY__ I know. It sometimes seems unfair to boys with all these princess themed movies."
"__DISNEY__ So true. Well let me know what you think about it after you see it."
