"__BASEBALL__ Hey do you like baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure it's ok."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you follow any teams?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not really during the season, it's too long."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah true, ever been to a game?"
"__BASEBALL__ Once or twice."
"__BASEBALL__ What team did you go see?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Texas Rangers."
"__BASEBALL__ Cool, I hear their ballpark is nice."
"__BASEBALL__ It's pretty nice but not near the tradition of someone like the Red Sox or Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, they're a pretty young franchise all things considered."
"__BASEBALL__ Agreed, did you see the world series they played against the Cardinals?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that was a good one, went all 7 games."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes I couldn't believe the Rangers lost game 6."
"__BASEBALL__ I know right?! They were within 1 strike of winning the whole series and the Cardinals came back and won."
"__BASEBALL__ I was stunned, and my dad was pretty upset."
"__BASEBALL__ Is he a Rangers fan?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he's been a fan for a while."
"__BASEBALL__ I've only been watching for 5 years."
"__BASEBALL__ I followed it off and on but my dad's been watching it since way back in 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcerâ€™s table."
