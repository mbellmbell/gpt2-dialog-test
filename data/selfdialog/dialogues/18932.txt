"__MOVIES__ I feel like going to the movies this weekend. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like a good idea, what are you thinking of seeing?"
"__MOVIES__ I've been wanting to see the new Pirates of the Carribbean movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I'm not too sure about that."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the last one was not very good. It wasn't the same without Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly."
"__MOVIES__ But Johnny Depp was still in it. He makes the whole series!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, but it just seems like there was too much of just his antics and no real story."
"__MOVIES__ I can agree with you on that one; they tried to make it more humorous and it did not really work"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, even Ian McShane couldn't save that one."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, but this one actually brings back Bloom and Knightly."
"__MOVIES__ Really? They brought them back?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I guess Disney thought the same thing about On Stranger Tides and decided to bring them back."
"__MOVIES__ But isn't their story over? Bloom's Will Turner is now the captain of the Flying Dutchman and they're married, what more can they do?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, but I saw the previews for this one and this looks promising."
"__MOVIES__ I'm still a little worried about this. They've already done four movies"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they are planning on making a couple of more after Dead Men Tell No Tales."
"__MOVIES__ Really?! They are going to run this series into the ground!"
"__MOVIES__ I can see what you are seeing, but this one may help strengthen the fanchise again."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm still not sure, but I'll be willing to go see it. When do you want to go?"
