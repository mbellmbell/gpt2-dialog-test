"__MUSIC__ Hey, were you ever a Guns n Roses fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?  I loved them!"
"__MUSIC__ I still do.  Axl Rose is an amazing artist."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he totally was.  They've had great music from the get go."
"__MUSIC__ When did they first come out?"
"__MUSIC__ I think their first release was in 1987.  It was Appetite for Destruction."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that was an awesome album.  That had Sweet Child Of Mine."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Paradise City.  The whole album was great."
"__MUSIC__ I think Sweet Child Of Mine was their first Billboard Hit."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it was.  After that, they had that Lies album."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that wasn't quite as good as Appetite For Destruction, but I still liked it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I agree.  Who was in the band aside from Axl Rose?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there was Slash, Izzy, Duff, and then the drummer.  I forgot his name."
"__MUSIC__ They were all great.  I wonder what they're up to now."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  The last albums I bought were the Use Your Illusion albums."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I loved those too!  That had November Rain, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was a beautiful song."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, a little softer than their original stuff but it was still amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I liked the soft quality of it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it managed to be soft but still be a hard rock song."
