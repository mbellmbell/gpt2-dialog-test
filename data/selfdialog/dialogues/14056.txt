"__BASKETBALL__ Do you Think Kobe Bryant is better than Lebron James?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No because Lebron is better."
"__BASKETBALL__ But Kobe has 5 championships."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's not fair because he has played 20 seasons."
"__BASKETBALL__ But he's been to the finals the same amount of times as Lebron which gave them equal opportunity."
"__BASKETBALL__ True but Lebron's career is not over."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm just saying you can't be better than someone and not have more championships."
"__BASKETBALL__ Robert Horry has more championships than Michael Jordan does that make him better than him?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess you have a point there."
"__BASKETBALL__ I will admit Kobe has had a better career than Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Doesn't that make him better?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No because just because he had a better career doesn't mean he is more skilled."
"__BASKETBALL__ Please elaborate."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron is a more skilled player than Kobe but Kobe has been around longer."
"__BASKETBALL__ What skills does Lebron have that Kobe doesn't?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron can pass, rebound, play defense, run and EVERYTHING else."
"__BASKETBALL__ So what you're saying is that Kobe is good at some things but Lebron is good at everything?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, Kobe never shot above 47 percent from the field in a season but Lebron has shot 57 percent from the field in a season."
"__BASKETBALL__ So I see, Kobe has had the better career but Lebron is a better player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly."
