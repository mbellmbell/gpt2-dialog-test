"__BASKETBALL__ So sad that the Pistons didn't make the playoffs last season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah really.  They used to be such a good team.  I mean they are supposed to still be a good team!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, at least they say they are.  The fact that they couldn't even make the playoffs was just so substandard."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly, I expected better."
"__BASKETBALL__ That was so awesome when the had some really good players like Joe Dumars back in the 80s."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, that was the pinnacle of it back then."
"__BASKETBALL__ Though you've got to give the Rasheed Wallace era of the 2000s a fair shake too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he was a great player but he could have handled himself better."
"__BASKETBALL__ He was a bit of a character, always getting into arguments with referees."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he was sort of the John McEnroe of basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, haha!  That's a good one."
"__BASKETBALL__ But there was no doubt about his talent or how good of a player he was."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can't wait to see the new stadium downtown, that is going to be so cool."
"__BASKETBALL__ Now that you mention it, I was thinking about that the other day!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Big time development downtown, with the new stadium and all the other stuff."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, finally they get it right and give people a reason to come to Detroit itself, instead of the suburbs!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Now the team just has to be good enough to be worthy of the new stadium, heheh."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well Tom Gores is a multi billionaire, so if he puts his money to good use, we should have a good team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that guy is so cool.  He's a jewish guy from Israel,, did you know that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I think I heard that.  Anyway, he's got to spend some of that money on the team now that we're getting a new stadium."
