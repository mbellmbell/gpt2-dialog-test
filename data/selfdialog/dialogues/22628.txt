"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see the Disney movie Blackbeard's Ghost?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I never saw that one. What's it about?"
"__DISNEY__ It's about a track coach who goes to a small town and stays at an old inn on the seashore that's haunted."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Who stars in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Dean Jones plays as the coach and Peter Ustinov is the ghost of Blackbeard."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that sounds good. It's not scary is it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, it's a comedy. You know how some of the older Disney movies were really funny."
"__DISNEY__ You're right they had some good ones."
"__DISNEY__ No one has seen the ghost but he shows himself to the track coach and follows him around."
"__DISNEY__ I'll have to try to find that and watch it."
