"__MUSIC__ Do you know who I just saw on a commercial?"
"__MUSIC__ Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Boyz II Men?"
"__MUSIC__ What kindo of commercial was it?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  I think it was for a digestion medicine."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, well that's weird."
"__MUSIC__ Right?  It's like they are getting old."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they probably are close to forty."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but it seems weird that Boyz II Men is doing a commercial about upset stomach."
"__MUSIC__ I bet it was weird, but I'd love to see it.  It sounds super funny."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were singing about having gas.  And it was perfect harmony."
"__MUSIC__ Well, at least they still got it!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, one of the guys was missing."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ I couldn't tell.  It caught me off guard."
"__MUSIC__ I bet.  I wouldn't expect them to be in that."
"__MUSIC__ Ten years from now, I bet NSync will be doing the same thing."
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think Justin would need the money."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe not, but I can see the other guys doing that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.  Especially Joey!"
