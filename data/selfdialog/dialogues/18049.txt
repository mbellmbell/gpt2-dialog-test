"__MOVIES__ What classic movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm a huge Hitchcock fan."
"__MOVIES__ I've only seen Psycho, any other suggestions for me?"
"__MOVIES__ You have to see The Birds and Vertigo for sure"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard his later stuff is not as good"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah most would agree. I think Marnie is probably his last good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen his early stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I've seen everything and I'd say it's for hardcore fans only but take a look at Lifeboat, that holds up."
"__MOVIES__ I will. I usually go for comedy. Mike Nichols, Woody Allen that kind of movie."
"__MOVIES__ I've only seen The Graduate and none of Woody's"
"__MOVIES__ That's a pity. Annie Hall really is a classic. Did you like The Graduate"
"__MOVIES__ I did but I thought Tootsie was funnier"
"__MOVIES__ It is. Sydney Pollack pulled a Hitchcock in that one with his cameo."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he was the agent. I forgot. I will have to look out for Hitchcock's cameos."
"__MOVIES__ It's my favorite thing to do. I love spotting them."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's better than full on starring like Allen."
"__MOVIES__ Sure that can be too much sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ A little touch is better."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah let the actors do their jobs."
"__MOVIES__ Luckily the greats always hired really capable actors"
