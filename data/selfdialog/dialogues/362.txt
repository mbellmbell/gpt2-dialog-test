"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the new Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ You're kidding right?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Theyre still putting out music? I abandoned them after the Black album."
"__MUSIC__ Dude arent you loyal to your bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Are they loyal to me or their pockets?"
"__MUSIC__ Man they released like 8 albums since then."
"__MUSIC__ And they all stink I'm sure."
"__MUSIC__ Doubt it, but I never heard much of their old stuff."
"__MUSIC__ stop talking to me."
"__MUSIC__ Haha. are you serious??"
"__MUSIC__ Look Metallica at one time did what they wanted and thats it."
"__MUSIC__ And now? What do they do now?"
"__MUSIC__ Dont know. But they used to be at play-used to take you through a heavy metal journey in each song."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds interesting, how so?"
"__MUSIC__ They'd start off slow, then toughen up that same riff with drums and distortion, then go back, and come around again."
"__MUSIC__ They still do some of that in the new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Nah. Since the black album they shortened their songs for radio play."
"__MUSIC__ I like hearing them on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ But it killed them. Their songs used to meander in a beautiful way, wondering on a landscape then soaring to another. Not anymore! Radio dont lie that."
