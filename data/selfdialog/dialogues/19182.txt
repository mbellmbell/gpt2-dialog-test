"__MOVIES__ Did you see Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, we saw that Saturday."
"__MOVIES__ How do you like it as a Harry Potter movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not a Harry Potter movie."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a Harry Potter universe movie."
"__MOVIES__ Don't be like that. Answer me."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it, and it's a fine magic movie, but it's infuriating for the same reasons as the previous ones."
"__MOVIES__ Which are?"
"__MOVIES__ Why don't they use magic all the time?"
"__MOVIES__ They do?"
"__MOVIES__ No, they don't. Sometimes they jump and dive, other times they use 'accio!'."
"__MOVIES__ So?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there's nothing that says when they can and can't, or why they wouldn't. It's never presented as draining or anything."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they just get tired or want to change things up."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't make sense though. Why fight and risk yourself when you can apparate and get a better position?"
"__MOVIES__ Eventually there would have to be a showdown."
"__MOVIES__ Actually in this movie, Porpetina knew where Newt would apparate to. We've never seen that before."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was a little unbelievable, even for me."
"__MOVIES__ At least they name-dropped Dumbledore."
