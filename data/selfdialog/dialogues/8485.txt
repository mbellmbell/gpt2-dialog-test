"__BEATLES__ So, you're a big Beatles fan, right?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I like a lot of their stuff."
"__BEATLES__ Cool, I was reading some trivia the other day and thought it might interesting you."
"__BEATLES__ Lay it on me, although, I might already know it... hehe."
"__BEATLES__ Okay.. check, the song 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' a lot of people think is about drugs, but one it's actually based on a picture Lennon's son drew at like age four or so of his classmates.  They were like, 'What is this?' And he said, 'That's Lucy!  She's in the sky with diamonds!'"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I've heard that.  That was Lennon's son Julian, actually.  Supposedly, he inspired two other Beatles songs."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, really? Which ones?"
"__BEATLES__ I believe 'Hey Jude' and 'Good Night.'"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's neat!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, sadly, John and Julian's mother got divorced when the boy was five. After that, Julian says John didn't have much contact with him."
