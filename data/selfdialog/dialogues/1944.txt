"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite opera?"
"__MUSIC__ La Boheme, what about yours?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd have to say Cosi fan tutte"
"__MUSIC__ Why would you pick that one?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the music in Boheme is beautiful and it's dramatic and lovely but Cosi is funny!"
"__MUSIC__ It's in Italian, how do you know?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw a production in English, and also there are subtitles."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, but people don't go to the opera for comedy. They go for the singing!"
"__MUSIC__ True, and the singing in Cosi is beautiful. It's pure Mozart with all the swells and sweet harmony."
"__MUSIC__ But where's the drama and the angst that pulls at your heart like a good Puccini?"
"__MUSIC__ Think about per pieta, where Fiordiligi is asking her love to forgive her for being weak. She's sweet and pleading, and furious with herself!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok that does sound like it has some drama to it."
"__MUSIC__ It really does! She's in love and confused and wants to follow her code of honor and rails at herself for the mistakes she's made."
"__MUSIC__ And this is in the middle of a comedy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. The guy she let sweep her off her feet is disguised with a ridiculous moustache."
"__MUSIC__ Because false facial hair is a recipe for comedy."
"__MUSIC__ You have to admit it's a time honored tradition. Beards are funny."
"__MUSIC__ I still think Puccini's drama is more fun to watch just because it's emotional."
"__MUSIC__ I can go for drama sometimes, but the music in Cosi is beautiful and the plot is fun and moves along briskly. To each their own I guess."
"__MUSIC__ We can definitely agree on that!"
