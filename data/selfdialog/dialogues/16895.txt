"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens?"
"__MOVIES__ I did."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It turned out to be a pretty good movie. The third act saved it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought the stuff leading up to the climax was pretty tedious."
"__MOVIES__ There wasn't enough character development to get me fully invested in the main characters."
"__MOVIES__ The droid was pretty funny though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it's easy to get people behind a humorous character if it's done well."
"__MOVIES__ In other words, not Jar Jar."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed all the callbacks to Epsidoe IV, but thought CGI Tarkin was kind of fake."
"__MOVIES__ That did look pretty phony."
"__MOVIES__ CGI Leia was better, but she was only on screen for a brief period."
"__MOVIES__ The part with Vader mowing rebels down before that was pretty awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably the best part of the movie, though Vader was kind of shoehorned in."
"__MOVIES__ It didn't feel like his subplot really mattered, true."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think it was quite the homerun Disney needed for these spinoff Star Wars films, but it was a decent start."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
"__MOVIES__ Will you go see the Han Solo movie when it comes out?"
"__MOVIES__ I probably will."
