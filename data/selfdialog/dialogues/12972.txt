"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm ready for the football season to begin - the Pats are going to take it again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. It's way to early to predict a Super Bowl winner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So if you don't like the Patriots, who do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always been partial to the Tennessee Titans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding me!  They don't have any defense. I don't think they could even beat the Browns!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, the Browns aren't so bad. And their fans love them!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but have you even been to Cleveland? The Browns are about the only thing there to love!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but when it comes to a football town, Dallas is the winner"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to admit you're right. The Cowboys also have rabid fans, even when they have a bad season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the Landry and Staubach legacy at work!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Landry was hands-down one of the best NFL coaches ever. He could take on any of today's teams!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure knew talent when he saw it. The Cowboys were THE team to watch back then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Today, it's definitely the Patriots who are in the spotlight all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, kind of reminds me of the Joe Montana days with the 49ers. He could do no wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or John Elway with the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And today we're stuck with guys like Colin Kaepernick and Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nothing wrong with Brady, my friend! But Kaepernick - I'll give you that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just wish he'd stick to football and stay out of political issues."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Joe Montana must be rolling his eyes!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least Kaepernick's a free agent now. Interesting to see if anyone picks him up."
