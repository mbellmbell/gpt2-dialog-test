"__MUSIC__ You're a rap fan right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you know me haha, I'm always listening to some rapper."
"__MUSIC__ So, you know I'm not a huge fan of rap, but there's one that I really can't understand how people listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Alright, who is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not just one rapper, it's all of those mumbling guys."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, yeah I know what you mean, what song did you hear?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was something like little yacht or something."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, lil yachty.  He's pretty catchy, but I can see what you're saying.  There's a bunch of younger rappers out there like that."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like lil yachty, but I can't stand lil uzi vert."
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea what that is."
"__MUSIC__ He's a rapper and one of those mumbling guys, you probably haven't heard any of his songs."
"__MUSIC__ Is there anyone new that's actually good?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like Dram, he's not a mumbler, but he actually sings on a lot of his songs, and they're really catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Who does he sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ You know that 'girl, you've got what I need' song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I love that song."
"__MUSIC__ He sounds like him."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I'll give it a shot, what song should I listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Check out Broccoli and Cash Machine."
