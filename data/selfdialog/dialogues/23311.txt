"__DISNEY__ Which is objectively the best Disney movie, Beauty and the Beast or Mary Poppins?"
"__DISNEY__ ...Oooooh, we're going to be here a while."
"__DISNEY__ Well one got terrible sequels and a useless remake, while the other's getting a needless sequel that may or may not be terrible."
"__DISNEY__ Hey, Lin-Manuel's doing the music, I'm cautiously optimistic."
"__DISNEY__ That is fair."
"__DISNEY__ Also I'm against judging based on supplementary materials, let's just look at these as stand-alones."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, what are some negatives about these two, since I couldn't find any."
"__DISNEY__ Uh...you could interpret Beauty as being about Stockholm Syndrome and it's better as is without Human Again, whereas Mary Poppins has Dick Van Dyke's bad cockney accent."
"__DISNEY__ ...I'm thinking Beauty and the Beast wins, though I could also be saying that because I have a bias in favor of animation."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think Mary Poppins might be objectively better. I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one."
