"__MOVIES__ I just saw She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. I had no idea the Duke could act."
"__MOVIES__ Yes he could, and not just in Westerns. He won a Best Actor Oscar, after all.."
"__MOVIES__ I knew he got one, but I thought it was a  longevity prize."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, no, he earned it, I think. They don't give those out just for showing up."
"__MOVIES__ Really. What was he in that wasn't just a Western?"
"__MOVIES__ Just a Western? Like The Wild Bunch, The Magnificent Seven,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre or High Noon., you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh. You really like Westerns."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I do. How about The Searchers? It's a John Wayne classic, with a marvelous character played perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, okay."
"__MOVIES__ Or McLintock! It's a rom-com like you've never seen. A Western remake of Taming of the Shrew, if you can imagine."
"__MOVIES__ I  can't imagine."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Maureen O'Hara is a flaming Katherine, and together they're spicy, and funny, and very self-aware."
"__MOVIES__ Yet he's good at it?"
"__MOVIES__ You will laugh. I promise. You can see they had fun making it, too."
"__MOVIES__ He's funny, and so is she?"
"__MOVIES__ Or stream The Quiet Man, set in Ireland. He's a retired boxer who finds love at last--with Maureen O'Hara again."
"__MOVIES__ I'll try it."
"__MOVIES__ You'll like it, I think. He  also played a detective, a soldier, and a French Musketeer. And many more."
"__MOVIES__ What a career."
"__MOVIES__ What a guy."
