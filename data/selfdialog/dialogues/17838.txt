"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest Aliens movie, yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Alien Covenant? No not yet, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Meh. A waste of my time and money."
"__MOVIES__ Another failed Alien attempt, I take it."
"__MOVIES__ It's not a complete failure, but there's something sadly inevitable about Alien: Covenant. It feels more like an exercise than it does a movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's not good and not a surprise. The commercials didn't make it out to be very interesting to me anyway."
"__MOVIES__ It's an  awkward marriage between intellectual exercise and suspenseful creature feature."
"__MOVIES__ Yikes. Brutal."
"__MOVIES__ It's not as good as the original."
"__MOVIES__ Neither was the last one. You'd think they would learn from past mistakes."
"__MOVIES__ They haven't so far."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the franchise took a backslide with the undercooked Prometheus and now this failure."
"__MOVIES__ It's like Hollywood does not know how to write a good story anymore."
"__MOVIES__ You'd think, for a franchise known for things bursting out of people's chests, that this movie would be worth talking about."
"__MOVIES__ It isn't?"
"__MOVIES__ This one will barely elevate your heart rate."
"__MOVIES__ These films have run out of ideas."
"__MOVIES__ In space, no one can hear you yawn."
