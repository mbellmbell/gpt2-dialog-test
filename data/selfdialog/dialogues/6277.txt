"__STAR_WARS__ Do you know some of the influences George Lucas had when he wrote and directed Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I know that Lucas went to USC film school, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he was part of that generation of directors who were first and foremost movie fans."
"__STAR_WARS__ And got exposed to a lot of art cinema, Kurosawa, or example..."
"__STAR_WARS__ And you see that in Darth Vader and Obi-Wan's duel, and R2-D2 and C-3PO wandering around."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was in the HIdden Fortress, that Kurosawa film, with the comic duo who wandered on and offscreen a lot."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, how much influence do you think Flash Gordon had on Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, if you watch those serials from the 1930s, you can see they pioneered the opening crawl."
"__STAR_WARS__ And there's that scene of Luke and Leia swinging across that chasm on the Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lucas was definitely a guy who loved movies, and you can see that in Star Wars!"
