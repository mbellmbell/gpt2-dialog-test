"__MUSIC__ Which new albums are you looking forward to?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm very excited about the new Clientele album."
"__MUSIC__ It's been a long time since they put out an album."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it's been about 7 years or so."
"__MUSIC__ They're a great band. Their quality level has been quite consistent over the years."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you can't say that about a lot of bands."
"__MUSIC__ I'm looking forward to the new Vince Staples album. It's called Big Fish Theory."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wanna hear that one too. It comes out tomorrow, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Right. I think he keeps getting better and better."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. He seems to be hitting his stride now."
"__MUSIC__ He's also really great in interviews."
"__MUSIC__ He's obviously very smart and he's super funny."
"__MUSIC__ I like watching Mac DeMarco in interviews as well."
"__MUSIC__ He doesn't seem as real as Vince though. Mac seems to be hiding something."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like Mac acts a certain way in public, but in his private life he's probably quite depressed and lonely."
"__MUSIC__ I can kinda see that. The hints are there."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, his music has that sort of sad, lonely quality to it."
"__MUSIC__ Regardless though, I enjoy his music and his interviews."
"__MUSIC__ I do too, but I'd like to learn more about what he's really like."
