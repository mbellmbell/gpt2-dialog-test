"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, how do you think the Eagles are going to do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, I'm not quite sure. I hope Carson Wentz doesn't experience his sophomore slump."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he will, after his play last year. He was undefeated through the first four games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but things kinda fell apart after that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think you can blame the remainder of the season solely on the quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but he does set the tone for the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope they beat the Cowboys this year, I'm sick of hearing about Dak and Zeke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did do well, but I think others teams will figure them out. They were so one dimensional."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I hope our revamped defense is up to the challenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see any other team troubling us, except, maybe, the Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's hard to tell what team will show up when we play 'Big Blue.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love to see them beat New York and Dallas at least once each, or sweep one of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If we did, I bet we make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be so cool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the City would love it, especially after the way they turned out for the draft this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was there the first night. I wouldn't have missed it for the world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I hope they do that again. The NFL knows how to throw a party."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you planning on going to any games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One for sure. How about you?"
