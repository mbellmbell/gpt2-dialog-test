"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I saw The Force Awakens last weekend with my boyfriend."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I enjoyed it a lot, but I was a little confused about how it really connected with the other movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I know what you mean. I liked Rey a lot though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I loved Rey! I'm excited to see where her story goes. And Finn too, I really liked him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really enjoyed that they kept Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It made it more real."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you going to see the next one when it comes out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I thought I probably would, we should go together!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's a date!"
