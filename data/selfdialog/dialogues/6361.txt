"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Phantom Menance?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved it!  I think the prequels have a lot of depth."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I hated it! I thought it was so boring."
"__STAR_WARS__ But you get so much background! And Yoda is so great!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't watch Star Wars for Yoda!"
"__STAR_WARS__ But he's awesome!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but I watch it for the Skywalker family stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then what about Anikan and Padame?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Super creepy because she's a teenager and he's a kid!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Eh. Maybe."
