"__FASHION__ Who was the best dressed at the Met Gala this year?"
"__FASHION__ There were many choices, but I really liked Rihanna's outfit. It flowed with the theme. And those shoes! Wow!"
"__FASHION__ She was very beautiful. Very different and stayed with the designer theme, Rei Kawakubo."
"__FASHION__ I agree completely. What did you think of Kim Kardashian's look?"
"__FASHION__ It was definitely simple, white dress yet elegant. Her makeup matched perfectly with the dress."
"__FASHION__ I did not expect that from her at all. I thought it was a very interesting choice."
"__FASHION__ Yeah...I also really enjoyed Jennifer Lopez's dress! It had a certain flare and beautiful colors!"
"__FASHION__ It was gorgeous! It reminded me a little bit of Elsa though from Frozen!"
"__FASHION__ Haha! Yes. I guess it does have that characteristic."
"__FASHION__ What about Blake Lively's dress?? I adored her dress!!!"
"__FASHION__ Can you remind me what she wore? I completely cannot recall..."
"__FASHION__ She wore a plunging gold gown heavily embellished with fringe-style beading and blue feathers that cascaded down the train."
"__FASHION__ Oh my, that was gorgeous! Although I did not particularly like her sleeves, they hung too loosely and it made her arm a bit flabby."
"__FASHION__ I can see where you're coming from. I still love the feathers though!"
"__FASHION__ Yes, those were great! Let's talk about Kendall Jenner..."
"__FASHION__ Oh yes! What is there NOT to talk about? She was stunning!"
"__FASHION__ Kendall always brings her A game. Those 85,000 crystals were to die for!"
"__FASHION__ I was speechless when I saw her. Her shoes matched perfectly! Definitely a show stopper."
"__FASHION__ I loved this year's gala! I want to wear one of those dresses one day."
"__FASHION__ It was indeed amazing. I look forward to next year!"
