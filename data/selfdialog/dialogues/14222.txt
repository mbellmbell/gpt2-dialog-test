"__HORROR__ Have you ever seen Psycho?"
"__HORROR__ Yes that's a classic! Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense."
"__HORROR__ He really earned that title too. That movie was so scary for an old film."
"__HORROR__ I think it's because there was so much mystery and suspense rather than in your face gore."
"__HORROR__ Right, they don't do it right these days. That's the first movie I can remember with a twist at the end."
"__HORROR__ Probably the best twist in a movie in history."
"__HORROR__ I agree with that. And Anthony Perkins was born for that role."
"__HORROR__ I heard Alfred Hitchcock purposely chose someone who displayed feminine traits."
"__HORROR__ Right, so he could look convincing as a mama's boy."
"__HORROR__ I know the scene in the shower was and still is one of the scariest in movie history."
