"__MUSIC__ I was just sitting here thinking about Bobby Brown."
"__MUSIC__ What about him?"
"__MUSIC__ How he left New Edition and crushed the game."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. That Don't Be Cruel album did numbers."
"__MUSIC__ He had like four or five jams on that album."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite was My Prerogative."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that and Roni."
"__MUSIC__ The truth about Roni, she's a sweet little girl..."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. Then he had a few remixes."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you talking about Every Little Step."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, when he did the remix and he added a rap verse to it."
"__MUSIC__ That thing was fire."
"__MUSIC__ Shoot, I liked his album that had Humpin' Around on it."
"__MUSIC__ Humpin' Around was my jam."
"__MUSIC__ Was? Man I still be playing that jam like it just came out."
"__MUSIC__ I even like the song he made with Whitney."
"__MUSIC__ What was the name of that song?"
"__MUSIC__ We Got Something In Common."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's it. Damn shame she left from here."
"__MUSIC__ I know right."
