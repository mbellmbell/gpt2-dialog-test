"__ICEHOCKEY__ Have you ever been to a hockey game in person?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I have been to a few and they were great. What about you?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I have never been to a game live."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Would you like to?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I love sports, but I'm not that big of a fan of hockey. I'm open to going, I guess."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ There is nothing like it. Most sports are better live than on TV and hockey definitely fits that description."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What is it about it that makes it so good?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How fast-paced it is and the crowds are alwasy amazing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Where do you recommend I sit at a game?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Anywhere is good, but if you pay the big bucks, try to be in one of the first few rows."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Why the first few rows?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You would be right by the 'boards' and see some really cool, up-close action."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Is it as violent as I think it is?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It can be at times, but I like the speed of the game live."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Would it be a good idea to bring my young son (8 years old) to a game?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, the games are family-friendly for the most part."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I would hate to bring my son if there is a lot of yelling and bad language."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You run that risk at any game you go to, depending on where you sit."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Thanks for the advice. I will probably take my son to a game next season as a surprise."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You won't be disappointed. Let me know if you need anything."
