"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about the Detroit Tigers bullpen?"
"__BASEBALL__ Ugh! It has been their downfall for years!"
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the game last night? I really did feel bad for Sanchez."
"__BASEBALL__ He sure has lost it, hasn't he? Same as K-Rod, it seems."
"__BASEBALL__ I feel bad for him, too, but just dreaded each time I saw him warming up in the bullpen."
"__BASEBALL__ I know exactly what you mean. How do you think Justin Wilson will do as the closer?"
"__BASEBALL__ He sure can't do any worse than K-Rod was doing. He was able to do the job the other night against Arizona."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he did a good job. Did you hear that interview they had with him following the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ You mean when they asked him about being nervous when he had to come in and pitch the ninth?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and he said he was more nervous than usual. That was funny. He also gave credit to the other relief pitchers for that night."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. There were sure a couple of deep fly balls given up by both Hardy and Greene."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but they ultimately got Arizona out without them scoring. So, you can't complain too much."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, you're right. What did you think of Verlander that night?"
"__BASEBALL__ It just seems like he's been kind of struggling this whole season. He's been winning okay, though."
"__BASEBALL__ His velocity has sure been good. One of his strikeout pitches was 99 mph!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know. I heard he reached a hundred a few games ago."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he did. But it doesn't seem like his control has been there like it has been in the past."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, Michael Fulmer's control has sure been there!"
"__BASEBALL__ What a pitcher! I heard him compared to a young Verlander!"
"__BASEBALL__ He is certainly everything they said he was going to be! He's definitely had an impact on the pitching staff!"
