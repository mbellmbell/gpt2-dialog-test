"__MUSIC__ Hey, who is your favorite person to see live?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean like musicians?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, what was the best concert you've been to?"
"__MUSIC__ You know I went to that Billie Joel and Elton John concert tour a couple years back, that was pretty amazing."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds cool, what made it good?"
"__MUSIC__ They had this dueling pianos type thing going on."
"__MUSIC__ What does that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, at first one of them emerged from the floor of the stage in a puff of smoke, just a platform and a piano rising from the ground."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, and then when one finished the platform lowered them, then the other guy came out with another colored piano on the opposite side."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, and then what?"
"__MUSIC__ When the second one finished he went back in the ground, then suddenly they both came up together."
"__MUSIC__ Quite the buildup."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, then they played a couple of their hits together."
"__MUSIC__ That does sound pretty epic."
"__MUSIC__ It was probably the best concert I've ever been to."
"__MUSIC__ Yea I've heard Elton John is a great live performer."
"__MUSIC__ Billie Joel is no joke either."
"__MUSIC__ .Yea I love Uptown Girl."
