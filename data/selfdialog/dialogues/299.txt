"__MUSIC__ Ever heard of Weather Report?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! 'Morning clouds will make way for clear skies and temperatures into the mid-70s with lows into the 60s overnight.'"
"__MUSIC__ No, dork. I mean the band."
"__MUSIC__ You mean those fusion guys?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Ever listen to their music?"
"__MUSIC__ The early stuff. It was a little out there for me."
"__MUSIC__ They really found their voice with 'Black Market.'"
"__MUSIC__ Haven't heard that one."
"__MUSIC__ That's when Jaco Pastorius came on board."
"__MUSIC__ That guy is legendary!"
"__MUSIC__ He can do anything. Even played with Joni Mitchell in the late '70s."
"__MUSIC__ I need to listen to more of his stuff."
"__MUSIC__ He revolutionized the bass; topped DownBeat's 'Best Bassist' several times."
"__MUSIC__ What's he doing now?"
"__MUSIC__ He had a horrible end."
"__MUSIC__ Drugs?"
"__MUSIC__ Not exactly. A bouncer beat him up outside some club in Florida."
"__MUSIC__ What !?"
"__MUSIC__ Jaco was a musical genius, but he was bi-polar. He got into with the guy, who likely had no idea who he was..."
"__MUSIC__ That sucks big time! What a loss!"
