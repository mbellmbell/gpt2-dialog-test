"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the movie Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ The Disney one?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! It is my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I watched it as a kid, but not recently. I remember loving it!"
"__DISNEY__ I just watched it with my niece and I forgot how much I loved the little mouse, Gus Gus."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah! He was very cute! When I was a kid I named my dog Gus Gus."
"__DISNEY__ That is so funny! I had a cat named after Malifecent from Sleeping Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ Awe! Was he a mean cat?"
"__DISNEY__ He could be a bit grumpy at times!"
"__DISNEY__ Well at least the name fits!"
