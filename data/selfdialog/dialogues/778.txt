"__MUSIC__ What was that song that you used to sing all the time?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean Tubthumping?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was the one."
"__MUSIC__ What about it>"
"__MUSIC__ Well I was talking to someone the other day and I couldn't remember who sings it."
"__MUSIC__ It was by Chumbawamba."
"__MUSIC__ Right, I don't know how I forgot that, you only sang it every 5 minutes."
"__MUSIC__ Hey it was a catchy song, then and now."
"__MUSIC__ It's an addicting song and you always got it stuck in my head."
"__MUSIC__ Like you have any room to talk about getting songs stuck in someone's head."
"__MUSIC__ I don't even know what you're talking about."
"__MUSIC__ So you're gonna sit there and say you don't remember your song choices."
"__MUSIC__ All the music I listen is amazing, people tell me I have great taste."
"__MUSIC__ Is that the story you're sticking with Barbie Girl?"
"__MUSIC__ Now that's not fair, Barbie Girl was a great song, even you liked it."
"__MUSIC__ It was a cute song, but it was like verbal terrorism when it came on."
"__MUSIC__ Don't blame Aqua for your lack of taste."
"__MUSIC__ There is such a thing as being played too much."
"__MUSIC__ The world is better off for having one hit wonders and infectious music."
"__MUSIC__ I guess, but now I'm gonna be singing those all day."
