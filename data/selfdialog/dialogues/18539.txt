"__MOVIES__ Remind me of a big Korean movie again?"
"__MOVIES__ Well a lot of Korean movies have gotten attention lately, but Oldboy is one a lot of people talk about."
"__MOVIES__ That one is pretty old, right?  Remind me of that one again?"
"__MOVIES__ It had a crazy plot.  Basically I'd say it was a double revenge plot."

"__MOVIES__ So the guy think he's out for revenge, but it turns out the person messing with him was seeking his own revenge."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea!  I remember it now.  It was super graphic and violent too."
