"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Seahawks will get back to the Superbowl this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think that there defense is no longer on the level that the Superbowl teams were."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I have to agree, the league has changed in over the years, more emphasis on passing the ball"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't see the Seahawks winning many scoring battles when airing it out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should still win the division though, I think they get to 10-12 wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I can see that, the Cardinals are the only real competition in the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they may only need 9 wins to win that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, unless the Rams end up surprising everybody."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not happening, they don't have the players to push for a playoff berth yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the 49er's?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, they are an absolute mess right now, they will be battling the Rams for last place in the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I can't believe how fast they have gone down, felt like the rivalry with the Seahawks was just yesterday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were so close to a Superbowl too, one of the best defensive teams during that span."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, just shows how crazy it is to be a consistent team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well getting back to the Seahawks I think they are reloading for another run right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps, it is all up to player development, there anchor players are all in their prime right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think they are still a Top 5 overall team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right, however I think the Packers are about to have a resurgence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that, you got Rodgers for MVP?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he's going to have an amazing season."
