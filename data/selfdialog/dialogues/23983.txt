"__SUPERHERO__ Who is the best Hulk?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm thinking Edward Norton; I really liked his portrayal."
"__SUPERHERO__ It was definitely better than Eric Bana's version."
"__SUPERHERO__ Let's never speak of that again. I assume you like Mark Ruffalo the most?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, his character definitely fits the comics in the best way."
"__SUPERHERO__ I haven't read any of the comics, so I don't have that to go on. Why him over Edward Norton?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Edward didn't really come off as the tech genius who figures out gamma rays. he doesn't portray enough anger on screen to justify the transformation."
"__SUPERHERO__ Are you looking forward to seeing Hulk in Thor 3?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Sort of. I really want to know how he got to the planet and how he became a fighting slave."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe it has something to do with how SHIELD ended, with everyone going into space. Perhaps they're looking for him."
