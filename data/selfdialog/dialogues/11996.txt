"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey guy! Only 30+ days til preseason!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I can't wait man! Pittsburgh is going to win it all this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Say what!?! I don't even know that they are going to win their division!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on! You can't be serious, If you don't think we are going to win the division, who is going to?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It could be Cincy or Baltimore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well we agree that it won't be Cleveland!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. They've got Brock Osweiler as QB. He'll do the same for them as he did for Houston, absolutely nothing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are hopeless! Worst team in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Baltimore is always a wild card for me. They were only one game from the division title last year, and the core is returning, so They are contenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'll give you that, but Cincy is finished if you ask me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that, Dalton got hurt last year right? Or was that the year before last?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't even ,matter. They have no leadership."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well. I guess I can see your point. They have no respect for their coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I used to really like Marvin Lewis, but he just can't get it done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. This has to be his last year ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But , you never know. If Dalton can stay healthy, they can go 11-5 and take Pitts. place as top dog."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so! But whatever man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I will confess that if , and thats a big if, all your Steelers can stay healthy an not suspended, they should stay on top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Low blow man! Anyway, what's your final call?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see Pitts at 12-4 , Baltimore 10-6, Cincinnati 8-8 and Cleveland 1-15."
