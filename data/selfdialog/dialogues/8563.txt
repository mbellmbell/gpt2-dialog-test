"__BEATLES__ DId your parents listen to the Beatles when you were growing up?"
"__BEATLES__ Not really. SO I didn't really grow up knowing their music."
"__BEATLES__ That's a shame. It's so good!"
"__BEATLES__ Is it?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. I really enjoy it."
"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite album?"
"__BEATLES__ I like their traditional stuff, but I also really like The White Album."
"__BEATLES__ I actually have listened to that one -- I took a history class that used that album as social and political commentary of the time."
"__BEATLES__ That's really cool!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. Maybe I should give some of their other stuff a try."
