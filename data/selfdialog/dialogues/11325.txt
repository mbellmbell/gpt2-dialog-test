"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Steelers will do well this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have one of the best quarterbacks in Ben Roethlisberger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think their running game will do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is hard to say.  It mostly depends on how well Le'Veon Bell plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he can be problematic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  He has had off field issues as well that seem to hold back his game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the wide recievers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously Antonio Brown is argueably the best reciever in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Martavis Bryant will contribute much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he does.  Before his suspension he contributed several touchdowns and stretched the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the defense will hold up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They would improve a lot by just taking William Gay out of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think he plays well?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I think he is one of the worst coverage backs in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What would you do if you were coaching?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would play Artie Burns on one side at corner and try a rookie on the other side."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the linebacker spot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ James Harrison is back again, and even at his age he still plays well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he can hold up all year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably so, but hopefully he will get some help from J.J. Watts brother at linebacker."
