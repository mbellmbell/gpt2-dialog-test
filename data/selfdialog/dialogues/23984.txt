"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen the new Wolverine movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ You mean Logan? No I haven't have you?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, not yet, but I really want to see it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me, too. I'm a huge Hugh Jackman fan!"
"__SUPERHERO__ I am, too! And I love the X-Men!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, me, too! I was into the comics and animated series before the movies started coming out."
"__SUPERHERO__ So who's your favorite X-Men character?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Wolverine, of course! And that was before Hugh Jackman started playing him."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think Hugh Jackman is the best as Wolverine."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, even though he's way taller than the real Wolverine would be."
