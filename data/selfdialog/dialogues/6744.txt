"__STAR_WARS__ You've seen Star Wars right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes of course one of my favorite set of movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Good have a question for you."
"__STAR_WARS__ Go ahead."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Luke and Lea could have been happy if Luke was never a Jedi or had any powers to begin with?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a hard question in short yes and no."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes because what drew them apart was Luke and his power rage if you will."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now why no?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What also drew them together was Luke and that he was a Jedi they would never have even met if it wasn't for that."
