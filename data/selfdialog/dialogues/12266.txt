"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think about last year's Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Amazing game, one of the most exciting second halves I've seen in a Super Bowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Amazing unless you are a Falcons fan, then it was a nightmare."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I'm not a fan of either team though so I just enjoy a good,competitive game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will get to the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's way too early to make a prediction like that. People who try before the season even starts are always wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay who do you want to get to the Super Bowl rather than who you think actually will?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping the Green Bay Packers will get there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers is obviously going to be good but how is their defense going to be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the big question, I think it's adequate. There's some question about how well they can stop the good team in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite Packers defensive player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think linebacker, Clay Matthews is really good. I like watching him play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most people would say Julius Peppers as their favorite Packers defensive player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's great too, I just really like watching Clay Matthews. I respect his skills at the position he plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to go to any Packers games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd love to go to a game at Lambeau Field, it's an amazing game day atmosphere but I probably won't be able to afford a ticket this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many games have you been to in Green Bay?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my lifetime I've probably been to about 10 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always try to get to at least one game per year for my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Watching an NFL game in person is so much better than watching it on television."
