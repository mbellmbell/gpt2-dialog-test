"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I've seen them all.  Who do you think Rey's father is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure? Maybe she is Kylo Ren's twin?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wouldn't that be a great twist!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but I also saw an interview where they had her name listed as Rey Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that could have been someone's wishful thinking."
"__STAR_WARS__ True.  We will know more when the next movie comes out."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's fun to speculate though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it is.  Maybe she is Luke's daughter?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Possibly, that would be too obvious though."
