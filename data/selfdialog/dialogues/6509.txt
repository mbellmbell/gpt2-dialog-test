"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I did. I like Star Wars and all, but that one was a lot more intense than the previous ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I thought so too. It was more like a war movie, but set in the Star Wars universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ My thoughts exactly. It was still a cool movie though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, that's a tough one. So many good new characters in that movie. I'd have to go with Cassian I guess."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he was cool. I liked Jynn the best I think, but K2-SO really stole the show."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, yeah, he was awesome! I liked how blunt he was!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Kinda like C-3PO but with a lot more sass and attitude!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly! Hey, want to rent the DVD this weekend. This conversation makes me want to see it again!"
