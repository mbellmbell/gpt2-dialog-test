"__HORROR__ Do you consider The Sixth Sense to be a horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, of course. Ghosts."
"__HORROR__ I looked it up and it's listed as Horror-Thriller."
"__HORROR__ Do you agree?"
"__HORROR__ Well, ghosts don't make it horror, like Casper."
"__HORROR__ That's an extreme opposite, though, and shouldn't apply."
"__HORROR__ It's not scary is the issue. They see ghosts who have been bloodied, but it's not scary."
"__HORROR__ So what's it?"
"__HORROR__ It's a kid who can see ghosts, and someone just coming to terms with that they're dead."
"__HORROR__ So, a psychological thriller?"
