"__BEATLES__ I was thinking about that Beatles song, 'Yesterday'. I like the verse 'yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away'."
"__BEATLES__ It's funny when your young how everything seems to be life or death."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, but when you look back you only remember the really good or bad times."
"__BEATLES__ It's funny how a song can take you back to your past. I remember roller skating and the song 'Don't let me down' was always playing."
"__BEATLES__ I really liked 'I want to hold your hand'. Seems so tame to the lyrics the kids listen to today."
"__BEATLES__ Isn't that the truth. I guess it does make one think of yesterday."
"__BEATLES__ It really does. It seemed like a wild time but it was really so innocent."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, to have back the innocence of our youth again. Life in the sixties and seventies times were a changing."
"__BEATLES__ They don't have music like that anymore. Music that will be around and still make sense fifty years from now."
"__BEATLES__ I don't know it may make sense to this generation and may make them smile when they hear it again."
