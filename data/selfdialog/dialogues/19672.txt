"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't was it a good movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was great, a lot of action just like the first."
"__MOVIES__ The first movie was great, I will definitely go see the second one."
"__MOVIES__ You have to see it in 3D, it was a  much better experience than standard."
"__MOVIES__ You went to see it twice?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I could not help myself I saw the 3D and the standard versions. The 3D is much better."
"__MOVIES__ I will be sure to see the 3D then."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any other movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, I like to stick to HBO and Cinemax for my movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh did you know HBO just came out with Suicide Squad?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it last night it was not as good as I thought it would be. Kind of dissapointing."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it was a great movie and had a lot of action."
"__MOVIES__ What else have you seen recently other than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2?"
"__MOVIES__ I finally watched Star Wars for the first time last week."
"__MOVIES__ What? I cannot believe that you had not watched it before. All the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No just a couple, but Return of the Jedi was my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah George Lucas did a great job with all of the movies honestly."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention Indiana Jones."
