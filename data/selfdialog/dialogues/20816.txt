"__THRILLER__ Suggest a decent thriller movie to me."
"__THRILLER__ I thought '10 Cloverfield Lane' was good for how little press it received."
"__THRILLER__ What's it like?"
"__THRILLER__ It's a bit of a sci-fi thriller. It kind of reminds me of 'The Village'."
"__THRILLER__ That's awesome. Is it scary?"
"__THRILLER__ I wouldn't say outright horrifying. It is creepy though."
"__THRILLER__ I will add it to my list. Will I understand it if I haven't seen Cloverfield?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, they actually have nearly nothing to do with eachother."
"__THRILLER__ Really? I always thought it was a sequel."
