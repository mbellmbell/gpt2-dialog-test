"__MUSIC__ Do you like any music that they play in churches?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, sometimes I do, but I don't really go to church a lot."
"__MUSIC__ I like some of the music, but I mainly like the organ."
"__MUSIC__ I like what the organ plays in what I've heard."
"__MUSIC__ I like the sound of it probably more than the notes."
"__MUSIC__ It definitely has a strong and powerful sound."
"__MUSIC__ I have to say that I like a lot of the melodies in the church music I've heard."
"__MUSIC__ What are they like?"
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty easy to remember and easy to sing, so everyone joins in."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty cool actually."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and most of the people that regularly go have memorized the songs so they don't have to read along."
"__MUSIC__ Does your church's music have a choir?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes they do, they're pretty good. Most of the music you hear though is from the audience and the organ."
"__MUSIC__ I do like all the church music I've heard during the holidays."
"__MUSIC__ Most people  know those, since Christmas is pretty much a religious holiday."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's true, that's why I know those songs anyways."
"__MUSIC__ You should come to church with me sometime and I'm sure you'd at least enjoy the songs."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really interested, but thank you anyways."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to gather up some recordings of the better ones and show you people online singing them then."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, as long as they're good I wouldn't mind listening."
