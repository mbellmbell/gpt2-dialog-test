"__MOVIES__ I finally got a chance to watch Oculus!"
"__MOVIES__ It was so good wasn't it! I told you those Mike Flanagan directed movies were top notch modern horror!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I didn't know Karen Gillan and Katee Sackhoff starred in Oculus! What a pleasant surprise."
"__MOVIES__ They were both so good. I thought Katee Sackhoff was terrifying in those flash back scenes. I saw her recently in Riddick too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I really enjoyed Riddick, always have loved that underrated franchise. It's literally the small franchise that made Vin Diesel."
"__MOVIES__ I know and look at Vin now, with two complete franchises of his own, the Triple X series and of course the Fast and Furious series."
"__MOVIES__ I need to catch the latest Xander Cage movie as well as The Fate of the Furious."
"__MOVIES__ They were a lot of fun. Action block buster hits that will make you tune out your brain and just enjoy the fun ride."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know, that's exactly what I expect from those movies."
"__MOVIES__ So in Oculus did you enjoy the ending? I was in the middle on how I felt about the ending for the longest time."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it! I thought it was just terrifying how it went. Brenton Thwaites character suffered the worse fate, knowing he lost his family and was being imprisoned with the mirror still out there!"
"__MOVIES__ Can you imagine that, I was so distraught about it that's why I didn't know what to make of how I felt regarding if I liked it or not!"
"__MOVIES__ It definitely isn't for everyone, especially those who always expect good to prevail in the end."
"__MOVIES__ I think it hit me even harder when Karen met her fate."
"__MOVIES__ Oh don't remind me, that bugged me more than Brenton's. You know how big of a fan I am of Karen Gillan since Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I didn't even recognize her in Guardians of the Galaxy until weeks later. I had no idea she was Nebula!"
"__MOVIES__ It was hard to tell since Nebula was blue and all made up, basically bald too. It's not your fault!"
"__MOVIES__ I know but I felt kind of embarrassed, being a big Karen fan myself."
"__MOVIES__ She's going to be in the new Jumanji movie starring alongside the Rock."
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing pictures of that! I watched Jumanji as a kid and can't wait to see my favorite actors in this remake!"
