"__DISNEY__ If you had to pick, who would be your favorite Disney prince?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, easily Eric from The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ He's pretty dreamy - but I like Flynn Rider from Tangled."
"__DISNEY__ But he wasn't a prince until he married Rapunzel!"
"__DISNEY__ In that case I guess my favorite is Prince Adam from Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ He seems like a good choice."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if Kuzco from the Emperor's New Groove counts as a Disney prince."
"__DISNEY__ Not sure, but if he does I'd switch my vote."
"__DISNEY__ 'Pull the lever, Kronk!'"
"__DISNEY__ 'Wrong lever!'"
