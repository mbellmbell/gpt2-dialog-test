"__DISNEY__ What did you think about the new 'Beauty and Beast' remake?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was superb! Emma Watson did such a great job as Belle!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I was very happy with that casting choice. She had the look, the voice, everything!"
"__DISNEY__ I liked how they made her an inventor like her dad. That was a nice touch."
"__DISNEY__ I thought so too. The movie was so similar to the original cartoon version, but all of the little differences only added to the story in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I was very happy with this version, and you know what a huge 'Beauty and the Beast' fan I am!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know that. I'm glad you liked it. The music was my favorite part. So many great songs in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ I think I hummed 'Be Our Guest' for days after seeing the movie. Such a catchy tune and Ewan McGregor performed it flawlessly!"
"__DISNEY__ Agreed! There's nothing that man can't do. I could listen to his voice for hours!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too! I'm heading to the store now, I gotta buy the DVD...the songs are already stuck in my head, might as well watch it while i'm humming the lyrics!"
