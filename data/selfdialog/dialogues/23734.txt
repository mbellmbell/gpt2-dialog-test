"__DISNEY__ I was looking at a list the other day and you would be absolutely shocked at the number of Disney films that were live action from the 1950s until now."
"__DISNEY__ Really? That's not what I think of when I think of Disney."
"__DISNEY__ I know! You usually think of the animated classics that they've made and rightfully so! I think almost everyone I know has seen Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah and those movies were made way before anyone our age was born."
"__DISNEY__ But because they're classics we've seen them. I bet there are lots of Disney films you didn't remember were DIsney, like The Parent Trap!"
"__DISNEY__ The one with Lindsay Lohan?"
"__DISNEY__ No! The one with Hayley Mills. Come on you remember, its the exact same story. The LIndsay Lohan one is remake."
"__DISNEY__ That's the girl that plays Polyanna! I loved that movie. It's the one about an orphan in a small town and she's really cheerful and everyone grows to love her."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I remember. Anyways, there are about 50 more live action movies that Disney has made."
"__DISNEY__ Well maybe we should go rewatch some of those ones."
