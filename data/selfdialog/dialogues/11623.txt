"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For the upcoming NFL season? You know it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah but ready to see some OU Sooners getting some pro action?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Always! It's really great to see these kids get an opportunity to follow their dreams beyond high school and college football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's always great though... not a fan of any teams that picked them up. Dede Westbrook made it on Jaguars then Samaje Perine  made Redskins and..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then the two that went to the Bengals. Joe Mixon and Jordan Evans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh, definitely not a Begnals fan in the slightest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same though I did catch a few of their games last season. That October game against the Redskins was intense!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay I will agree that was a fun one to watch. Can't believe they tied in overtime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, don't see that too often. Think it was... 27 to 27 if I remember correctly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really looking forward to seeing the Broncos in action this year. They had a great season last year... as always... but will be interesting to see how they do without Peyton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It certainly won't be the same without Manning but he should have retired a few seasons back don't you think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe... but if it was me I would have wanted to stay in as long as possible. Enjoy it 'just one more year' y'know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess. Was a real shame that Marshaw Lynch retired also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, I heard he was coming back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I think the Raiders picked him up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow, that was unexpected. Had him on my fantasy team last season but that injury killed me for a few weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. Hopefully he's back in 100% beast mode this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely following the Raiders a lot more closely this year to find out. Been a few years since I've kept up with them so should be interesting."
