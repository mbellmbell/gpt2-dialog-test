"__MOVIES__ O.K., last time we talked about Brooklyn and simple movies, but you must have liked some blockbusters through the years."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose."
"__MOVIES__ Well, give me some of your favorites."
"__MOVIES__ O.K., but first you can't get down on me if they are not from this century."
"__MOVIES__ O.K., blockbusters from any era, but I won't give you Birth of the Nation or even Ben Hur or Cleopatra."
"__MOVIES__ All right--I'm not sure exactly what a blockbuster is--let's say high budget movies and ones in somewhat recent memory."
"__MOVIES__ I'll accept the ground rules."
"__MOVIES__ Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies."
"__MOVIES__ Not that recent."
"__MOVIES__ Not to start with, but they're still going."
"__MOVIES__ True, I just saw the recent Star Wars film--is Harrison Ford still doing Indy?"
"__MOVIES__ Not sure, but if he can't land his plane on the right runway..."
"__MOVIES__ All right, so we are all getting old."
"__MOVIES__ I liked Independence Day and Titanic."
"__MOVIES__ O.K. still not that recent."
"__MOVIES__ The problem I have with most of the recent big budget action movies is they're based on comic books."
"__MOVIES__ Were you not into comic books."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, no, so I can't relate to most of the characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and I think that character development is the most important thing in any movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think you're on to something there; we';"
