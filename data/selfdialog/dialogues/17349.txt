"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of Sofia Coppola's movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette. I thought they were good."
"__MOVIES__ Well she's got a new movie out called 'The Beguiled' that I'm dying to see."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't there a movie with Clint Eastwood from the '70s with that same name?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's a story based on a book. It takes place in the deep south, so the original movie comes with a heavy dose of patriarchy."
"__MOVIES__ One thing  I know about Sofia's movies is that they focus on the female experience. Is that the case in this film?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. She has a great cast of women including Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, and Elle Fanning, among others, who are all pitted against Colin Farrell's character."
"__MOVIES__ When does it take place?"
"__MOVIES__ During the civil war. However, sadly this movie doesn't incorporate contemporary music the way her other films do."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a bummer. I remember that being one of my favorite aspects of Marie Antoinette."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I'm still excited to see this. She just won the Best Director category at Cannes this year for the film."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it must be a great movie, since I think only one other woman has won that category before. It's quite competitive."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. I think it is indicative of her ability to convey such an interesting and thrilling story from a different perspective. I'm excited for the costumes and general aesthetic of the film."
"__MOVIES__ Sofia Coppola and gothic southern style - I never thought i'd hear those two in the same sentence!"
"__MOVIES__ She even filmed in the same plantation house as Beyonce's Lemonade!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it was intentional?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently she had no idea. She only found out when some of the younger girls working on her film were freaking out over it."
"__MOVIES__ You've got me excited to see the film now. When is it out in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ Last week of June, I think. Sofia herself said it's best to see it in theaters as it's a good collective experience."
"__MOVIES__ Count me in!"
