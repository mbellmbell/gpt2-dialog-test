"__MUSIC__ Hey Matt, I have a music question for you."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, hey Elliot, go ahead, I'm ready for you!"
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite musical group."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, that's a good question.  Why do you want to know?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm looking for some new music to listen to, and know you have good taste."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks man, right now I think my favorite band is Metallica."
"__MUSIC__ Metallica?  Are they still around?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure they're still around, they just released a new album a few months ago, and are on tour."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, is their new album any good?"
"__MUSIC__ I like it a lot, it's their best music in years."
"__MUSIC__ Really, I liked them in the 80s and 90s, but haven't heard much of their later stuff."
"__MUSIC__ You should check out the new album."
"__MUSIC__ What's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ Hardwired to Self Destruct."
"__MUSIC__ Nice album title!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so too.  You can watch some YouTube videos of them recording the album, they're pretty interesting."
"__MUSIC__ I bet they are.  Are there a lot of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there are at least 5 I think, its fun watching them think of ideas as they go along."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the music advice!  I appreciate it."
"__MUSIC__ No problem, man, enjoy!"
