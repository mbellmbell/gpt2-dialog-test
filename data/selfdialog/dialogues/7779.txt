"__POP__ Pop is such a weird category. It's like a catch-all bucket that you can toss everything else into."
"__POP__ It is -- it's basically every kind of music based off of the music American slaves sang to keep themselves sane. Up until pretty recently, in Europe it was all called 'black music'."
"__POP__ Yikes. Wasn't expecting a deep dive like this."
"__POP__ Well, you can't really avoid it. It's all about the class and race divide."
"__POP__ There is a sort of snootiness to the name. This is, ugh, popular music -- for the proles."
"__POP__ It's a euphemism. Everything about pop music is a euphemism, just like everything about white culture is about hiding our shame over our crimes."
"__POP__ Yee yimminy yikes. Let's dial it back, okay?"
"__POP__ I'm just being honest here. You know how 'dangerous' it was in the 1950s for nice young white girls to dance to that rock and roll music."
"__POP__ Well, that was a generational thing."
"__POP__ It's all about fear of black men having sex with white women. Rock and roll was at the time black slang for sex, just as jazz was a generation earlier."
