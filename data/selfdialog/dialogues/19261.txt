"__MOVIES__ What's up?"
"__MOVIES__ I just finished watching My Fellow Americans."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Jack Lemmon and James Gardner?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure is"
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie. It's so funny."
"__MOVIES__ It is good.  I can't believe I hadn't really heard of it before."
"__MOVIES__ It came out at the end of the year.   It was one of those blink and you miss it."
"__MOVIES__ Even with that cast?"
"__MOVIES__ Messed up huh?  Did you know Walter Matthau was supposed to play James Gardner's part?"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  No offense but I think James Gardner was the better choice."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I definitely agree.  I really liked how they made each party look good and bad."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's rare in movies now.  I wonder if Jack Lemmon hadn't died, if they would have made a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ That would have been cool and fun to see.  Both of them working together in the White House."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah.  Oh and that guy who played Ralph Flemming who was also in the gay pride parade was so cute."
"__MOVIES__ Yes he was.  It took me a couple minutes to fully realize who he was."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was the point.. makes you think and wonder like the main characters do."
"__MOVIES__ Are you going to buy the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I might if I find it at a good price."
"__MOVIES__ I got it for 5 dollars."
"__MOVIES__ Kewl, where?"
