"__ACTION__ So, you know what's really a good action movie?  Hot Fuzz."
"__ACTION__ Really?  Don't think I've seen that one."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I mean, for the first two actions, it's played up like a mystery/horror film with comedic elements, but then it Act III it goes into over-the-top Michael Bay style action."
"__ACTION__ Oh, not Michael Bay!  Getting tired of the Transformers movies."
"__ACTION__ No, no, this was made back when his biggest things were Bad Boys 2 and Point Break.  So, they movie does a lot of send up of those films."
"__ACTION__ Oh, that sounds fun."
"__ACTION__ Oh, yeah, there's a scene for instance where the main character and bad guy are fighting in a replica model of the village, so they shoot it like something out of a Godzilla movie."
"__ACTION__ Hahaha."
"__ACTION__ Another good one is how mainly of the lines they exchanged with characters previously in the film and respoken later one to give them extra meaning."
"__ACTION__ Oh, yeah, like a neat little call-back/"
