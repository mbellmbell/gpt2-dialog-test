"__STAR_WARS__ I want a Separatist Star Wars film. There I said it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like with Count Dooku or General Grievous or something?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, it could be about them. Or it could be about the Separatists who held out and kept fighting after the Clone Wars were over."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sort of like those Japanese soliders who kept fighting after World War II ended?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. It could take place between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, and show their futile fight for their beliefs in separatism."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose it is hard to believe that an army that managed to conquer half the galaxy would disappear overnight."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, the Confederacy of Independent systems had a lot of support. Even without the droid armies I'm sure some people would keep on swinging."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's good to want things. I don't think we'll ever see that movie, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ And that's fine, I would also take a General Grievous or Count Dooku film. Maybe showing what they were up to before Episode II."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like I said, it's good to want things."
