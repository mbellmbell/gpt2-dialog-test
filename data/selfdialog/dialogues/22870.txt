"__DISNEY__ I think all of my favorite Disney movies have animals as the main characters."
"__DISNEY__ Really? That's strange. Like which?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, when I was a kid I really loved One Hundred and One Dalmatians."
"__DISNEY__ I remember that one clearly too! It has such a great villain."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. Cruella DeVille is a pretty great name, even."
"__DISNEY__ It's funny to think that it's even set in England."
"__DISNEY__ Disney seems so American to me, it's hard for me to wrap my head around it too."
"__DISNEY__ As a kid I couldn't even really conceptualize it."
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad they picked that setting though. We even had Hugh Laurie play a character in the live action remake!"
"__DISNEY__ Now that was a great casting choice!"
