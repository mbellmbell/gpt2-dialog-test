"__MUSIC__ If you could only listen to one song for the rest of your life, what song would you pick?"
"__MUSIC__ Is that a trick question?"
"__MUSIC__ No, why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ Because it seems like a trick question."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Any music you listen to over and over again, you'll start to hate it."
"__MUSIC__ That's probably true."
"__MUSIC__ So any song I pick, it's basically a song that I will grow to despise."
"__MUSIC__ I guess maybe if you listen to it sparingly, it might be OK."
"__MUSIC__ I'd probably pick something from a style of music that's fairly undestated."
"__MUSIC__ Like Classical, maybe?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, maybe a classical composition. That wouldn't be as grating over time."
"__MUSIC__ Which one would you choose?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Fur Elise, by Beethoven."
"__MUSIC__ Why Fur Elise?"
"__MUSIC__ It's very beautiful, but it's also pretty understated compared with some of the more loud, operatic classical tunes."
"__MUSIC__ I can see how that's true."
"__MUSIC__ So that might have a chance of lasting for a whil before I grow to despise it."
"__MUSIC__ You've got a very gloomy outlook on music."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I just don't want to listen to only one song for the rest of my life!"
