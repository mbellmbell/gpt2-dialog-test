"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder who the oungest QB to win the superbowl is..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You and your questions"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm curious, Curiosity is good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Curiosity killed the cat, anyway, Roethlisberger was 23, when he won it for the steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's the youngest QB, period?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mariota and Winston are both 22."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have no chance of being the youngest QBs to win the superbowl, then"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. There is no way Titans or Buccaneers will be a superbowl winning teams within this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, yeah. Huh. I think being the youngest QB to win the superboal is more impressive then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a rare thing, but not more impressive, it's mostly luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because you have to be a good QB, and happened to be drafted by superbowl winning caliber team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, right, you sort fo have to be in the right place at the right time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. But given good enough QBs, it takes time to build a superbowl caliber team around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. what do you know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, they are getting younger on the average"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the average age of Superbowl winning QBs from 1998-2012 was around 28 or so"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's kinda similar to the average age of the superbowl winning team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, which happens to be aroudn 27 or so. it just take time for these players to develop into that caliber."
