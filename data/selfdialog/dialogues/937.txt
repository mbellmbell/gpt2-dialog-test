"__MUSIC__ What are your favorite music videos?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually haven't watched a music in a while."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think they're too shallow."
"__MUSIC__ I guess they can be."
"__MUSIC__ Like, every single video has half naked girls and beautiful people."
"__MUSIC__ I see what you mean. But maybe those are only the mainstream videos."
"__MUSIC__ What music videos do you watch?"
"__MUSIC__ Just the ones of my favorite bands. Those tend to be a little bit more artsy."
"__MUSIC__ Can you give me an example?"
"__MUSIC__ Well like in Tame Impala's videos, there are collages and paintings that move to the music."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds pretty trippy"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! It's pretty cool in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I should check out some music videos of some indie bands I like"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely."
"__MUSIC__ Where do I watch them?"
"__MUSIC__ You could see them for free on youtube."
"__MUSIC__ Oh right."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, just search the song and it should pop up."
"__MUSIC__ Will do."
