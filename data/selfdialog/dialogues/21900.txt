"__DISNEY__ Have you heard about the movie Gigantic?"
"__DISNEY__ No, what is it?"
"__DISNEY__ It's basically Disney's version of Jack and the Beanstalk."
"__DISNEY__ Oh!  Well, at least that's original.  I've never seen that as a movie before."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it comes out next year."
"__DISNEY__ Depending on how it looks, I might actually see this one."
"__DISNEY__ I wish Disney still did animated cartoons instead of that Pixar looking stuff."
"__DISNEY__ I feel the same way.  They don't make em like they used to."
"__DISNEY__ You'd think it would cost less to do it the older way.  I hear people all the time wishing they would go back to that."
"__DISNEY__ I wish Disney had a channel on tv where it just showed the 90s cartoons they did."
