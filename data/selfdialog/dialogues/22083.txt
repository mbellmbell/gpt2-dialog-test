"__DISNEY__ Do you think Jack Sparrow is getting too old?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ In the most recent movie, he looked... old."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah.  People age."
"__DISNEY__ You know what I mean.  It seems like Johnny Depp is just getting a bit old."
"__DISNEY__ He's like 50-something.  Of course he's going to look older."
"__DISNEY__ I was just expecting him to do more stunts and stuff."
"__DISNEY__ When you're 50, I doubt you'll be jumping around."
"__DISNEY__ I'll be sitting on my couch watching Johnny Depp do it instead."
"__DISNEY__ Oh brother."
