"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, NFL Training Camp starts in a few weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right how great is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's awesome as everything else is very boring this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean, NFL and football is where it is at!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how do you think the Lions will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a chance only if Stafford stays healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly! He is the key virtually to everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He needs to step it up and take this team to the next level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he does. He has talent around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true, but as Lions fans we are always skeptical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that but since Quinn took over we have improved the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true, as he is doing what many GM's never have here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Millen was a disaster, so nice to finally have a guy in place who seems to know what he is doing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really does thus far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if Stafford and the offense pick it up this year, I think the defense should be better with off season acquistions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Defense is better, we are faster, and hopefully make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Playoffs? We better get there and win a game....It's only been 20 years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't that crazy how long its been?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, but hopefully we turn it around. Go Lions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Forward down the Field LOL."
