"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are you still a rap fan?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes but not any of the new stuff. Classic hip hop all the way."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's just not as good now, the lyrics are all the same, the MCs all dress the same."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I remember you used to love Eve, LLCool J, Dre"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah still do. Eve and Ja Rule were the bomb, they still tour"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you been"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yep I say Ashanti, Eve, Ja Rule in Philly last year."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's good, shame you don't like the quality now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There's a really small few like Common that still have a message."
