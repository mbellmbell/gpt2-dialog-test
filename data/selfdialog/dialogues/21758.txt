"__DISNEY__ what do you think about Wall-E?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I fell in love with both the movie and the little robot the first time I saw it"
"__DISNEY__ not surprised, it's such a romantic trip between 2 robots"
"__DISNEY__ it's hard, isn't it? to make a romantic movie that's for kids, and it's between robots."
"__DISNEY__ it's difficult to think about indeed, but Disney did it again."
"__DISNEY__ what's your most memorable moments from that movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's definitely the wheel chair scene, where men no longer needs to walk, they go everywhere with elevated chairs"
"__DISNEY__ it's terrifying to think about, but I have seen some recent tech trends trying to push into that direction"
"__DISNEY__ Human just want to get lazy, don't they"
"__DISNEY__ yep, that's why we invent robots, so they can do the hard labor"
