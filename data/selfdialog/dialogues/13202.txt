"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you looking forward to the preseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I already bought more sports channels."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which ones do you have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got all the ESPNs & TNT sports. They included free streaming."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I only stream right now. I was going to wait until the season to get the bigger channels."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, you missed the Manning interview by Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did Steven A interviewed Manning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they had a sit down for about an hour."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did he talk about his injuries at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He only mentioned his workout routine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, Smith didn't press him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he didn't. He seemed to go easy on Peyton for some reason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably because he's a fan favorite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, it was favoritism for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When Matt inteviewed Manning, he didn't hold back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Matt was the one who got Manning to admit to his injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure did. Matt let it be known that Peyton was still in recovery."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want him back next season, but it's pointless if he's still injuried."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is absolultely no need to lie about his injuries. There is no way his team would trade him even injuried."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but I think it's a natural fear injured players have."
