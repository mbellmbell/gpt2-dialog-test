"__MOVIES__ What movie from your youth had the biggest impact?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I didn't see too many movies in my youth, but Grease made a big splash and I did see that one."
"__MOVIES__ Grease is a musical isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was the first musical I watched straight through I think, haha."
"__MOVIES__ Who starred in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well of course there was John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Also Frankie Avalon had a short appearance."
"__MOVIES__ Were there other well known stars in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure there were, but I was too young to recognize them then, or I don't recall them now."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that the movie that launched John Travolta's career?"
"__MOVIES__ No, John made his big splash in Saturday Night Fever which came out a couple years earlier, I think."
"__MOVIES__ But Grease was a big movie for him also, was it not?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, Grease was a big hit for John and Olivia Newton John."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think the movie did so well?"
"__MOVIES__ Well a part of the movie's success was the soundtrack. There were some very catchy tunes in the movie that were played constantly on the radios."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any famous lines or scenes that you recall?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh there are many of them. I can almost sing Frankie Avalon's song 'Beauty School Dropout.'"
"__MOVIES__ Was that the big song from the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, there was a song entitled Grease, and a ballad Hopelessly Devoted to You that both did very well."
"__MOVIES__ Who sang those songs?"
"__MOVIES__ Grease was sung by the cast, at least in the movie, and the other song was a solo by Olivia Newton-John, who is a professional singer."
