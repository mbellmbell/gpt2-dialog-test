"__MOVIES__ I'm really excited to see the new Wonder Woman movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Eh, I'm kind of lukewarm about it."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ The D.C. Universe comic book movies haven't really done it for me."
"__MOVIES__ You like the Marvel ones better?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! I loved the Iron Man and Captain America series."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they were pretty decent. But I'm not a big Robert Downey Junior fan."
"__MOVIES__ Really, I thought he was great as Tony Stark."
"__MOVIES__ He just comes across as kind of smug and superior."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but in a pretty hilarious way."
"__MOVIES__ Regardless, I've heard some really good things about Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ I saw a trailer that looked pretty good, but the D.C. thing still has me wary."
"__MOVIES__ What about the Christopher Nolan Batman movies? Those were great!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they were awesome, but I kind of put them in their own category. Not quite in the same realm as the other D.C. stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think mostly because of Christopher Nolan's influence. Take a look at the Joker?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ In Dark Knight, Ledger as the Joker was pretty much the best thing ever! In Suicide Squad, Leto was cringe worthy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can't really argue."
"__MOVIES__ So anyway, I probably won't see Wonder Woman. At least not in theaters."
