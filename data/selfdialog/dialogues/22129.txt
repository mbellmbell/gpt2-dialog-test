"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see Descendants?"
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't that the movie released directly on Disney channel?"
"__DISNEY__ That's the one."
"__DISNEY__ Nope.  Thought it looked cheap."
"__DISNEY__ I think you'll be surprised, it was quite good."
"__DISNEY__ I prefer to stick with the classics."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really?  What classics do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Like Tangled, stuff like that."
"__DISNEY__ Dude, you don't even know what the classics were.  Go back to the 90's for much better stuff."
"__DISNEY__ Snow White, hello?  I know the older classics too, buddy."
