"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the movie The Wizard of Oz?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah!  That's one of my all time favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is great.  Judy Garland as Dorothy is amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the soundtrack is great.  I love when she sings Somewhere Over the Rainbow."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that is beautiful.  It scared me when I was little."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What scared you about it?"
"__MOVIES__ The witch and the monkeys.  I thought they were real."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess I could see that.  The witch was pretty spooky."
"__MOVIES__ Especially when she melted.  I used to close my eyes during that part."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny.  I always thought the munchkins were weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they are a little bizarre.  It's based off a book, did you know that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, by Frank L. Baum I believe."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's right.  There's so much Wizard of Oz memorabilia out now."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I saw a really cool music box."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've seen some neat stuff too.  I wonder what other movies Judy Garland was in?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure.  I only remember her from the Wizard of Oz."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the follow up movie, The Land of Oz?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that what it was called? I think I saw it as a kid but I don't remember much about it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too.  I remember liking it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can't even remember if I liked it or not."
