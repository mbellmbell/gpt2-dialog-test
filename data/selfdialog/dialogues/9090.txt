"__BASEBALL__ Have you heard about the doping scandal in baseball recently?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I haven't. What doping scandal?"
"__BASEBALL__ They're saying that some 20 baseball players may face suspension!"
"__BASEBALL__ Twenty? That's just crazy! What players are involved?"
"__BASEBALL__ The report didn't mention all the names but they said that Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun are involved in the scandal."
"__BASEBALL__ So, what are they doing about it?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, the players union said that players are being interviewed by baseball officials and are represented by attorneys."
"__BASEBALL__ This could become the worst drug-abuse scandal in the history of U.S. sports!"
"__BASEBALL__ Tell me about it. The league declined to comment to CNN but confirmed that an investigation is in the works."
"__BASEBALL__ I heard that Rodriguez admitted to using banned substances when he played with the Texas Rangers in the early 2000s."
"__BASEBALL__ But he denied using performance-enhancing drugs this time."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he's telling the truth?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's hard to say. Nowadays, many athletes turn to these kinds of drugs to improve their game."
"__BASEBALL__ For his sake, I hope he's telling the truth."
"__BASEBALL__ It would be a shame to lose a good player like him."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you think will happen if they are found guilty?"
"__BASEBALL__ They mentioned that the league may ban the players for 100 games."
"__BASEBALL__ Seriously? That's a bit much. Don't you think?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, they're counting the doping as one fraction and lying about having taken the drugs as a second one."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I see. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens."
