"__MOVIES__ What is the most tragic scene in movie history?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure... there are lots of good ones."
"__MOVIES__ What about the scene at the end of Moulin Rouge where Satine dies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a good one."
"__MOVIES__ I especially am convinced by Christian's crying. The choked sobs were spot on."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know right?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like movies where one of the main characters gets hurt or dies, and his or her lover cries over them."
"__MOVIES__ Haha that's interesting!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think that's really what love is. I mean, you can say that you love someone, but you never know until you put it to the test."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, that's what movies are for - you can live out your fantasies through the actors."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah... what are your favorite movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I like Avatar. I like it for the music and the visuals."
"__MOVIES__ You don't care much for the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't, and in fact before I watch a movie, I read the entire plot summary including the ending."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't that spoil it? Why would you do that?"
"__MOVIES__ I need to know if it's interesting - I need to know the big picture because when I watch a movie, I focus on the details."
"__MOVIES__ You're a film critic, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ I never voice my opinions on websites or anything... it's just for personal enjoyment."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you should get a Rotten Tomatoes account."
"__MOVIES__ I have one, but people would just think I'm crazy or ranting..."
