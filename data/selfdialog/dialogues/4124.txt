"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of the band Third Eye Blind?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I've been to three of their concerts."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That's awesome. Did you know they came out with a new Album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea I heard, but I haven't had a chance to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ You should, it's pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I kind of stopped listening to them when they got political."
"__MUSIC__ When did that happen?"
"__MUSIC__ Around the time Bush was in office."
"__MUSIC__ So, whats wrong with a band that stands for something."
"__MUSIC__ Nothing, that's just not what I was used to. I liked their songs about love, and life."
"__MUSIC__ Yea I get that, motorcycle driveby is one of my all time favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too, it really helped me get over a bad break up."
"__MUSIC__ Yea it did the same for me. But you should still check out the new album."
"__MUSIC__ Well I researched it online and it looks to be mostly political."
"__MUSIC__ You should make your own judgement though."
"__MUSIC__ The thing is, I don't want to taint my memory of them. Right now I still love them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I get it, you think if you listen to the new stuff, you won't like them anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, it's why I just stick to listening to Semi Charmed Life and Blinded. I love those songs."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I could listen to them all day."
"__MUSIC__ I normally do."
