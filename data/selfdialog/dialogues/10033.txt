"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who do you think was better, Biggie or Tupac?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think they both were about equal."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think Biggie told more stories in his music. Pac kept it real."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you mean kept it real?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Pac had rap that made you stop and think and want to take action. Biggie told you a good story to listen to while smoking a blunt."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You are so silly. But you do have a point."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I got music from both of them in my phone and on my computer."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Me too. I think I got every album downloaded that Pac ever made."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ His best album was All Eyez on Me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know right. I can't wait to see the movie with the same title, it looks like it will be good."
