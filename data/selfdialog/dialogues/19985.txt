"__MOVIES__ What is the first movie you ever watched?"
"__MOVIES__ I barely remember going to see the original Rocky at a drive in with my parents."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that must be quite a memory. I've never been to a drive in."
"__MOVIES__ It's a pretty cool experience. There are still a few in existence and I've always meant to find one to go to."
"__MOVIES__ What about Rocky? How much of the movie did your remember?"
"__MOVIES__ I fell asleep that night during the movie. But I have seen it since, along with some of the others."
"__MOVIES__ Which one was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one was really good, the classic underdog story."
"__MOVIES__ As I remember, some of them are pretty corny."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember Rocky II very well, but III and IV I did see. Rocky III I thought was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Rocky III had Mr. T in it right? And Hulk Hogan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was a bit much but I still liked it. Even though Apollo Creed died in the ring."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, what about Rocky IV, the one with the Russian?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked that one too, Rocky against the Russian Machine. The training montage was both epic and corny."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's a hallmark of the Rocky movies. The training montage, the very earnest dialogue."
"__MOVIES__ Rocky ripping down the Russian's picture, I laugh when I think about it."
"__MOVIES__ Then there's Adrian. Her relationship with Rocky was what motivated him."
"__MOVIES__ She was his inspiration, but some of the things they said to each other made me cringe."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the more recent movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen Rocky V and probably won't. But I saw Rocky Balboa and liked it and I want to see Creed."
