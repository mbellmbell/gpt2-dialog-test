"__MOVIES__ Guardians of the Galaxy 2 bothered me."
"__MOVIES__ I loved it! What didn't you like?"
"__MOVIES__ There were a lot of implications that need to be played out."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, his body is in ALL planets and were growing and killing millions, if not more. Will the Marvel movies address that?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably SHIELD will make a passing reference and fix the problem."
"__MOVIES__ So, Peter saw the whole universe, remember?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, his dad showed it with the God powers."
"__MOVIES__ He stripped Peter of those powers and he's now mortal."
"__MOVIES__ yes, so?"
"__MOVIES__ They never said that he lost his memory. Did he see Thanos? Does he know what's coming?"
"__MOVIES__ That actually could be interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Did anything bother you?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm an optimist. Keep going."
"__MOVIES__ I love Gamora Nebula, but their whole existence in the movie had no meaning."
"__MOVIES__ Why? There was some redemption."
"__MOVIES__ They literally fought until they stopped. The plot of the movie did NOT have this be necessary."
"__MOVIES__ At least Baby Groot was around!"
"__MOVIES__ He was so irritating! Cute, but he did nothing!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he's so adorable"
