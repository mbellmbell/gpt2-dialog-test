"__BASKETBALL__ So do the Celtics have any chance of taking a game from the Cavs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think so. Lebron seems driven to take this title as quickly as possible."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, they haven't lost a game these playoffs, have they?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, and the Celtics have now dropped seven, so they've only saved themselves one game to rest."
"__BASKETBALL__ They seem pretty run down."
"__BASKETBALL__ They do have a decent bench."
"__BASKETBALL__ They do. It's not as experienced as the Cavs, but probably just as good."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wouldn't be surprised if Stevens finds some rotation scheme to make the last two games a bit more competitive."
"__BASKETBALL__ If the outside shooters hit some shots at the beginning of a game, things could be different."
"__BASKETBALL__ Olynyk needs to step up again for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Bradley has been a bit off as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ And even Thomas."
"__BASKETBALL__ Tristan Thompson has been killing them on the glass early on as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, for sure. Stevens doesn't have much in the way of a response for that available, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Perhaps he should start more energy guys."
"__BASKETBALL__ He did Green already, who else?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Jaylen Brown?"
"__BASKETBALL__ True, he's been getting after the boards."
"__BASKETBALL__ Getting the rookie some more hard playoff minutes might be the best they can salvage from this series now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and at least with games every other day, the series will be over soon and they can turn to the draft."
