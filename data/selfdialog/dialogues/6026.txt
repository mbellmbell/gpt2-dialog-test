"__STAR_WARS__ Who is more evil? Kylo Ren or Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ooh, good question. There's so many places this can go."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was a fully-trained Jedi, and CHOSE to do what he did. For decades."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kylo Ren helped destroy an entire star system."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but he's young. He still has time to be redeemed sooner rather than later."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kylo is more powerful for sure, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth couldn't sense his own daughter in the same room as him. That's kind of sad."
