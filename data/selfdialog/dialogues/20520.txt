"__MOVIES__ I finally watched the new Star Wars movie the other day."
"__MOVIES__ How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it had way too many characters that went nowhere, but the action was good."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it, but that's what other people were saying."
"__MOVIES__ You must not see many movies then if you haven't seen the new Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ No, I usually just watch what I can get on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Then you'll miss out on a lot of good movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but I can't justify the price of tickets at the theater."
"__MOVIES__ What about old movies, though? Did you see the old Star Wars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean like the one with Jar Jar Binks?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that's The Phantom Menace, Episode I. The 'prequels' were terrible."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I was just joking. Of course I've seen the originals; everyone has."
"__MOVIES__ OK, that's good. A New Hope is probably my all time favorite movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was good, but I like movies that don't take themselves so seriously."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen The Fifth Element? That's the best sci-fi movie I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That movie was ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ That's the whole point. It made me laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, you're one of those comedy movie type people, then."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's usually what I prefer to watch over some really serious movie like a horror or scifi or drama."
