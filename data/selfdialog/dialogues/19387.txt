"__MOVIES__ Are there any movies coming up that you're excited about?"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard good things about Black Panther."
"__MOVIES__ Black Panther?  Oh, the Marvel one, from the Captain America movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I liked T'Challa in Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ So, what about Spider-Man?  I mean, the new one was in that too."
"__MOVIES__ Homecoming?  No, I don't think I'm going to see that."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, a few reasons: I'm actually pretty selective in my Marvel movies, there've been too many Spider-Man reboots recently, and I was actually slightly annoyed by him in Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ So, then a definite no there."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but like I said Black Panther sounds good, even though it's not until next year.  Also, pretty far off, but I'm looking forward to Ocean's Eight."
"__MOVIES__ Ocean's Eight?  Like another sequel to Clooney's Ocean's Eleven?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but more of a spin-off with Sandra Bullock as Danny Ocean's sister and a female crew she puts together for a heist."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, and some others."
"__MOVIES__ Rihanna?  The singer, Rihanna?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  You know, she was in Battleship, though the movie was terrible, she wasn't bad."
"__MOVIES__ You saw Battleship?"
"__MOVIES__ It was on TV, I was curious.  It was a bit like watching a crash in slow motion - you could see it very wrong, but it was hard to look away."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that happens sometimes.  I mean, I've watched a few SyFy Originals."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can't say it was fun, but it was certainly attention-getting."
