"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite Star Wars Villain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Is there any other answer than Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I liked Darth maul the most."
"__STAR_WARS__ What?! Darth Vader is iconic, Darth Maul is already forgotten about."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is not! People still dress up like him for Halloween."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, but it's been what, 10 years since his movies have come out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, so what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well its been over 40 for the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't see your point."
