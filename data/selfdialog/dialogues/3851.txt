"__MUSIC__ My friend is having an album release party for the new Decemberists album. Want to come?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. What kind of music is it."
"__MUSIC__ It's like indie folk-pop. Very Portland."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I could get into that."
"__MUSIC__ I think you'd like it, and even if it's a bust, it's still a party."
"__MUSIC__ Any songs I would know?"
"__MUSIC__ They had one called The Crane Wife that was on a few sitcoms. It's based on the folktale."
"__MUSIC__ Is that a thing they usually do? Base music on folktales?"
"__MUSIC__ They do it more often than most bands. There are a few songs like that."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm.. anything else?"
"__MUSIC__ Lots of literary references. One of the band members has an MFA in writing, so I guess he's witty."
"__MUSIC__ That could be interesting."
"__MUSIC__ We could listen beforehand if you want and then decide?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be good. What should we start with."
"__MUSIC__ The song Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect is my favorite. It's very low key."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Do you have it on your phone."
"__MUSIC__ Actually no, but I bet we can search for."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Let's listen."
"__MUSIC__ Here we go. What do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I'll come to the party."
