"__DISNEY__ Do you remember that movie about the bed that could take you anywhere?"
"__DISNEY__ Bed Knobs and Broomsticks?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that's it... what a crazy movie that was."
"__DISNEY__ Why would you decide to make a magic flying bed, I mean it's not exactly inconspicuous."
"__DISNEY__ No, I agree.   When they travel to Portobello Road and end up in the middle of the market, surely someone would notice."
"__DISNEY__ Is that the scene where they find part of the book?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and then realise it's only half of it.  They need to travel to the Isle of Naboombu to get the other park from King Leonidas."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't like to have a game of that football match."
"__DISNEY__ No, nor me.  I like my legs in one piece!"
"__DISNEY__ What a classic, Treguna, Mekoides, Trecorum, Satis, Dee!"
