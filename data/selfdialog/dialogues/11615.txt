"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is gronk going to be healthy for this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. I'm not actually sure though."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. I don't know how many more years he is going to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. I just kind of expect him to be here forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Patriots will make it to the superbowl again this year?"
