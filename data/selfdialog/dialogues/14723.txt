"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, there I was thinking about going and seeing a movie. Would you like to go?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have not been to a movie in years. They are to expensive."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know they are expensive sometimes but I like to go to a matinee because they are cheaper."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That might be an option."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I also like to go to matinee's because there are normally fewer people."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That sounds like a great reasons to go to matinees."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What kind of movie would you liek to go see?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I like all kinds of movies except horror type ones."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I see there are several that I would like to go to. Maybe you can help narrow it down a bit,."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I definatly do not want to go see any romance type drama movies this time around."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I found Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Which one sounds better to you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have not seen Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Is there any other options besides Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What about The Fate of the Furious or King Arthur: Legend of the Sword? I really like period pieces."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Now that is a hard decision to make between all three movies. I also like period pieces."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ If we are going to go see King Arthur: Legend of the Sword during a matinee time it looks like it is only showing at 3:05pm today. Does that work for you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I am not sure I can do that today. is it showing tomorrow around the same time? If it is I can do it tomorrow."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They have it at either 3:25 or 4.30 tomorrow. Which time works best for you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I would like to go to the later one at  4.30 tomorrow."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sounds great! I will meet you at my house at 3:45pm so we can go together to the movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sound good to me. See you tomorrow."
