"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me what your thoughts are about the new NFL Season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am really excited for the regular season to get underway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean - it is almost painful waiting on the regular season during the summer"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly - the pre-season and summer camps are usually disappointing, it has no resemblance to the regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If anything it always seems like the pre-season and regular season are exact opposites."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right - what I hate is when someone from my favorite team gets injured during pre-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! that has happened before to my teams.  Who is your favorite team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a couple I watch faithfully. But living in the Washington DC area. I am a Redskins fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow lots new there this year. What do you think about the Doug Williams hire?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like all other fans of the Redskins - love him. But I think he is in a no-win job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah if I guy like Joe Gibbs came back and couldn't fix things or get them better - not sure anyone can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The best news we would ever get as fans is if Dan Snyder sells the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats never going to happen though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well one can hope - maybe he will get an offer he can't refuse one day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have any opinions on the Redkins name controversy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes - I totally see both sides of it - but again it's a Dan Snyder thing I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah - what would you like to see happen if it was your choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If it were up to me - I look at it and say if it is offensive - who am I to keep something so major that it offends so many people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel the same... it's not like it is a cool name or the best franchise name ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the fact it is our Capital city is bad too... it should be something government or US related I think."
