"__STAR_WARS__ Who's your favorite Star Wars heroine?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think that any actress can top Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, but I have enjoyed the new female leads too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Daisy Ridley's portrayal of Rey in the new movies has been really good I think."
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure, she's a great actress and fits the Jedi role perfectly. She's tough and likable at the same time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really enjoyed the relationship between Rey and Finn as well. Can't wait to see where that leads."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know right, December can't come fast enough! I can't wait for the new movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Natalie Portman? What did you think about her as Anakin's love interest?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She was ok. The Star Wars movies that she was in were not my favorite, but she wasn't bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, my thoughts as well. Rey is my favorite new female lead, but Princess Leia will always be top of the list!"
"__STAR_WARS__ All this talk of Star Wars characters makes me want to have movie marathon this weekend and watch them all again!"
