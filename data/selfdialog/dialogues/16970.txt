"__MOVIES__ I finally broke down and watched Don't Breathe last night."
"__MOVIES__ How did you like it? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ No. I did not."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think it was too bad."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like it how the one character who didn't want to do the job ended up dead."
"__MOVIES__ You know, that stung me too. If he did not try to save that girl..."
"__MOVIES__ He would still be alive."
"__MOVIES__ A home invasion story gone wrong."
"__MOVIES__ It was intensely a smart thriller. But not as many jumps and scares as I would have liked."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't jump at all."
"__MOVIES__ It did have me holding  my breath more than once."
"__MOVIES__ It had you scared to breathe, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Some but if you think about it, the entire  premise of Don't Breathe was stupid."
"__MOVIES__ Because a 65 year old blind veteran living with his dog and is sitting on a pile of money. But he is able to overtake 3 intruders."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe he was a special kind of blind. He did serve in the military."
"__MOVIES__ That makes no difference. Blind people are feeble and portraying this guy as some sort of buff super villain is idiotic."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that as ironic. The man is blind, you want to rob him but he over powers you instead."
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of messed up to rob a blind guy, isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ The moral of the story is."
"__MOVIES__ Don't mess with the blind?"
