"__MOVIES__ What did you think about 'Doctor Strange?'"
"__MOVIES__ I was honestly surprised that the movie worked."
"__MOVIES__ There definitely was a lot working against it.  The fact that it's so not grounded in realism, must have been a challenge to make."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Benedict Cumberbatch's performance?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think he is great in every role he plays.  However, his accent was rather lacking."
"__MOVIES__ You're right.  I guess you can't be good at everything."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it would have been better for him to keep his normal voice, since it's so great as is."
"__MOVIES__ I think more than Cumberbatch, I really liked Tilda Swinton's performance as The Ancient One."
"__MOVIES__ She was so great.  I love her range as an actress."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she is truly talented.  I just saw her in 'Okja.'"
"__MOVIES__ I did too.  She becomes a different person from role to role."
"__MOVIES__ I would also give an honorable mention to Mads Mikkelson."
"__MOVIES__ He really knows how to play an excellent villain."
"__MOVIES__ He has a pattern of great villain roles.  From 'Casino Royale' to 'Hannibal.'"
"__MOVIES__ Though don't forget that he was the good guy in 'Rogue One,' just disguised as a villain."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see Doctor Strange in the new Avengers movies."
"__MOVIES__ It will be an interesting dynamic to see Stephen Strange interact with the other Avengers."
"__MOVIES__ Especially someone like Stark."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see that.  They are basically the same character."
"__MOVIES__ They even both have cool facial hair."
