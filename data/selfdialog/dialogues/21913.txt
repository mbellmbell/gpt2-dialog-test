"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Dead Men Tell No Tales - yes!  I loved it."
"__DISNEY__ I've loved all the Pirates movies, but I was glad to see some of the old characters back again."
"__DISNEY__ No kidding - I loved seeing Will turner again!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!  I just wish that Elizabeth Swan would have had some dialog.  I hope that there will be some more sequals."
"__DISNEY__ I had heard that this was supposed to be the last one, but that it may be a multi movie finale."
"__DISNEY__ I just hope that Barbossa isn't really dead.  He's one of my favorite characters."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I was thinking about that too.  He died in the first movie but Tia Dalma brought him back, so maybe he isn't dead again."
"__DISNEY__ I like Tia Dalma - I liked her better than the new witch in this movie."
"__DISNEY__ I agree - I loved the Tia Dalma/Calypso/Davy Jones themes."
