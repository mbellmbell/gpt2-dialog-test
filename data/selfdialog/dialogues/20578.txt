"__MOVIES__ Have you had a chance to see the new live-action Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I absolutely loved it!  What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I definitely think that nothing could replace the animated film, but it was incredible!"
"__MOVIES__ The only issue was I wish they had a stronger singer for Belle than Emma Watson."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  She was a perfect choice for personality and acting, but the singing seemed to fall short"
"__MOVIES__ Especially since the rest of the cast was so phenomenal!"
"__MOVIES__ I know!  Dan Stevens and Josh Gad were amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ And Luke Evans as Gaston - perfect choice!"
