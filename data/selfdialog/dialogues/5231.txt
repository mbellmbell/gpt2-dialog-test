"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No not yet.  Whats that one called again?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Its called The Fate of the Furious."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you think that's going to be the last one?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm not sure.  I think they said it would be the last one but they seem to just keep churning them out."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was really sad when Paul Walker died."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was.  I really liked the ending of Fast and Furious 7 where they did kind of like a little tribute to him."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh yeah that was really cool.  I wonder how they did those scenes since he was already dead?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think they used a lot of CGI but I know his brothers stepped in and filmed some for him."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's so cool that they can do stuff like that."
