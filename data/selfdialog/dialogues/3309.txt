"__MUSIC__ Do you like the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love them!"
"__MUSIC__ Cool. Which album is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Sgt. Pepper."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's interesting! So you like their more experimental work?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think they really started to experiment with Revolver, and it just kept getting better from there."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite album is the White Album."
"__MUSIC__ That's a really beautiful album. So you tend to like their later stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I like all of it, even their earlier sappy stuff that got them famous."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny, I don't really like anything before Rubber Soul. I guess I don't like the poppy love songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I get that. They're just so melodic, it's hard not to sing along to them."
"__MUSIC__ So have you listened to all the Anthologies?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I really like the 2nd Anthology. How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I have, but not closely. What did you lie about the 2nd one?"
"__MUSIC__ Just hearing them experiment and say funny things."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and they have some good alternative versions, if I recall."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. And some funny ones."
"__MUSIC__ Could I borrow some of them from you? I'd like to listen to them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, of course! I'll send you all three of them."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, thanks! Looking forward to discussing the 2nd one with you after I listen to it."
