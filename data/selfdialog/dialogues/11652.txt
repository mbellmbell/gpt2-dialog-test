"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K. the other day we talked about the greatest NFL team of all time--who was the greatest player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, I've actually thought about this, and I think you have to do it by position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the quarterbacks have the biggest impact these days, but they are not the best athletes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K., who are?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All right, I'll go with you.  Who is the greatest running back of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Jim Brown would say it is Jim Brown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might be right, but since we didn't see him that much, let's eliminate him from the discussion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll throw out O.J. Simpson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because of his troubles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I didn't mean discard him--I meant consider him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, pretty darn good--playing in the Buffalo weather on poor teams hurts his ranking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if all the games we're on artificial turf, I'd go with Barry Sanders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed.  Dickerson has the most yards, but I was never a big fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, big and powerful, but the elusive backs are more fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, like Gale Sayers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, my; he scored, I think, six touchdowns once against my Niners."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's consider Adrian Peterson and move on--I'd take any of the guys we've talked about."
