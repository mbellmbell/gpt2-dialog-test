"__MUSIC__ We have been losing so many legendary musicians lately."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  David Bowie, Prince, Chris Cornell."
"__MUSIC__ We lost Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots too."
"__MUSIC__ We did.  They were a good band, but I don't know if I consider them legendary."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't disagree.  He wasn't on the level of Prince."
"__MUSIC__ Prince may have been one of the most popular and accomplished musicians that we have had in recent history."
"__MUSIC__ Do you really think so?"
"__MUSIC__ I do.  Many people don't know about all his talents."
"__MUSIC__ Prince is great, but he was just a singer right?  His band were the real musicians."
"__MUSIC__ No.  Prince was like a one-man band."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ He played multiple instruments.  On his first album, he played every single instrument that appeared on the album."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ He would often go into a music studio and create entire songs without the need for anyone else."
"__MUSIC__ How come we don't hear more about Prince's musical abilities?"
"__MUSIC__ We do.  However, I think people were more caught up by Prince's image and didn't focus on his abilities."
"__MUSIC__ Prince did have a lot of crazy rumors swirling around about him."
"__MUSIC__ That is the type of figure Prince was.  He was an artist."
"__MUSIC__ I think I am going to have to listen to his entire discography."
"__MUSIC__ Good luck.  Prince has a lot of albums."
