"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you think was Roman Pierce's best line in 2 fast 2 furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm actually torn on that one. If I had to choose then when they were walking away at the end of the movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ After they took some of the ransom cash."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, after Brian said 'Our pockets ain't empty cuz', then Roman lifts up his shirt and says 'and we ain't hungry no more either', and he's got cash stuffed in his pants."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was a great walkout line, what was your number two."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well it's not so much what he said but what he did when he said it. It was when they were driving to the final meet."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Let me guess, it was just when he hit the ejector button."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes! That was hilarious, he just hit the button and shouts to the guy 'ejecto seato cuz!', I was on the floor laughing after that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well it is hard narrowing down a Roman Pierce quote."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well of course it is, he never stops talking or he'd die."
