"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I watched a bunch of the older ones over and over again on VHS when I was a kid, so those tend to be the ones I'm most familiar with."
"__STAR_WARS__ But you're not old enough you saw them come out in the theaters originally, are you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope, but I think these tapes might even have been taped off of television!"
"__STAR_WARS__ So of the older ones, which one do you like the best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ah, the culmination. What do you like about that one in particular?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, first of all, the acting gets a lot better in this one than in the first two movies!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh come on, the story is wonderful but the acting is so bad in the first film. Harrison Ford is by far the best, and he's not great."
