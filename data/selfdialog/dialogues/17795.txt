"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen any movies since I saw Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ Well, there have been 7 or 8 Star Wars movies, depending on how you count them. Which one are you talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Rogue One. It was the most recent Star Wars movie."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it. I thought it stayed pretty true to what George Lucas had set up for Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so you're a big Star Wars fan then?"
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't say I'm one of those die-hard fans. Die-hard fans have been into Star Wars since the first three movies in the '80s."
"__MOVIES__ So the first three Star Wars movies came out in the '80s?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, yes and no. The '80s, and the end of the '70s, is when episodes 4,5 and 6 were really popular."
"__MOVIES__ So when were episodes 1, 2 and 3 in theatres?"
"__MOVIES__ Those actually came out after 4,5, and 6."
"__MOVIES__ Why did 4,5 and 6 come out first?"
"__MOVIES__ George Lucas used a theatrical approach derived from the literary approach of in medias res."
"__MOVIES__ What does that mean? How does that work?"
"__MOVIES__ That means 'in the middle of things'. It's an old story technique used to get the person involved in the action from the very beginning of the story."
"__MOVIES__ What about Star Trek movies? What makes someone decide to use In Medias Res?"
"__MOVIES__ Star Trek movies actually came out in response to the popularity of the orginal T.V. series. So viewers were already kind of involved."
"__MOVIES__ Was there anything that the Star Wars movie franchise was based on before it started?"
"__MOVIES__ It all came from the mind of George Lucas, originally. There was no TV show before it or anything like that."
