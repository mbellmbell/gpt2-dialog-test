"__BASKETBALL__ i wonder what the worst traveling violation is, then"
"__BASKETBALL__ Define worst."
"__BASKETBALL__ The longest travel."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think you mean the most steps took. It's more common nowadays because the NBA changed the rules. They allow traveling as long as it results ina cool play"
"__BASKETBALL__ Ok fine, then whatever. What's the most number of steps taken during a play that should've been called traveling."
"__BASKETBALL__ Um the most I've seen is 7 with Carmello.Anthony."
"__BASKETBALL__ What happened with that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It wasn't called. He just walked with the ball in his right hand for like 7 steps. And the end play wasn't all that cool either."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's not fair that they're not consistent with play calls."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, it is pretty cool when they do break away and go down the court to make a nice play."
"__BASKETBALL__ Like what?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Like Corey Brewer. He takes the ball away and travels clear across the court, and about mid court, he takes the ball and proceeds to dunk"
"__BASKETBALL__ Did he make it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep"
"__BASKETBALL__ and he was traveling?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Really really badly. He was practically carrying the ball for half the court almost."
"__BASKETBALL__ See, that's not fair if you ask me"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the play was cool. It was his ball. He took it away."
"__BASKETBALL__ But that doesn't mean we should allow players to break the rules."
"__BASKETBALL__ Often dribbling causes players to lose the ball. At least this exception rule, we get to see cool plays and they still count towards the game."
