"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the movie, 'Treasure Planet?'"
"__DISNEY__ I do! It's one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ I know right, it's like no one remembers it though."
"__DISNEY__ That's truely a shame, I mean the animation is-"
"__DISNEY__ Breathtaking!"
"__DISNEY__ Seriously!"
"__DISNEY__ All of the robotic parts are so intricately animated."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, I think they used both 2D and 3D animation to pull that off."
"__DISNEY__ Really?!"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, like with John Silver, his body was 2D but his cyborg parts were made in 3D."
