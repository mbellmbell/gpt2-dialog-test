"__MOVIES__ Hey, I need help finding a movie but I can't remember the title for the life of me."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. Do you remember what it was about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there were twos guys in it who wanted to be spies."
"__MOVIES__ Who were the actors in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember their names but I'd recognize them if I saw them."
"__MOVIES__ Go on."
"__MOVIES__ Like I sad, the two guys wanted to be spies, but they were complete idiots."
"__MOVIES__ That could be any Jim Carey movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure Carey wasn't in it. I'd remember that much."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't sound like something I've seen so."
"__MOVIES__ The two guys don't know that they're brothers at first."
"__MOVIES__ Brothers Grimsby."
"__MOVIES__ No, because from that movie you knew their were brothers all along and one was already a trained spy."
"__MOVIES__ I'm drawing a blank. Was it a comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ The movie had a bunch of crude humor it, so yes."
"__MOVIES__ Spies Like Us."
"__MOVIES__ No, it's not that one either."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I have no idea what it is. It would be helpful if you could remember some of the actors in it."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I haven't seen the movie in a while and I think I only watched it once with a friend."
"__MOVIES__ I think you should try searching the internet for it. It knows all."
