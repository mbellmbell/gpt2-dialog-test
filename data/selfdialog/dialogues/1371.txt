"__MUSIC__ What's up with Adele? She hasn't been out in public lately has she?"
"__MUSIC__ Didn't you hear? Adele said she may never tour again."
"__MUSIC__ NO!! Why?!?!"
"__MUSIC__ I think its because she wants to spend more time with her family."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that. but to just make a blanket statement like that?"
"__MUSIC__ I doubt she'll 'never tour again', I do expect that she's going to take a really long break."
"__MUSIC__ Well, why not just say 'I'm taking a really long break?'"
"__MUSIC__ Because if her fans think that she's never going to tour again, if and when she does, it'll be a sell out tour."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, everyone would want to be there for a comeback tour."
"__MUSIC__ Besides, there's lots of artists who say they'll never tour again,but sure enough when they need the money, they tour."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if this means that Adele is done making new albums as well?"
"__MUSIC__ I would venture a guess that it will be a while before that were to happen, if she does release anything new."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess you can't really have an album without a tour."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly.I bet she'll still do guest spots on television and sing on other people's albums. I don't think she'll be an actual recluse."
"__MUSIC__ Its just disappointing, when I saw her live, I was totally blown away. She puts on an amazing show!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I imagine that doing world tours where you're constantly singing and traveling has to be really draining to a person."
"__MUSIC__ Plus, her kid is getting older. So, I bet she wants some stability for him."
"__MUSIC__ She does seem like a really good mom, very involved and very caring."
"__MUSIC__ That's probably the biggest reason for not touring, I bet she just wants to have her kid grow up like a normal person."
"__MUSIC__ I'd lay money on her touring again once the kid is a bit more grown up. Right now, she probably just wants to be a normal mom"
