"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course!  My favorite is The Goblet of Fire."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really?  Why?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I think it was the most adventurous.  It was action paced, but kept itself grounded in the familiar territory of the kids at school."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess I understand that.  I really like The Order of the Phoenix."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The exact opposite of your reason--it gets the movie away from school and more into the actual world of wizardry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Huh.  I understand."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like them all, I mean.  But that one is my favorite."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like them all too."
