"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen The Goonies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really like that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's my favorite movie ever."
"__MOVIES__ It's hard to believe Mikey went on to be in Lord of the Rings."
"__MOVIES__ Sean Astin has been in a lot of great roles."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever play the Goonies video game?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I played the sequel on NES. That was one of the first video games I ever played."
"__MOVIES__ That one was weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you had to rescue a mermaid and beat up an eskimo with a hammer. But it's not like the movie wasn't weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was an 80s movie. Richard Donner did a good job directing it, though."
"__MOVIES__ Very little of the awkward blue screening like in Superman."
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing Goonies on the Disney channel once and thinking I was watching a sequel because they added in some deleted scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that. They cut out anything vulgar or dubbed over it, but put in a bunch of new scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I used to have a recording of it on VHS, but misplaced it over the years."
"__MOVIES__ I actually have Goonies on VHS, DVD, and Blu Ray. One for every generation. If I can find a Laserdisc version, I would probably get that too."
"__MOVIES__ Do you even own a Laserdisc player?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but it would be a nice collectible."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so."
"__MOVIES__ At least we can always see the movie. It's on TV constantly."
"__MOVIES__ It sure is."
