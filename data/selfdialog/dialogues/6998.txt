"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the Capitals got knocked out of the playoffs last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I saw that.  Such a disappointing final game.  I don't know what happened."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me neither. They played great the past three games and then just lost all desire to win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Classic Capitals.  The curse continues."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, it will only get worse too.  We'll be having some pick shakeups next year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How so?  Players leaving?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, we don't know yet, but Oshie, Shattenkirk, Winnik, and quite a few others will probably become free agents."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh man. The Caps are going to struggle without Oshie.  I really hope they can put something together again, Ovechkin really needs a cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, but I think he might be part of the problem.  He's very inconsistent in the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I noticed that he had several games with several points and then other games he did nothing at all."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh well.  I'm over it.  As long as the Penguins don't win the cup again."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who are you cheering for now?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I would say either the Predators or the Senators."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh yeah, having the eighth seed win the cup after beating the Blackhawks would be pretty cool."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, it would.  They seem like good guys, I have no reason not to like them.  But Karlsson in Ottawa has been playing out of his mind."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh, definitely, he's the best defenseman in the league right now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And Craig Anderson's wife having cancer and him missing a significant part of the season.."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that's such a sad story. Would be a great comeback for the team and him personally."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think so too. I think his wife is getting better since he decided to come back to the league."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I sure hope so.  A cup won't make up for your losing your wife to cancer.  Fingers crossed for the Senators to take it all."
