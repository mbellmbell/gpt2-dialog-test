"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, you a Star Wars fan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Somewhat, I remember watching the original movies on VHS when I was a little kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ I haven't gotten into the new ones as much, but the original trilogy is an all time classic."
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure, think about how many recognizable characters there are, from Chewbaca to R2D2 to Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ And saying something like 'the force' and everyone immediately knows what you're talking about."
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite part is the concept of something as powerful as a death star, and yet they are able to defeat it somehow."
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved the light saber fighting. We used to play like that when we were kids."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, the whole idea of being in outer space and fighting an evil empire is super fun."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's funny, the people who played that way as kids still dress up like that to see new Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Good point, it's a lifelong following."
