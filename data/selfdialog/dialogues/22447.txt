"__DISNEY__ I just watched one of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series movies. It was such an amazing experience. I really loved Johnny !"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes. It's an amazing series. Which one did you watch ?"
"__DISNEY__ I watched the 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'. I especially liked the way it ended. What a climax !"
"__DISNEY__ Is this the first 'Pirates of the Caribbean' you ever watched ? Wow, this one released in 2003. You are 14 years too late."
"__DISNEY__ Oh common ! I was not watching it for the first time. In fact, I have watched all five of them many times."
"__DISNEY__ Thank God ! I was wondering if you are at all living and keeping up with the real world."
"__DISNEY__ Which one is your favorite one ? Mine is the 2nd one which was released in 2006."
"__DISNEY__ Oh. Dead Man's Chest is it ? I liked that one as well. However, my favorite remains the one which was released in 2011; On Stranger Tides."
"__DISNEY__ Well...Honestly, it's do difficult to tell one over the other. All of them are pretty good. Do you know, if they are planning to bring the 6th one sometime in future ?"
"__DISNEY__ Though, I am not very sure. But, I heard rumors that they were planning to shoot the 6th one back to back the 5th one. If that's to be believed, we might have another treat in 2018 !"
