"__DISNEY__ Have you ever seen disney's rescuers down under?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I feel like it is often forgotten about completely."
"__DISNEY__ I was going to say that, funny."
"__DISNEY__ I love the mouse that reminds of zsa zsa gabor."
"__DISNEY__ I think she may have voiced that role, no?"
"__DISNEY__ That would make sense so much alike."
"__DISNEY__ Or rather one in the same. I liked the kangaroo."
"__DISNEY__ He was a good guy. The seagull was really funny too."
"__DISNEY__ Interesting disney uses seagulls in that way in The little mermaid too!"
"__DISNEY__ Never thought of that before, but true scuttle is also very funny."
