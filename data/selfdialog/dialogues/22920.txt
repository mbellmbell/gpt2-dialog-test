"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite classic Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I like Sleeping Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ I think my favorite is Peter Pan."
"__DISNEY__ Sleeping Beauty has the really sweet romance between Aurora and Prince Philip."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. Peter Pan doesn't really have a romance."
"__DISNEY__ And I love the fairy godmothers. They're so funny, and they get to save the day!"
"__DISNEY__ Peter Pan has a lot of funny parts, too."
"__DISNEY__ And both movies have a lot of good action scenes."
"__DISNEY__ But I have to love the movie that was the origin of Tinkerbell."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, you're right, that does make Peter Pan a classic!"
