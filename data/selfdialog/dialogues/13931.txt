"__BASKETBALL__ Did you catch that game last night between the San Antonio Spurs and the Golden State Warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course, I wouldn't have missed it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Game 3 of the series is pretty big one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, with the Spurs being down 0-2 in the series this one was cruicial for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ They really needed this win to stay alive, but it just wasn't happening for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Warriors were just too good!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see Durant last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure did! He was on fire!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he ended up with 33 points. He was hitting everything!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't forget the 10 rebounds he got too."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think injuries were what got the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, with Leonard out, they were hurting."
"__BASKETBALL__ Popovich said Leonard wasn't playing but I wasn't sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too. I was hoping it was just talk."
"__BASKETBALL__ Then Lee went down in the first quarter."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know! He came down hard on that left knee and didn't come back."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I guess game 4 could possibly finish the series for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not sure if the Spurs can come back from this."
"__BASKETBALL__ Looks like it's probably going to be the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers in Round 3."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wonder how that will turn out!"
