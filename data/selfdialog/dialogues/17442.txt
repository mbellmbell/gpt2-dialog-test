"__MOVIES__ You like Goddard?"
"__MOVIES__ At first I didn't get him."
"__MOVIES__ He has a way of creeping up on you, like a persistent cat that ends up on you lap when you didn't want him there and you get distracted and suddenly find it purring on your lap and you don't know how it got there."
"__MOVIES__ It is like that, isn't it."
"__MOVIES__ What's the first thing you saw of his?"
"__MOVIES__ WEEKEND. It was like taking drugs."
"__MOVIES__ Remember that scene where the couple is driving past what looked like a 50-car wreck?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. He established a mood, a sentiment in his films that was unlike anything happening in the U.S."
"__MOVIES__ I remember finally seeing BREATHLESS in college. It was for an existentialism in literature class."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds cool."
"__MOVIES__ The professor saw SO much going on beneath the surface."
"__MOVIES__ Nihilism?"
"__MOVIES__ Goddard's character, to a point. But his interpretation of the ending was crazy deep."
"__MOVIES__ When Belmondo gets shot and dies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and he does that Bogart thing with his thumb on his lip."
"__MOVIES__ I remember. It felt deep but I couldn't articulate anything cogent."
"__MOVIES__ The prof interpreted as Dostoevskyian apostolic succession, like in the 'Brothers Karamozov.'"
"__MOVIES__ That IS deep!"
"__MOVIES__ I had a crush on his first wife, Anna Karina."
"__MOVIES__ She had something -- very cute -- not flashy Hollywood style."
