"__MOVIES__ Would you be willing to watch a movie with me?"
"__MOVIES__ What movie do you have in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I've been thinking about watching Raging Bull again."
"__MOVIES__ Never heard of it, what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It outlines the life of boxing great Jake Lamotta"
"__MOVIES__ So like Rocky in real life?"
"__MOVIES__ It's funny that you mention Rocky as both films won best picture and are often compared, would say this is more gritty. Lamotta didn't have the easiest of lives."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm interesting will need to look it up, but would likely be interested,  who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ The great Martin Scorsese"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow then I have little doubt it will be good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's great and the acting is superb."
"__MOVIES__ Who stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Robert De niro has the main role and is great as always, Joe Pesci is remarkable as well."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a great cast, look forward to it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah some of the better actors of our generation and a world class director."
"__MOVIES__ Where would you rank it among Martin's films?"
"__MOVIES__ It's actually my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Wow and that's saying something."
"__MOVIES__ He typically always delivers,  but the direction of this is on a whole other level, I am of course a boxing fan, so perhaps biased."
"__MOVIES__ You do love your boxing! Get back to me soon and we can make this work."
