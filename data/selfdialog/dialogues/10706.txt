"__FASHION__ Have you heard about the 8 Most Wearable Spring 2017 Fashion Trends?"
"__FASHION__ No. You know I don't let my style be guided by stuff like that."
"__FASHION__ I know but one can plan their style for the season with those trends."
"__FASHION__ How?"
"__FASHION__ For instance, the slogan tees."
"__FASHION__ What about them?"
"__FASHION__ We can be political, feminists or be our own heroes with those tees while looking like we are on trend."
"__FASHION__ Oh, please. I don't need fashion gurus to tell me I need to wear a t-shirt with a slogan on it to be cool."
"__FASHION__ I hear you and yes you are right. But with those tees you can spread your message without saying a word at all."
"__FASHION__ I already do that. Look at the shirt I am wearing now."
"__FASHION__ Cool slogan 'I am the boss of me.' Why did you wear that today?"
"__FASHION__ My crazy boss seems to think he owns me just because I work for him."
"__FASHION__ Wait. You wore that shirt to your job?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, I did. He got the message and I was fired."
"__FASHION__ Awwh. I'm sorry to hear that but now we can see what is on trend for interview attire."
"__FASHION__ You never stop do you?"
"__FASHION__ No. Now pink is in this year and it is an empowering color."
"__FASHION__ I thought they said red was empowering."
"__FASHION__ Pink is too."
"__FASHION__ Next thing you know they will be saying lemonade yellow is the empowering color of the year."
