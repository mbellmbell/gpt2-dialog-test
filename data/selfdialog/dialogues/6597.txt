"__STAR_WARS__ I just rewatched Rogue One last night. It's still holding up on the small screen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, I thought Rogue One was a bit boring and had pacing issues."
"__STAR_WARS__ Boring? Pacing issues? Did we watch the same movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Look, it takes nearly an hour for Rogue One to establish the characters and the battle was over too fast."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's what I love about Rogue One! It takes its time to introduce the characters to the audience."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of whom I don't care about, and half of whom I still don't remember the names."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then you are not paying attention to the movie. I can name all the main characters and side characters in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well prove it then. Who is the blind dude that goes all kung-fu on the storm troopers?"
"__STAR_WARS__ His name is Chirwut-Imwe and he is a disciple of the Whills. He is played by the kungfu master/actor Donnie Yen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Amazing. I bow before your encyclopedic knowledge of all things Star Wars."
