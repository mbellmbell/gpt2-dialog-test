"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite old school Disney film?"
"__DISNEY__ The Little Mermaid. It was my favorite growing up."

"__DISNEY__ You 'loved' it? What happened?"
"__DISNEY__ I still love the music and all, but the message is sort of not my style anymore."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I'm a much bigger fan of the Disney films that show more women who are empowered and don't need a man."
"__DISNEY__ Like Mulan and Moana?"
