"__MOVIES__ Did you see the movie 'Bad Moms?'"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I heard it was pretty popular."
"__MOVIES__ It was a box office smash, it made over 100 million at the box office. So of course they have a sequel coming out."
"__MOVIES__ Did you go see it?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched it on cable on OnDemand. I might go see this one at the theatre, because it's coming out during a prime movie month."
"__MOVIES__ When is it coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ In November. It's called 'Bad Moms Christmas.' I always end up going to the movie theatre when I'm out doing Christmas shopping and I get tired and need to sit down for awhile."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good idea. I usually end up going to a restaurant to take a shopping break, but between all I eat at Thanksgiving and Christmas, maybe I should take a movie break instead."
"__MOVIES__ This should be pretty funny, because the moms are rebelling against all the things housewives have to do during the holidays."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes I feel like rebelling. The shopping and cooking is one thing, but having to run around all the time doing errands makes me feel like a taxi driver, especially with the kids."
"__MOVIES__ There's a trailer of the movie out, showing them drinking beer and complaining about how they are expected to make a picture perfect holiday."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh, that might get me in trouble and make me feel like rebelling."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I don't like to drink, because then I just get tired, and I'm already tired enough. But sometimes I would just like to be sitting on the couch with my feet up, not running to a department store to get new lights because the old ones don't work on the tree."
"__MOVIES__ The problem is you have so much company over for the holidays, you feel like if you don't make it look good, people will wonder why you didn't care."
"__MOVIES__ That's one of the things in the movie, when the bad moms own moms get involved in the picture."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes relatives do get overwhelming during the holidays."
"__MOVIES__ This sounds like a good movie to go see while I'm out shopping and get tired. Maybe some laughter will help me get back out into the stores and get done what I need to do."
"__MOVIES__ I might want to come to this movie with you. This year though, I'm planning on doing a lot of my shopping online to avoid the crowds."
"__MOVIES__ We can go together, and compare notes with each other and the bad moms on how we're handling the holidays."
"__MOVIES__ All right, it's a date. But no beer- I'm going to need a Pepsi to keep my energy up."
