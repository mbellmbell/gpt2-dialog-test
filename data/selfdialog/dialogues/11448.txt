"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think had the best draft in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think the San Francisco 49ers had one of the best drafts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see your point.  The trade they made with the Chicago Bears was amazing for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that trade definitely helped their overall draft.  I was surprised to see Reuben Foster fall so far in the first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, wasn't he projected as a high first round pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, all the experts during the pre-draft process projected him to be a top 10 pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know why he fell so far?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From reading various articles which speculated on his fall, it sounded like teams may have been concerned about his shoulder injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see.  Well I personally really liked the LA Chargers draft, I'm really excited to see all their rookies play next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I was a bit surprised by their pick of Mike Williams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really liked them picking up a couple of offensive linemen as well, I think that's really going to help them in the future and protect Phillip Rivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, hopefully that helps Rivers stay healthy and on his feet.  Who do you think is going to win the Superbowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to take the Patriots on that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots for sure...they somehow won the Superbowl last year AND got better players in the offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was shocking!  I could not believe the Patriots somehow got Brandin Cooks AND kept Malcolm Butler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That offense is going to be scary as long as Tom Brady remains healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so, but at some point age is going to catch up with Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How old is he now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's about 40, which is amazing.  I'm 40 and barely want to exercise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully for Patriots fans, he's got a couple more years in him."
