"__MOVIES__ Have you watched any good movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, I've been too busy. What have you seen that you think is good?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just watched 'The Big Short' last night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? Who's in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Tons of people. Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling...lots of people you'd recognize."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that sounds promising. But it is funny? Steve Carrell, he's usually a comedian, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it's definitely not a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what *is* it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about the collapse of the housing market back in 2007-2008."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds kind of boring. I barely remember that."
"__MOVIES__ I know, that's kind of the point of the movie, actually."
"__MOVIES__ What, that it's boring?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the movie's not boring, but that somehow bankers and everyone else calculate that we're so stupid we can't focus on all these technical details about mortgage stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Well, they're probably right about that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the movie keeps doing this funny thing where it brings in stars to 'explain' stuff to us as we watch the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Like, it's not part of the actual plot?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, kind of. Like the camera just cuts to Margot Robbie in a hot tub, explaining mortgage stuff while she drinks champagne."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds weird, but awesome..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I actually think you'd really like it. But it's kind of dark. The bad guys kind of win, sort of. But it's a true story!"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I will give it a try!"
