"__BASEBALL__ Hey what do you think about the Red Sox pitching situation."
"__BASEBALL__ What a mess. They need to get a couple starters and soon."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. It's too bad about Steven Wright."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. He can really eat up innings."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope David Price ends up coming back soon too."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that would be great. Hopefully he's fully healthy."
"__BASEBALL__ So who do you think they should bring in to pitch."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know. There are a lot of starters out there who are free agents."
"__BASEBALL__ I think we should take a look at Jake Peavy."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he did well for the Sox before. But he's getting old."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he is but I think he'd do fine as a number 5 starter."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I wouldn't expect too much from him but he could get the job done."
"__BASEBALL__ I also think they should look at Mat Latos."
"__BASEBALL__ What's happened to him? He can't seem to stay on one team."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. I don't know what his deal is."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he could turn it around and pitch well."
"__BASEBALL__ I do. I think he's just needs the right situation and the Red Sox could be that team."
"__BASEBALL__ It'd be interesting to see how he did in Boston."
"__BASEBALL__ I just hope they don't trade for Quintana from the White Sox."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. As much as I'd like him on the team, I don't think they should trade anymore top prospects."
