"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Jason Bourne movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have.  I thought it was different then the last one."
"__MOVIES__ I did too.  It was more introspective and thought provoking, though there was a lot of violence, too."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a good balance between an adventure/thriller and drama."
"__MOVIES__ The premise was very chilling.  That people who work for the government would allow themselves to have their identities stripped."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and it was fascinating that Jason wanted to find the truth of how he had gotten to be a killer.  How to salvage what was left of his life."
"__MOVIES__ I was surprised at the zigzag path that Jason took, around the world and back, to find out who he was."
"__MOVIES__ And how determined he was to find the truth."
"__MOVIES__ But, if you remember, he had no way back.  The government was trying to kill him because he knew too much."
"__MOVIES__ But with his talents he could have chosen to change his identity and start a new life.  Without all the drama."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but the premise was that he need to know to go on living."
"__MOVIES__ True, but so many people died in his quest."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was part of his mental agony.  He wanted to stop the program from doing what was done to him to others."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, when he could have shot the asset sent to kill him, he didn't.  That made the asset think and decide not to shoot him."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the ending was so appropriate.  A very satisfying movie."
"__MOVIES__ If there were more movies with that amount of emotional investment into why the violence in the movie was taking place it would make for better movies."
"__MOVIES__ Violence as a whole has become so commonplace, that it no longer holds my attention unless there is more to the violence."
"__MOVIES__ I think that is very true.  Violence and the reason behind it is more complex then just shooting people dead."
"__MOVIES__ I think you are right.  Do you think there will be another sequel."
"__MOVIES__ I don't see how there could be.  Jason Bourne is now the person he was before.  With no desire to be Jason Bourne again."
