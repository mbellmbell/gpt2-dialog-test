"__MOVIES__ What is a key grip, anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ A grip is a person who holds up scenery and stuff like that. The key grip is the head one."
"__MOVIES__ Who holds up the actors' heads?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's exactly right."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so what's a gaffer? A really, really old grip?"
"__MOVIES__ They handle the lighting. There's some... historical reason for the term, that I forget."
"__MOVIES__ Is that where we get gaffer tape?"
"__MOVIES__ Presumably, yes, as it covers all the stuff they do. They do all kinds of electrical stuff, but the focus is on lighting."
"__MOVIES__ I get what a runner is. Uh, Foley?"
"__MOVIES__ A sound engineer who creates all of the 'body sounds' you hear -- like clothes rustling, footsteps, bumping into stuff. Named after a prominent one -- Bob, I think?"
"__MOVIES__ So they don't do, like, laser blasts or explosions? Just people bumping into each other?"
"__MOVIES__ More or less. People make a ton of subtle noises, and it seems weird when we don't hear them."
"__MOVIES__ What if a character were to, like, throw something?"
"__MOVIES__ That might count. Probably. I mean, it's not going to be that clear cut all the time. Depends on context."
"__MOVIES__ So there wouldn't be a labor issue? Like, the lead sound engineer complains because the foley guy is doing his job for him?"
"__MOVIES__ No, probably not -- but, you know, it's hard to generalize. It depends on what's happening."
"__MOVIES__ I know that sometimes people flip out if another crew member, like, moves a cup when they're not supposed to."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds ridiculous, but it's kind of like civil litigation -- you need to protect your space or else other people will take it over and claim precedent for when you failed to stop someone before."
"__MOVIES__ So you don't want a squatter doing grip work."
"__MOVIES__ No, the squatters do something totally different."
