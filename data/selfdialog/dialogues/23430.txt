"__DISNEY__ My favorite Disney Pixar movie by far has to be the Toy Story series."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, these movies always seem to make me cry."
"__DISNEY__ I cried during the end of Toy Story 3, Andy is all grown up."
"__DISNEY__ When Andy gave Woody to the girl it was like a full circle experience."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think Andy will get the toys back for his own kids?"
"__DISNEY__ It would be nice to see Andy get married and have the toys be in his kids lives."
"__DISNEY__ Disney might be making that the next movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes but what if Andy has a daugher?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Andy's daughter would also play with the toys."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe Woody and Bo-Peep would have a renunion."
