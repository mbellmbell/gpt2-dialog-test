"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, so I can probably guess, but what is your least favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely the Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ Because of Jar Jar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he's awful, but I thought the whole movie was a let-down after waiting so long?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's kinda dull, with the race and little Anakin is annoying. The only good thing is the Darth Maul fight."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to agree-- I thought it was creepy there was a budding romance between Amidala and Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that kid was like 8, and she had to be at least 16 or so."
"__STAR_WARS__ All of the prequels under-delivered in my opinion."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the series didn't really get good again until they took control from George Lucas."
