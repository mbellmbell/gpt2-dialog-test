"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about this year's NFL Draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't watch a lot of it. It takes way too long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean the picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the first pick wasn't surprising. I expected Myles Garrett to go first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From what I read, I think he did too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you are right. The most surprising to me was that Mitchell Trubisky ended up going second."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That seems like a big risk for the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. But clearly they saw something in him!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Jabrill Peppers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally, I recognize he is an amazing athlete, but I think he's overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? He can play all sides of the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which may be great in college, but will that work for the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. I guess the Browns will find out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns need all the help they can get!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've been so bad the last few years. How many picks did they have this year in the first round?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they ended up with three first round picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their quarterback situation is still such an unknown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is the truth! They have Osweiler who himself is a big question mark."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know and I don't know that their backups will offer much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't even think they know who their backups are yet. They haven't picked a starter."
