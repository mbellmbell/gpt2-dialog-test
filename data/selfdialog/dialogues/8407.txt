"__BEATLES__ I was just reading this interesting article about underrated drummers in rock music."
"__BEATLES__ Did it mention Ringo Starr?"
"__BEATLES__ It did! I have always thought he was a great drummer."
"__BEATLES__ He definitely was, though I think a lot of people forget that."
"__BEATLES__ Did you know that sometimes, he had to play in small cramped studios with very limited drum kits?"
"__BEATLES__ I did not know that! That makes his playing all the more impressive to me."
"__BEATLES__ He was a good vocalist, too."
"__BEATLES__ Really? I'm not sure I know any songs that he sings."
"__BEATLES__ Well, he provided contributed to group vocals on several of the songs. He was the main vocalist on 'A Little Help from my Friends'."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's right! I love that song."
