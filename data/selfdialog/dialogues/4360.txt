"__MUSIC__ I'm so sick of radio these days."
"__MUSIC__ Which songs?"
"__MUSIC__ All of them I'm afraid.  I can't find a decent rock song anymore."
"__MUSIC__ It's a genre which just doesn't get the airplay."
"__MUSIC__ It seems like all the rock artists are just being poppy now."
"__MUSIC__ They have to actually get some radio play."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but it's irritating."
"__MUSIC__ I want to hear actual guitars, not drum machines."
"__MUSIC__ Drum machines aren't that bad, it's the auto-tune garbage."
"__MUSIC__ Which artists are doing that a lot lately?"
"__MUSIC__ For rock?  Well, it seems like I've heard that from Kings of Leon."
"__MUSIC__ I think they're doing that to make their voice clearer, not necessarily auto-tune."
"__MUSIC__ I know some country artists are pulling the same crap too."
"__MUSIC__ The best auto-tune shall always be T-Pain."
"__MUSIC__ Man, he was such garbage."
"__MUSIC__ But people bought it up anyway!"
"__MUSIC__ Because people are sheep and will listen to nearly everything."
"__MUSIC__ Well, everything but rock apparently these days."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's a sad world we live in."
"__MUSIC__ Get used to it, buddy!"
