"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen The Reef?"
"__THRILLER__ Is that a shark thriller movie?"
"__THRILLER__ Yea, a group of people on a boat crash, and they get hunted by a giant shark."
"__THRILLER__ Yea I think I did see that actually. It was pretty corny."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, but I love shark movies, even when they are corny!"
"__THRILLER__ Yea, I admit I watched the whole movie."
"__THRILLER__ They basically just took turns swimming to a reef and getting killed."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, I wish I could be a shark movie writer."
"__THRILLER__ It's not about the story, it's about putting yourself in their place and getting scared."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, definitely. That's why I watch shark movies too."
