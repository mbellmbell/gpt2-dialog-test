"__MUSIC__ Drawing a blank..."
"__MUSIC__ For crying out loud! Sublime?!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, sorry. I forgot I had it. The self title?"
"__MUSIC__ No. 40 oz."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah. Fraid I can't let you have it."
"__MUSIC__ What?!"
"__MUSIC__ It's my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Stop messing with me."
"__MUSIC__ OK, OK. Just kidding. It is good though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's why I want it back."
"__MUSIC__ Wish Bradly was still around."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have a new front man, but it's not the same."
