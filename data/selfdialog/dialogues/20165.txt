"__MOVIES__ I was having dinner at a friend's a couple nights ago, and another couple that was visiting had a hilarious argument."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they don't have internet right now, so they've just been watching the same movies over and over."
"__MOVIES__ The ones they have DVDs of or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. And my friend offered to lend them a movie or two."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds normal."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the guy is apparently really into chick flicks. They had watched 'The Notebook' the night before and he loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay."
"__MOVIES__ So they get all the movies out, and look over them, and the decision comes down to The Last Unicorn and Steel Magnolias."
"__MOVIES__ Both of those are such out there choices that I'm not really sure how to respond."
"__MOVIES__ The girlfriend wants to watch The Last Unicorn, and the boyfriend is really pitching Steel Magnolias."
"__MOVIES__ Of the two, I'd go The Last Unicorn."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I loved that movie as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ So what did they decide?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they couldn't come to a decision between the two of them."
"__MOVIES__ So did you all vote?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually no. We flipped a coin."
"__MOVIES__ So what won?"
"__MOVIES__ The went home and watched The Last Unicorn."
"__MOVIES__ They made the right choice after all!"
