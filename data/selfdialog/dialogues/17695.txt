"__MOVIES__ I was able to watch the new Aliens. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not yet. From 1 to 10 what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I would give it a 7 out of 10."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. Why so low?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a little slow in the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ Oh darn, Was it as scary as the original one?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think it was as scary because they are not on the ship as much as the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah the ship was the main part of the original and what made it so so scary."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! I thought the actors were all good though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay cool. I heard it was a long movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, it was over two hours and I kept waiting for the characters to develop more."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, like when you start feeling a connection to a character or feel like your getting to know them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so it lacked depth of characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that is a good way to describe it."
"__MOVIES__ I was going to take my son who is 14 years old, do you feel like that is too young?"
"__MOVIES__ It kind of depends. I seen a father and son there and hid kid was about 15 or 16 yrs old."
"__MOVIES__ i know what you mean because every kid is different and parenting style too."
"__MOVIES__ Overall I would recommend seeing it but not necessarily in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ I might just wait til it come out on DVD! Thanks!"
