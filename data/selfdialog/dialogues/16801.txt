"__MOVIES__ Supervillians, how do they hope to keep them under control?"
"__MOVIES__ The candiates are implated with a nanoscale explosive device in their necks powerful enough to destroy their heads."
"__MOVIES__ Yikes! and ouch!, who'd they pick for the Squad."

"__MOVIES__ Okay, who else is in the squad."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Joker's girlfriend Harley Quinn is one, as well as Waylon Jones, aka Killer Croc."
"__MOVIES__ Killer Croc, isn't that the guy that is half crocodile and lives in the sewers of Gotham City?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but Batman drove him out and he was caught by the government."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, anybody else interesting in the group?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Chato Santana, aka El Diablo, a one-time LA gang member who was pyrokinetic abilites, which means he can generate and control fire."
