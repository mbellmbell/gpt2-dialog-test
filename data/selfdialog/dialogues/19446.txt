"__MOVIES__ OK. Do you love Pokemon: The First Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. I watched it growing up."
"__MOVIES__ Who was it directed by?"
"__MOVIES__ I think... I don't know actually. That's a good question."
"__MOVIES__ The promotional website was www.pokemonthemovie.com"
"__MOVIES__ Is that so? I don't remember seeing it."
"__MOVIES__ Is the site still active?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea. I'll look it up."
"__MOVIES__ Is it active?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, it's still loading. It would be crazy if it was."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't look it is. It still hasn't loaded yet."
"__MOVIES__ When was it released?"
"__MOVIES__ It was on VHS by 2000. I have a huge collection of VHS cassettes."
"__MOVIES__ I don't. I like online videos and movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know, the quality is probably better."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and the sound quality too."
"__MOVIES__ And the site won't respond, so it's probably dead."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame. I wonder what it looked like."
"__MOVIES__ Like any other movie site I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Just promotional I'd assume too."
