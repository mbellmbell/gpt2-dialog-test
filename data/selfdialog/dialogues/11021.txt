"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Here's a story of a man named Brady....."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh come on, why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because Miami does not have to play them in regular season until December."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but whay the lack of love for Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just burnt out over the New England Dynasty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why burned out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because it seem like no other QB can put a patch on him and all for different bad reasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So Tom Brady can't be 'Just that good'?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Cam Newton needs to knock him off his pedistal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No one other than Cam has a shot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about RG III?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he's more hype than hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, i know..... Aaron Rodgers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Please, stop. Another hype artist."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Brees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now there is a possibility. But that would mean the saints would dominate the division and that would be bad for Tampa."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if it means the demise of the Brady career......"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear ya.... i'm on the fence with that one."
