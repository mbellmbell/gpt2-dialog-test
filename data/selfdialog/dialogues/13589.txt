"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your least favorite thing about the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My least favorite thing would probably be the injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the injures always make me feel bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! Like these men are just trying to do their jobs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a lot of them are really young too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. Like Teddy Bridgewater."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, his injury was really nasty. I felt so terrible for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard he could potentially miss the 2017 season because of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That honestly makes me so sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, me too. I hope he comes back soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he comes back soon too, but only if he's ready."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't want him to feel pressured to make a return and get hurt worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially because he's so young too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think he's only 24."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't want him to be the next Austin Collie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't say that, that guy had so many concussions it was ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really was. I don't want Teddy to be like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't want anyone to be like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Concussions are terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm glad we both agree on that."
