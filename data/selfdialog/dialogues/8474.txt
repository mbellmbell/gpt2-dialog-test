"__BEATLES__ What Beatles song do you think is the most overrated?"
"__BEATLES__ Hmm. Let me look at their compilation 1, which is made up of all their number one hits."
"__BEATLES__ That's a good idea. The songs are clearly held in high esteem by the public if they were number one hits."
"__BEATLES__ Exactly, these songs shot to the top of the charts."
"__BEATLES__ I'm looking now and 'Love is All You Need' is probably the song I find most overrated."
"__BEATLES__ Why's that?"
"__BEATLES__ I know the end gets experimental, but to me it's a little too repetitive and a little too lovey dovey."
"__BEATLES__ Well, I'm still looking at this list. I disagree about 'Love is All You Need.'"
"__BEATLES__ Well, what will it be then?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm going to go with 'Eight Days a Week.' I love their early stuff, but this track just doesn't connect with me."
