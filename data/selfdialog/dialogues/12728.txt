"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which NFL team do you think is going to turn it around this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Baltimore Ravens had a bad season, so they're going to make it back to the playoffs this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too bad Steve Smith won't be with them this time around"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He retired at a good point in his career, and I agree that he deserves to have gotten a Superbowl ring"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of great players go without rings, like Larry Fitzgerald if the Cardinals don't win in the next season or two"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did pretty well a couple of seasons back, so what happened last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks ruined their chances at the post season, only to lose to the Falcons in the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Cardinals lost to the Panthers the season before, didn't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, there's something about NFC West teams losing to eventual Superbowl teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But how awful was the Superbowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was terrible, probably the worst Superbowl I've seen, if not the worst game overall"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would have been amazing if the Falcons had just stuck it through until the end"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not even a Falcons fan and I'm still reeling from that game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why I try not to get too invested in teams I don't follow regularly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What other teams do you think will turn it around?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns picked up a lot of great players, so I think they're going to be set for the next few years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm always rooting for the Browns to turn it around, but I don't know if getting Myles Garrett will be enough right now"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not, but they've built up a ton of draft picks for the next few years, so we could be looking at a resurgence"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How great would it be to finally see the Browns in the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure beats seeing the same two or three teams winning the AFC championship every year"
