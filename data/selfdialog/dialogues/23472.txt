"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see Brave?"
"__DISNEY__ That's the one with the red-headed princess, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Merida.  That's the one."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I did.  I liked it."
"__DISNEY__ I did too.  I really liked that Merida was strong and independent."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she was really independent.  She was also stubborn and that got her into a bit of trouble."
"__DISNEY__ True.  She shouldn't have gone to the witch to get help with her mother.  She should have just kept trying to make her mother see her point of view."
"__DISNEY__ But she tried to get her mother to understand and she just wouldn't.  She had no choice but to go to the witch."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know.  At least she figured out how to fixed the curse and turn her mother back into a human."
"__DISNEY__ And don't forget her brothers because they'd turned into bears too."
