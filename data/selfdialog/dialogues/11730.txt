"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! Football season is coming up!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm stoked. Preseason starts in August, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the rookies?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really know. We'll have to wait and see if there's another Dak Prescott this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of which, do you think the Cowboys will be as good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, I think they'll be better than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah? Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've still got the best O-Line in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their offense will probably only get better with more chemistry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Defense is still an issue for them though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think they meant to address that in free agency and the draft this year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's crazy that Dak and Zeke were in MVP talks as rookies though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously. Dallas really lucked out in drafting both of those guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Tony Romo will be a good broadcaster though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably. Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a charismatic guy, and he's gotta be used to being in front of a camera by now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Makes sense. I'll be sure to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Looking like a good season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure."
