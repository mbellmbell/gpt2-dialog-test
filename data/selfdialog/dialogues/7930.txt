"__POP__ Do you like Katy Perry?"
"__POP__ I like most of her music, but especially her song 'Dark Horse'."
"__POP__ Thats a great song. What do you think about her feud with Taylor Swift?"
"__POP__ I can't believe it has gotten so out of hand. Its really time to squash it already."
"__POP__ You know when Taylor Swift came out with 'Bad Blood' I knew it was going to be an ongoing feud for a good while."
"__POP__ 'Bad Blood' was so obviously about Katy, but Katy has had a bit more couth with her retaliation."
"__POP__ I wish they would go back to being good friends, put this stupidity behind them, and move forward as an unstoppable girl power house."
"__POP__ A Katy Perry and Taylor Swift collab would be a great way to put it all to rest. It had been hinted at, but has never come to fruition."
"__POP__ Hopefully this year we will see the feud end and with that get an amazing pop song from two of the hottest female pop stars of this decade."
"__POP__ I agree. Fans are ready, the world is ready, its time for the ultimate pop collab!"
