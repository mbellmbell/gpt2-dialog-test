"__MUSIC__ What do you know about the new Imagine Dragons album?"
"__MUSIC__ I know I like it!  It sounds great, while still sounding like them."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked the first single from the new album!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  I was confused at first, thinking it was a song from their last album."
"__MUSIC__ I thought that too!"
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen the video they did with Dolph Lundgren?"
"__MUSIC__ I have!  It was really neat."
"__MUSIC__ I thought so!  It was neat seeing him in a music video."
"__MUSIC__ Where do you think they got their name?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  I never thought about it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they will ever put out any ballads?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't be surprised if they did.  They are talented, and could pull it off."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked the songs that they did for the Transformers movie."
"__MUSIC__ The last one?  Or did they do one for the current movie?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember if they did one for the current movie, but I was thinking of the last movie."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was a great song! I listened to it a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!  I really wished they had brought Linkin Park back, though."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but I still thought that it went well with the overall soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ I can't wait to listen to the new album again."
"__MUSIC__ Me either.  Imagine Dragons is one of my favorites!"
