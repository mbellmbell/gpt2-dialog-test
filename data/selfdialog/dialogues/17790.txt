"__MOVIES__ I just saw a trailer to an interesting movie."
"__MOVIES__ Which was?"
"__MOVIES__ Annabelle 2: Creation Official Trailer ."
"__MOVIES__ What's Annabelle?"
"__MOVIES__ A haunted doll."
"__MOVIES__ Is it supposed to be a horror?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Annabelle 2 tells the tale of a doll maker and his wife who, several years after the tragic death of their child."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess, they make a doll and call it their daughter?"
"__MOVIES__ No silly. They welcome a nun and several girls from a shuttered orphanage into their home."
"__MOVIES__ Then what?"
"__MOVIES__ They become the target of the dollmaker's possessed creation, Annabelle."
"__MOVIES__ How can you be scared of a doll? It is just a doll, hit it."
"__MOVIES__ I hear you."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait till the day they make a movie that will genuinely have you scared and not for two seconds like all these jump scares nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much every single supernatural movie does that to me.  The Ring, The Grudge, Insidious, The Conjuring, Grave Encounters, etc...all of them."
"__MOVIES__ Not hating on the movie but I don't understand why the doll is haunted."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not entirely sure. It is my understanding that the girl did want her soul moved into the doll."
"__MOVIES__ So if she move into a doll, why is she acting all scary and creepy?"
"__MOVIES__ Good point now you got me thinking."
"__MOVIES__ Could it be demon and not the little girl?"
