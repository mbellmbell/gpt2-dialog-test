"__MOVIES__ What was the scariest movie you watched as a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ My parents really never let me watch a lot of scary movies."
"__MOVIES__ None at all?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I was terrified of Jaws."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Jaws was scary."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, we went to the beach a lot and I hated to go in the water."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it probably traumatized you."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe a little.  Eventually, I started to go into the water."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch it again as an adult?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wasn't as scared."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it more?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I started to realize what a good movie it was.  It was scary, but not enough to make me cry."
"__MOVIES__ You weren't scared going to the beach anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Not really.  I mean, they put up warnings when there are sharks around."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and there are shark attacks but not as often as there was on the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, something like that would make headlines."
"__MOVIES__ Definately."
"__MOVIES__ Now, they make headlines, but usually the victim survives."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's true."
"__MOVIES__ There's really nothing to be scared of."
