"__THRILLER__ What's your favorite Thriller movie of all time?"
"__THRILLER__ That is a very tough question.  I would have to go with Jaws."
"__THRILLER__ That is a good choice.  I hadn't thought of that one."
"__THRILLER__ What about you?"
"__THRILLER__ I would say Sixth Sense. The twist at the end just shocked me."
"__THRILLER__ I wasn't a fan.  I saw it coming."
"__THRILLER__ Really?  I had no idea."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it was kind of obvious to me.  But it is still a decent movie."
"__THRILLER__ Decent?  Best thriller ever!"
"__THRILLER__ If you say so.  Agree to disagree."
