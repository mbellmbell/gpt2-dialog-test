"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Detroit Lions next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I watched them a bit, but think they have a lot of issues."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?    What is the biggest problem you see?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the rushing game was terrible last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but Theo Reddick seems to be healthy this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but both he and Ameer Abdullah need to be healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matthew Stafford is good, but he does too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can a good quarterback do too much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A good offense should be balanced, and nearly 600 passes is just too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't that a factor of the offensive line?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, and unless Rick Wagner has a great season, that too is questionable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fine.      What about the kicking game then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it starts with Matt Prater."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I'm talking about!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is definitely a great kicker, although not necessarily the best in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the punting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Sam Martin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't he even get some team records last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he did a tremendous job in the first game in the Colts."
