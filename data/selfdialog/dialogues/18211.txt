"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the movie Memento?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've never even heard of it!  When did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wow, it was back in the late nineties I believe.  It's been awhile."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe that's why.  I didn't watch many movies back then."
"__MOVIES__ Well this is one that you don't want to miss!  I could easily say it's my favorite movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Guy Ritchie and some other people I can't remember.  Nobody ridiculously famous."
"__MOVIES__ What's so great about it?"
"__MOVIES__ The plot!  It's totally unlike anything you've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ That's hard to believe - everything's been played out and done and redone nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ Not this one!  You can watch it over and over and you catch something new every time."
"__MOVIES__ What type of movie is it even?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a mystery.  But it's told in reverse order, like it starts at the end and works backwards towards the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ Weird, how does that work?"
"__MOVIES__ You'd have to watch it to see.  The main character has some sort of amnesia condition and he can't remember things well."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds strange."
"__MOVIES__ It is strange, but it's strange in a good way.  You are put into the same confused state he is in throughout the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm intrigued!"
"__MOVIES__ You should watch it!  He's trying to figure out who killed his wife.  The ending is really perplexing."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I will get it tonight and check it out.  It better be good!"
