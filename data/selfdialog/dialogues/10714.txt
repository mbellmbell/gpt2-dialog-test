"__FASHION__ I don't like the way younger people dress these days?"
"__FASHION__ Why do you say that?"
"__FASHION__ I think they are immodest and show too much skin."
"__FASHION__ Do you really think they're that different than the previous generation?"
"__FASHION__ They probably are only slightly more immodest in the way they dress than the previous generation,"
"__FASHION__ I think the previous generation showed just as much skin. Our culture is constantly pushing us to dress sexy."
"__FASHION__ That's true. Teens are taught to glamorize the way celebrities dress without realizing that the average person dressing that way could be harassed or get into trouble."
"__FASHION__ I don't think all current fashion is bad. I really like the uneven hemline trend in tops, dresses and skirts."
"__FASHION__ I do too. And I think the cold shoulder trend is cute without being overly sexy or exposing too much skin."
"__FASHION__ I never thought skinny jeans would come back into style! They're unflattering and uncomfortable for most people."
"__FASHION__ A different trand that I dislike is the trend of wearing sweats, scrubs, yoga pant, leggings or even pajamas constantly. A lot of people don't take any effort to make themselves look nice."
"__FASHION__ I sort of agree. We should take pride in our appearance, but overall we need to focus less on appearance and more on the content of the character of the person."
"__FASHION__ You know what trend I think is funny? In ads for men's clothes, they're starting to make the men pose in more and more ridiculous ways, the way they do women."
"__FASHION__ It is funny to see a guy advertising a suit, standing in the rain with an unopened umbrella, or laying on the floor in a warehouse."
"__FASHION__ But the same pressure women have felt to be as thin as fashion models is also starting to effect men, they think they're supposed to look like fashion models."
"__FASHION__ People don't understand that fashion advertisements use a lot of tricks: camera angles, photoshop, lighting, makeup, all just to get the perfect shot."
"__FASHION__ It's unfair that now they photoshop almost every fashion model's picture or celebrities' pictures. They take attractive people and impose impossible standards on them like tiny waists."
"__FASHION__ I'd like to see a more healthy look in fashion advertising. It would be nice to see models that aren't so impossibly perfect and unrelateable."
"__FASHION__ I know, I really like the trend of using plus sized models."
"__FASHION__ EVen though plus sized is really just the size of the average American woman! It should be called real sized."
