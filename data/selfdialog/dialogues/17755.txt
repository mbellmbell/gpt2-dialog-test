"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good documentaries lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen a few, actually, and there's a couple that are available on Netflix now that I'd like to see."
"__MOVIES__ What have you seen recently that you liked?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just watched a new true crime documentary on HBO that was very interesting."
"__MOVIES__ What was it called? What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It was called Mommy Dead and Dearest. It was about a girl whose boyfriend killed her mother and she was part of the plan to do it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! I think I heard about that on a podcast I listen to. That movie sounds really intense."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty intense. It was interesting though, too. It made me feel bad for some of the girl's family, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I bet! That's the documentary about the girl whose mother had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was. That's what made the film even crazier, actually - just learning about how her mom had gotten away with everything she did."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. That's really sad but the documentary actually sounds really fascinating."
"__MOVIES__ It was. Obviously it wasn't a lighthearted movie to watch, but my girlfriend and I watched it and we were both totally absorbed."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm definitely going to watch it now."
"__MOVIES__ You definitely should! Especially if you like true crime stuff."
"__MOVIES__ I do. I'm always watching those types of documentaries."
"__MOVIES__ Also, watching anything about someone with Munchausen by proxy always makes me think of that M. Night Shyamalan movie. Haha."
"__MOVIES__ The Sixth Sense? That's funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! because of that little girl ghost that's in the movie who shows Haley Joel Osment's character that her mom did that to her!"
"__MOVIES__ I totally get why you would think of that movie. I remember that part! Wow, it's crazy that something that happens in a movie like The Sixth Sense could happen in real life."
"__MOVIES__ I know. It is totally scary, to be honest!"
