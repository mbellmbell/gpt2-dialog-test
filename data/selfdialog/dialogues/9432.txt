"__BASEBALL__ What a season the Giants are having!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, unbelievable, and not in a good way."
"__BASEBALL__ After they got Melancon, it seemed like their troubles were over."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, spring was full of promise..."
"__BASEBALL__ Until they hit the windshield like a bloated horsefly at 80 MPH."
"__BASEBALL__ Then the Bumgarner thing!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, what was he doing, somersaults on a dirt bike?"
"__BASEBALL__ Dunno, but his contract's up this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Not a good for him heading into negotiations for a big payday."
"__BASEBALL__ He's been so cool about it though, never complained."
"__BASEBALL__ He'll still do pretty well."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but not as well as he would've. Really bad timing."
"__BASEBALL__ You know when he's coming back?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was supposed to be after the All-Star break, but now the Giants are talking August!"
"__BASEBALL__ Figure if they lose 10 games they might've won with him pitching, there goes the playoffs."
"__BASEBALL__ It's going to be tough..."
"__BASEBALL__ But lately they've shown signs of life."
"__BASEBALL__ Reverting to the mean, to some extent."
"__BASEBALL__ They couldn't keep losing the way they have."
"__BASEBALL__ It's good to Melancon earning his money, too!"
