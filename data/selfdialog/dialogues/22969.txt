"__DISNEY__ We should go see a movie today."
"__DISNEY__ That's a great idea. Are there any Disney movies playing?"
"__DISNEY__ Why Disney?"
"__DISNEY__ I've just been in the mood for one."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm, well, it doesn't look like it right now."
"__DISNEY__ Could we just rent one then?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure! What would you like to rent."
"__DISNEY__ Either Aladdin or The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Let's do Aladdin then!"
"__DISNEY__ Okay!"
