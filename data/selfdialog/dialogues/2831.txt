"__MUSIC__ Alright, let's switch gears and talk about covers you HATE."
"__MUSIC__ oh, boy this will be fun!  So many, don't know where to start..."
"__MUSIC__ Just take your time, they'll come to you."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, well, one of the WORSE has got to be MCR's 'Under Pressure'"
"__MUSIC__ MCR?"
"__MUSIC__ My Chemical Romance"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, god, they did a cover of that?  NO ONE should do that song but Queen and Bowie"
"__MUSIC__ I know, and the sucky part is, it's not too bad for the first thirty seconds or so, but it just get progressively worse as they go along."
"__MUSIC__ My brain hurts just thinking about it."
"__MUSIC__ Again, I'm biased, I've never really liked any of MCR's stuff, but.. you know."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, what's another one?"
"__MUSIC__ Alright, get ready for this... 'You Shook Me All Night Long' by... Celine Dion."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, dear God, no!!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  one of the most rocking, hardcore songs sung by someone who LEAST personifies rock and hardcore."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, good, I'm nauseous just thinking about it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard they use that song to torture prisoners at Gitmo..."
"__MUSIC__ HAHAHAH! That's horrible!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, but hey, I wouldn't doubt it.  I read somewhere they use Red Hot Chilli Peppers?"
"__MUSIC__ What they make them eat them?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I mean, the band.  The literally play RHCP songs over and over to drink them nuts."
