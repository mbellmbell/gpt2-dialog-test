"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish each state had an NFL team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because it's not fair that some states have multiple teams, while some have zero teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think it matters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would you feel sad if your state didn't have at least one NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well,, yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, I'm sure there are plenty of people in plenty of states who wish they had one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it would be cool to have more teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More teams, more players, more games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The playoffs would be so ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm glad your're beginning to see things my way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think this would be possible?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ sure, first we take states that have multiple teams and we give them to a different state."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then we just make a few football teams each year until we have 50."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this could all get pretty messy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just because it could potentially be messy doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, it just seems like it would be a lot of work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we should just be happy our states have NFL teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now you're talking."
