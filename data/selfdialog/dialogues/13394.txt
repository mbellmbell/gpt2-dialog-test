"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the quarterback option is an outdated move in today's NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think the defenses in the league have learned how to defend against."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I kind of disagree. I think it still have its merits."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that quarterbacks with good pocket presence will still be able to use the move to stall defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So only good quarterbacks can use it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think quarterbacks who can stay in the pocket longer can benefit from it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about running quarterbacks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they'll be able to manage it. Like you said, defenses are just too fast these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I think quarterbacks who use it to run themselves are going to get buried."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But like I said, good passing quarterbacks can use it to stall defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which quarterbacks do you think can use it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, etc. those kinds of quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's so odd how that move became so outdated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think defenses were just so new to it that they didn't know how to respond."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why the NFL is the top of the class when it comes to studying film."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope more elite quarterbacks use it though. It's entertaining."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely think that a good offensive line helps as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely."
