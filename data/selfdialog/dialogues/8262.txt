"__POP__ I heard a funny story about Justin Bieber."
"__POP__ That wouldn't be surprising, there's probably LOTS of those!"
"__POP__ He was singing at a festival a couple weeks ago and someone asked him to sing the Spanish song he collaborated on, Despacito."
"__POP__ What was he doing, lip synching?"
"__POP__ No, he couldn't even do that. He refused to sing it, and admitted to the crowd he didn't even know the lyrics."
"__POP__ That would be funny!"
"__POP__ One of the fans apparently didn't think so- they threw a water bottle and almost hit him in the head."
"__POP__ Did he get mad and storm off the stage?"
"__POP__ No, he was actually calm and asked them not to throw things at him."
"__POP__ I kind of feel for him, because I took Spanish in school, and I couldn't learn much except a few words."
