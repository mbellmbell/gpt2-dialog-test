"__BASEBALL__ Boy I really disappointed in the Toronto Bluejays!"
"__BASEBALL__ You know, I think I'm going to just give up on that team"
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. Every year I think that this is the season where they put it all together and I'm always wrong!"
"__BASEBALL__ It's like watching Charlie Brown trying to kick the football when Lucy is holding it!"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly! I can't keep falling for this team time and time again."
"__BASEBALL__ It's like they have so many problems. Sometimes they hit well, but their pitching is atrocious. They pitch well, but can't hit!"
"__BASEBALL__ This team is so lost! I think they need to blow this squad up and start over"
"__BASEBALL__ The culture in this organization is so bad right now. It's time for a change."
"__BASEBALL__ It may be necessary to get rid of the GM and the manager. Just to shake things up!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it's time. This organization needs a makeover."
"__BASEBALL__ Starting with Jose Batista. Ever since he had that big Home run year, he's been declining."
"__BASEBALL__ If he's not hitting a home run, he is worthless!"
"__BASEBALL__ This guy has no plate discipline whatsoever."
"__BASEBALL__ I swear he goes up to the plate and all he seems to care about is trying to hit a home run."
"__BASEBALL__ Then surprise! He strikes out again!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it would be a miracle if he got that batting average over 200"
"__BASEBALL__ He's definitely not Tony Gwynn at the plate!"
"__BASEBALL__ I would even take him being a serviceable hitter. He's not even a major league quality hitter right now"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but it's not all on him either. His teammates have not been stepping up as well."
"__BASEBALL__ Your're right! It feels like this hole team has been infected with a loser's mentality."
