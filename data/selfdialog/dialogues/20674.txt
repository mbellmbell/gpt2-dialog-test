"__THRILLER__ What did you think about that new M. Night Shymalan movie?"
"__THRILLER__ Which one are you referring to?"
"__THRILLER__ I think it's called Split."
"__THRILLER__ That was awful."
"__THRILLER__ Really?  I thought it was kind of creative."
"__THRILLER__ I'm so sick of him trying to do twist endings.  It's comedic really."
"__THRILLER__ This one wasn't really a twist, it was just surprising that it was actually true."
"__THRILLER__ Nah, sorry, it was garbage.  Just my opinion."
"__THRILLER__ Do you think they'll make another Unbreakable with the reveal at the end?"
"__THRILLER__ Doubtful.  That ship sailed long ago."
