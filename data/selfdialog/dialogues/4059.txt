"__MUSIC__ Remember that one artist from the 90's that was super popular?"
"__MUSIC__ You need to be more specific than that, who do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ He was an attractive African American man. I'm trying to think of a song."
"__MUSIC__ Was he older looking or young?"
"__MUSIC__ Older I think. Oh wait I think one song was called 'Back At One.'"
"__MUSIC__ I know who you're talking about! That's Brian Mcknight!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I couldn't think of the name! Thank you."
"__MUSIC__ I really loved his songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yes he was quite talented. You don't hear much about him anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder why."
"__MUSIC__ Probably because of newer artists. Maybe he doesn't want much of the spotlight anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Yes you're probably right."
"__MUSIC__ He kind of reminds me of a female singer I liked back then too. Her name was Brandy."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she have her own show also?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes she did!"
"__MUSIC__ I loved that song she did with Monica called 'The Boy Is Mine.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yes that was so popular when I was in middle school! My friends and I would sing it."
"__MUSIC__ It cracked me up."
"__MUSIC__ I miss that kind of music."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it's rare these days."
