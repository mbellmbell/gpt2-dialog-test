"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite actress?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite actress is Cameron Diaz."
"__MOVIES__ You know I used to underestimate her acting abilities, but she has been really good in the dramatic roles she's been in."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I totally agree. I love her in In Her Shoes."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. The relationship between the two sisters was great and so believable."
"__MOVIES__ It was Toni Colette that played her sister, right?"
"__MOVIES__ That's right. Have you ever seen her in Little Miss Sunshine?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I have heard a lot of great things about that movie."
"__MOVIES__ And it was for good reason. It won two Academy Awards."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. I'll have to rent it sometime."
"__MOVIES__ I'm telling you, if you like dramatic movies you will love it."
"__MOVIES__ I do really enjoy dramas. That is my favorite movie genre."
"__MOVIES__ I like dramas too, but I'd rather watch comedy most of the time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, do you plan on seeing the new Baywatch movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I want to wait to rent it or see it in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Zac Efron and Dwayne Johnson might be quite the comedy duo."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, but I've been disappointed by Zac Efron in the past."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I didn't think he was very funny in Neighbors."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. I didn't really enjoy that movie either."
