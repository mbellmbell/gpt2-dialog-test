"__MOVIES__ I saw your post that you went to go see It Comes at Night yesterday."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, me and my fiances went to see it."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard really conflicting reviews though."
"__MOVIES__ Well, both my fiance and I had different opinions, even though we like the same kinds of movies."
"__MOVIES__ What did you disagree about?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the tension and suspense, and thought it was well thought out!"
"__MOVIES__ What did he think?"
"__MOVIES__ He thought it was too much of a slow burn movie, and not enough happened to justify the run time."
"__MOVIES__ I heard it was kind of in the style of The Witch."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't read that, but I guess that would be a good description."
"__MOVIES__ So, what comes at night?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to spoil it for you....."
"__MOVIES__ No, I feel like I need to know now! It will help me make my decision whether I watch it or not!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, since you asked......"
"__MOVIES__ Tell me! Please!"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, well, nothing comes at night. It's more of a suspenseful drama than a horror movie, I don't know whether 'It' was supposed to be allegorial or....."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean nothing comes at night? How could they do that!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if that's a dealbreaker for you, DEFINITLY don't see it!"
