"__ROCK__ So I'm thinking about buying tickets to Blink 182 tomorrow."
"__ROCK__ Are they in town?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah.  Tickets haven't really been in demand though."
"__ROCK__ They're kind of a bit of date.  Doesn't seem like people like them as much."
"__ROCK__ Well, one of their singers left and it just hasn't been the same."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, the guy moved to Angels and Airwaves."
"__ROCK__ Tickets are relatively cheap though.  Want to go?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, pick me up a ticket."
"__ROCK__ Cool.  Make sure you wear your 90's clothing."
"__ROCK__ Still do!"
