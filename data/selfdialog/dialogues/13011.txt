"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you had to pick one WR in the NFL, who would you pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably Julio Jones... what do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good answer. I sometimes think Odell Beckham Jr is, but he is kinda crazy and inconsistent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, but, wow he may have the greatest catch in NFL history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure, but for top catches you gotta talk about Antonio Freeman back in 2001 in that Monday Night Football game vs the Vikings"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, and Al Michaels had that iconic Call...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ...He did what?!?!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. That's it haha. Oh man, Antonio Freeman. I really like those nostalgic mediocre players that people kinda forget about these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like James Thrash."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahah. Exactly. Or like Muhshin Mohhammed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, from the Panthers and Bears. He was a great possession WR!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was a guy that would have 100 catches and barely 1000 yards!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He reminds me of another Bears possession WR, Marty Booker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, he was on probably one of the worst 13-3 teams I can ever remember. Jim Miller was the QB!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was kinda silly. The Packers swept the Bears that year and went 12-4 themselves, but didn't even win the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the Packers had a great team that year. I think that year they ended up losing in the playoffs to the Kurt Warner led St. Louis Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh. That game depresses me. I think Favre threw 7 interceptions that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh what a surprise. Favre throwing interceptions in the playoffs. How typical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. Live by the Favre, die by the Favre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least he threw a horrible game-losing pick for the Vikings in 2009 too."
