"__SUPERHERO__ What version of Batman do you like better...the version with Christian Bale as Batman or the latest version with Ben Affleck as Batman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Definitely Christian Bale."
"__SUPERHERO__ I would agree. Not really a super fan of the new Ben Affleck Batman, though he's alright."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea. I feel like they should have just stopped after Christian Bale was done playing Batman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Those movies with him as Batman were so good. Like the best Batman movies ever."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, Christopher Nolan did such a phenomenal job on those movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ He should just direct every superhero movie ever."
"__SUPERHERO__ Haha, they would all be so good!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well we'll have to see if Ben Affleck's version of Batman gets any better with the coming movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ I hope so. It would be such a waste."
