"__DISNEY__ You know what's funny? I've never even seen Hercules."
"__DISNEY__ What? You're missing out."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I've seen basically every other Disney movie, but I somehow missed that one."
"__DISNEY__ We should totally watch it. Hercules is such a cutie."
"__DISNEY__ Is there a princess in that movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Meg! She's so sassy."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, is she the one who sings I Won't Say I'm In Love?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's her!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, right. Hercules is the one with the gospel choir."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that's my favorite part."
