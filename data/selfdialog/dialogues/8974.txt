"__BEATLES__ You know, I miss the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Who doesn't? I guess people who don't know what good music is wouldn't."
"__BEATLES__ I just miss how most of their songs were uplifting and had such meaning."
"__BEATLES__ They had a couple of strange ones too."
"__BEATLES__ Well, of course they did. But what ones are you thinking of?"
"__BEATLES__ Take your pick, I Am The Walrus, Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds, Strawberry Fields Forever."
"__BEATLES__ I still think that those songs had meaning, it just used interesting language."
"__BEATLES__ I am not saying they didn't, they are just not as obvious as some of their other songs like Let It Be or Blackbird."
"__BEATLES__ I still think they are one of the best bands of all time."
"__BEATLES__ Only a fool would debate you on that."
