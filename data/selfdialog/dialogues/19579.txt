"__MOVIES__ How about we get together and do something?"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good, what would you like to do?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I have not watched a good movie in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ I have several movies that you may want to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Great, do you have any funny ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure do, do you like Bradley Cooper?"
"__MOVIES__ I love him! He is not really a comedian though."
"__MOVIES__ No, but he was really funny in the Hangover movies."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have all of those?"
"__MOVIES__ I do! Have you watched them?"
"__MOVIES__ I have only seen the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Part two and three were even crazier than the original."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is hard to imagine!"
"__MOVIES__ I actually thought Ed Helms was great in those movies as well."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, although he does not get the credit that he deserves."
"__MOVIES__ That is true. So, are we watching the Hangover two and three?"
"__MOVIES__ I think we should! I can not wait."
"__MOVIES__ I think you will love them both if you enjoyed the original."
"__MOVIES__ I hope so; is Melissa McCarthy in one of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she has a small role in part three."
