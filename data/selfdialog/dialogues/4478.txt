"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to Oh Wonder?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them, but I'm not sure it's my type of music. How would you describe it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's an alternative pop duo of a man and a woman. Do you like harmonizing?"
"__MUSIC__ Usually! That sounds like something I would like."
"__MUSIC__ I think so too! Interestingly, they released their album song by song."
"__MUSIC__ That's strange. When are they releasing their new album?"
"__MUSIC__ They have three new songs out now. You should try it out."
"__MUSIC__ What's the name of the band again?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh Wonder! You should listen to Heavy or Ultralife. Those are new."
"__MUSIC__ What about the last album?"
"__MUSIC__ It's self titled. I liked Lifetimes. It's one of my favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ Sweet, are there any songs you don't like?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really like Heart Hope."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a little slow and cheesy for me to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ Man, that's not good. How's the rest of the album?"
"__MUSIC__ It's very upbeat and pleasant sounding with some awesome lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I really do prefer happy music. Thanks, man!"
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome. Check them out!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to listen to them on my way home after this."
