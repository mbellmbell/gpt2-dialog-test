"__MUSIC__ Did you heard that Radiohead is releasing a reissue of Ok Computer?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't know. Wow, that's really exciting!"
"__MUSIC__ I know. Its going to be called , OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017."
"__MUSIC__ Is there going to be any new tracks on it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they're putting out 3 previously unreleased tracks, along with a bunch of b-sides."
"__MUSIC__ That's really great news."
"__MUSIC__ I think so. I thought they were done after Moon Shaped Pool."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. What did you think of Moon Shaped Pool anyways?"
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't my favorite, but I liked it for what it was. A Radiohead album."
"__MUSIC__ So any new music by Radiohead is better than no music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not exactly. I think I just keep waiting for OK Computer Radiohead."
"__MUSIC__ I thought A Moon Shaped Pool was really good."
"__MUSIC__ To me, it felt more like a novelty album than anything else."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean a novelty album?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like they played a lot of games with it, deleting the website, sending out the singles, it just didn't feel like Radiohead to me."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand why you would feel that way. Do you think the 3 new tracks will be like that?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think so. Since they're previously unreleased, I'm hoping that they are from when Radiohead first got started."
"__MUSIC__ I think in any case, its great that they're releasing new tracks and touring again."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you. it feels like they're doing this for the die hard fans, so it should be really good."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure it will be, we'll just have to wait and see I guess."
