"__MOVIES__ Hey! What is your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. That is a tough one. I really like the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
"__MOVIES__ I have never heard of that. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is so good! It is about a man who decides he wants to have a procedure done to erase his memory."
"__MOVIES__ Why does he want to erase his memory?"
"__MOVIES__ Because he had a bad breakup and he is trying to move on with his life and forget it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is intense."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. But then in the middle of the procedure he changes his mind. Since he is asleep, he cannot tell them to stop the procedure so he tries to hide his memories in other memories."
"__MOVIES__ That is a very cool concept for a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is very interesting. The movie really makes you think."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it! Who stars in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The main characters are Jim Carey and Kate Winslet."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love Kate Winslet!"
"__MOVIES__ Same, she is a very talented actress."
"__MOVIES__ She was Rose in the Titanic right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! She was so good in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is she good in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind too?"
"__MOVIES__ She is amazing. Her character is very quirky and unique."
"__MOVIES__ Nice. That movie sounds very good."
"__MOVIES__ You should definitely watch it."
