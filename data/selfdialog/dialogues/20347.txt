"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Bridgette Jones Diary movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, is that the one where she's pregnant."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, She accidentally gets pregnant and doesn't know who the father is."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my!  Is it between Hugh Grant's Character, & Collin Firth's."
"__MOVIES__ No, Daniel is dead in the movie, but it is between Collin Firth and another cute leading man."
"__MOVIES__ OH I bet that puts her in a pickle"
"__MOVIES__ It really does.  She spends most of the movie trying to narrow down the father search"
"__MOVIES__ Well she has to end up with Mr. Darcy, I'm sure."
"__MOVIES__ You'll have to watch the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I plan on it.  When did you see it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it on Netflix last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, my favorite way to watch a movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think it just came on Netflix, so it should be there a while."
"__MOVIES__ Good, because I don't have much time free for the next few weekends."
"__MOVIES__ I think you should make time, because it was a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ I will, as soon as I can."
"__MOVIES__ Rene Zellweger does a great job as Bridgette Jones."
"__MOVIES__ Yes really does.  I've read the books and she really captures her essence."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if this is the last movie."
"__MOVIES__ I hope not, I love them."
