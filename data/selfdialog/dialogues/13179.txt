"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think is the strongest division in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a tough question. I guess I'd have to think about it division by division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the AFC East is out. The Patriots are strong of course, but there's really nobody else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair. I'd say the AFC North could be a contender with the Steelers, Ravens, and Bengals. We can forget about the Browns!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Poor Browns. The AFC South could be a contender in some years, but not lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I think next year we should see some good things from the AFC West with the Chiefs, Broncos, and Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I think of the NFC, it seems like each division has a couple good teams and a couple bad ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that, but I think the NFC East and NFC North are both difficult divisions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you can't underestimate the NFC West either with the Seahawks and Cardinals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but the other two are so bad!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair point. I feel the the NFC East and the AFC North have the biggest rivalries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd agree with that. You have Vikings/Green Bay, but I don't feel like all four are rivals as much as the Giants, Cowboys, Eagles, and 'Skins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then you take the AFC East. Where are the rivalries?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Pats have been so dominant for so long that it is hard to have a rivalry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they even have one at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If anyone, I guess the Giants because of the two Super Bowls, or maybe the Broncos, but that's about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you might be right with the Giants. Ruining a perfect season does tend to create some hard feelings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still can't talk about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even with this year's amazing comeback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even with that. The 2007 loss still hurts!"
