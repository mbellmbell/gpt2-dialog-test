"__ACTION__ Did you ever watch Captain America:Civil War?"
"__ACTION__ Yes, I did!  I couldn't believe that the Captain and Iron Man fought each other!"
"__ACTION__ Personally, I was on Team Iron Man. How about you?"
"__ACTION__ Oh, definitely!  Captain America got a little evil there at the end."
"__ACTION__ Didn't he let his friend almost rip Tony's heart thing out?"
"__ACTION__ I think so and then took his friend's side of Tony's.  That was just way wrong."
"__ACTION__ I used to like Captain America but now I am not so sure."
"__ACTION__ Me either.  I hope they make another movie where Iron Man kicks his butt!"
"__ACTION__ I totally agree with that!  Iron Man needs to wipe the floor with him and teach him a serious lesson about right and wrong!"
"__ACTION__ And a lesson about loyalty and friendship!"
