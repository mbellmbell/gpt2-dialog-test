"__MUSIC__ I noticed you really like Maroon 5's latest hit. Have you listened to some of their earlier stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I have! I really liked the album Songs About Jane."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I think that one is probably their best. I think my favorite track is Secret."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good song, I like it too!"
"__MUSIC__ If you like Maroon 5, you would probably like Matchbox Twenty."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm...why does that artist sound familiar?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember the song Push from the 90's?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah! That was Matchbox Twenty?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and the other popular one that got a lot of radio airplay was How Far We've Come."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, okay. Well, those are the only two songs I know by them."
"__MUSIC__ They have a lot of slow rock songs in their album More Than You Think You Are."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? I love smooth, slow rock."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you'd love this album. It was released in 2002, so it's got a lot of angsty rock in it, too."
"__MUSIC__ They sound like a strong band. Would you say they're similar to Shinedown?"
"__MUSIC__ Shinedown? The band that did Sound of Madness?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's them. They also did Second Chance."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess you could say that Matchbox Twenty is similar to Shinedown."
"__MUSIC__ Cool! Thanks for the recommendation."
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome! Remember: Matchbox Twenty."
"__MUSIC__ You got it! I won't forget."
