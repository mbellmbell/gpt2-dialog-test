"__DISNEY__ Okay, best Disney movies of the 2000s."
"__DISNEY__ Wow you're going for the big questions! Okay best Disney movies .... I mean honestly Holes was one of the greatest movies, period."
"__DISNEY__ Wow you really are my soulmate! I loved Holes, I still know all the words from that song at the end."
"__DISNEY__ Of course! Okay well what were some of your favorites?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, the Lizzie McGuire movie, hands down. It's what made me want to go to Rome!"
"__DISNEY__ That's a really good one too. I had it on VHS. I'm still upset they didn't put Miranda in the movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Right! It was a dishonor to the original trio. And personally I was mad Lizzie and Gordo got together."
"__DISNEY__ Can't say the same, I had been rooting for them since the TV show."
"__DISNEY__ You know who I was rooting for? Ethan Kraft."
"__DISNEY__ Ethan Kraft, the typical teenage hearthrob! I really do miss those movies."
