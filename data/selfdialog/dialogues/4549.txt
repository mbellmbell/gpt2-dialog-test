"__MUSIC__ Is there anything you miss about the pre-Internet, pre-MP3 era of music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh sure, there's tons! I think we devalue music now."
"__MUSIC__ Are you making an economic argument. That when there is an unlimited supply you might value each product less."
"__MUSIC__ Sort of, but it's more nuanced than that."
"__MUSIC__ Well what is it?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that back in the day, when the costs to getting an album were higher, it was a different experience."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, sure, but how is that relevant."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you were making a commitment when you bought an album. You'd go to a store, look around for a while, buy one cd, say Radiohead OK Computer for 19 dollars, drive, bike, or walk back home and sit with that record."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I see what you're saying. We don't have to sit with stuff anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly my point. It's all kind of disposable if you don't like it right away."
"__MUSIC__ I miss growing with an album and an album growing with me."
"__MUSIC__ That experience certainly is still possible, I recently did it with Pinegrove's latest album, but it's a conscious decision to do so rather than being built in."
"__MUSIC__ I also miss the social experience of the music store. Bumping into people, striking up conversations, talking to the staff, et cetera."
"__MUSIC__ You can do all of that online now though!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it's not the same as human connection. We have Facebook, but it hasn't supplanted our need to see each other in person."
"__MUSIC__ Point taken. Did you ever get any great recommendations in store?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, a clerk once referred me to check out The Modern Lovers. That was an epic day in the development of my music taste."
"__MUSIC__ I had a similar experience with someone recommending David Bowie at the record store after seeing that I picked out Modest Mouse. His passion was contagious."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's lost these days. You only really see it at shows."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I'm feeling nostalgic for CDs right now, but I also don't wanna give up my access to the majority of everything ever recorded being at my fingertips."
