"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the new SZA album?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was okay. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was alright... maybe it was overhyped."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I've been waiting for someone to say this."
"__MUSIC__ Yep... I didn't actually like it. It feels like TDE just made her drop it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and I'm not too fond of the promiscuity on the album."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the Weekend song is something else!"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! I'd be so hurt hearing that."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I don't think that's a proper thing to sing about."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she should be more discreet with her... actions."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, I think that the production was good though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, definitely. And she can sing too."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I love her voice. It's just the lyrics that don't do it for me."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe she's appealing to today's generation."
"__MUSIC__ Yep... sex does sell."
"__MUSIC__ You're right, especially with this generation and the music that they love."
"__MUSIC__ I just feel like R&B is all about infidelity now."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's the new trend."
"__MUSIC__ Sad to see those good lyrics get replaced with this mess."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, hope higher quality comes along."
