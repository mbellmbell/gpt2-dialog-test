"__MUSIC__ Do you like Radiohead?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I havent listened to their new stuff for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? Did you hear anything from a Moon Shaped Pool?"
"__MUSIC__ I watched one of the videos, it seemed pretty cool and similar to their earlier stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Really, I thought it was a little different. There earlier stuff is more rock/pop."

"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I love that album. What's your favorite album?"
"__MUSIC__ Ok Computer."

"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I read about it. I haven't checked it out yet."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't either. I still have the original CD from the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Are they touring?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so! Have you seen them live?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, at the Shoreline. They were amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Cool! I'd love to see one of their shows. I usually just watch their live stuff on youtube."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah I also like watching those videos -- they are really good live."
"__MUSIC__ Do you follow any of their solo work?"
"__MUSIC__ I have Thom Yorke's first album which was ok."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, The Eraser? Yeah that was just ok."
"__MUSIC__ Not nearly as good as Radiohead."
