"__MOVIES__ Where do you think it ties into the Tarantino universe?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure; I don't really keep up with that."
"__MOVIES__ Well it is another western film, like Django."
"__MOVIES__ This one takes place after slavery though, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so if anything, the people in the movie would have to be the descendants of the characters in Django."
"__MOVIES__ Wouldn't that be weird if Samuel L. Jackson was playing a Django's grandson or something?"
"__MOVIES__ That actually would be very ironic if that were the case."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so there is only one black person in the movie, so it is pretty obvious who they would be related to."
"__MOVIES__ No, that's not true. There are a couple of minor characters who are black in the movie. For all we know, they could be the the descendants."
"__MOVIES__ That seems really lackluster to make them supporting characters. Do they at least do something important?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. They mostly just die and serve as clues for Jackson to figure out what is really going on."
"__MOVIES__ See, I can't see him just killing them off like that."
"__MOVIES__ Then you cannot appreciate the brilliance of art and a Tarantino film. You know he does no do the ordinary."
"__MOVIES__ I understand that,  but what would be the significance of creating a universe if you were to just kill off the links to the universe."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Jackson is still linked to them through friendship, but I think Jackson dies too."
"__MOVIES__ Jackson dies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oops, well I don't know for certain. They never really show him die on screen, and he is alive for a long while after he is shot."
"__MOVIES__ He got shot? It thought he didn't take roles in which he got killed."
"__MOVIES__ I guess he changed his mind when Star Wars came out. He may have been killed in a gruesome way in The Hateful Eight."
"__MOVIES__ Did they lynch him?"
