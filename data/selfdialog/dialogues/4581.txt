"__MUSIC__ What was the first concert you ever went to?"
"__MUSIC__ It was an Alan Jackson concert!  He was absolutely incredible live!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I bet he was!  Alan Jackson is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I know, he's definitely an all time best country singer."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he is.  He has so many great songs."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard anything new lately, is he still making new music?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a good question.  I haven't heard anything either."
"__MUSIC__ I kinda doubt it because he's getting a little old."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's a little harsh, but yeah he has been around quite a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, when I saw him live it was in the nineties."
"__MUSIC__ So which of his songs do you like best?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Chattahoochee!  That song makes you wanna just get up and dance."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and you find yourself singing it later don't you."
"__MUSIC__ It's a real toe tapper.  Which one do you like best?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough decision.  I don't know, I really like all of them."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say he's one of the two best country singers of our time."
"__MUSIC__ Who's the other one?"
"__MUSIC__ Garth Brooks of course."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, they're both in a league of their own.  I agree."
"__MUSIC__ I'd love to see him in concert one day."
