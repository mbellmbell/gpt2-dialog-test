"__MOVIES__ What do you think the best Disney movie is?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked The Hunchback of Notre Dame."
"__MOVIES__ The musical variant they made? But it had nothing to do with the book."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Disney's version of the Hunchback of Notre Dame had nothing to do with the book; the book was much darker."
"__MOVIES__ Right... but it's a kid's movie. Of course it's going to be a bit gentle."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose, but they changed everything."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Frollo wasn the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, not a court judge as the Disney movie suggested."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh... I had no idea."
"__MOVIES__ Not only that, but Quasimodo murders Frollo in the book."
"__MOVIES__ Wait. What? He doesn't try to save him?"
"__MOVIES__ No. He murders Frollo right at the end. The movie does something different, I believe."
"__MOVIES__ No, you're right. In the movie Frollo dies, but Quasimodo does everything he can to try to save him."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, well. That's fine I guess. my favorite Disney movie is Mulan."
"__MOVIES__ ... Mulan? And you're complaining about accuracy?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Mulan has nothing to do with the actual story of Mulan..."
