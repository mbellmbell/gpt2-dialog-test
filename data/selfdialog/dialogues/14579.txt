"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ When I lived in Detroit I used to be able to see a band any night of the week. I miss it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Did you see anybody good?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I saw a lot of great bands. Not all of them famous or anything. Just good, local music. There was a really thriving music scene during the time I lived there. There is still is, I would imagine."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Did anybody get famous?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, the White Stripes certainly became very well-known."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Did you see them?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Many times, yes. They used to play music on my street."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh really?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. We would have a block party. We would build a stage and have music, beer and dancing all day. White Stripes played. Also other Jack White side projects, also."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Did you like their music?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh forsure. Many people did. Although, when they became famous many people became bitter."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, people who had helped Jack felt that they owned a piece of his success. They felt they were owed something."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What did they feel they were owed?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't know. Many of these guys were musicians who had helped produce or record his first album. They wanted more recognition, fame, and money."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you think they were jealous?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Somewhat. Many of these guys were in absolutely fantastic bands that never received the kind of attention the White Stripes did. Maybe they felt they deserved it more. It was a strange time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Is Jack White a nice guy?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He was always nice to me. Kind of quiet, but sweet. He is really talented guy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I wish I could have seen them play back then."
