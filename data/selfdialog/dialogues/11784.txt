"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is the NFL going to have a game or two in England again this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but I wish they'd stop that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It robs one group of fans a home game every year. Some people save up for these games and have less chances to see it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it exposes the NFL to other countries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's all well and good, but save it for pre-season scrimmages."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a great idea!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I should be the commissioner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You'd have my vote."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why should a game that counts towards the season be played in another country with a different time zone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, the time zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're basically playing at 8am, which is ridiculous for eastern teams, but 5am for those on the west coast!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That always bothered me about sports in general: late games for east teams on the west coast, and vice versa."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As commissioner I'd get rid of that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, is that your only solution for NFL in Europe?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I love the whole exhibition thing. Maybe take the top CFL team and have them play a team from the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That'd be a disaster for the CFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. They'd get paid a lot, probably, that should help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'd lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well...not against the Lions. Ha!"
