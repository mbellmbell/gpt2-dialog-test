"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite droid?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I know what mine is, but yours better not be Threepio."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not. It's the super sarcastic sassy droid in Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha, he was funny, but raises a lot of ethical questions."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yours?"
"__STAR_WARS__ R2D2. He's super functional and is sort of an deus-ex-machina."
"__STAR_WARS__ So what's the ethical issue?"
"__STAR_WARS__ If you create a robot with personality, it's alive and conscious."
"__STAR_WARS__ So?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's artificial intelligence, and it's being used as slave labor, despite being self-aware."
