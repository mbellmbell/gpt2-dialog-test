"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite part of the Goblet of Fire?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really like when Harry has to go underwater to save Ron."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked that part too. I thought it was very brave when he tried to save both Hermione and Ron."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So did I. But it was scary to me when the mermaid yelled at him that he could only take one person!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like that movie a lot because of how Harry and Cedric help each other through the challenges."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was nice of Cedric to tell Harry to take his golden egg underwater, and before that Harry told him that the first challenge involved dragons."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It just made it that much sadder when Cedric died."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh I know! And when Harry came back and everyone was cheering until they realized he had Cedric's body with him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you think everybody thought he killed Cedric?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think some people still do think he killed Cedric. Nobody wants to believe that Voldemort is back again."
