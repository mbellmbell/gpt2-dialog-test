"__MUSIC__ Ugh...this is driving me crazy..."
"__MUSIC__ What? What are you doing?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to make a mix from my favorite 90's bands and I'm on this Rob Thomas streak."
"__MUSIC__ Rob Thomas? Do you mean Robbie Thomas?"
"__MUSIC__ No, he's the songwriter and vocalist for Matchbox 20"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man...I loved that music when I was growing up."
"__MUSIC__ Right?"
"__MUSIC__ I really liked that song 'Push'"
"__MUSIC__ That's his best known one with Matchbox, but he did a lot of other good ones too?"
"__MUSIC__ Wait, did he do 'Everything you Want?'"
"__MUSIC__ No, that was Vertical Horizon, he did songs like 'Bent' and '3am' that I really like."
"__MUSIC__ So what is driving you crazy about it then?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to find his song 'Mad Season' and I can't seem to download it anywhere"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I know that one"
"__MUSIC__ It was on the radio forever along with 'Unwell', but maybe it has another name or something."
"__MUSIC__ You know he was the vocalist for Smooth right?"
"__MUSIC__ Smooth! I totally forgot about that one! Who was it he did that song with?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was Santaria or something like that...if I recall correctly."
"__MUSIC__ No, your thinking of Sublime, Smooth is with Carlos Santana"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, love Santana's jams. If you haven't seen it, the live version of it is really good."
