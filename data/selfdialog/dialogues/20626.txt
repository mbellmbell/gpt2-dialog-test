"__THRILLER__ Do you know what movie I would like to watch again?"
"__THRILLER__ Finding Nemo? No dude I have no idea."
"__THRILLER__ No Country for Old Men, such a cool flick."
"__THRILLER__ Heck yes, there are some weird and spooky dudes in that one."
"__THRILLER__ Javier Bardem......I had no idea who he was until that movie."
"__THRILLER__ Anton was dirty, nasty, mean and despicable."
"__THRILLER__ What about Woody Harrelson's character? He was like the weirdo on the fringe who liked to count the number of floors in buildings."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, he didn't last too long though. Anton made sure of that."
"__THRILLER__ They should have made an alternate ending where Anton got what he deserved at the end."
"__THRILLER__ No way man, the movie was dark all the way. It ended like it was supposed to end."
