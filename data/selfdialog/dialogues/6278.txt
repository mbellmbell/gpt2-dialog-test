"__STAR_WARS__ What year did Return of the Jedi come out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think 1983"
"__STAR_WARS__ That long ago?!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, crazy. We were just little kids back then"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved the ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but if you watch it now it seems really campy with the ewoks"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh really, I haven't seen it lately"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it definitely hasn't aged well."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that makes sense considering how long it's been"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, some parts still hold up well"
