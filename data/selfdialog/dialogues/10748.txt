"__FASHION__ This year's theme for the 2017 Met Gala was Japanese fashion designer Rei Kawakubo's vision of Comme des Garçons."
"__FASHION__ Yes, Rihanna, who is known for embracing the Met Gala themes in their entirety stunned in an avant-garde Comme des Garçons outfit with lace up sandals by Dsquared 2."
"__FASHION__ My favorite look of the night was Gigi Hadid's asymmetrical Tommy Hilfiger gown."
"__FASHION__ The dress embraced the masculine tailoring and structure of Comme des Garçons on one side and was sultry and elegant on the other."
"__FASHION__ The champagne color of the Hilfiger dress really complemented her olive skin tone."
"__FASHION__ My favorite look of the night was Blake Lively's feathered Versace gown.  This dress was made for her!"
"__FASHION__ The two-toned indigo feather fish-tail train gave this dress a spectacular flair."
"__FASHION__ She reminded me of an exotic bird as she graced the red carpet."
"__FASHION__ I was really disappointed at the Kardashian's and the Jenner's this year.  None of the dresses they chose met the theme nor were they showstoppers."
"__FASHION__ I actually think that Kim Kardashian-West was a bit under dressed this year.  She wore a white corseted Vivienne Westwood gown and strappy sandals which was a far cry from the sparkling silver Balmain gown she wore in 2016."
"__FASHION__ I liked Kylie Jenner's pink floral illlusion dress, but it is a look that we've seen hundreds of time before.  There was nothing original about it."
"__FASHION__ But that wasn't the biggest fail of the evening.  Madonna's camo Moschino gown stood out for all the wrong reasons.  It wasn't a fashion moment."
"__FASHION__ The camo gown was just a poor choice and it didn't fit the moment.  I can't think of an event where a camo dress is haute couture."
"__FASHION__ Katy Perry's Maison Margiela gown was a miss as well."
"__FASHION__ I think the saying goes, 'too many accessories clutter an outfit.'  This look had bad horror film written all over it."
"__FASHION__ My other favorite looks of the night were Rita Ora's red Marchesa gown and Zendaya really stunned in the gorgeous satin Dolce & Gabbana off the shoulder gown."
"__FASHION__ The hair, the makeup, Rita Ora definitely stole the show!"
"__FASHION__ She was an elegantly wrapped feast for the eyes even though her dress didn't really gel with the theme."
"__FASHION__ This was a complicated theme so many guests just aimed for their best fashion."
"__FASHION__ I agree.  Now, I can't wait until next years' Met Gala!"
