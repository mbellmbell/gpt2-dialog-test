"__THRILLER__ Want to watch Se7en tonight?"
"__THRILLER__ Did you seriously pronounce the number 7 within the word 'Seven'?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that's not what you do?"
"__THRILLER__ It's just stylized. It's 'Seven.'"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, sorry. Want to watch it?"
"__THRILLER__ Sure, I've seen it a few times. It's a good thriller."
"__THRILLER__ I just want to know why I hear people say 'What's in the box?' every once in a while."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, you'll love it. It's a pretty gore-filled thriller, though."
"__THRILLER__ Thanks for the warning."
"__THRILLER__ You'll like it. I don't know anyone who doesn't."
