"__COMEDY__ What is your favorite movie, a funny one?"
"__COMEDY__ It has to be, Something About Mary."
"__COMEDY__ Is that the one with Cameron Diaz?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes!!  I love her she is so funny.  She totally cracks me up!"
"__COMEDY__ Me too!  My favorite part is when she gets the 'hair gel' stuck in her hair."
"__COMEDY__ That part was so funny!  I almost died when she answered the door with her hair sticking up."
"__COMEDY__ And what about when Ben Stiller gets his 'thing' stuck in his pants zipper?"
"__COMEDY__ I totally forgot about that part, so funny!"
"__COMEDY__ Oh I know he cracks me up, but  Cameron Diaz did the best job in this film."
"__COMEDY__ I agree.  She makes this movie a must-see comedy classic."
