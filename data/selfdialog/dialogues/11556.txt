"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey Jim, why so glum?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can tell I'm depressed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. It's pretty obvious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You look horrible. You haven't showered of shaved all week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't felt like it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your living room is a mess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I hadn't noticed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You still have two have-eaten pizzas on the table"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't felt like finishing them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are still wearing the same closes you had on last Sunday!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's my football outfit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I could tell by the helmet you are wearing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It protects me from concussions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Concussion?  Dude, you have to move from your recliner to get a concussion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And there is one more thing that I noiced."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You still are wearing the body paint you were wearing while we watched the Superbowl together last Sunday. You are painted completely blue, except for the enormous horse shoe painted on your chest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Colts were so close to winning it all, and then the season ended. The thought of having to wait months until the next season starts is just too depressing!"
