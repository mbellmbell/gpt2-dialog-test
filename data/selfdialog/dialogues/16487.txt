"__MOVIES__ Let me ask you a question what's your favorite Disney cartoon?"
"__MOVIES__ You won't believe me when I tell you it's one everyone forgets."
"__MOVIES__ Well are you going to leave me in suspense?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually love the Robin Hood movie it's one of my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ What are we talking about the Robin Hood with the fox from the 70's or 80's?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it seems like no one even remembers I was a thing."
"__MOVIES__ Wow I barely remember anything from that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was so old that the animals didn't have names yet."
"__MOVIES__ What you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean these days you  you see a bear and you think to yourself oh that's Baloo  but back then when the credits were old it would just said Robin Hood played by 'a fox'.   The fox didn't have an official name yet."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I don't know why I always thought that was funny."
"__MOVIES__ That's the only reason you like that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, you know what's crazy is when you go back and look at those movies how open Disney was with negative portrayals of things."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ In the movie there's a scene where they're super sad music playing and there's animals chained to balls in prison starving.   You could never get away with that today."
"__MOVIES__ You think it would be too graphic for today's audience?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely."
"__MOVIES__ Yea it'd probably cause some social media protest."
"__MOVIES__ What doesn't these days?"
