"__DISNEY__ I feel like all of Disney's direct to DVD sequels are a waste of time."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean? The company certainly profits from them."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but it should be about more than the money; the story should mean something."
"__DISNEY__ Well, there must be one good direct to DVD sequel."
"__DISNEY__ Cinderella's are terrible, Bambi's aren't very good, Aladdin's are just average, Belle's was terrible and so was Ariel's, so."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but wasn't the Rescuers Down Under a sequel?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I forgot about that one! Isn't that the one where they're in Australia?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and they help the little boy and there's an eagle."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, you have a point, that one is really good."
"__DISNEY__ I loved Miss Bianca and Bernard, they were so cute!"
