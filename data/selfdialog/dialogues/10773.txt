"__FASHION__ That's right! I absolutely loved the flared look and think it was very fitting for her body type."
"__FASHION__ Right, along with her simple yet stunning necklace and shoes that might have been my favorite look!"
"__FASHION__ Oh those shoes were gorgeous!  Do you remember what designer they were from?"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure, I don't really remember other than it looked great!"
"__FASHION__ Agreed.  I also loved her partner's look also.  It was a perfect compliment to the dress."
"__FASHION__ Could you imagine how long it took for them to get ready?  Or how many outfits they had to look at before they decided on, 'the one?'"
"__FASHION__ I couldn't even imagine.  How fun would that be?"
"__FASHION__ Right.  Black is such a nice, elegant color for a red carpet occasion, how could you go wrong?"
"__FASHION__ Kate Hudson's Giorgio Armani suit was also stunning and such an eye catcher."
"__FASHION__ Totally agree.  Her simple hair style complimented it in such a way.  It was simple yet so gorgeous."
"__FASHION__ I don't know how she can pull of a suit like that, but I wish I could!"
"__FASHION__ Haha.  Right?  The details were so ornate."
"__FASHION__ Her shoes also complimented the outfit.  Simple tan.  How does she walk in those?"
"__FASHION__ No clue.  But after standing on the red carpet for a couple hours I bet she was ready to take them off."
"__FASHION__ If I were to wear a gorgeous Armani suit with those shoes and looked as good as she did, I don't think I'd ever take the outfit off."
"__FASHION__ Totally agree.  It actually looked pretty comfortable.  More comfortable than wearing a super tight dress or something that barely covers the body."
"__FASHION__ Jennifer Aniston always looks so timeless on the red carpet too."
"__FASHION__ Yes!  She never has a bad look. Always so elegant, confident, and beautiful"
"__FASHION__ I feel like Jennifer could walk down the red carpet in jeans and a T shirt and everyone would still love the look."
"__FASHION__ Haha.  Seriously though.  I need some fashion advice from her."
