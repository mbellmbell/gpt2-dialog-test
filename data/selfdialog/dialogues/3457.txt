"__MUSIC__ Okay, best concert ever?"
"__MUSIC__ This one is easy. Bruce Springsteen, 1978, Darkness on the Edge of Town tour."
"__MUSIC__ I can't disagree. I hadn't been to too many concerts at that point, but I knew he was something special."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and I've never seen anything likerhim since. I haven't seen any of his concerts since that were as good, although all are incredibly good."
"__MUSIC__ Watching him dance up there with so much energy, even after playing for 3 hours was incredible."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and Clarence Clemmons' solos felt like you could fly away on them."
"__MUSIC__ God rest his soul."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was a big loss for the world."
"__MUSIC__ Max Weinberg made me LOVE the drums starting at that concert."
"__MUSIC__ I loved the stories he told, and the way he weaved them into the song intros."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, for sure. Rosalita!"
"__MUSIC__ And Spirit in the Night!"
"__MUSIC__ You know, maybe the greatest accomplishment of Bruce Springsteen (among many accomplishments) is the way he has made so many thousands of people, more like hundreds of thousands, so intensely happy for at least a few hours in their life."
"__MUSIC__ I can't argue with that. As you said, so many accomplishments, but making people happy is important. Without happiness it's hard to feel alive, and happiness is so rare for most people in this tough world."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's so impressive that all his albums stand up, after all these years."
"__MUSIC__ True, true. I still love Greetings from Asbury Park and I still play it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, me too, me too. And some of his albums that weren't such huge hits are still fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ Right, Nebraska, Human Touch --"
"__MUSIC__ Lucky Town, released at the same time as Human Touch, and Tunnel of Love."
"__MUSIC__ I could listen to Bruce all night. Maybe I'll turn on my all Bruce play list when I get home."
