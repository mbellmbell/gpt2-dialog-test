"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a tough question, but I'd have to say Obi Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting choice.  Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's an interesting character.  He's a strong Jedi, and he is a good mentor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think so?  Even though his protege went to the Dark Side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that was not Obi Wan's fault.  Who is you favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love Princess Leia!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nice!  She's really cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, she's really the hero of the whole story.  She's the one searching for Obi Wan in the original, she goes after Han Solo, and even now in the new movies, she is a rebel leader."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought of that.  She's a strong character."
