"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, you ready for the NFL season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah dude, not having any games going on is driving me crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha I feel you, the year is more fun when the games are going."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for sure. I hope we see a game as exciting as the super bowl again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that game was one for the archives. Can't believe the Broncos pulled it off like they did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was awesome!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of which, did you get a chance to watch the draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah sadly not this year, had some business so I couldn't really pay attention to it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Understandable, I didn't really catch it while it was happening but I did read that it was the most attended draft in history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow really? That's pretty crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah this was the first time it was held outside so people could gather around, apparently there was over 200,000 people there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Crazy!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wonder if the Bears will turn it around this year..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't hold your breath man, they did really terrible in 2016."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know, but they are still my home team so I have to root for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't have to root for anyone, besides you're in California now, pick a new team to root for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you seen the teams around here? I will just stick with the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair enough haha, forgot how bad things were over there. Man you sure know how to live around some stinkers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very funny. We all anyway man I gotta go do some stuff I will catch you this saturday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah for sure, see you there man."
