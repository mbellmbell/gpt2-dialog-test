"__BASEBALL__ It's a good thing you didn't get me those Yankees tickets for my birthday."
"__BASEBALL__ Why is that? Because they were so expensive?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, because they lost!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah, right, that was pretty brutal."
"__BASEBALL__ That's why I love the Astros. I think they're the best team in the league right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Better than the Yankees? You're a traitor to your team!"
"__BASEBALL__ Haha. I think Carlos is great. Did you see that two-run home run he made?"
"__BASEBALL__ Carlos who? Who are you talking about."
"__BASEBALL__ Carlos Correa, number one on the Astros"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah I saw the run but I forgot his name. Guess I better start paying attention to them though."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah you should, they're gonna be contenders this year for sure."
"__BASEBALL__ They almost were contenders last year, but they had some bad luck."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah Correa got a shoulder injury and was out for awhile."
"__BASEBALL__ I saw the way he dives for the ball, always lands right on his shoulder. That's very risky."
"__BASEBALL__ Jose Altuve is great too, he's their golden boy. But I think Correa is gonna outshine him eventually."
"__BASEBALL__ The game was rained out today. It was supposed to be a double header."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah and it was Derek Jeter night too."
"__BASEBALL__ Traffic is gonna be chaos in the Bronx tonight!"
"__BASEBALL__ That's another reason I'm glad we didn't get tickets this weekend."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly, I'm not up for taking two hours to get out of the parking lot at the stadium after the game!"
