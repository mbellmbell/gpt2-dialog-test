"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you see Lady Gaga's Super bowl performance this year?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw some of it - I wasn't that impressed, actually."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh really? Why?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I just expected a bit more drama and showmanship from here. She's quite campy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, she's moved on a bit though. She's more of a serious singer now."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I remember doing a few songs at a grand piano during that performance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She has a really great voice when she uses it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, she does. She's a talented songwriter too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ People forget that it takes talent to write catchy pop songs, and Lady Gaga wrote tons of them."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly - she was absolutely everywhere a few years ago."
