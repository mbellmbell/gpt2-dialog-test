"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to this new band called Pink Floyd. Have you heard of them?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't call them exactly new, dude. I'm surprised you discovered them."
"__MUSIC__ As the networks used to say, it's not a repeat if you haven't seen it. So they're new to me."
"__MUSIC__ You're still playing vinyl, aren't you?"
"__MUSIC__ I gotta tape deck."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I'll bite. What's your favorite song or album?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Animals. Robin Watkers really wrote some fantastic lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's Roger Waters. Did you know that the album was created in response to...."
"__MUSIC__ Excuse me, I'm talking now. The piece called Time is very moving. The clock section is tremendous."
"__MUSIC__ That's not even on that album. That's on Dark Side of the Moon."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I meant. Who are you to question what I meant to say when I said it? Anyway, they are my favorite five group band, next to the Backstreet Boys,"
"__MUSIC__ There were only four members. One died."
"__MUSIC__ I said that there were four. Why don't you listen to me when I think of what I'm going to say? Now there's three. Robin Watkers died. He played drums."
"__MUSIC__ You're waaay off. Robin Watkers, I mean Roger Waters is not dead. Musically maybe but he's very much alive and he did not play drums, although in his mind he probably thought we did. Kind of a little like you."
"__MUSIC__ So who played drums then, smarty-pants?"
"__MUSIC__ Nick Mason did. He's still alive."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't he run a jar factory on the side? My Gamma always talked about how good those jars were."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'm going to hemorrhage."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's the name of their third album, I think. It had a guy singing with pixies."
"__MUSIC__ Lord, please take me now. Don't care where."
