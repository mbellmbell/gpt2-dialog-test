"__MOVIES__ Have you watched the new movie, 'The Mummy'?"
"__MOVIES__ No, is that the one with Tom Cruise in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he is the main character."
"__MOVIES__ It's been awhile since Tom Cruise has been in a new movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but I thought it was pretty good, but not his best."
"__MOVIES__ What's the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Tom Cruise and Jake Johnson are soldiers, but they are a bit corrupted. They like to steal antique artifacts."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. I remember seeing it advertised on television now. It seemed to have pretty good graphics and special effects."
"__MOVIES__ I will say that the special effects were pretty good. It had some pretty funny spots in it too."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I didn't really think it would be a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it's not a comedy, it's an action movie. But, they did incorporate a bit of humor. I thought it was a good touch."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I like action movies with humor too. So, did you enjoy the movie, was it a new plot, or a bit expected?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I felt it was a bit expected, definitely reminded me of 'The Mummy' starring Brendan Fraser."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes, that's right! I remember that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, very similar plot line, except the mummy was a woman in this one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes, I remember seeing her in the advertisements on television. Did she do a good job with the role?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she actually was very good at the role. Of course, there was a romance for Tom Cruise, which is a bit typical."
"__MOVIES__ True, I believe there was a romance that developed for Brendan Fraser in 'The Mummy' too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you're right. But, it's an okay movie, worth a watch."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, well I will make sure I check it out. Thanks!"
