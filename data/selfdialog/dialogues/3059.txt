"__MUSIC__ I went to see Maroon 5 in concert last night."
"__MUSIC__ I really don't listen to them."
"__MUSIC__ How could you not?  Their music is awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I know some of their songs.  I'm just not a fan."
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to them since they released their first song."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, how long have they been around?"
"__MUSIC__ Since the early 2000's."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I didn't know they had been around that long."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they've had a few albums."
"__MUSIC__ What was the first song they released?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was 'Harder to Breath.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I remember that song!  I didn't realize it was them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have a ton of songs."
"__MUSIC__ Were there any other songs from that first album that I might know?"
"__MUSIC__ They were all pretty good.  You might know 'She Will Be Loved.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I remember that one too!  I liked it."
"__MUSIC__ I thought you didn't really care for them?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't realize they had all these songs!"
"__MUSIC__ So, do you wish you went to the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Definately!"
