"__DISNEY__ I see. I think I've heard one of the songs from it."
"__DISNEY__ It might be 'When Will My Life Begin.' That's probably the most popular one."
"__DISNEY__ It could be. How did you like Mandy Moore in that role?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought she was awesome. I've always liked her as a singer and actress, though."
"__DISNEY__ Me, too."
