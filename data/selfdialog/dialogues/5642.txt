"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know Jabba the Hut was supposed to be furry?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh?  You're making that up."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I'm serious.  He was originally written as a furry character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just can't even picture that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I guess the idea got dumped because they didn't think he'd be scary enough."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jabba is pretty ugly looking with his pasty skin and what not."
"__STAR_WARS__ If he was furry, you'd just want to pet him, not hurt him."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would have been an odd dynamic for the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm glad George Lucas came to his senses."
"__STAR_WARS__ At least he did about something!"
