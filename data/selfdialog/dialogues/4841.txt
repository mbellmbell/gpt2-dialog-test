"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the current state of hip hop?"
"__MUSIC__ Personally, I think the lyrical content has fallen from public eye."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, aside from people like Kendrick Lamar and J Cole I feel like people don't appreciate lyrics in mainstream hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ I can see what you mean to a certain extent, but I feel that you're exaggerating a bit."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well we have people like Schoolboy Q, Big Sean, and Kanye West still out in the mainstream still."
"__MUSIC__ True. I just meant we don't pay enough attention to the content in music."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's still true somewhat."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah like people just pay attention to melodies. They don't care about anything other than if it sounds cool or not."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I feel like people pay too much attention to artists like Lil Yachty and Lil Uzi."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. They pick very catchy beats and throw lazy lyrics over it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but how do we shift back to listening to more lyrically conscious artists?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I just think that what the kids are listening to right now isn't hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ We used to shun this type of music back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. the previous generations of music paid attention to lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it's just the current wave of music. it might change in a few years."
"__MUSIC__ And i'll be happy when it does. I don't like seeing hard working artists I listen to struggle while this type of music is in the spotlight."
"__MUSIC__ That's a valid point. I think lyricists deserve to eat more off of hip hop before the art is dead."
"__MUSIC__ I think it'll always be a craft. i just wish it was in the spotlight again."
