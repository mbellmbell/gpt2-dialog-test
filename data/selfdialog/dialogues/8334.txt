"__POP__ I read something stupid Lourde said recently about Taylor Swift."
"__POP__ It better not have been mean, you know how ferocious Taylor's fans are."
"__POP__ She said being friends with Taylor was like having a friend with an auto-immune disorder or severe allergies, because you can't go to certain places or do certain things."
"__POP__ She should be grateful to have a friend like Taylor Swift regardless of what they get to do together."
"__POP__ Apparently people got mad because they saw it as insensitive to people with disorders, and especially Selena Gomez who was diagnosed with Lupus."
"__POP__ I've always felt sorry for Selena, she seems like such a nice girl, and then she had a hard time with Justin Bieber, and then being diagnosed with Lupus."
"__POP__ Sometimes famous people like pop singers don't stop and realize they have to be careful what they say, because they have fans following them, and their words can be really hurtful to fans."
"__POP__ What did Taylor say about it?"
"__POP__ There wasn't any comment from her, but Lourde went on twitter and apologized for being insensitive."
"__POP__ It is insensitive to use a medical problem like that as a joke. It's not a joke to people who have it."
