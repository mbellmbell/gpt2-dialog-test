"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which version do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ To me there's only one version, the original."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I've seen the ones that just came out, how about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Those are phony. The ones from the eighties are the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean the original and then like The Empire Strikes Back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first three, including those two and Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I think Yoda was the coolest."
"__STAR_WARS__ The ones after the first three I think they were just doing too much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, who does a trilogy prequel? Doesn't make sense to me."
