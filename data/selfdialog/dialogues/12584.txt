"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so ready ! The first game is KC at NE on Thursday night!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm pulling for my Chiefs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. Gronk will be back in full form, so that worries me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but who do they have running the ball? Blount left for Philly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck, It doesn't matter! With Brady they might throw the ball he first 20 plays!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true too. They've done it before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know Belicheck's record on opening day is great, But so is our boy Andy Reid!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes sir. He's great on opening week and coming off byes."
