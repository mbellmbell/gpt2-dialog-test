"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new blink-182 album?"
"__MUSIC__ The one they did with Matt Skiba?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I had my reservations because legacy and all that but it's actually really good."
"__MUSIC__ That's great to hear though like you have I had and still have my reservations."
"__MUSIC__ Original lineups are always preferred but when an original lineup is getting no results why not shuffle around?"
"__MUSIC__ You have a point but when I think of blink-182 I think of the way Mark and Tom play off of each other."
"__MUSIC__ That was always their defining quality but I think they maintain what with Matt Skiba."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wait I forgot it was Matt Skiba who replaced Tom, that makes me feel better."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah getting someone of his caliber in the band helped with the transition tremendously."
"__MUSIC__ I'm really excited to hear it now, does it have Alkaline Trio vibes?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of but not really, it's a lot more classic blink than Alkaline Trio."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's kind of a bummer to hear but good on the classic blink though."
"__MUSIC__ Not to say there aren't flashes of Alkaline Trio on the record, just not as much as some were hoping."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to listen to it as soon as I get out of work."
"__MUSIC__ They're playing a show up in Hershey if you were interested."
"__MUSIC__ Is getting me to listen to the new album a way to get me to go to the show?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, not often you get to see punk legends united on a stage."
"__MUSIC__ That is true, the thought of seeing Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba on the same stage is exciting."
"__MUSIC__ Let me know what you think, the album is called California."
"__MUSIC__ Of course it's called California."
