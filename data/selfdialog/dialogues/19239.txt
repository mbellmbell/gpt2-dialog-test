"__MOVIES__ Hey! What's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say Terminator 2, have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've only seen the new ones. Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's, in my opinion, the best Terminator. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edward Furlong, Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick."
"__MOVIES__ Those are big actors! What's the general plot?"
"__MOVIES__ Well you've probably have the basics of Terminator but it's basically a good terminator protecting John and Sarah Connor from the T-1000."
"__MOVIES__ Arnold is a good terminator?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, future John Connor sent a terminator to the past (where the movie takes place) to protect John from the T-1000."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool, when did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ It came out on July 3rd, 1991."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty dated. Does it have bad CGI or anything like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually it really doesn't. The movie concept and the graphics are pretty ahead of it's done. Also the soundtrack and theme of Terminator 2 is amazing."
"__MOVIES__ What's in the beginning?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the opening theme that shows the war between man and machine with Sarah Connor talking over it. Then it goes into a post apocalyptic LA with a ton of symbolism, it's powerful."
"__MOVIES__ Woah, that sounds awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! There's also a bunch of crazy things that occurred behind the scenes of the movie as well."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really, like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, one of the things that happened, was Linda Hamilton had permanent hearing loss in one ear from the famous elevator scene because her ears were not covered or plugged up."
"__MOVIES__ I have to check this movie out like right now!"
"__MOVIES__ You really should, it's a classic and great movie!"
