"__THRILLER__ Have you seen shutter island?"
"__THRILLER__ I have I enjoyed it but not as much as the book."
"__THRILLER__ I didn't even realize it was a book first. I wish I would have read it before viewing the film."
"__THRILLER__ Hard to say what is better because you may have enjoyed the film more not knowing the twist first."
"__THRILLER__ That is true, it is a different movie watching it a second or third time, knowing what happens."
"__THRILLER__ Exactly, even though I knew the twist.. I still really enjoyed this film overall."
"__THRILLER__ I thought the best performance outside of Leo was Mark Ruffalo."
"__THRILLER__ Mark Ruffalo was superb, I feel he doesn't always get due credit for his acting chops."
"__THRILLER__ True he may be underappreciated in hollywood."
"__THRILLER__ Or maybe by audiences since he is rarely the main draw, he may get overlooked for people like leo, super a-list."
