"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I actually like Obi Wan Kenobi a lot."
"__STAR_WARS__ The old version or the young one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like them both but I prefer the older Obi Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you like him the best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like how he is a teacher and is secretly watching Luke grow up. It's like he already knows all the events that will transpire."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think he let Darth Vadar kill him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it has to do with a Force ability to come back as a ghost after you are dead. He even says that he will be more powerful than Darth Vadar ever imagined."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought of it that way, it is an interesting theory. Do you think the Sith can do it also?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Possibly but its probably a more warped version of the ability. I think it is related to Anakin thinking he can prevent death from happening or some kind of mastery over death like that."
