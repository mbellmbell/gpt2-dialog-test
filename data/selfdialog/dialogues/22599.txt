"__DISNEY__ I was watching a PBS documentary about Disney last night."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah? Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. It showed clips of the different movies and saw clips of Dumbo."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I loved Dumbo!"
"__DISNEY__ He was so darned cute with those big eyes."
"__DISNEY__ And he never spoke a word of dialogue in the whole movie."
"__DISNEY__ True. Proof that emotions can be conveyed just through body language and eyes ... even when animated."
"__DISNEY__ Dumbo is a little unusual as far as a Disney movie goes."
"__DISNEY__ How so?"
"__DISNEY__ Most have a father raising a motherless child, but in Dumbo his mother was raising a fatherless child."
