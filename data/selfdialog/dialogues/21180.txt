"__THRILLER__ Are you a fan of thriller movies?"
"__THRILLER__ Not really. I do not find being scared entertaining."
"__THRILLER__ I agree. I did think Alien v. Predator was good."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I did too! I was not scared by that film at all."
"__THRILLER__ I wish they would make more like that. Many thrillers these days are not entertaining."
"__THRILLER__ I know. They only have shock value."
"__THRILLER__ I would rather watch an old film such as Michael Myers."
"__THRILLER__ Those were the best, even though they were horror films."
"__THRILLER__ Maybe I will put one on tonight."
"__THRILLER__ Keep the lights on!"
