"__MUSIC__ What are you listening to? I can hear it through your headphones but can't place it."
"__MUSIC__ What!?!"
"__MUSIC__ Take off the headphones!!!"
"__MUSIC__ You don't have to yell. There, they're off now. What do you want?"
"__MUSIC__ What are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a group called ELOY."
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of them. Who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Ask your dad. Oh, alright, I'll tell you. They're a progressive electronic new-wavy kind of rock band from the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ Man, I wasn't even alive in the 80's. There was music back then?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. The instruments were wooden but they made them work."
"__MUSIC__ Instruments?"
"__MUSIC__ They're what people played music on before computers. Eloy was drums, guitar and heavy on the keyboards."
"__MUSIC__ How do you hear the singer with all that noise?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the idea is that the singer sings along with the music. They are integrated together."
"__MUSIC__ Let me listen. Wow. That's trippy. It's hard to listen to. It confuses me."
"__MUSIC__ Do I really want to ask? Alright. Why does it confuse you?"
"__MUSIC__ It's too busy. There's too many sounds at once."
"__MUSIC__ You mean too many notes?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's it. What's a note?"
"__MUSIC__ Go boil your head."
