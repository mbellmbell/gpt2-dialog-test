"__MOVIES__ Did you like the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It was better than I thought"
"__MOVIES__ The movie didn't have many cheesy or stupid scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I'm glad that they didn't have any love scenes. Sometimes a love scene destroys a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ But I thought the scene where the girl was washing her hair and Tom Cruise came to say good bye was stupid. Why did they have that there? It didn't make sense."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. They didn't need that scene"
"__MOVIES__ When you are talking about good movies versus great movies, each and every scene counts"
"__MOVIES__ But besides those one or two scenes, the movie was great"
"__MOVIES__ I liked almost everything about it. I really liked the samurai that was beating up Cruise in the beginning of the movie. The guy second in command. He was cool too."
"__MOVIES__ Every movie has a guy like him. They try to make him awesome even though they don't say much."
"__MOVIES__ I don't understand why Tom Cruise went back to that village. If he was the only survivor, wouldn't that make everyone suspicious about where his loyalty lies?"
"__MOVIES__ It was clear in the movie that he loved the place and the samurais. Clearly everyone knows that he isn't a traitor. I would have done the same thing in his position"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I think so too."
"__MOVIES__ But isn't it suspicious that he is the only survivor?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, all the samurais were looking for a death in battle. Cruise wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ But only the boss received the satisfaction of being killed with the sword. Nobody else did."
"__MOVIES__ That is true."
"__MOVIES__ I guess we can agree to disagree on certain points."
"__MOVIES__ Overall though, we both found some things in the film that we liked, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Right! I'm glad that we went"
