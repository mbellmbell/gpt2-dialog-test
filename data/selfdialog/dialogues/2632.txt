"__MUSIC__ So I have to tell you about this new album I just heard."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? What new crazy album are you listening to now?"
"__MUSIC__ I'll give you the genre and you can guess. It's Hip Hop. I will give you more clues if you can't guess right away."
"__MUSIC__ Only the genre, really? All right. So knowing you, and what you've been up to lately I would say Kendrick Lamar's new album."
"__MUSIC__ Dang, you're good. You know I really like his last album, so I can see why you picked that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. His beats are pretty tight. My wife, surprisingly, thinks he's a genius. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip hop so I'm not a good one to ask opinions about it."
"__MUSIC__ Well let me fill you in on a couple of things about it. First off, all the song titles are one word. It reminds me of the movie Seven."
"__MUSIC__ Like deadly sins? Or something else?"
"__MUSIC__ He's got song titles like Love, Loyalty, Fear, etc. It's pretty freaking genius if you ask me."
"__MUSIC__ So my wife was right, huh? Does it have any comedy in it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, sort of, if you consider dark humor to be comedy."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Yeah, that's my favorite kind. You've got me kind of curious now."
"__MUSIC__ Trust me, even if you don't like rap, I bet you could appreciate the beats and the content of his lyrics. He talks some about the state of things currently in this social and political climate right now."
"__MUSIC__ Sound interesting so far. As long as they don't all sound somewhat the same-- because I hate that."
"__MUSIC__ No, no. Absolutely not. It's actually a little too diverse in my opinion, but does a good job in at least keeping to a theme."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's good. Does he have any guest singers that add some hot stuff to the tracks?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I'm trying to remember exactly who, but-- Oh, I got it now. There's U2, Big Boi, Rhianna..."
"__MUSIC__ Nice. You're right, that is pretty diverse."
"__MUSIC__ He is definitely the most up and coming hip hop artist within that last few years. He talks a real game and keeps it 100% honest."
"__MUSIC__ I like that. I will definitely check it out now. Burn me a copy, or just FTP it to me tomorrow, all right?"
