"__MOVIES__ I think we see films shot all over."
"__MOVIES__ Some cities are so used to it."

"__MOVIES__ But when you go to other cities the film process almost shuts them down."
"__MOVIES__ I think you can create a city landscape right on a set."
"__MOVIES__ Its crazy to think we are being deceived."
"__MOVIES__ I dont see it as deception this is just the process used in film making."
"__MOVIES__ I would like to see an entire film shot and not edited."
