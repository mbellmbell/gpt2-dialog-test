"__MOVIES__ So did you see the new mummy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ the one starring tom cruise?"
"__MOVIES__ yes, that one."
"__MOVIES__ nope, I don't think it's a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think so?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I mean I watched the trailer, and it does not look good."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the original mummy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ yes I have, The first movie was so scary."
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree. I was not able to sleep for 2 days."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, There was this one scene in which I almost got heard attack."
"__MOVIES__ Oh Yes! I remember that scene as well, The one in which the mummy suddenly appears."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that scene."
"__MOVIES__ I remember, It was so scary that they were forced to make second part less scary."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't see a point of making a horror movie that is not scary."
"__MOVIES__ By the way this new mummy movie doesn't look scary at all."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I totally agree. It looks more of an action movie than a horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ Makes sense why they took tom cruise."
"__MOVIES__ ha ha ha.. Are you suggesting that tom cruise is symbolic of action movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he pretty much is."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, It is hard to ignore his mission impossible movie series."
