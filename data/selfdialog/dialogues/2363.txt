"__MUSIC__ Hey, what's up?"
"__MUSIC__ Not much, what about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Eh, about the same. Just listening to some Lorde."
"__MUSIC__ Lorde? I've heard of her but I don't think I've listened to any of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't know."
"__MUSIC__ She's a fantastic singer; One of the best, I think."
"__MUSIC__ You've gotta be kidding."
"__MUSIC__ No, I'm serious."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't she so young, though?"
"__MUSIC__ So? She's got the pipes."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I like Stevie Nicks and stuff like that."
"__MUSIC__ Lorde's new album is shaking me up."
"__MUSIC__ Good or bad shaking?"
"__MUSIC__ Good, all of her songs give me chills."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you say she's really that good, then I'll give her a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Good! I love Stevie Nicks too, but it's hard to compare different styles and genres."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is. I'll try Lorde out."
"__MUSIC__ Nice, thanks man. Let me know how you like her."
"__MUSIC__ I will."
