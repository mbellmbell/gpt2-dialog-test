"__STAR_WARS__ How do you see Finn fitting into the next few movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not quite sure.  He's not the focal point for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed, that would definitely seem to be Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see him as being more of the Han Solo variety focused on phasers and one-liners."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think they are trying to make him anything like Solo personality-wise, but get what you mean."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe we'll learn a bit more of where he came from.  Did he grow up on the Death Star?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's my guess. They probably just take kids and put them into training for the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm wondering if he'll ever be involved romantically with Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope not.  No reason to muddy the plot with anything like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree with you, I just hope the writers do too."
