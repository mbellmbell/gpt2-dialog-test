"__DISNEY__ People seem to think that Disney is only recently doing live action movies."
"__DISNEY__ I know. They have terrific animated movies but they've also been doing live action for many, many years."
"__DISNEY__ I loved seeing 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, Kirk Douglas was really good in it."
"__DISNEY__ I also went on the ride in Disneyland but kind of freaked out."
"__DISNEY__ How so?"
"__DISNEY__ You go inside a really tight, enclosed replica of the submarine and I discovered that I have a touch of claustrophobia."
"__DISNEY__ That's one heck of a time to find that out."
"__DISNEY__ It sure is. Good thing I was a cute little 4 year old when it happened and everyone took pity on me when I sort of freaked out."
"__DISNEY__ Cute goes far in getting you out of things!"
