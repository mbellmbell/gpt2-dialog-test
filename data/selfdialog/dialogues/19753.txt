"__MOVIES__ What would you say is Joss Whedon's best movie project?"
"__MOVIES__ We're only talking about movies here? Not TV shows?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, only talking about movies."
"__MOVIES__ Darn, I'd say Firefly, then Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that would be too easy. So it's only movies."
"__MOVIES__ I'd maybe say Avengers Age of Ultron, then."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I wasn't all that fond of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was an excellent example of how to make a massive superhero movie entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ See, for me it was kind of bloated and overly scattered."
"__MOVIES__ Bloated, I will grant, but that's how it is these days. Every movie needs to be 3 hours for some reason."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it."
"__MOVIES__ But I didn't think it was scattered. I think Whedon did a nice job of cutting in contemplative, character building moments amid the action."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those moments didn't work for me. I found them distracting."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like most superhero movies don't do enough of that."
"__MOVIES__ We clearly have different taste in superhero movies, then!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. Did you like the Thor movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they were a lot of fun!"
"__MOVIES__ There you go. I didn't like them at all."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ They were just kind of goofy and bland."
