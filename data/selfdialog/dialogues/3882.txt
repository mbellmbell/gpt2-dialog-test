"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite rock band?"
"__MUSIC__ I really love The Pixies. I have all of their albums!"
"__MUSIC__ They're one of my favorites too. Have you ever seen them in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ I've seen them a handful of times, they put on a really solid show."
"__MUSIC__ Are Frank Black and Kim Deal getting along these days?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard that they're not touring again because Frank and Kim got into it again."
"__MUSIC__ That's not entirely surprising."
"__MUSIC__ No, what's surprising is that they haven't killed each other yet!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, I've heard they fight like crazy."
"__MUSIC__ They do. Frank's kicked Kim out so many times."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder why she keeps coming back to the band?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe its a love hate relationship? Except we only really hear about the hate part."
"__MUSIC__ That's probably at least close to the truth."
"__MUSIC__ I remember at one show I saw them at, Frank made fun of Kim almost the entire time."
"__MUSIC__ Did she at least go back at him?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, she mostly took it in stride and laughed it off."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine she's probably used to it by now."
"__MUSIC__ He does seem like a pretty tough guy to work with."
"__MUSIC__ He wants to be a rock star and he probably doesn't like it when he's not the center of attention."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe that's why he booted Kim when she started to branch out to a side project."
