"__BASEBALL__ The Rockies are playing the Reds this evening"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the Reds just got swept by the cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ The Reds are struggling a little bit they could use a win tonight."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but the Rockies are rolling and are looking really good right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they are 10 games over .500 right now."
"__BASEBALL__ And they are playing better on the road than they are at home. Which is impressive."
"__BASEBALL__ The reds are still only 4 games back after getting swept, so they are still engaged."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah and it's still early, but I would like to see them take care of the Rockies this evening."
"__BASEBALL__ Matter of fact the Reds have lost 6 in a row, so they got to  stop the bleeding."
"__BASEBALL__ Baseball is such a long season, you just have to be able to hang in there."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but you never want to fall too far behind. It's a marathon, but you don't want to be way in the back."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah if they could just tread water and hover around 3 to 4 games out of first place they should be in good shape."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but that is easier said than done. They are in a tough division."
"__BASEBALL__ That division is tough. Especially with the World Series Champions Cubs and the Cardinals."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the Cardinals always seem to be hovering around the top."
"__BASEBALL__ The Reds are going to have to play awfully well to compete with this group."
"__BASEBALL__ But it can be done, they just got to get some timely hitting and good pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but I think the Cubs exposed their pitching that last series."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but when the Cubs are hot, they will expose a lot of teams."
"__BASEBALL__ Good point. Hopefully, tonight starts a win streak for the Reds."
