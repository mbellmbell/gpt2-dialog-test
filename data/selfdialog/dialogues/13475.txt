"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Training camp is almost here and I can't wait for the season to start!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah this year's draft was awesome and a lot of teams will be in the hunt for the championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still can't believe Atlanta crumbled in the big game after such a big lead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you can never count out the Pats and the greatest of all time, Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa there! I dunno if I would call him the greatest. There are way better people to call the greatest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like who!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will always think of Joe Montana as the greatest. Other QBs like Bradshaw, Steve Young, Elway, and even Manning I would put above Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are out of your mind! Brady is a proven winner and has the rings to prove it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will wait and see. Just my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the team to watch this year could be the Tennessee Titans, surprisingly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have Mariotta who has another year under his belt, and DeMarco who still has a lot left in the tank to do well this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. People seem to forget about them. They just need to shore up their defense a bit and they are a legit contender."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would agree to that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you know who isn't going to do well this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chicago Bears"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Da Bears! Yeah it was a bad showing at the draft, especially the trade to move up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I don't get it at all. But I guess they needed to move on and get another quarterback to rely on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dunno who is worse at getting QBs....Chicago or the Browns, lol."
