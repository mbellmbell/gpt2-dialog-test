"__MOVIES__ Did you catch the latest Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ which one, the Force Awakens or Rogue One?"
"__MOVIES__ Rogue One"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that one yet, I did see Force Awakens"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Force Awakens?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay, not as good as the original ones"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was kind of a mash-up of the original three movies"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there wasn't much of a new story line"
"__MOVIES__ And Carrie Fisher was really bad in it"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, her acting has gone way down, hasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's too bad because she was really good in the original ones"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, do you remember her in Blues Brothers?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, she was Elroy's estranged wife?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, I just remember her shooting the machine gun at them at one point"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a classic moment"
"__MOVIES__ Well, anyway, at least the Force Awakens was better than the prequels"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man those were horrible"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, really bad"
"__MOVIES__ You should check out Rogue one; it's good"
"__MOVIES__ Okay I'll try checking it out, thanks."
