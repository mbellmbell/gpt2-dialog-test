"__MOVIES__ Do you like to watch any black and white movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes, though a lot of them seem boring to me."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know anything about the first movie ever made?"
"__MOVIES__ No, do you want to talk about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It's actually one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ What is it called."
"__MOVIES__ It's called Nosferatu, and it's pretty much Dracula."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I haven't heard of that as a movie, but I know of the monster."
"__MOVIES__ Oddly enough, the movie was pretty enjoyable to watch, even by today's standards."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's very interesting."
"__MOVIES__ It is a silent movie though, so there aren't any voices."
"__MOVIES__ That I would expect if it's so old."
"__MOVIES__ They do have lots of music though and still have the word panels that show up."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really much for those."
"__MOVIES__ You should watch it sometime though, it's not boring at all."
"__MOVIES__ I might, do you know where I could watch it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure you could rent it online somewhere, maybe through Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good idea, though I'll wait a while to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Nah you have to watch it with me sometime soon, it's really good."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'll give it a try when I come over next."
