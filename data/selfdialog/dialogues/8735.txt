"__BEATLES__ Who's your favorite Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that question is as old as time!"
"__BEATLES__ I know. I can't say I really have one."
"__BEATLES__ Me neither. Would George Martin count as an option?"
"__BEATLES__ I guess he could!"
"__BEATLES__ What about the drummer they had before Ringo. 'Pete,' somebody i think."
"__BEATLES__ Good point. Technically he was a Beatle"
"__BEATLES__ Obviously Paul and John were equally gifted and prolific"
"__BEATLES__ But George wrote a ton of good stuff too."
"__BEATLES__ Absolutely, He just wrote significantly less masterpieces than they did, ha!"
