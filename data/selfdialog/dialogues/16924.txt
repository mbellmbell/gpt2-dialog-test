"__MOVIES__ So, have you seen any of the Batman movies?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean the Dark Knight Trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah, though I also meant any of them, like the Michael Keaton ones and such."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! Then yeah, I've seen quite a few of them."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favourite Batman?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, like you probably guessed from my original response, Christopher Nolan's is my favourite."
"__MOVIES__ No love for the new Ben Affleck one, I take it."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, I actually do like Affleck's portrayal, I just think the movie sucked."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ So, in Batman vs. Superman, I really like how the detective aspect of Batman is played up."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that wasn't as obvious in the Nolan films."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. But I just felt like the conflict between Batman and Superman was too forced for me to take seriously."
"__MOVIES__ That's fair, I guess, but I just love seeing detective Batman so much it's still my favourite."
"__MOVIES__ We can excuse a lot of faults when the one thing we like best is right, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, wise guy, why do you like the Nolan films?"
"__MOVIES__ I just think the social commentary and the cohesiveness of the storyline is so on point."
"__MOVIES__ The Dark Knight really is in a league of its own, I'll give you that."
"__MOVIES__ For sure! It completely rewrote the way we understood how a comic book movie could work."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately, movie studios took that to mean that every movie should be dark and gritty."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. They misunderstood that Batman worked as dark and gritty because Batman himself is dark and gritty, not because all movies need to be."
