"__BASKETBALL__ Did you fill out your bracket yet?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I actually filled out three."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you in a pool, or are they just for you?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm in one pool at work and one at the bar.  One is just for me."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you have in the Final Four?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I took Kansas, North Carolina, Duke, and Gonzaga in my work pool."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you really think Kansas will get to the Final Four?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, they've been playing well at the end of the season."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know, man.  They usually fold in the tournament."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, maybe this year they won't."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know about that Gonzaga pick, either."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why not?  They've been solid all year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but their conference is weak."
"__BASKETBALL__ That doesn't matter; their coach can work magic."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm sticking with the Tarheels to go all the way."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, Roy looks pretty focused this year, and he's got a good team."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'd like to see Kansas win, but I'm just not feeling it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Self seems like a good guy, but sometimes his teams just can't finish."
"__BASKETBALL__ You have to love this time of year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Indeed, it's March Madness, baby!"
