"__MUSIC__ So, two new Nine Inch Nails releases this year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, man. Yeah. I... uh, wonder if either of those will also come with a physical component."
"__MUSIC__ Possibly a spiritual component. I'm sure they'll sell a box to hold all the FLAC files."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously, though, when's the last time he was this productive? Like, a decade ago?"
"__MUSIC__ Not many choices, are there? He's always gone, like, five years between albums, except for that run from 2005."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder how all of these will fit together. They're supposed to be all on a theme, right?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what he said. The first one was... okay, but it did feel like only a third of an album."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, yeah, it was short -- but it's an EP. What gets me is that I'm not totally sure what theme even runs through that one record."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, records. Speaking of -- not to change the subject -- did you ever get a physical record?"
"__MUSIC__ I ordered one, but I think they had some kind of a problem with manufacturing?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, is that it? Because I've been waiting -- and I'm gonna move soon, so I'm not sure what to do about that."
"__MUSIC__ That must be annoying, yeah. I'm sure you could write to them."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I'll have to. Maybe they'll send me a physical component, too."
"__MUSIC__ What are those things, anyway? I've never seen a report; everyone's all elusive."
"__MUSIC__ Someone told me it's an envelope or something, that warns you of possible consequences if you open it."
"__MUSIC__ That's not ominous at all."
"__MUSIC__ He said, 'Oh, great, Trent just sent me a package of anthrax.'"
"__MUSIC__ Harking back to the Year Zero days with this."
"__MUSIC__ So, yeah, I dunno. I'm glad he's doing something!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I'm just wondering... what?"
