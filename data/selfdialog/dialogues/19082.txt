"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the Casino Royale Move?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you talking about the Peter Sellers spoof movie or the other one? I've seen both."
"__MOVIES__ I mean the other one, the one with Daniel Craig as James Bond."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, yes, the true Bond film, I liked it a lot. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it. I agree it was the true Bond film."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The producers stuck to Ian Fleming's vision."
"__MOVIES__ And Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond."
"__MOVIES__ You think he was even better than Sean Connery? Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ He played a more well-rounded character. Connery was suave as Bond, but something was missing."
"__MOVIES__ I can see what you mean in some ways. Still, Connery did not play the role for comic effect as Roger Moore did."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, Moore thought the whole famous spy angle was a funny premise."
"__MOVIES__ You make me want to watch Casino Royale again just to compare Craig to Moore and Connery."
"__MOVIES__ You are forgetting the other Bond actors."
"__MOVIES__ I almost did. What were their names again?"
"__MOVIES__ I think Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and George Lazenby were the other Bonds."
"__MOVIES__ Is that all of them? I think each was good in his own way."
"__MOVIES__ Some played the role more as ab action hero while some took a less serious approach. I still prefer Craig."
"__MOVIES__ I can see why now. He seems to combine all those aspects of Bond's personality into one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, this 007 has a mission and a history."
"__MOVIES__ And we want to see more!"
