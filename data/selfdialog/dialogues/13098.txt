"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There were an awful lot of surprise trades during this NFL offseason"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes there were, like Marshawn Lynch coming out of retirement to be traded"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They say Lynch dreamed of playing for the Raiders, and if he plays as well as they think he can they'll be heading straight to the top"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've never been a huge Raiders fan, but I'd much rather see them in the Superbowl than the Patriots, Steelers, or Broncos for once"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Carr stays healthy, they definitely have a lot of talent to make it there"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last season was a huge bummer seeing Connor Cook make his NFL debut in a big playoff loss"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't blame him for that, and I don't think anyone should expect a rookie to do that well under so much pressure"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least with Lynch on their team, they won't have to rely on the passing game so much"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of the AFC West, how weird is it to see Jamaal Charles on the Denver Broncos?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It won't be the first time a player was trading to a fierce rival, but it will be interesting to see him play his former team twice each season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will, and I hope he'll be back to his healthy self"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seeing him in that regular season game a couple years ago scoring something like five touchdowns was amazing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was, unless you were like me and playing someone in fantasy football who had him on their team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That many touchdowns has got to translate to a lot of fantasy points"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my first fantasy football season, I drafted Adrian Peterson with my first pick in the season where he made his big comeback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if it's more weird to see Charles on the Broncos, or Peterson in any team other than the Vikings"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Saints definitely need all the help they can get, and it will be interesting to see if he makes another big comeback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's already a future hall of famer, but that would cement him as one of the greatest players to play the sport"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now the Saints have him and Brees, two of the very best at their positions"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which means there's even more pressure for the Saints not to completely waste the incredible talent on their team"
