"__BEATLES__ I was watching a children's show a couple days ago with my cousins. There was a parody of the Sgt. Pepper's Band."
"__BEATLES__ Did they have the band uniforms on?"
"__BEATLES__ They did. Four of the characters had on the right color uniforms."
"__BEATLES__ That sounds awesome. The Sgt. Pepper album is one of my favorites."
"__BEATLES__ Mine too! Not only is the music great, but the art is fantastic as well."
"__BEATLES__ I love the concept behind it. What's your favorite track on the album?"
"__BEATLES__ I love 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'; but I also love 'When I'm Sixty-Four', 'Lovely Rita', and 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite', too. It's too hard to pick."
"__BEATLES__ 'With a Little Help from my Friends', is my favorite. All the songs on the album are great, though."
"__BEATLES__ It's hard to think that the album recently celebrated it's fiftieth anniversary."
"__BEATLES__ It really is. Fifty years later and the music is still great."
