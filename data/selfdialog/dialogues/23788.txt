"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen Batman vs Superman yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I have and I loved it. Although I really thought Superman was going to win."
"__SUPERHERO__ I figured they wouldn't let either one of them win. But in reality if Batman didn't have the Kryptonite as a weapon it would have been all over for him, super suit or no."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's for sure. I never knew both their mothers names were Martha. That was a surprise."
"__SUPERHERO__ It was to me too. I didn't like Lex Luthor's son's role, played by Jesse Eisenberg. It's like he tried too hard to play crazy."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well I don't know, I think he did a pretty good job playing evil."
"__SUPERHERO__ He did ok but someone else could have done better. I loved the Wonder Woman cameos and how they're building up to The Justice League."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh I can't wait for that one. The Flash is my favorite DC character by far."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'd have to say mine is Superman. I mean, who can beat him?"
"__SUPERHERO__ You're right about that, but I feel that he can be a little selfish sometimes."
