"__POP__ The pop music industry is saying that Ed Sheeran's popularity is damaging to the music business."
"__POP__ How can popular music be bad for the business?"
"__POP__ His third album came out in March, and 16 of his songs were in the top 20. So they are saying this is bad for the other artists trying to get on the charts."
"__POP__ Well. if he's that popular, and everyone else isn't, it's not his fault."
"__POP__ A lot of it has to do with how they count sales with both streaming and sales. But now they are proposing a new rule."
"__POP__ Because of Ed Sheeran being popular?"
"__POP__ Yes, they are proposing a maximum of three singles by a lead artist in the singles chart."
"__POP__ That doesn't seem fair. If people like his music that much, he should be allowed all top 20 spots if he earns them."
"__POP__ Some people think because they don't add in things like youtube views, it doesn't properly reflect what people listen to."
"__POP__ Youtube shouldn't count, because it's not a sale, and sales are what the charts have always rated."
