"__MOVIES__ So, did you see Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, opening weekend!"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty amazing - Gal Gadot was wonderful."
"__MOVIES__ I agree! She's very talented. The action scenes were fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ She definitely brings a wide skill set to the roll."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know she was in the military?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I read she was a fight instructor in Israel. That's pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ Looking forward to seeing more of the character in other movies. Is she in Justice League?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! Really looking forward to that!"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, should be cool to see some more new characters too. I'm looking forward to Jason Momoa as Aquaman."
"__MOVIES__ Loved him on Game of Thrones. I've seen some of the promo material and his character looks pretty awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully the plot lives up to the concept. I haven't heard too much about what the movie is actually about."
"__MOVIES__ Me either, no idea who the villain is. Was Superman going to be in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really sure.. he's on some of the promo material, but as of the last movie he's.. well, dead."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, yes. They kinda have to take care of that first, don't they?"
"__MOVIES__ Then there's Batman and the Flash, of course. Not crazy about Affleck as batman."
"__MOVIES__ I thought he did ok in Batman vs. Superman. I mean, that movie as a whole was pretty bad, but I thought he did ok."
"__MOVIES__ Eh. He wasn't completely awful, but I have a hard time separating him from his other roles. Who's playing the Flash?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. I know it's not the same guy that plays him on tv, though."
