"__DISNEY__ I was thinking I should give Frozen another chance."
"__DISNEY__ You didn't like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I just couldn't really focus. I was on a plane and the kid behind me kept kicking my chair."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds really unpleasant!"
"__DISNEY__ It was! And now I can only remember the songs, really."
"__DISNEY__ Well, the songs were the important part."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but I always like the story of Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ I can understand that."
"__DISNEY__ Want to watch it together?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure!"
