"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to much local music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I grew up in a city with a long history of bands, so it would have been difficult to avoid it."
"__MUSIC__ Ah see I grew up in the country where the local music scene was some guy who would sing in the village pub."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I can't imagine growing up like that."
"__MUSIC__ So which city did you grow up in?"
"__MUSIC__ Glasgow in Scotland. There weren't many bands until punk, which seemed to have inspired a whole generation of kids."
"__MUSIC__ Now you mention it I can't think of any Glasgow or even Scottish groups from the '60s."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it's a real mystery. There was one group called The Poets who had a minor hit single but that's about it."
"__MUSIC__ So what about the bands when you were growing up, did you go to many gigs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I was tall for my age so I could pass for an adult when I was 15, at least enough to fool the doormen."
"__MUSIC__ 15! Did your parents not mind?"
"__MUSIC__ Oddly enough no, they were both musicians so they saw it as a good thing. And a lot of gigs at the time would go on until 2am!"
"__MUSIC__ That's amazing, my village would shut down at 7 o'clock!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I remember sleeping on the school bus the next day a lot. It was worth it though, I got to see lots of great stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Go on then, make me jealous."
"__MUSIC__ Well I grew up in the '80s so I got to see bands like Primal Scream, Teenage Fanclub and Jesus and Mary Chain when they were starting up."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love Primal Scream, I had no idea they'd been around for so long."
"__MUSIC__ They sounded a lot different in those days though, jangly guitars like the Byrds."
"__MUSIC__ Ah so more like the C86 stuff? That fits in with the timescale I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ Yes around that time, there was a lot of that stuff about! I blame The Pastels."
