"__STAR_WARS__ I thought Liam Neeson was in Star Wars, but I guess not."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, he was in some of the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one or ones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know he was in the Phantom Menace for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was Obi-Wan, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh no, Anakin hadn't befriended him at the time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then what was his name?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Qui-Gon Jinn I think."
"__STAR_WARS__ Man, I remember nothing about his character to be honest."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was kind of a boring Jedi honestly."
