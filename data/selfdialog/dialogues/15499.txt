"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just watched all of the Harry Potter movies for like, the 10th time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yea! I've probably watched them like 20 times. Which one is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hmm, I don't know, the first one is so classic and I love the original Dumbledore actor."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, he was so much more like the book character. But I think the last two movies are awesome."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, they did an amazing job. I feel like I'm one of the characters when I watch it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Totally. I think the hardest to watch is the Order of the Phoenix because of Dolores Umbridge."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ugh yes. The cats!! And all of the new rules..."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But Fred and George were hilarious in that one. The fireworks and flying through the testing hall was epic."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know! I love Fred and George!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too, they're hilarious."
