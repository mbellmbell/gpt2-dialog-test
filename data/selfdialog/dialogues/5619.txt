"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about Akikan killing all of the young Jedis?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's awful of course."
"__STAR_WARS__ But I mean, do you think that it is consistent with his character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, you don't obviously.   I mean, he is Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ But I thought it was the death of Padame and the thought of loosing his kids that drove him over the edge."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why did you think that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, when Darth Vader dies defending Luke, I kind of thought that the loose of family was what drove him nuts."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see your point. That the death of family is what drive him nuts."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the idea that his ambition was that blood thirsty was a bit out of characer."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but he was evil."
