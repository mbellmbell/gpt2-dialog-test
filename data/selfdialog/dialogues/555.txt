"__MUSIC__ This song reminds me of my job at the herb garden and of my Aggie."
"__MUSIC__ Agnes your Scottie? What song, you're wearing ear buds."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Agnes. It's World Spins Madly On by The Weepies."
"__MUSIC__ Love the Weepies! Why does it remind you of Aggie.?"
"__MUSIC__ Heard it the morning I woke up after she passed away. It was like a soundtrack to that moment."
"__MUSIC__ Made you sad. Those lyrics!"
"__MUSIC__ Mad me sad but the next song that came on was I Was Made For Sunny Days, so it's a happy sad sort of thing."
"__MUSIC__ Why the herb garden connection?"
"__MUSIC__ It's where I first heard the Weepies. We would listen to Pandora while we worked and they came into the mix."
"__MUSIC__ Oh Pandora is great! So I bet stuff like Ingrid Michaelson and Matt Nathanson was in the mix."
"__MUSIC__ Yes and even Shawn Colvin - now an oldie but goodie in many ways. Love her."
"__MUSIC__ I jumped aboard the Colvin train at Few Small Repairs - amazing album!"
"__MUSIC__ Agree. I came on board at the very beginning via my WCLZ listening in the 80s. Remember Diamond in the Rough?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! So I do know some earlier stuff probably. Speaking of 80s woman folksters - remember Tanita Tikaram?"
"__MUSIC__ Slice him up, slice him up poor cow! hahaha how could I forget! She was great. Wonder if she still records?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. I Googled a while back and it looked like she still tours anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Queen of the females in the genre is Joan Armatrading. I've seen her twice in concert. She still tours!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I read somewhere she says she will never retire."
"__MUSIC__ Hope she comes around here again. One of those artists whose music I will never tire of."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Show Some Emotion, Down to Zero, Love and Affection - soooo many classics."
