"__ROCK__ Favorite rock band of all time?"
"__ROCK__ Tough one. I would have to go with Nirvana."
"__ROCK__ Would you consider that rock? I was thinking that was more grunge."
"__ROCK__ I think grunge is subset of rock. Teen Spirit totally speaks to me."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, they are pretty good. I like Pearl Jam too."
"__ROCK__ I know they would be mortified but I kind of think of them as the same time period. Very similar."
"__ROCK__ They are but very different in their own right."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, same thing with Sound Garden and Radiohead."
"__ROCK__ Oh, I hadn't thought about them"
"__ROCK__ Yeah too many good ones. I would be lost without my music."
