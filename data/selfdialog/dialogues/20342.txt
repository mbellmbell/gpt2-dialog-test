"__MOVIES__ What do you mean why?"
"__MOVIES__ Woah, calm down. I was just wanting to know why."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I guess the text suggests I was annoyed at the question. I really was just trying to get you to clarify your question."
"__MOVIES__ Did the trailer turn you off from the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I did not see anything captivating in the trailer."

"__MOVIES__ That is good to know."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, just check it out."
"__MOVIES__ It's on netflix right?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, everything is on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ You are correct about that."
"__MOVIES__ I know I am."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I will check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You definitely should."
