"__ACTION__ Do you want to go see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?"
"__ACTION__ You know I do. I love an action packed Pirate movie!"
"__ACTION__ Me too. I wonder how it will hold up to the other ones."
"__ACTION__ I think they've done really well so far. Each Pirates of the Caribbean movie seems better than the last."
"__ACTION__ I don't know, I'm still a fan of the first one. I doubt anything will top that."
"__ACTION__ That's true, I feel like that was the first time Johnny Depp realized that deep down he is a pirate."
"__ACTION__ A Captain at that! He has started to look more piratey over the years."
"__ACTION__ He really has. He plays the role so well, its easy to get immersed in the movie."
"__ACTION__ I agree. I don't think anyone could do a better job than him."
"__ACTION__ Who knows, maybe one day we'll be reading about Johnny Depp, commandeering a boat!"
