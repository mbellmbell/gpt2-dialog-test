"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, what's going on?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, not much. What are you up to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nothing much. I was thinking about maybe going out tonight."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, really? Do you mean like a movie or something?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. I was thinking about going to a movie because everyone else went to that concert."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What were you thinking of seeing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't know. I'm not really sure what's out."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I haven't seen anything lately. I hear that Aliens movie is supposed to be good."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, really? Which one is that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's that one that's based on an old movie with Sigourney Weaver."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I never heard of it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, I'll avoid spoiling anything for you."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I appreciate it. You could tell me a little about the old one I guess."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, basically they're on a spaceship and they find out there's an alien on it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's actually full of suspense, drama and action, though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do they just fight the alien the whole time or something?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was more complex than that. Without giving too much away, there's a bit of mystery involved with finding out about the alien."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, wait. Was that the one where an alien pops out of someone's stomach or something like that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Exactly. It was really well done and really drew the viewer into the experience of being on the spaceship."
