"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, do you keep up with NFL football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I used to, not anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's too bad, why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too much drama."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean all the steroids and cheating and stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, but you don't really think they use steroids do you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course they do, have you seen the size of them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not proof though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not. But in any case, it's just too violent of a sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that's why people love it. It;s about being tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea well being tough gives a bunch of guys fatal concussions before the age of 50."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they get paid a lot of money to do it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but it's just not something I want to be promoting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I love it, the comradery, the athleticism, the sportsmanship, all of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, you're right, there are a lot of good aspects to it too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, you should give it another chance, it's not going anywhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe you're right. Who's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, then. So do I."
