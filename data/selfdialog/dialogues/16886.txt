"__MOVIES__ They're doing another Friday movie."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously. Ice Cube confirmed it last night."
"__MOVIES__ That's the best news I've heard all day. Is Chris Tucker in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Ice Cube didn't go into any details."
"__MOVIES__ If Tucker's not reprising his role as Smokey, then I'm not going to get too excited."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right? The last few Fridays weren't as good as the original."
"__MOVIES__ Tucker made that movie. Can you imagine it being as popular without him?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. But don't get your hopes up on him returning."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard he was looking for more serious roles and not comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Is that why we haven't seen him in a movie since Rush Hour?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. He still does stand up comedy, though."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like Chris has been typecasted."
"__MOVIES__ If that's true he may as well return for another Friday movie. He needs the work."
"__MOVIES__ What's the name of the new movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Last Friday."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds final."
"__MOVIES__ It will be for me if Chris isn't in it."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that."
