"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, I know we both like the Bucs, so I was wondering if you wanted to go to a NFL game? My treat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be awesome, but what game would you be interested in seeing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I guess we could both figure that out now.  What other team do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Panthers. What other team do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Miami; both the Florida teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha Ha. Miami?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is so funny?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Miami is horrible, I don't even know why they are still a NFL team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is your opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year, their game stat was 10-6."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, that does not mean that they did not improve, since last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not saying that, but do you remember how bad they lose. Remember the game between them and the Ravens 6-38."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I must say, 'that was a big ouch,' but the other losses were not that bad. Maybe only a 12 to 15 point deficit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you have to admit, they don't give much of a game to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, okay, then what team would you want to see the Bucs play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about not choosing any of the teams we both like."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay that sounds fair, so I'm just going to say a team and you agree or disagree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, let me hear it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ New Orleans Saints should give us a good game to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good to me, I agree."
