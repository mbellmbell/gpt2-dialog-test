"__MUSIC__ Do you like One Republic?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, yeah, some of their stuff, why?"
"__MUSIC__ I just wondered, I figured out the other day that I liked more of their songs than I realized."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah?  What made you realize that?"
"__MUSIC__ I was listening to some pop hits thing and a song of theirs came on, Counting Stars, and I liked it and then i thought about it and realized that I liked at least a few songs off each of their albums."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that like with every group you like?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really, there are only a few groups or singers that I like the majority of their songs and a few more that I like some of the songs.  For most, I only like a couple of songs"
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  Do you like all of the songs for every group or singer you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Not all, most for my favorites.  But for the ones I say I like, usually a few off each album."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like about three Rolling Stones songs enough to know the words and I can only ever think of two Metallica songs."
"__MUSIC__ Three Rolling Stones songs, huh?  Maybe they're just not to your taste."
"__MUSIC__ I do like pop a lot, but you know it's the same with Beyonce or Ed Sheeran and they have a lot of songs that are popular."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, okay.  So who do you like enough to like most of their songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, the Beach Boys maybe."
"__MUSIC__ The Beach Boys?  Okay, aren't the songs mostly about surfing?"
"__MUSIC__ They have a fair few songs about surfing and some about cars and some about other stuff."
"__MUSIC__ You don't surf, though, do you?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but they are fun songs. You don't have to do something to enjoy a song about it."
"__MUSIC__ I guess, but it helps."
