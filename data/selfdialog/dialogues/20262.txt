"__MOVIES__ We're thinking of having a Men in Black party. Want to come?"
"__MOVIES__ Men in Black? What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ You don't remember? It was a big movie franchise in the nineties."
"__MOVIES__ I'm drawing a blank here."
"__MOVIES__ Will Smith was in it? He works for an agency that fights aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Okay. I just didn't know the title."
"__MOVIES__ So are you in?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that sounds like fun. Do I need to bring anything special."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I was thinking of having everyone wear suits."
"__MOVIES__ That could be fun!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Anyway, we'll double feature the first two of them."
"__MOVIES__ How many are there?"
"__MOVIES__ Three, and an animated TV show."
"__MOVIES__ Is there any way we could start early and watch all of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. Would you be willing to bring dinner?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's just get take out!"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Okay. I could go for that."
"__MOVIES__ Then next week we can do a movie night at my place."
"__MOVIES__ What will we watch?"
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking Homeward Bound!"
