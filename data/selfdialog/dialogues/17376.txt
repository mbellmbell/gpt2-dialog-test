"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite musical comedy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I have two favorites - I can't pick between them."
"__MOVIES__ What's the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Singing' in the Rain, with Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that's a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure it's on a lot of people's 'best' lists. It is just an amazingly perfect, funny, romantic, musical movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have any favorite moments in the film?"
"__MOVIES__ When Donald O'Connor sings Make 'Em Laugh. It's a great song for him, he shows off his dancing, he walks up walls, it's awesome."
"__MOVIES__ It was Debbie Reynolds' breakout film, wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ She was very young, and Gene Kelly worked her hard, but she kept up with him and Donald, which is saying something."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Jean Hagan as Don Lockwood's screechy ditzy costar."
"__MOVIES__ She was the best! And even though she's kinda dumb, she is very savvy about her career, and she has even the heads of the studio over a barrel for much of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What's your other favorite comedy musical?"
"__MOVIES__ The Court Jester, with Danny Kaye and Glynis Johns. It's far and away my favorite Danny Kaye film."
"__MOVIES__ 'The pellet with the poison's in the vessel with the pestle...'"
"__MOVIES__ See, everybody knows The Court Jester."
"__MOVIES__ He has great co-stars - Basil Rathbone is the bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ There is an amazing sword fight between them toward the end. It sends up all the great swashbuckler battles, but at the same time, it's a great sword fight on its own."
"__MOVIES__ Danny Kaye's ability with trick lyrics is legendary."
"__MOVIES__ His wife Sylvia Fine wrote all of his numbers, to show him off in the best way. The Court Jester does just that."
