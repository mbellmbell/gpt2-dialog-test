"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't realize that Disney had readapted Winnie the Pooh in 2011!"
"__STAR_WARS__ How did you miss it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was out of the country that year. I guess it wasn't released or promoted very much in the country I was in."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm. That's surprising to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Was it any good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it okay. Winnie the Pooh is always such a heartwarming story."
"__STAR_WARS__ It brings me right back to my childhood. I think I'm going to rent it tonight."
"__STAR_WARS__ You should. And you know what you should have as a snack while you watch it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?"
"__STAR_WARS__ A big pot of honey!"
