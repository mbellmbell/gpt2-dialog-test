"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the new Drake album?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean More Life? I have only heard 'Fake Love' on my car radio on the way to work."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think of it?"
"__MUSIC__ I liked it. Is the rest of the album as catchy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Drake uses a lot of house beats."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds interesting."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds cool, but some have complained that Drake is appropriating Dancehall."
"__MUSIC__ You can argue he was just inspired."
"__MUSIC__ Is it true he uses a fake accent?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I suppose that part is a bit problematic. But over all, the music sounds good."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of the car radio, have you heard of 'Goosebumps'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I don't like it very much. Isn't it by Kendrick Lamar?"
"__MUSIC__ It's by Travis Scott but Kendrick Lamar features in it."
"__MUSIC__ Kendrick's part in the song sounds very silly."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ He reuses the same melody in two of his other songs."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, I have noticed that too. I wonder why?"
"__MUSIC__ Me too. He's talented, but he's made some very questionable music."
"__MUSIC__ You can't blame an artist for their worst songs, I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right. Let's celebrate them for their hits."
