"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about Durant's move to Golden State"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it's one of the weakest moves I have ever seen"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, you know it's bad when I agree with Stephen A. Smith"
"__BASKETBALL__ My thoughts exactly. He could have went anywhere else."
"__BASKETBALL__ And then to go to the team that you should have beaten last year!"
"__BASKETBALL__ The team that won 73 games without you!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I don't recall a player ever doing something like that before"
"__BASKETBALL__ Me neither. I mean guys have played with other superstars, but not like this"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah this was a trash move and professionally I have lost some respect for him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah me too. I think this was a move just so he can say that he was a champion."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I think he was scared that he would never get a championship in his career"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. Very weak on his part. He could have carved a legacy had he won with the thunder"
"__BASKETBALL__ In golden state he's just a piece of the puzzle"
"__BASKETBALL__ I definitely feel like this move is showing a character flaw for Durant"
"__BASKETBALL__ Even if he had went somewhere else, I would have been cool with it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah me too. Just not the team that didn't need you anyway"
"__BASKETBALL__ He will probably get this ring, but it will be tainted"
"__BASKETBALL__ Absolutely. Most people will not forget this."
"__BASKETBALL__ This takes away from his legacy not add to it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Someone should have told him that before he signed on the dotted line."
