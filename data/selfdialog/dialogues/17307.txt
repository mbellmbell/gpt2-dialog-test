"__MOVIES__ Did you know that the movie  'Annabella' is based on a true story?"
"__MOVIES__ is it really? I didn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ Apparently they have a museum with the real doll there."
"__MOVIES__ That would freak me out to have a demon doll around, even in a glass case."
"__MOVIES__ It has a warning sign on it to never open the case."
"__MOVIES__ Who would want a homicidal doll?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess folks that don't believe it. I have trouble believing a doll is possessed by a demon."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that in the movie, she would keep coming back even if they through it out."
"__MOVIES__ one time they even burn it, still showed back up."
"__MOVIES__ That had to be someone messing with someone else."
"__MOVIES__ Probably, but still its creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, but I wonder why people kept it around in the first place?"
"__MOVIES__ Who knows, maybe they planned to use it somehow."
"__MOVIES__ For what? revenge?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea, but the movie itself, was a good flix to watch at home, in theatres not so much."
"__MOVIES__ Why not watch it in Theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ It was too cliche for me to spend money to watch in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ So it is not a good date movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It is just captivating enough to watch, but again its a better Netflix and chill movie."
"__MOVIES__ I will just wait for Netflix to release it."
