"__MUSIC__ Hey James, have you ever listened to drake, he is a hip hop artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Hey Manoj, No I am not into hip hop music. Why you listen to drake?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he is fantastic, he wrote a bunch of hits recently, and the ladies love his music. Why don't you like hip-hop?"
"__MUSIC__ Hip hop makes my head hurt from all of the loud bass that comes out of the speakers?"
"__MUSIC__ Really, I did not know you don't like bass. What type of music do you listen to then?"
"__MUSIC__ I love classical music, like Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach. Have you ever listened to classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ I listened to classical music when I was in high school, but everyone thought I was a nerd and I never had any girls trying to hang out with me."
"__MUSIC__ So the only reason you listen to Drake and hip-hop is because you want women to like you?"
"__MUSIC__ No that is not entirely true, I like hip hop because of the complex rhyme structure, the creative use of metaphors, and I of course love the bass, especially when I am driving, I like to blast the bass music"
"__MUSIC__ That is interesting that you like to blast the bass when you are driving. Do the passengers in your car like to hear the bass booming?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes when I am with a new girl and I am trying to have some fun, I like to blast the bass and listen to gangster rap to the girls reaction"
"__MUSIC__ How does the girl typically react when you blast the bass in your car?"
"__MUSIC__ Well there was this one time I was blasting DMX and the girl was so impressed that she would want me to pick her up after school each day so we could listen to DMX"
"__MUSIC__ Wow you are the man!! What if you tried playing Beethoven or mozart for her, do you think she would enjoy that?"
"__MUSIC__ Dude, she would probably run home, log into facebook, and announce how much of a loser I am to all of her hot friends."
"__MUSIC__ But Beethoven and Mozart are so talented, they composed symphonies that have shaped so many minds and influenced individuals to pursue their dreams."
"__MUSIC__ Thats great and all, but I think women like music that makes them feel wild and ready to party. I do not think Beethoven and Mozart are going to make any one want to have a little fun tonight"
"__MUSIC__ Perhaps you are right, when I listen to Beethoven and Mozart I end up studying astrophysics, math, chemistry, and x-ray crystallography"
"__MUSIC__ Thats so sad, next time you should put on some Drake or Nicki Minaj and go try and pick up a girl."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes my cat sits in my lap and listens to moonlight sonata with me, that is all the companionship I can handle at this point, my mom doesn't want me to have a girl friend"
