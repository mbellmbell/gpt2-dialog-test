"__MUSIC__ Do you still listen to Project 86?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure do!"
"__MUSIC__ I got one of their albums if you want it. I mean if you don't already."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ Knives to the Future."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, no I don't have it, but I'd love to take it off your hands."
"__MUSIC__ No problem. Have you ever read Andrew Schwab's poetry?"
"__MUSIC__ The lead singer? No I haven't but I want to."
"__MUSIC__ He's a very talented guy, not just musically it turns out."
"__MUSIC__ Well I know he's talented musically. I love what he does with his voice and the texture of his voice itself."
"__MUSIC__ The texture?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's slightly scratchy, but thick and he always sounds like he's singing around something in his mouth."
"__MUSIC__ That's a way to describe it."
"__MUSIC__ I really like it. Do you have a favourite P86 song?"
"__MUSIC__ I like spy hunter. It was the first P86 song I remember hearing."
"__MUSIC__ It's a classic. I like Pipe Dreams myself."
"__MUSIC__ That's one of their mellower songs."
"__MUSIC__ I like it because it has a great rhythm, it sounds so dark and dreamlike."
"__MUSIC__ It's definitely dark if you listen to what's being said in the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, 'and outside my window the demons are singing' is about as dark as it gets."
