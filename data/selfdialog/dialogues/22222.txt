"__DISNEY__ You know what's a good movie?  Lady and the Tramp."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah!"
"__DISNEY__ I hope they don't remake it anytime soon.  Leave it how it was."
"__DISNEY__ Seems like it would be hard to remake that into a live-action version."
"__DISNEY__ It would be all CGI."
"__DISNEY__ There's been enough talking dog movies."
"__DISNEY__ Up had a talking dog."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but that was animated.  This would be total-CGI."
"__DISNEY__ Some things are better left never remade and that's one of them."
"__DISNEY__ Agree 100% with you."
