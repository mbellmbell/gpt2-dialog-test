"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know, the first time Harry goes the the Weasleys' house in the Chamber of Secrets, it looks like he feels like he is probably home."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, it's so homey and comfortable messy in the Burrow. They did a great job on the set design."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And Mrs Weasley is the perfect mother figure, even if she yells at her kids a lot."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Mr Weasley balances her out. He doesn't care if his kids fly a car or not."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He thinks it's really cool actually."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And he's a supportive father even as his kids go off to fight Voldemort."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He's just crushed when Fred dies, though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They all are. Fred was an integral part of the family."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Imagine George making a joke after his death. It just wouldn't be the same."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They'd still be homey and welcoming, but they'd be missing something."
