"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Orioles game yesterday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I thought my TV color was messed up because everything looked pink."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, It took me a minute to realize they were actually wearing pink for Mother's Day."
"__BASEBALL__ Kind of a disappointing loss."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, had them down 5-0 at one point."
"__BASEBALL__ Yup, All it takes is one big inning."
"__BASEBALL__ Still can't believe they got swept."
"__BASEBALL__ Right, especially after blowing the save vs the Nats right before this series"
"__BASEBALL__ I think we've only lost like 2 series all year"
"__BASEBALL__ Still feels like we are slumping big time"
"__BASEBALL__ That could change when Britton gets back"
"__BASEBALL__ I never thought having a shutdown closer was so important"
"__BASEBALL__ Now you know what the Nationals feel like lol"
"__BASEBALL__ Davis had a big shot yesterday"
"__BASEBALL__ Hopefully he's getting his groove back"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I was starting to get worried about him."
"__BASEBALL__ He's not a liability defensively but he's not living up to his reputation right now"
"__BASEBALL__ Eh, we've got enough people in the line-up who can put the ball in play that we can afford a HR lull from time to time."
"__BASEBALL__ Schoop is turning into one of the most reliable players we have."
"__BASEBALL__ Yup, that's why Buck has him batting 2nd.  I wouldn't be surprised if he or Manny take Hardy's spot as short next year."
