"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you ever feel bad for Draco Malfoy?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ All of the time! He is my favorite character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He was just trying to make his parents happy!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And not get killed by Voldemort!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yes that too. He did a good job with that!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And in the end his mom saved Harry!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah when she said he was dead when he really wasn't!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She just wanted her son to be okay. They weren't all that evil."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But Voldemort and Bellatrix are truly evil."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They kill all the good people!"
