"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know you love Harry Potter. Is there anything in the movies better than the books?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well for one the music. It might seem a small thing but it really adds to it especially the song 'Double Double Toil And Trouble!'"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love music so that sounds about right. Anything else?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course! The Hungarian Horntail dragon in the books stays close to her next. Not in the movies and it is a great scene!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which movie was that one?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's the book and the movie The Goblet of Fire."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which order is that one in?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's actually the fourth book and movie in the series."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But I should still watch in order and look for all the extras right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, you won't regret the time, I promise!"
