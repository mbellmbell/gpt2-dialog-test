"__ROCK__ Slightly. I never got into grunge."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, but they transformed the music industry."
"__ROCK__ I wouldn't go that far."
"__ROCK__ Really, the destroyed hair rock."
"__ROCK__ Well hair bands are on their way back?"
"__ROCK__ I haven't heard that."
"__ROCK__ Well, I just went to a hair band tribute band the other night. It was rockin'."
"__ROCK__ Well a tribute band is something different. It's not a legitimate band."
"__ROCK__ I still think it's legit."
