"__MOVIES__ Hey Bob, can I join you for lunch?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah sure! I'm actually checking out what movie I would like to see this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I can recommend a good movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ Me and my wife went to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2!"
"__MOVIES__ What? I didn't even like the first one!"
"__MOVIES__ No no! You are mistaken my friend.. Vin Diesel does the voice for the Baby Groot! Its so funny"
"__MOVIES__ Umm I'm still not sure"
"__MOVIES__ And Bradley Cooper does the voice for Rocket the Raccoon!"
"__MOVIES__ I never understood why a Raccoon was in space!"
"__MOVIES__ Well just go and see it and you will not be disappointed.. at least take the kids!"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm ok but first I will have to watch the first part."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah try to rent it on netflix or hulu before you go otherwise you will be lost."
"__MOVIES__ I also don't know if my kids are into it also"
"__MOVIES__ Ask them! If not there are other movies out that you can see"
"__MOVIES__ Ok will ask them when I get home."
"__MOVIES__ It may turn out that you are the only one in your house that has not seen guardian of the galaxy one!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it could be!"
"__MOVIES__ Anyways good luck with your movie weekend!"
"__MOVIES__ I will thanks for the advice!"
