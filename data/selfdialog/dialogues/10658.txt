"__FASHION__ I need help choosing a dress for the wedding next weekend. Can you go shopping with me on Friday?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, sure! I love shopping for dresses! What time do you want to go?"
"__FASHION__ Around five. I'll pick you up."
"__FASHION__ Sounds great! So, are you thinking about using a long dress or short dress?"
"__FASHION__ Well, I'm not quite sure but I think a long dress will look more elegant, considering the occasion. Don't you think?"
"__FASHION__ True. Long dresses do look more elegant but a short dress will draw more attention from the single bachelors!"
"__FASHION__ Oh yeah! I didn't think about that! Maybe I should buy a short dress instead."
"__FASHION__ Do you have a nice high heel pair of shoes?"
"__FASHION__ Uhm, I have a pair of shoes with heels but they're not very high."
"__FASHION__ Oh no, you'd better pick me up at three. We're going to have to go shoe shopping too!"
"__FASHION__ But I wasn't planning on buying shoes too!"
"__FASHION__ You cannot wear a short sexy dress with low heels! Short dresses draw attention to your legs!"
"__FASHION__ This wedding invitation is becoming expensive. Maybe I just won't go..."
"__FASHION__ No, no, no. Relax! I know a great store for dresses that always has good sales."
"__FASHION__ Don't you have a dress or a pair of shoes I can borrow? You go out a lot."
"__FASHION__ Actually, yeah, I do! Now that I think about it, I have the perfect dress for you!"
"__FASHION__ What color is it?"
"__FASHION__ It's a sassy red! It'll look great on you!"
"__FASHION__ Are you sure? Sassy red? That sounds a bit extravagant for me, don't you think?"
"__FASHION__ Don't worry. Leave it to me. Come on over tonight after work."
