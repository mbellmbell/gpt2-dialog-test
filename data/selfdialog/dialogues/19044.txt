"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Princess Bride?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is one of my favorite movies of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Why is it your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh gosh, probably the dry and obvious humor. That guy, Vizzini, has the funniest lines. And his laugh gets me every time."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard it has some romance aspects, too. Would it be a good date movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, actually! There is an element of romance in it, although it is comedic and overdone."
"__MOVIES__ So it has sort of a Monty Python vibe?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but sort of tamer and with more famous actors."
"__MOVIES__ Which actors are the most famous ones from that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It has to be a cross between Robin Wright and Andre the Giant."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Robin Wright on that new Netflix series, House of Cards?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think she is a classic actress. The same actress who played Jennie in Forest Gump."
"__MOVIES__ Neato. What are your favorite lines from the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably when Vizzini is challenging Wesley to a battle of wits."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's supposed to be an epic scene for this movie. Sort of like Russian roulette only with poison."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the rediculous part is that the 'iocane powder' actually kills the guy who pours the wine."
"__MOVIES__ How does that happen?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Wesley, one of the main characters, has been apparently building a resistance to the drug for years."
"__MOVIES__ Weird. Yeah, this movie seems like a hit. I think I will check it out when I have my date."
"__MOVIES__ You won't be disappointed! Good luck, bro."
