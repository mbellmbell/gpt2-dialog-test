"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite movie genre?"
"__MOVIES__ That's would have to be action movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Really, why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Becuase I like seeing the good guy pound the stuffing out of the bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ Good versus evil, I get that. Any particular type of action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'd have too say martial arts action movies or ones with martial arts scenes in them."
"__MOVIES__ So, you literally like to see the good guy pound the bad guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but hey what about you? What kind of action movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I tend to prefer shoot'em ups, with plenty of firefights and explosions."
"__MOVIES__ So, westerns, crime thrillers, and war movies, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much, but I prefer World War II movies as far as the war movies go."
"__MOVIES__ Really, any particular reason?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, WWII films have a clear cut division between good and bad. Allied powers are generally good, while the Axis is almost always evil."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I can see that, but what about the Korea war or Vietnam. Plenty of good war movies made about them."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but both tend to have much darker tones to them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you got me there, both were a lot more morally ambigious than WW2."
"__MOVIES__ So, what's would be your favorite WWII film? Mine is Patton."
"__MOVIES__ Really, mine is Patton as well."
"__MOVIES__ Huh, why do you like it? I like the fact is based of a book written Omar Bradly, a man who actually knew and worked with Patton."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Between that and the technical advisor and a numbner of actor who actually served during the war, you get a pretty accurate picture, as least what they were allowed to show you."
