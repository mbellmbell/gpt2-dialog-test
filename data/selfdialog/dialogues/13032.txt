"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you as excited as I am for the upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck yeah! I miss football"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope the Broncos do better this season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, last season was a big let down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! especially coming off our superbowl win the previous season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone doesn't think we're as good as the chiefs or raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just like how Von lost out on defensive player of the year last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just because we didn't make the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll prove them wrong this year. Von sounds motivated losing both the sack title and defensive player of the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hungry Von is best Von. Im not worried about our defense though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they always ball out. We got a lot of questions on offense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. We definitely need to improve everything on offense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hope who ever wins the starting qb job does good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah theres a really good battle during training camp"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess thomas and sanders both are backing Siemian."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I hope that extra year helps him out. Lynch has the better tools"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I would love to see the Broncos toss bomb down field again. To stretch the field"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah as long as our line play is better we should be good. And a run game would help"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets hope Anderson and Charles stay healthy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets hope everyone stays healthy!"
