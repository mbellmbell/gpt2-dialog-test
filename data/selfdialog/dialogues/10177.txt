"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Did you hear Lupe Fiasco's newest cd?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, when did that come out?  He's not one of my favorite rappers so I don't really keep up with him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It came out this February.  It's called Drogas Light."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is it any good?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I liked it.  The song Promise was definitely the best I thought.  I heard the album was a lot of old songs he had written and reworked."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So its not really new stuff?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Apparently only a few songs are new, the rest were stuff he had thought of previously but didn't really get around to recording."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's kind of lame.  I thought his best album was Lasers so far."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That one was good but I thought only one or two songs were really worthy of being singles."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ My favorite was The Show Goes On.  That one was all over the radio."
