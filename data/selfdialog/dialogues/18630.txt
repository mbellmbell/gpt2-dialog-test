"__MOVIES__ How many actresses are in LA you think?"
"__MOVIES__ A lot. just look at all the waitresses around Hollywood"
"__MOVIES__ I mean in terms of numbers, thousands? Tens of thousands?"
"__MOVIES__ This type of questions belong in The census bureau. Why don't you ask them?"
"__MOVIES__ So you don't know"
"__MOVIES__ of course I don't know. I have no idea. But! But! I do know how to estimate it."
"__MOVIES__ Alright smart guy, how do you estimate the number of movie actresses in LA?"
"__MOVIES__ There are about 135K people in SAG-AFTRA or screen actor's guild-American Federation of Television and Radio artists."
"__MOVIES__ That's liek total number of people who has a union membership in those."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I'm not done. Of those, we can estimate about 80% of the work is done in LA"
"__MOVIES__ which gives you, what? About a hundred thousand?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but not all of them are currently acting 'actors' We can see another 80% are out of work 'actors'"
"__MOVIES__ So that gives you about 20k people."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. And say about half are women, so we probably have about 10 thousand actresses vying for jobs in LA /Hollywood area"
"__MOVIES__ And you think why making it is so hard."
"__MOVIES__ Imagine 10K competition for a one position. Of course it won't be as bad as that"
"__MOVIES__ Might as well be though. A pool of 10 thousand people is still a big pool."
"__MOVIES__ Even if just 100 people apply for one position, you have 1% chance."
"__MOVIES__ And 100 is just 1% of 10K. So you literally have to be 1% of 1% to make it."
"__MOVIES__ That's some tough work. Makes you want to respect actresses."
