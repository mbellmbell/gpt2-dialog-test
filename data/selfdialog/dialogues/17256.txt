"__MOVIES__ Did you like those Jurassic Park movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I did. I remember thinking the first one was so good."
"__MOVIES__ I know. The dinosaurs looked so real!"
"__MOVIES__ I loved seeing the veloceraptors. I couldn't get enough about them. I started reading about them anywhere I could."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the ones in the movie were so wicked. The way they worked together."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Talk about a crazy predator."
"__MOVIES__ I do think that one was the best. The ones after were entertaining, but kind of expected."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Plus I can't remember any of the people in the ones after Sam Neil."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's the reason I went to see Hunt for the Wilder People."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that. Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It was totally different kind of movie. He plays a grouchy old man and it's kind of a coming of age movie."
"__MOVIES__ He's always been a good a actor. I might have to go see."
"__MOVIES__ The movie takes place in New Zealand and the kid is this really chubby kid. He is funny when he doesn't mean it."
"__MOVIES__ I think I saw the trailer for that. I'll have to stream it some where."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the kid's name Julian Denison. I think he's done a few movies."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't he in Paper Planes?"
"__MOVIES__ Not sure, but I've started watching some of these foreign films like that when I can find them. I think they are amusing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Muriel's Wedding was one of those. It's old but it's pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that. That was an old one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but sometime those are better than the new ones. Some new movies are just too slick."
