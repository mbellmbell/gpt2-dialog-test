"__MOVIES__ The new Stephen King looks so creepy."
"__MOVIES__ What movie are you talking about, Dark Tower?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm talking about It."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, the remake!"
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  I remember seeing the miniseries on TV."
"__MOVIES__ I think this one's quite a bit different."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't believe in this one, any of them grow up."
"__MOVIES__ You mean they are kids throughout the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's what I heard, but again, not 100% sure."
"__MOVIES__ That's an interesting take.  I actually preferred them as kids in the first one."
"__MOVIES__ The clown is so creepy."
"__MOVIES__ All clowns are creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but dial that creepiness up 1000% for this one."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think they'll switch the ending around?"
"__MOVIES__ I imagine they might revise it somewhat."
"__MOVIES__ Probably to leave it open-ended for future films?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  A lot of these low-budget horror movies do that since they are cheap to make and box office gold."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'll go see it and midnight and scare myself to death."
"__MOVIES__ I'll be right there with you."
