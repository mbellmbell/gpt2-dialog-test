"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of the newest Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was enjoying it up to the point where Han's own son murdered him. I was outta there after that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, aren't they trying to do Darth Vader 2.0? He has to be really evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't care. There's very little reason for me to watch the rest of the series anymore, without Han."
"__STAR_WARS__ C'mon, characgers die. There's still Luke, he looks pretty cool with that beard and stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ If Harrison wanted out of the franchise, there were SO many more satisfying ways to do it than to get offed by his son."
"__STAR_WARS__ But this was the worst way, and that's probably why they did it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Fine, you can have evil Han Jr. I'll go watch the original trilogy again and be much happier."
"__STAR_WARS__ But...Leia. Carrie Fisher's last film. You have to see that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose I will, eventually, when it comes out on DVD. So I can scan to the Leia scenes and wish Carrie well."
