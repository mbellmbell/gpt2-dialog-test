"__MOVIES__ What do you think of the new Cars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the trailer for that recently!"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think after seeing it?"
"__MOVIES__ It looks way better than the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I’m glad they are going back to the original storyline."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, the second movie was not that good."
"__MOVIES__ I didn’t like it either."
"__MOVIES__ Putting the focus on Light McQueen is the better decision."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the accident in the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did! Lightning McQueen’s crash looked brutal!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! I got worried after seeing it. Do you think he is going to die or something?"
"__MOVIES__ I don’t know. I think he might retire."
"__MOVIES__ It would be sad if he did."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, or maybe it’s going to be some kind of redemption story line."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think you’re going to watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ I might! The animation looks amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! Pixar did a really good job!"
"__MOVIES__ They did! It looks photo-realistic."
"__MOVIES__ I know! It really looks like a live action film."
"__MOVIES__ I can’t wait to see it on the big screen!"
