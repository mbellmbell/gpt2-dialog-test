"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Arrrgh, I need a metric for predicting these games!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is none. We go back to the human events and its randomness. if it's played by the computers using bad random number generators, then it can be predicted"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marsaglia published a paper saying the random numbers fall mainly in the planes in the 60s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, so if we ARE to uise a poor random number to play football, then you can.. Ok I see it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Besides, we don't want to be able to predict football. It's a game. We need that element of surprise, the human victory over the expectation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah the drama of football"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Indeed.Without that, there is no rooting for the underdog, and football without the underdog's triumph is just not the same"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unless, we can predict the underdog's triumph."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if Minnesota got any new running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? Do they need an RB?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're the dead last in terms of rushing yards. They averaged 75 yards/game rushing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's like half of Cowboys which is 149"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Oh. They picked up Dalvin Cook."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cook is a beast!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had over 1700 rushing yards as a senior"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Vikings made a good choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, maybe they'll get more rushing yards now."
