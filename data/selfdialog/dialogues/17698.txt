"__MOVIES__ Have you seen LaLa Land?"
"__MOVIES__ I did see LaLa Land!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you enjoy it? I know a lot of people were saying negative things during and after the Oscars. It was crazy."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, that was pretty crazy. Yes, I did enjoy LaLa Land. I liked Moonlight too, though, and I'm glad it won at the Oscars."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought Moonlight was a really good movie, too."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part of LaLa Land?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the opening scene, actually!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the opening scene was great, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it really reminded me of scenes in, some of the Broadway musicals I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ I can definitely see that! I thought it was very theatrical, as well, though."
"__MOVIES__ It was very theatrical, I agree. Are there any other movies you've seen in the last year that you thought were good?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I recently saw Colossal and I thought that movie was good."
"__MOVIES__ I think I've heard of that movie but I can't remember what it's about."
"__MOVIES__ It is basically about a girl who finds out that she is accidentally controlling this godzilla-type monster that keeps attacking Korea."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that sounds really funny and interesting, maybe a little weird. Who is in that movie again?"
