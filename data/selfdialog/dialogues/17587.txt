"__MOVIES__ I want to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I saw the first one and it was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't even seen the first one."
"__MOVIES__ You haven't?!"
"__MOVIES__ Believe it or not, I haven't!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you should definitely see it before you see the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Ok."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, you don't have to, but, it's super fun and you'll get the characters more and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ That's how it usually is."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the dude who plays starlord is hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Looks like it."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, so when do you want to go see the second one?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. You've kind of got me wanting to see the first one first."
"__MOVIES__ Makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ Where should I see the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know online somewhere."
"__MOVIES__ Netflix?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. It's a big movie. I'm sure it's online somewhere."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, and then after you watch that we'll go watch the second one!"
