"__MOVIES__ What do you think of all the superhero movies these days?"
"__MOVIES__ I like them a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Hit and miss for me."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I really like the Marvel stuff, but DC seems a little weak."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like Batman vs. Superman."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right!?"
"__MOVIES__ I was keeping a Batman bodycount through the entire thing."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see hi kill anyone...."
"__MOVIES__ Not directly. But the people he 'branded' for instance."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ He would brand criminals and when they went to jail they'd be killed."
"__MOVIES__ Oh!"
"__MOVIES__ Not only that, there was this huge chase scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remeber...."
"__MOVIES__ I counted everyone that would have been colateral damage in Batman's wake."
"__MOVIES__ I hadn't thought of that."
"__MOVIES__ DC really got some work to do."
"__MOVIES__ I guess if they want to compete with Marvel...."
