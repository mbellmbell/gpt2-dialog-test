"__MUSIC__ OK, favorite Smashing Pumpkins album."
"__MUSIC__ Oh definitely Siamese Dream. How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it always comes with a caveat, but Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That second disc though..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, well, that's the caveat. Taking it from the first side only, it's a fantastic, epic alternative album that sums up the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ I somehow know what you mean though. It felt like the albums Gish and Siamese Dream built toward that."
"__MUSIC__ There's so many great songs and it's arranged so well as an album. Then the second disc..."
"__MUSIC__ ...falls apart. I know. But it did have 1979."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and it's one of the best songs on the album, buried on the second side."
"__MUSIC__ I will say that's a song that I really think sums up my teen years in the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ See, I'm talking you into it!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, no, I still say Siamese Dream is the best. Mellon Collie definitely has its strengths. But an album must be taken as a whole."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I see you're point. But I stand by my decision."
"__MUSIC__ Sure. But isn't it odd? Billy Corgan was such a perfectionist - how he didn't perfect this album is so surprised."
"__MUSIC__ I heard he teed off on Jimmy Chamberlain and James Iha."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, all the time. He was a nightmare to work with, it sounds like."
"__MUSIC__ And Corgan has been pretty much insufferable since then."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's mad that he didn't win a Grammy. He never will now. His stuff sucks."
"__MUSIC__ I guess he was a man for his time."
"__MUSIC__ And what a time it was."
