"__FASHION__ Want to help me design a dress for a competition I'm going to be in?"
"__FASHION__ Sure. Any special criteria?"
"__FASHION__ No. It can be any dress."
"__FASHION__ How about doing something with these cool watermelon shaped buttons I have?"
"__FASHION__ Those are so cool? Where did they come from?"
"__FASHION__ I saw them at a craft shop but never used them after I bought them. You may have them."
"__FASHION__ Thanks so much. They're so cute."
"__FASHION__ You're welcome. Let's do a red dress with some kind of black trim and those buttons."
"__FASHION__ That sounds amazing."
"__FASHION__ Do you actually sew it or just design it?"
"__FASHION__ You actually make it."
"__FASHION__ Let's use something summery then, a light fabric."
"__FASHION__ I agree. Watermelon is a summer thing."
"__FASHION__ Yes. Want to go to the store for the materials together?"
"__FASHION__ Yes. The deadline is in 30 days."
"__FASHION__ I can go whenever."
"__FASHION__ We need material and something for the black trim."
"__FASHION__ Not lace."
"__FASHION__ No, maybe just another kind of material."
"__FASHION__ This is going to be the cutest dress."
