"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite color Lightsaber?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the purple one Mace Windu had."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's a good one - I kind of liked County Dooku's curved handle."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader's red is always classic too."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder who came up with the idea for Darth Maul's double bladed lightsaber?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was pretty epic when he ignited it during the final Phantom Menace dual."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if Kylo will fix his red lightsaber and get rid of the crossguards?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know - I think it is a nice effect and made things seem more evil in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Snoke will have or use a lightsaber?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe - his should be an epic gold/yellow color."
