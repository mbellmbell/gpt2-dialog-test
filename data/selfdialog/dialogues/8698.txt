"__BEATLES__ Do you remember the song 'Revolution?'"
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that's it!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, do you remember in the 90s when there was a big commotion about it?"
"__BEATLES__ Wait, what happened?"
"__BEATLES__ I think Yoko Ono gave Nike the rights to use the song in a commercial."
"__BEATLES__ So what was wrong with that?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, people were kind of annoyed that Lennon was talking about this great Revolution, then it's used for a sneaker commercial."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, I see."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, and then Heaven's Gate happened with Nike."
