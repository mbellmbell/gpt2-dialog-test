"__MUSIC__ That's the one."
"__MUSIC__ I had no idea. Who were the up against?"
"__MUSIC__ Jay-Z, Bruno Mars, Cee-Lo Green among others."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I'm surprised they took home the prize that year."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I would've picked someone else like Bruno Mars"
"__MUSIC__ How about Cee-Lo"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, he was way overrated."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he had that one song, Forget You"
"__MUSIC__ Well, that was the radio version. The real version contained a naughty word."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I never heard that version."
"__MUSIC__ Not many did."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever happened to Cee-Lo?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I know he was on that show The Voice for awhile"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah I remember that."
