"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, can I ask you a question? About Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, what's up?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think all the people on Alderaan died? I mean, ALL of them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean? The planet blew up, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well yeah, but... I mean, there had to be some people off world when the planet blew up, right? I mean, everyone couldn't have been home at the time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, I guess so. So what's your point?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what happened to those people. What was it like when they found out the death star had destroyed the planet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, that's a good point. I mean, it's not like having a flight cancelled."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's one horrible day at the space station. 'Sir, your flight is cancelled, because, um, I don't know how to say this, but Alderaan is gone.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel a strange disturbance in the force..."
