"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. I have been her fan since 2012. She is one of my favorite singers."
"__MUSIC__ Which of her songs do you like most?"

"__MUSIC__ I like it very much. I also like 'Red' in the same album."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. You and I have a similar taste."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. We should hang out more often to talk about her songs."
"__MUSIC__ That is a great idea. Are you interested in attending one of her concert with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds great. When will be her next concert?"
"__MUSIC__ It will be in Boston in early July. Will you be available at that time?"
