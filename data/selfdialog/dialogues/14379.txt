"__HORROR__ I've been searching the internet for the name of a horror movie I saw when I was, like, 5 or 6. But I can't find it anywhere."
"__HORROR__ I don't think I was allowed to watch horror flicks at that age."
"__HORROR__ It was the first horror movie I ever saw, so I think it stayed with me a little."
"__HORROR__ Everything but the title."
"__HORROR__ I believe it aired on TV one night around the late 80s or early 90s."
"__HORROR__ Ah, I thought it was in the movie theater. Could have been one of those made for televisions movies."
"__HORROR__ Could have been. It was about a married couple that moved new house or were on vacation, or something. And these strange people lived around them."
"__HORROR__ How strange?"
"__HORROR__ One was a fat middle-aged lady with dark hair tied in a bun. She looked very pale and I think she was a witch. The other guy looked like a Bee Gee who kept threatening the wife."
"__HORROR__ I'm drawing a blank. But it sounds a lot like that recent Liv Tyler movie, The Strangers."
