"__STAR_WARS__ Are you a Star Wars fan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I love the Star Wars movies!"
"__STAR_WARS__ So who is your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like Boba Fett, I feel like he's the mercenary of the Star Wars Universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I love Boba Fett too!!  It's sort of strange that he's my favorite and yet I know anothing about the actor."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought of that, but you're right.  Who plays him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jeremy Bulloch has played him the majority of the time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Just when I thought I knew everything about Star Wars I learn something new."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's true, there's just so many characters and settings and everything!  I love it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, let's go have a movie marathon of all the movies in order!"
