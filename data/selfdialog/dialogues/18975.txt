"__MOVIES__ Have you ever read a book and then watched the movie adaptation?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've watched a few."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Let me see... Great Expectations, Romeo + Juliet, Perks of Being a Wallflower, 1984, Clockwork Orange, and Atlas Shrugged, to name a few."
"__MOVIES__ Which one do you think was most like the book?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Romeo + Juliet was basically verbatim, but of course the scenery was modern. Perks of Being a Wallflower did a really good job, too."
"__MOVIES__ Which one was the worst?"
"__MOVIES__ Great Expectations. I liked the movie itself, but it really differed from the book. For some reason they even changed the names of the main characters."
"__MOVIES__ That's strange. What did they change them to?"
"__MOVIES__ They changed Pip's name to Finn and Miss Havisham to Mrs. Dinsmoor."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder why they did that?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know--artistic license, I guess. Like I said, the movie was good, though. The soundtrack was excellent."
"__MOVIES__ What year was it released?"
"__MOVIES__ 1998."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that was a pretty good era for film and soundtracks."
"__MOVIES__ Most definitely."
"__MOVIES__ So, what book do you wish they'd make a movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty obscure, but I wish they would adapt Poppy Z. Brite's Lost Souls."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the one about gay punk vampires?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one. I think it'd be great on screen."
