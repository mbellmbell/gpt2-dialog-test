"__DISNEY__ Did you notice that TV never plays any of the really good Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! I haven't seen Mulan 2 for years, not to mention The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ mostly they play the old movies, like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ Ugh, Sleeping Beauty is terrible."
"__DISNEY__ Why so? I like it."
"__DISNEY__ She doesn't actually do anything! All she really does is sing and dance."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm, I guess you're right. But you've gotta admit, Prince Phillip was pretty cool."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he was really heroic  and the epitome of a knight in shining armor."
"__DISNEY__ The villain, Maleficent, was also very realistic."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, the battle between her and Prince Phillip was extremely memorable."
