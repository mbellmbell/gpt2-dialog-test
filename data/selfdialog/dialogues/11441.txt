"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K., I've got one for you.  What was the greatest football team of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's tough.  I guess you start with the Miami Dolphins, only team to go undefeated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but that's going back to the seventies.  I think players are bigger, stronger, and faster now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you would eliminate the great Packer and Steeler teams of long ago even thought they were dominate in their eras?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't care about eras--if you lined the teams up against each other across the eras, who would win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the Steelers are out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably, although Bradshaw, Swan, Harris--that's pretty impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the great 49er teams are out, too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, not so fast--they played in the 80's and played modern football and Montana, Rice, and Lott with that defense--pretty tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if you're going to consider the 80's, how about the '85 Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll give them the greatest defense ever, but not enough offense to be the greatest team ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The team that probably should have been the greatest was the New England team that went undefeated until the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you could be right, but you can't be the greatest if you lose the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And when you think of New England, you only think of Brady and Belechek."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're right, although obviously they've had many great players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I'm getting a headache--there's been Dallas and Seattle and the Giants and so many good teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't take it seriously--it's just for fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know--well, what team would you pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm biased towards the 49ers in the Montana years--I mean Steve Young is your backup, Bill Walsh your coach..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, pretty good choice."
