"__FASHION__ What are your favorite trends right now?"
"__FASHION__ It's so hard to say. I really like the look of the cold-shoulder top."
"__FASHION__ Really? I don't like that one as much."
"__FASHION__ Why not?"
"__FASHION__ It just looks impractical, you know? Like why wear a long-sleeved top but have a bit cut out?"
"__FASHION__ I guess I can see that. So what are your favorite trends?"
"__FASHION__ I like the new trends in jeans."
"__FASHION__ With all the rips?"
"__FASHION__ No, the shape--I like that it's more relaxed, not like skinny jeans."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, me too. Much more comfortable!"
"__FASHION__ True. Anything you really don't like?"
"__FASHION__ I don't really like the midi skirt--it's such an awkward length to pull off if you're not tall."
"__FASHION__ I agree. It makes my legs look really short."
"__FASHION__ What else don't you like?"
"__FASHION__ Well, midi skirts, the cold-shoulder thing, and millenial pink."
"__FASHION__ I love millenial pink!"
"__FASHION__ Why? It's so boring!"
"__FASHION__ It's like a neutral, but more fun!"
"__FASHION__ I guess so, but it's not for me."
"__FASHION__ That's fine--more millenial pink cold-shoulder tops for me!"
