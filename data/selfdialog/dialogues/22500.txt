"__DISNEY__ I saw Fantasia on Netfix last night."
"__DISNEY__ I remember that my Aunt Catherine took me to that when I was around 4 years old."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I remember being really afraid when the brooms came to life and were putting buckets of water all over the place."
"__DISNEY__ That scared you?"
"__DISNEY__ Hey, I was a little kid. Yes it scared me."
"__DISNEY__ Did you tell your Auntie you were scared?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I didn't want her to feel bad for taking me to the movie."
"__DISNEY__ That was nice of you."
"__DISNEY__ She recently died so I now look back at it as a good experience because she and I were together."
