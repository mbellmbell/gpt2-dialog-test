"__THRILLER__ It's difficult for me to pin down a definition of what a thriller movie is."
"__THRILLER__ Isn't it just a movie with a lot of suspense?"
"__THRILLER__ Maybe, but that can mean a lot of different things tonally."
"__THRILLER__ Isn't suspense a tone?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, but that's not what I mean. Like, Home Alone has a lot of suspense, so is it a thriller?"
"__THRILLER__ That's really a comedy though."
"__THRILLER__ Some thrillers are also comedies though! The lines are really blurry."
"__THRILLER__ Okay, then let's say Home Alone is a thriller then. What difference does it make?"
"__THRILLER__ Not a whole lot, I guess."
"__THRILLER__ Exactly."
