"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it looks like Raymond James Stadium is not going to raise ticket sales."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, since the Bucs cant get to the playoffs i can see why. Sales have to be down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember a few years back they tried to raise ticket sales and black out games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do too and the Bucs were playing worse then they are now!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will have to make it to the playoffs to see some kind of jump in attendance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus it so costly to buy anything there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Also they are screening anyone that comes in like you are at the airport, no sneaking in anything!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. If you want a coke be prepared to pay 5$ for a 24 oz cup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And it will be packed full of ice too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same with beer. Way too overpriced."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully this will be the year the Bucs get to the playoffs and beyond."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, i don't think the prices will feel so bad if the team is having a winning season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if New England has that problem at Foxborough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, i havent been there in years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know when i am at the Trop, the food and drinks are good and not that expensive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that why i like just watching NFL games at home, cheaper and better view."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! Speaking of which, you gonna have a Bucs party this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right on! I cant wait!"
