"__HORROR__ I heard that the new Tom Cruise Mummy movie didn't do so hot its opening weekend."
"__HORROR__ I guess his movie star mojo works better in Mission Impossible movies."
"__HORROR__ Personally, I prefer the classic Universal horror films anyway. Nothing will ever top them."
"__HORROR__ Those creaky old things? They're so...old."
"__HORROR__ My friend, you do not appreciate the masterfulness of the original Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolf Man, and Mummy movies. They are amazing."
"__HORROR__ They're in black and white. Boring."
"__HORROR__ Karloff was incredible. His stage presence, even playing Frankenstein's Monster with no dialogue."
"__HORROR__ Not my cup of tea. Now Freddy Krueger, that's a horror villain."
"__HORROR__ Nah, modern horror films are mostly shock cuts and gouts of blood. Just watch the original Dracula with the lights out, you'll pee your pants."
"__HORROR__ Okay, maybe I'll rent one-- just one, mind you-- and check it out. Draculal - I thought Lugosi was badass in that movie about Ed Wood."
