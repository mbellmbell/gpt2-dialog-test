"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I like pop music the best."
"__MUSIC__ I never would have guessed that. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I just like knowing songs other people know and the songs are always pretty catchy."
"__MUSIC__ You're right about that. I haven't been able to get 'Call Me Maybe' out of my head since the first time I heard it five years ago."
"__MUSIC__ See, everyone knows pop music! I really like Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ Is she considered pop?"
"__MUSIC__ I think these days she's considered pop music. She used to be country when she first started singing."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure how I feel about Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, some of her songs are good, but others are just annoying."
"__MUSIC__ Which songs are annoying?"
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't the biggest fan of 'Shake It Off.'"
"__MUSIC__ I loved that song!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, to each his own, but it got stuck in my head like 'Call Me Maybe.'"
"__MUSIC__ I think getting a song stuck in your head means you like the song."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe at first, but after the millionth 'shake it off' going through my head, I started hating the song."
"__MUSIC__ What Taylor Swift songs do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like her older stuff like 'Love Story'"
"__MUSIC__ I like that one too! At least we can agree on that!"
