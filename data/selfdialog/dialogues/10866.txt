"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Currently, do you have a favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I do. It's the Denver Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are a great team. I bet you were very happy last year when they took it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh absolutely. I actually had to work the next morning at six in the morning but made sure to stay up until the end of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is safe to say that they redeemed themselves after 2014?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh please do not get me started on that game. That was truly difficult to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a rough one. I believe it went down as the most one-sided SuperBowl game of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can surly believe that. I had a friend who was betting a little bit with co-workers and he lost money very quickly!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember thinking of you when that game was going on. Thinking how you must've tossed your TV across the room!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It came close. I was at a friends house for that game, and he is not a Denver fan, but even he felt it was very hard to get through."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you family Denver fans, also?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, no. Just my step father, who lived in CO for a chunk of his life."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember what his thoughts were on that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If memory serves, he did not even watch the whole thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did he even make it to half time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe he said that was when he turned it off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Safe to say, not due to a lack luster half time show?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all! He was very upset with his teams performance and could not take anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Needless to say, the Broncos made it up for it last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And I was truly happy to see it!"
