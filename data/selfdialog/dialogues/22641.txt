"__DISNEY__ Do you every think about how young Snow White was?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ She's supposedly only 14 years old in the movie!"
"__DISNEY__ What? No way!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! Which is even more devastating when you think about how the Queen treated her."
"__DISNEY__ She was just a kid!"
"__DISNEY__ Atleast with all that work she had to do, she held her own well in the dwarf cottage."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, they really appreciated her cleaning and cooking for them."
"__DISNEY__ And she was married at 14 also!"
"__DISNEY__ To be fair you'd married a prince at 14 if it meant being far away from an evil witch mother."
