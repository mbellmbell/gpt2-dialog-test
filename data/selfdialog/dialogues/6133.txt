"__STAR_WARS__ What first got you into watching Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I just randomly saw a part of one of the original movies and I thought it was really cool.  I ended up renting the original trilogy and I was hooked!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is great!  The original trilogy totally made me a Star Wars lover!  Do you have a favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do!!  Return of the Jedi is my favorite!!  I love how Luke comes in and stands up to the emperor and also when Darth Vader throws him over the balcony and kills him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I totally agree!  Plus the Ewoks were adorable! lol"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes they were!!  What do you think about the new trilogy that they started?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like it but of course nothing can beat the original trilogy!  Til this day, those are the best movies ever made!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes they are!!  I did really like Rogue one though!!  It fit in very well with the others."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree!!  That last scene with Princess Leia saying 'Hope'...OMG! I just about wanted to scream!!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too!!!"
