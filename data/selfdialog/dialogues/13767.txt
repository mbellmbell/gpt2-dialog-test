"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about college basketball vs. the NBA?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I strongly prefer watching college basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why? The NCAA takes advantage of its students by not paying them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, they're not employees, and if they get scholarships, they have free tuition, so they are paid."
"__BASKETBALL__ I still think they should be paid."
"__BASKETBALL__ I just hate that they can't get ANYTHING from anyone. If you receive $5 for an autograph once in four years, you're kicked out, and a lot of these players are super poor."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why else do you like them?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think NCAA plays with more passion. They're there to make it to the next level and they know they have four years max to win a championship, so they have to go all-out."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that's true, the NBA players are lazy as heck."
"__BASKETBALL__ And the referees don't call traveling!"
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about men vs. women basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The men would win because they're taller, faster, stronger..."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's not what I meant, you misogynist. Which do you prefer, and why?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I prefer men's. The women are too predictable--you always know who'll be in the final four and UConn will win the title."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, at least the men have ten teams each year that can win it all."
"__BASKETBALL__ I also think it's more entertaining."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ok, misogynist, how so?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Stop calling me that. I just like dunks, and with a handful of exceptions, women can't dunk. And if they can, it's barely above the rim."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the men put on a show."
"__BASKETBALL__ And that's what I'm paying to see. I'm not paying to see some excellent bounce passes."
