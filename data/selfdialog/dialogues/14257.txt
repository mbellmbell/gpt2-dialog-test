"__HORROR__ Debate time, horror movie edition."
"__HORROR__ Okay, go ahead."
"__HORROR__ Evil Dead 2: Remake or sequel?"
"__HORROR__ That's so easy it's insane."
"__HORROR__ I say remake, it's practically scene-by-scene"
"__HORROR__ And the graphics are better, maybe it's like the new editions like George Lucas did?"
"__HORROR__ Right!"
"__HORROR__ Wrong, very wrong."
"__HORROR__ What makes you so sure?"
"__HORROR__ Different cast. Only Ash remains--it can't be a remake with different characters, silly."
