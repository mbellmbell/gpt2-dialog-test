"__DISNEY__ Would you want to live in the world of Disney's Pinocchio?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean, a world in which a boy exists whose nose grows every time he lies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, except the lying-nose growth connection would apply to everyone."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that would certainly be a way to get a good judgment of who you can trust."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's like a credit score for honesty that's all over your face."
"__DISNEY__ Would the growth be proportionate to the lie?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean by that?"
"__DISNEY__ For example, if I tell a huge lie, that someone tried to kill me for example. Would my nose grow bigger than if I told a white lie about someone else's appearance."
"__DISNEY__ Good distinction. Yeah, it would have to be that way for the nose growth to be any use."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed, unless the growth is happening in real time."
