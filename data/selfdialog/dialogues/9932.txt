"__COMEDY__ I finally saw the South Park movie."
"__COMEDY__ Didn't that come out like 20 years ago?"
"__COMEDY__ Something like that.  I'm a bit behind on my movies I guess."
"__COMEDY__ You don't say?"
"__COMEDY__ That movie was so hilarious though.  Cartman gets me every time."
"__COMEDY__ What about the songs?  Those were nuts."
"__COMEDY__ I feel bad if I even tried to sing them in public!"
"__COMEDY__ I would sing them in the shower though."
"__COMEDY__ Well, yeah.  Hey, that's a good idea, I should try that."
"__COMEDY__ Yes, you should!"
