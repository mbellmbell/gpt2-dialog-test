"__MUSIC__ Seriously, has there been any good, major music in the last 15 years?"
"__MUSIC__ There always is, isn't there? It just depends on where you're looking, and what you're prepared to accept."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously, don't talk about Jack White."
"__MUSIC__ There's him, sure. And there are tons of older bands who have come back and reformed to do sort of interesting stuff -- Faith No More, My Bloody Valentine."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I mean something... new. Something that pushes the boundaries in the way that the White Stripes don't."
"__MUSIC__ That's probably The Knife, then. Silent Shout is... maybe the only album you'll ever need."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard some of their early stuff. It was... kind of annoying."
"__MUSIC__ It can be! But there was a progression, and Silent Shout is in deep masterpiece territory."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, noted. Is there anything else?"
"__MUSIC__ Janelle Monae is pretty interesting. Her first EP and LP are something else -- though there's a bit too much on the album."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know who that is. What kind of music is this?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a stew of a million ingredients. Her big project is this yet-to-be-finished mega opus, based on an Afrofuturist sci-fi story."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds, uh, ambitious. What do you mean it isn't finished yet?"
"__MUSIC__ It's this opera about an android revolt, split up into multiple acts. The first act is an EP that she recorded in her bedroom and released on Myspace; her first album makes up the second and third, and so on."
"__MUSIC__ How many acts are we talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember, but I think there's one more album coming. So far we've got one EP and two albums."
"__MUSIC__ Is this, like, mainstream music? Or is this just some lady on the Internet?"
"__MUSIC__ Does it matter? I mean, it started as some girl on the Internet -- who got 'discovered' and recorded a major-label album, and then started acting and all that jazz."
"__MUSIC__ Acting? What's she been in?"
"__MUSIC__ You know Hidden Figures, about the ladies who made NASA work in the early days? That, for starters."
