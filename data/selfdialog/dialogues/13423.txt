"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As of recent, all of the New York football teams sure have been bad"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, that's pretty clear"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants were the last good team and that was years ago they won the superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and the jets are a joke"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants usually have good talent on the team each year I wonder what their problem is"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are poorly coached in my opinion"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think they recently fired someone from their coaching staff"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe they fired their head coach"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was probably a good choice, it wasn't working out after they had won the super bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The jets are also pretty bad"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but they've been bad for a while"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a lot of problems"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The jets are far away from being any good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they are lacking critical parts to their team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need a complete overhaul so they can come back"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The entire team and staff needs to be gutted"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure new york fans are ashamed"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would be"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would be clinging to the Giants superbowl win a few years ago"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure most of those fans are!"
