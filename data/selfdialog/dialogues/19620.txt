"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Super Size Me?"
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a documentary."
"__MOVIES__ Was that the one where the man ate all that food?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he ate at McDonald's for a month."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't he gain a lot of weight?"
"__MOVIES__ Supposedly he did."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean supposedly?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess he did lose the weight, but there is controversy about the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What was controversial about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, another guy ate at McDonald's everyday and lost weight."
"__MOVIES__ How did he do that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was all about making healthier choices."
"__MOVIES__ You can't really eat healthy at McDonald's."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe not healthy.  But you can be moderate."
"__MOVIES__ So the second guy proved what exactly."
"__MOVIES__ More or less, that you won't gain a ton just by eating at McDonald's."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so he was telling the viewers it was their responsiblity to order responsibly?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that makes a lot of sense."
