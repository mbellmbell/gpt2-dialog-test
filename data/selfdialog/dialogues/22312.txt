"__DISNEY__ Like the Aristocats?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah doesn't everybody want to be a cat."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's hat."
"__DISNEY__ Everybody's picking up on that feline beat."
"__DISNEY__ Because everything else is obsolete."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, it seems we are already on our way to becoming Aristocats."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I'd be a tomcat and you'd be a scaredy cat."
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha you're so funny. Anyways I'd definitely be Scat Cat."
"__DISNEY__ Well I'll be Toulouse then."
