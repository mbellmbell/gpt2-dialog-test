"__STAR_WARS__ So, apparently, Ewan McGregor wants to do an Obi-Wan Kenobi spin-off Star Wars film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then should let him. I don't think people would complain."
"__STAR_WARS__ It makes more sense than the Young Han Solo film starring none of the original actors."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which is still better than making a fake, CGI, young Han Solo, honestly."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, yeah, but my point is that McGregor is at the perfect age to play Obi-Wan during the era between Episodes III and IV."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you want a midquel basically?"
"__STAR_WARS__ If it would work. Though if they wait too long to make it, he'll get old and they'll have to recast Obi-Wan yet again."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or CGI young and just have him do the voice."
"__STAR_WARS__ They'd just get James Arnold Taylor to voice him in that. He's  technically played Obi-Wan more than anyone because of that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh. Never would've guessed."
