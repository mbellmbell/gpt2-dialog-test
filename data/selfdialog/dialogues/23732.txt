"__DISNEY__ The story of Sleeping Beauty is wonderful. Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip make quite the duo."
"__DISNEY__ They do make quite the handsome couple."
"__DISNEY__ Who is your favorite Disney Princess?"
"__DISNEY__ I really like Cinderella. Prince Charming is striking, as well."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you like Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ I like that she works hard and does not complain. She is pure and gets the prince in the end."
"__DISNEY__ More like the prince gets her, looking for the foot that fit the slipper."
"__DISNEY__ It could be viewed that way. I love her dress in the ball scene where she loses that slipper."
"__DISNEY__ It helps when you have a Fairy Godmother to dress for for a ball."
"__DISNEY__ I wish I had a Fairy Godmother and a Prince Charming in my life."
