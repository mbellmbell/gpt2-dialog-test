"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You know what really upset me about Fast & Furious 6?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What disappointed you?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I feel like the characters totally forgot about Gisele at the end."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wow.  Now that you mention it, they totally glossed over that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ One of their crew members died, but they seemed so happy about celebrating when they got Mia back."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was very uncharacteristic of the crew to forget a family member."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They should have at least had a moment of silence for Gisele.  Especially since she died sacrificing herself for Han."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That made me angry as well.  By the way, you realize who the actress who portrayed Gisele was?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, it was Gal Gadot!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I guess we can't be too sad about her leaving the franchise, now that she's Wonder Woman."
