"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what are your opinions on legal steroid use for NFL players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck, no. Why should that be allowed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because it would make the game more exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that would be so wrong. I don't think athletes should be allowed to cheat like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if it's legal, how would it be cheating? Everybody would be allowed to use it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the players that don't want to use it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, then that's their choice. They don't have to use it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that would make the playing field really dangerous for those who have no desire to use steroids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then they should consider using it. I think the game would be more exciting for fans to watch since there'd be better athletic peformances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there already is great ahtleticism in football. We don't need to add steroids to the mix."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To me, there shouldn't be limitations to how the sport should progress. If athletes want to use steroids they should use it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like I said, it would be unfair to those who don't want to risk the dangers of steroids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally, I think sports are more exciting when athletes are using steroids. Look at the home run derby between McGuire and Sosa years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To me, if they have to use steroids to put on a show, then there's really nothing great about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're being a little too judgemental about steroids. It isn't as dangerous as you think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even if what you say is true, just the fact that it's even a little dangerous is something some players don't want to deal with. And they shouldn't have to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think the NFL is too soft these days. I want to see some hard hits again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that has more to do with the rules than the lack of steroids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe. Maybe I just want to watch some old style football again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could be it. Plus, you never know which players just haven't gotten cauging using illegal substances, too."
