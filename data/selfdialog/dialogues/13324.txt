"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of NFL players do some great things for charity, but you sometimes don't hear much about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, Drew Brees has a Brees Dream foundation that helps kids with cancer. That's a great cause!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of them like to help with kid's charities. Larry Fitzgerald from the Cardinals has a kid's foundation that helps kids in crisis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Andy Dalton from the Bengals has a foundation that helps kids in the hospital. He does a lot of fundraisers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ JJ Watt from the Houston Texans has a charity for middle school kids helping them with sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like everyone likes to help kids when it comes to charity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that and the military. Vincent Jackson from the Buccaneers has a charity for veterans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People feel like we owe vets the support because they get injured protecting all of us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One player even supports police and police dogs. Ben Roethlisberger from the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Police often owe their lives to those dogs, it's good to see someone thinking of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, most people do center on kids though. Jay Cutler from the Bears has a foundation that helps kids with diabetes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think children with diseases touches people because these kids should have their whole life ahead of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tim Tebow has a foundation that helps build kid's playrooms in hospitals. I'm sure getting to be a kid helps them deal with the stress."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems strange that kids these days come down with so many different diseases."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brandon Marshall from the Bears had borderline personality disorder, and started a foundation to help kids with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's good to see people finally talking about mental illness and doing something about it, instead of hiding it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like how all these NFL players use their fame and fortune to turn around and do good deeds that help so many others."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, they don't get enough credit. The media always talks about actor's charities, but never much about athlete's charities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's important to publicize charity work, because a lot of people don't know how to help, and learning more about a foundation can give them little ways they can help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean, if people just realized what great things a fundraiser does, and how someone they admire is involved, they might be more willing to participate."
