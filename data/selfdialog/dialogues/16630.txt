"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Shining?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one, the movie or mini-series?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't realize there was more than the movie. That's all I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the movie came first and Stephen King really wasn't happy with how it turned out."
"__MOVIES__ That's why there was a mini series made?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, so you see the plot taking different turns in each one but they each have their merits."
"__MOVIES__ Well even if I didn't have the same vision for the story Stephen King had, I still appreciated the movie a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely, and to answer your question, I have seen it several times and it's one of my favourites."
"__MOVIES__ How come?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it's kind of a classic within my family, it scared me to death as a kid and I'm just a big fan of the stories King comes up with in general."
"__MOVIES__ Nice, nice."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! Plus I liked Jack Nicholson's acting in it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
"__MOVIES__ I know he wasn't who King liked for the role because he seemed like he was already on the way to crazy from the start, but I can't help it."
"__MOVIES__ Well I'm learning all kinds of new things."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, similarly he thought Shelley DuVall seemed too emotionally weary from the start unlike the privileged cheerleader type he envisioned for the role."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I kind of thought that myself and I had no idea he felt the same!"
"__MOVIES__ Well you know what they say, great minds think alike."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. I could never have come up with a story like that though, with the hotel itself being an entity trying to take advantage of his boy's powers!"
"__MOVIES__ It really is a tremendous story the more you get into it and read about and learn about it. Not just a shallow horror like some."
