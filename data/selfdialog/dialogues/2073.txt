"__MUSIC__ What kind of music is your least favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, that's a tough one."
"__MUSIC__ Is country one of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes actually. I used to like country oddly enough though."
"__MUSIC__ What made you not like it anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it just got too whiny for me after a while."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah a lot of the singers talk about the same things and sappy love stories."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I heard someone say that country is now just like pop with a twang."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely agree with that, modern country is very much like pop."
"__MUSIC__ What about older country?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say things like bluegrass are more country than modern country."
"__MUSIC__ Is bluegrass considered older country music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's pretty much old folk music, but in a different way that people consider folk music nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've liked every bluegrass song I've heard."
"__MUSIC__ Most of what I've heard is instrumental, and there's plenty of violin and banjo."
"__MUSIC__ True, I've heard both of those in bluegrass."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame that more classic country artists aren't as popular."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there's definitely more talent in them I would say."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with that, more mastery of an instrument for sure."
