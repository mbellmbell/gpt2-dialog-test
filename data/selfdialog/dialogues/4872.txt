"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to much punk music?"
"__MUSIC__ It might depend to some degree on what you consider to be punk."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so what kinds of things do you listen to that might be punk."
"__MUSIC__ I'm really into Bad Religion and the Dead Kennedys."
"__MUSIC__ Those sounds like punk bands to me."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the Dead Kennedys definitely are. Some people think of Bad Religion as more pop-punk music, though."
"__MUSIC__ I never got too much into those discussons. I just like to listen to the music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so what punk bands do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm really into Husker Du."
"__MUSIC__ So I'm guessing you like their earlier stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like their stuff in the 1980s."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't they more into alternative rock now?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are. But they were a great hardcore punk band back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ So what's your favorite stuff from them?"
"__MUSIC__ I really love the album Flip Your Wig!"
"__MUSIC__ That album's great."
"__MUSIC__ So are you into any more recent stuff than Dead Kennedys and Bad Religion?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I'm not sure punk is being done very well anymore."
"__MUSIC__ You could definitely make a case for that. Thanks for the chat."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, thanks."
