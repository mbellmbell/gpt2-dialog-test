"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Imagine Dragon's new song yet?"
"__MUSIC__ Is it the one called Walking The Wire?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the song! Do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty good. I liked some of the older songs better."
"__MUSIC__ I've been a fan since I heard Radioactive back in 2012."
"__MUSIC__ Radioactive is my favorite song of theirs."
"__MUSIC__ I think that was their big hit that made them get so popular."
"__MUSIC__ I had never heard of them until that song started playing on the radio all the time."
"__MUSIC__ I hadn't either. After that when they released Demons as a single, I was sure I was hooked."
"__MUSIC__ It showed they had more range."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it made me buy their album, Night Visions, to see what else they could do."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you got their album? How are their songs besides the radio singles?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they're great, really creative. I could listen to them nonstop."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'll check out some more of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ You should. If you like them, you might like Neon Trees too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I've heard of them. What songs do they have?"
"__MUSIC__ They released a song called Animal that topped the charts in 2010, I think"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, Animal, I've heard that song! Are they good?"
"__MUSIC__ They're fantastic. I can lend you their album. It's really different stuff, sort of between alternative rock and pop, but they're really fun to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks. I look forward to hearing more from them. Their first song was huge!"
