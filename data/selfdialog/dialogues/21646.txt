"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I just loved the lion king! What about you?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd have to say Aladdin. I think the old movies are better than the new ones."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not too sure about that. Moana was great!"
"__DISNEY__ I think they're good, but the old ones have a more nostalgic feel to them."
"__DISNEY__ Well I see what you mean, but watching the new ones bring that feeling back to me in a way."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well they all have a warm theme to them so watching them makes me feel like a kid again."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think they're better than the old movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I think they both have their place, but I still prefer them to the old movies."
