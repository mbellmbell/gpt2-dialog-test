"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ready for the Patriots to win another Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it is gonna happen this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that the Patriots are a bunch of cheaters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way they are the best Football team in the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Steelers will destroy them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Never we have Tom Brady the best quarterback in the whole NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no you are mistaken Ben Rothinsberger is so much better then Brady"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would you say that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ben can actually take a hit if needed and not whiny like a baby."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady never gets hit since the Patriots offense is so strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really thats why he was complaining last year about them not protecting him.  At least Ben tries to run when theres an opening"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ oh no thats the side effect of not being able to throw this year since he blew his fingers of on a fourth of july party."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a fake news story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ sounds like something he would do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it was fake and he is an excellant quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hes no Tom Brady and they are no where near as good as the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guess we will see since preseason is right around the corner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true we should take our families to a preseason game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good idea the tickets are cheaper durning the preseason."
