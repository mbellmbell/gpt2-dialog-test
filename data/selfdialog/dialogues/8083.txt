"__POP__ Have you seen Katy Perry's new hairstyle?"
"__POP__ Yes! She looks so different from when she first started her career."
"__POP__ I know. It doesn't even look like her."
"__POP__ I will always remember Katy Perry for how she looked in her California Gurls music video."
"__POP__ Oh yeah. She was so pretty in that video and that song is so catchy."
"__POP__ My favorite song by her is probably Firework."
"__POP__ Firework is really catchy, too. I like some of her lesser known songs like Pearl and Circle the Drain."
"__POP__ Sometimes it seems like the best songs that artists have are the less popular ones."
"__POP__ I agree. Kesha has such a beautiful voice, but I don't like any of her songs that always play on the radio."
"__POP__ I haven't listened to Kesha much. I'll have to check out some of her songs."
