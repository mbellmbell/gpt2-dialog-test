"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Christopher Nolan movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm a huge Nolan fan so this is a tough question. Let me think about this for a second, what's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ If I had to rank them, my order would be The Dark Knight, Interstellar, Inception, The Prestige, Memento, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight Rises."
"__MOVIES__ Now that I've had a little time to think about it I think my all time favorite Nolan movie would have to be The Dark Knight and Inception. I like Interstellar next and everything else is sort of in the same category for me."
"__MOVIES__ I'm looking forward to Dunkirk. That's going to be releasing soon!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! I've already reserved a day to watch it when it releases."
"__MOVIES__ Tom Hardy is going to be in Dunkirk right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Tom Hardy is going to be in there. It'll be his second movie I think under Nolan's direction."
"__MOVIES__ That's right, the other was Inception."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever figure out if the top stopped spinning or not in Inception?"
"__MOVIES__ No! That's the never ending question. I think I've had endless debates with people over that ending."
"__MOVIES__ I know, was it a dream or not?"
"__MOVIES__ My head slightly hurts thinking about it again now, so I'll just stick to what I originally thought, it's not a dream. Makes me feel good knowing it was more fulfilling."
"__MOVIES__ I won't argue with you on that. What did you think about the extra dimension in Interstellar?"
"__MOVIES__ That turn or twist really surprised me! It was so revealing and I remember being so pleasantly shocked and surprised by it!"
"__MOVIES__ That movie really brought out the melodramatics but I enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, it had a strong sense of love."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the Anne Hathaway love monologue was a little corny I thought."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't that bad! I know people are cynical today, but I thought it was fitting for the situation they were in."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. I sort of agree it does fit the overall theme and message of the movie."
