"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um. ok, then I don't know what I was thinking. no wait, I do know what I was thinking. I mean do that for all the teams,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh. So you have 32 data points on 3 axes? Well, then what? Even then, it's not any more informative than just looking at the numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will the comparison easier. You can sort the teams by run efficiency, and then reception efficiency and maybe scoring efficiency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What on earth is a scoring efficiency?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know... maybe TDs per drive distance?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is not a scoring efficiency, that's more like... Ok I have no idea what that is, but it's not how efficient the scoring was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it shows you TDs per distrance, that's efficiency... I think..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh... no... it shows you that the punt was good, and the drive was long, and that the team was able to score. How is that scoring efficiency?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hm, ok so that's more like will to succeed, so I the TDs per distance of drive is small, that means the drive was long. Which also means the team was determined to score."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's just score divided by the total yardage. The NFL keeps track of that as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So make a graph of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. It's too much work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Please, I wanna see, it might be informative."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It won't be any more informative than what is already compiled by the NFL, ESPN, etc, besides, total offense stats like that are meaningless unless you compare it the total defense of the opposing team, which is also curated on the websites."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Woo, that gices me an idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh God. Don't tell me"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If we divide the two, then we get a ratio. So divide the offense's run efficiency by the defense's run defense efficiency"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How on earth are you going to get the defense's run defense efficiency?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Runs allowed per game, and yardage allowed, the same way as offense's efficiency. But looked at as a loss as opposed to gain"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. and the ratio offense/defense is greater 1 if the offense has better run efficiency that the defense? You know what, let's do this for and pats and cowboys."
