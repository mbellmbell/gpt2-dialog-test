"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Katy Perry song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Swish Swish"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, It isn't good, do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think it is okay but I wouldn't buy it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me either and I am a little tired of the whole feul thing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too.  Get over it already."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, I don't know why you have to keep dragging it out."
"__MUSIC__ Me either, it seems childish and petty."
"__MUSIC__ I agree."
"__MUSIC__ She has some good song but not sure how this album is going to be."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, if this first song is any indication, it is not sounding good."
"__MUSIC__ I know."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe she will have a better hit with the second song."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe."
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't real crazy about the song she did for the olympics but ended up using for Hilary."
"__MUSIC__ I don't remeber it."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, it was pretty bland."
"__MUSIC__ And clearly not very memorable."
"__MUSIC__ I know."
"__MUSIC__ Well, we will have to wait and see but not planning on buying any concert tickets just yet."
