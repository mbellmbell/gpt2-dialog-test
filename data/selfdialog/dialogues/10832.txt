"__FASHION__ Hey what's your opinion on J Crew's new spring catalog?"
"__FASHION__ Well, I did see a few things I liked, but I haven't shopped at J Crew for awhile now."
"__FASHION__ Oh really?  Where have you been buying all your clothes lately?"
"__FASHION__ Mainly from John Varvatos and Barneys."
"__FASHION__ Wow.  I love both of those places, but they are always so expensive."
"__FASHION__ I defintely agree, but the clothes aren't too much more expensive than J Crews and I never shop at there main stores."
"__FASHION__ Where do you get their clothes then?"
"__FASHION__ There is a outlet for both stores at Sawgrass Mills.  Great way to save money and the selection is usually great."
"__FASHION__ I will definitely have to check both out."
"__FASHION__ You should.  I've actually saved a considerable amount of money compared to retail J Crew."
"__FASHION__ Do you only shop at the oulets for these clothes?"
"__FASHION__ No.  I actually look on eBay quite often as well."
"__FASHION__ I never even considered using eBay for buying clothes.  How is the selection?"
"__FASHION__ The selection is great, and the price is nearly half of that in store."
"__FASHION__ Yah, but what about the condition of the clothes?  I'm looking to look good and fashionable."
"__FASHION__ There are ways to search for only new clothes on eBay, and trust me you will look good in Varvatos clothes."
"__FASHION__ Thank you for the heads up.  I think I will look tonight.  I'm trying to impress my new girlfriend."
"__FASHION__ No problem at all and let me know if you need any help.  Your girlfriend will probably want to marry you after you become more fashionable."
"__FASHION__ I would hope so.  I look like a bum now."
"__FASHION__ Yes you do, but not for long!"
