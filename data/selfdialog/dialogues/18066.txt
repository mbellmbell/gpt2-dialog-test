"__MOVIES__ The Sound of Music was on the other night.  I love that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it.  It's on every year around Easter, and I usually watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ Julie Andrews is the perfect Maria, and Christopher Plummer makes a great Captain von Trapp."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think the casting was perfect.  Even the children were cast well."
"__MOVIES__ I'm a big fan of Charmian Carr as Liesl, the oldest daughter."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite child character is probably Kim Karath as Gretl."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes, she was adorable.  I read that Julie Andrews had to jump in and save her in the scene where the boat tipped over and the children fell in because she couldn't swim."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know that.  I really like all of the scenes with the children in them."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the scenes with the children were always good.  I love it when Maria teaches them to sing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I like that too.  What is your favorite scene?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is probably when Maria is walking down the aisle to get married.  The church is beautiful and the perspective from above is stunning."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, her wedding gown is gorgeous."
"__MOVIES__ I also like the scene in the gazebo where Liesl is dancing with Rofle."
"__MOVIES__ That is one of the best scenes in the movie.  'I am Sixteen Going on Seventeen,' is an awesome song."
"__MOVIES__ I really love all the songs in the movie, but that one is one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ I really like the scene where Captain von Trapp and Maria dance a folk dance in the courtyard."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think that is the first moment when they are aware that they have feelings for each other."
"__MOVIES__ And the children seem to be in favor of the match."
"__MOVIES__ The ending scene when they are climbing the mountain into Switzerland is pretty moving."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think the real life von Trapp family had to escape Austria in a similar fashion."
