"__FASHION__ Where did you get those shades?"
"__FASHION__ Well I actually just found them at a gas station but they fit my face so well."
"__FASHION__ I know they go perfectly with your cheek bones. Plus the shades aren't too dark."
"__FASHION__ Wow so how did you get those to match?"
"__FASHION__ Well I found two fabrics with the same style and made it into this skirt."
"__FASHION__ Wow did you do the pleading yourself?"
"__FASHION__ Hes your would be surprised how difficult it is. I had to look in so many fashion magazines to get an idea."
"__FASHION__ Well that is intense, how did you come across the fabric?"
"__FASHION__ Well it was at a fashion school"
"__FASHION__ Was it used or were you able to find it for free? I thought there was no free in fashion"
"__FASHION__ well that is true and not true. The black doesn't really match the grey."
"__FASHION__ Does the pattern match the solid?"
"__FASHION__ Well it may but you will need to find some matching shoes and accessories"
"__FASHION__ I was think of wearing this watch, I know it makes a statement but what do you think?"
"__FASHION__ It's sort of beautiful but has too big of a face for my taste"
"__FASHION__ What about these shoes, will they go with the rest of the outfit?"
"__FASHION__ They may but I am not sure, why don't you try it on?"
"__FASHION__ Okay it just I don't think it fits. I will need to get it himmed"
"__FASHION__ Well can we go to a seamstress?"
"__FASHION__ I don't know one in this area but we could always call the fashion police. LOL"
