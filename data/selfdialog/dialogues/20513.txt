"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good horror films lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I saw that one movie written by the Peele guy."
"__MOVIES__ Jordan Peele? You saw 'Get Out'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that one! It was awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ What was scary about it? And I don't want it to be too funny, was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a good blend of both. I was really scared at some parts but it is funny throughout."
"__MOVIES__ That is awesome to here, I saw some recent horror movies on Netflix but they weren't that good."
"__MOVIES__ I get you, I watch horror movies on those streaming sites and none of them do the job."
"__MOVIES__ Don't spoil anything for me but does it get supernatural?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing really supernatural, it is more of how the mind gets played with."
"__MOVIES__ Does it end well?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought so, I was mostly scared so I was relieved it had ended."
"__MOVIES__ Haha nice! Did you see it with anybody?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it with my cousin."
"__MOVIES__ How old is your cousin, was he scared?"
"__MOVIES__ My cousin is older than me, he was fine."
"__MOVIES__ Would you want to see the movie again?"
"__MOVIES__ Possibly, it is intense but if you wanted to we could go."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, I will call you this weekend!"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good!"
