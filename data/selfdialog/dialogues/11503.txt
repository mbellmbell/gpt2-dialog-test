"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, do you watch NFL football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course! What's your favorite time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine is the Detroit Lions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously? Why, they're not very good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but I like going to Ford Field, it's one of the best in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure about that.  Part of the fun is watching a winning team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but the Lions have been doing better lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny. I heard someone say that the Lions may be the only Michigan team to go to the playoffs this coming year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I've been watching the Lions since they played in the Plontiac Silverdome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Pontiac Silverdome? Is that even still around?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sadly, no."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened to it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Once the Lions left Auburn Hills for Detroit, the Silverdome became a ghost town."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's fine, Ford Field is a lot better, anyways."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the new home of the Lions.  Ford Field is near a lot of other stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, hopefully, the Lions will make it even better by winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're absolutely right!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go Lions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go Honolulu Blue!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope they win something this year!"
