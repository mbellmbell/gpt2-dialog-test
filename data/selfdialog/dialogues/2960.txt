"__MUSIC__ Trey, are you listening to Tears for Fears, man?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know you liked that kind of music."
"__MUSIC__ No offense, Larry but I grew up on these white boy songs!﻿"
"__MUSIC__ Shout by Tears for Fears is one of my all time favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ So did. I really miss the 80s!"
"__MUSIC__ YEAH! I Miss The 80's!"
"__MUSIC__ Music was so good then. Music had meaning."
"__MUSIC__ This is the only kind of stuff MTV would play when it first came out, remember?  And Michael Jackson.﻿"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. Now they  are all about that reality TV mess."
"__MUSIC__ This is one of those songs that you want to blast through your car speakers on the way down the interstate going about 75mph.﻿"
"__MUSIC__ I do that all of the time. I almost got a ticket last week for doing just that."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. I was going down the interstate and this song came on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ And before you knew it you were over the speed limit."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. A cop pulled me over but let me go with a warning."
"__MUSIC__ Why didn't he give you a ticket?"
"__MUSIC__ This song was still playing. He was shocked that a black man was listening to this type of music."
"__MUSIC__ You're kidding?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. He said because he liked that song he would let me go with a warning."
