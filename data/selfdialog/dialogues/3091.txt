"__MUSIC__ Do you like Red Dirt country music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know what that is. What kind of country is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a type of country music that comes out of Texas and Oklahoma."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds interesting, why is it different than regular country?"
"__MUSIC__ It is specially non-Nashville, and it embraces the down home roots of country music. It doesn't really have any pop elements in it."
"__MUSIC__ Why did it begin?"
"__MUSIC__ Red Dirt began because of a distaste for Nashville country, and because certain country artists felt they were being shut out of the Nashville music scene. A lot of the songs in red dirt reflect that sentiment."
"__MUSIC__ So do all of the bands and musicians come from Texas or Oklahoma?"
"__MUSIC__ I think originally, yes, but today many artists do not."
"__MUSIC__ What are some examples of Red Dirt artists?"
"__MUSIC__ Jason Boland and the Stragglers, Robert Earl Keen, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and others."
"__MUSIC__ What is the difference between 'outlaw' country and 'red dirt' country?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there aren't many outlaw country artists left, I believe. However, there is a lot of overlap between artists who were 'outlaw,' or outside of the Nashville music scene and red dirt artists."
"__MUSIC__ What is the sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Red dirt sounds more like bluegrass, rock, Western swing, honky tonk, even Mexican influences. I think most of the country music coming out of Nashville has undeniable pop overtones."
"__MUSIC__ When did this begin?"
"__MUSIC__ It began in the 1970s, and really grew to apex around the early 2000s. However, many people today would say that the gap in the types of music are closing."
"__MUSIC__ If they don't go to Nashville, how to these artists get their start?"
"__MUSIC__ The musicians tour various honky tonks, dance halls, fraternity parties, wherever they can get a gig."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds so good and interesting! I will certainly check it out!"
