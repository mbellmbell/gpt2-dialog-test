"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the 1970's movie The Warriors?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  It is one of my favorites!"
"__MOVIES__ Mine too, I have watched it so many times I almost know the script by heart!"
"__MOVIES__ No kidding?  I've watched it a few times, but not that many."
"__MOVIES__ I have to say, one of my favorite parts is when they go into the Orphans territory."
"__MOVIES__ Oh heck yeah, that part is classic"
"__MOVIES__ The leader of the Orphans looks like he's been through the ringer, eh?"
"__MOVIES__ He sure does, and its so funny they didn't know about the meeting up in the Bronx."
"__MOVIES__ What a great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ It never gets old does it?  Good soundtrack too."
"__MOVIES__ When they are on the beach and the Joe Walsh song comes on it is so fitting."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, In The City, whoever thought of that had the right idea placing it in the show."
"__MOVIES__ The scene on the train is heavy when the prom couples board."
"__MOVIES__ Mercy goes to fix her hair and Swan pushes her arm down as if to say, no, you don't need to fix yourself up for them."
"__MOVIES__ There are a lot of scenes in the movie that are heavier than they seem."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, for sure, like when the guys go with the girls, The Lizzies."
"__MOVIES__ I knew something was up, why would these girls just show up and invite three Warriors back to their place without some kind of motive?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea, and when that switchblade comes out, it is fight central!"
"__MOVIES__ I must say, that movie is one of the greatest I've ever seen"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I agree with you, it is an excellent watch."
