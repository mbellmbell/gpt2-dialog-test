"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite David Fincher movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Hm, that's a good question."
"__MOVIES__ Please don't say Fight Club."
"__MOVIES__ But it's so good!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's good, but I never really got that into it."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the ending after the twist, but before that it's just so over the top with the violence."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it like a commentary on masculinity?"
"__MOVIES__ Is it though? It always seemed more like it was glorifying it."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. Everything goes badly in the end!"
"__MOVIES__ Only sort of, though."
"__MOVIES__ We never even know if Tyler and Marla live when the buildings come down."
"__MOVIES__ i think they do live, since they were talking about it as a place to watch the show."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, true. I just don't think the end justifies the means, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I sort of get what you're saying."
"__MOVIES__ You should check out other movies that are hard to figure out if you're into that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I should."
"__MOVIES__ You should try Donnie Darko or Mulholland Drive."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, Mulholland Drive is great."
"__MOVIES__ I know, one of my favorite movies."
