"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you recognize the blonde guy in Saw?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, but I couldn't place where I knew him from. It bugged me the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ What if I said, 'as you wish'?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh!"
"__MOVIES__ Now you recognize him, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Westley!"
"__MOVIES__ From the Princess Bride!"
"__MOVIES__ Why didn't you point him out to me sooner?"
"__MOVIES__ I figured you'd get it eventually. Plus I didn't want to ruin it for you if you'd picture him as Westly and not this character."
"__MOVIES__ I probably would have at that."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it weird to see Cary Elwes in such a different role?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's probably why I didn't recognize him."
"__MOVIES__ He's still just as good looking even as the participant of a macabre game."
"__MOVIES__ If not more so. At least in this role he looks more approachable and normal."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I get what you mean. And not playing the outlandishly suave dread pirate Roberts."
"__MOVIES__ I'll still take him as the masked sword fighter any day."
"__MOVIES__ Who wouldn't?"
"__MOVIES__ Well now I'm curious what other movies he's been in."
"__MOVIES__ Well, not a movie, but I remember him being in Psych as an art thief."
"__MOVIES__ I can picture that."
