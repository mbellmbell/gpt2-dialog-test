"__STAR_WARS__ Why were Luke and Leia sent to different families on different planets after Padme's death?"
"__STAR_WARS__ To make it more difficult for Darth Vader to find them."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Darth Vader, or Anakin was their father."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but remember Aaikin killed all the Jedi children when he turned to the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you think he would have killed his own children?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  He had turned completely to the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Vader rejected the dark side at the end of 'Return of the Jedi'."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but when Luke and Leia were born, he would have killed them if he could find them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably so."
"__STAR_WARS__ Defiantly so.  That is why Kenobi hid them from him."
