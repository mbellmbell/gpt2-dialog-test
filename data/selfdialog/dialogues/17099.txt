"__MOVIES__ You know what's strange? Spy Kids and Machete take place in the same universe."
"__MOVIES__ No, really, Danny Trejo plays the same character in each of the Spy Kids movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's weird. I wonder what other movies have subtle shared universes."
"__MOVIES__ I think the Quentin Tarantino movies take place in the same universe."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, some people say the Pixar movies take place in the same universe."
"__MOVIES__ That one probably isn't true. The Marvel films all share a universe, though."
"__MOVIES__ That's obvious. Though, also made by Disney."
"__MOVIES__ Some people think that Tangled and Frozen exist in the same universe. That's Disney too."
"__MOVIES__ Heck, if you want to take it further, some people think all Disney films exist in the same universe."
"__MOVIES__ Man, I miss the days when movies were just one and done."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean? No sequels?"
"__MOVIES__ No sequels, no interlocking, connected universe. Just one movie, beginning, middle, end, over."
"__MOVIES__ We still get movies like that. They're just not big blockerbuster hits."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right. Even on the rare occasion I want a sequel to a movie like that, I never get one."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ District 9. Great movie that felt fine on its own, but I would love a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ It could still happen. I mean, even Unbreakable is getting a sequel all this time later."
"__MOVIES__ Two, technically, if you count Split."
"__MOVIES__ Talk about secret shared universes, there you go!"
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, you're right. That's a franchise that started out as a single story, unconnected into everything, then blossomed into a shared universe."
