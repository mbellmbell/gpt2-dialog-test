"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Man, when Dom drove off in one direction and Brian the other at the end I was in tears."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ To be frank that is not why I go to those movies. It is all about the cars and the capers they pull."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They have some of the greatest car stunts I have ever seen. I love to watch it on the big screen."
