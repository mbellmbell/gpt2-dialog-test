"__MUSIC__ What do you think about music in movies?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Like the background music that plays."
"__MUSIC__ I think it can get a little cheesy at times."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah totally."
"__MUSIC__ But, it's definitely necessary to make the movie more interesting."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Like if a movie was just talking, then it would be kind of boring."
"__MUSIC__ What movies best utilize music you think?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably action movies."
"__MUSIC__ Ah yeah. The action scenes need to have music to be more epic."
"__MUSIC__ Can you imagine a fight scene without and music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it would be punches and grunts."
"__MUSIC__ Action music can be pretty enjoyable in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's intense, dramatic, and actually sounds pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't listen to it in my free time though"
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of noisy, and like I said, a little cheesy."
"__MUSIC__ To each his own."
"__MUSIC__ I guess so."
