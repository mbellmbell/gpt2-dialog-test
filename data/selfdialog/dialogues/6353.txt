"__STAR_WARS__ My brother's favorite character is Lando."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  He's not very memorable in my opinion."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lando is cool though.  Fast talking guy, can get out of a situation easily."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's already someone like that called Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but where do you think Han learned it from?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Lando also stabbed them in the back and basically got Han frozen."
"__STAR_WARS__ He didn't mean to, he didn't have a choice."
"__STAR_WARS__ He did have a choice and he screwed it up."
"__STAR_WARS__ He helped get him free eventually though, don't forget about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but who wants to be frozen in carbonite?  Lando has lots of blame for that."
