"__THRILLER__ The other night, I sat down and watched the classic 1970's thriller, Jaws. You've seen that one, right?"
"__THRILLER__ Of course I've seen Jaws, but it's been a long time. I remember thinking it was great."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, it is a great movie. And for being over four decades old, I still think it holds up."
"__THRILLER__ I would assume it does. It's been at least a few years since I've watched it, but I remember enjoying it and felt it has aged well."
"__THRILLER__ I think one of the best things about Jaws is how you really don't see how much of the actual shark."
"__THRILLER__ That is a brilliant thing, but I remember watching a documentary that said that was not supposed to be the case."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I remember hearing that, too. Because the mechanical shark did not work too often, they had to come up something else."
"__THRILLER__ That is correct and therefore Steven Spielberg then had to have the shark implied."
"__THRILLER__ Do you think that single change made the movie even better?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I do. There is nothing scarier then something you can't see."
