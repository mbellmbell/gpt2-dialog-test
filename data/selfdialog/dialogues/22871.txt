"__DISNEY__ I want to rewatch all of the Pirates of the Caribbean."
"__DISNEY__ They are amazing, we do need a new marathon now that there is another one out."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think they could have picked a better actor for Captain Jack."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, the entire movie series would be different had he been played by someone else."
"__DISNEY__ Have you heard if Dead Men Tell No Lies will be the last?"
"__DISNEY__ I have, I hope it's one of those things where in a year or two we'll hear they are making another."
"__DISNEY__ I guess the way the story plays out it could just be the beginning of the end. Meaning we'll get another couple movies at least."
"__DISNEY__ That would be fantastic, I'm not ready to say goodbye to all of them yet."
"__DISNEY__ As long as they don't start doing a bunch of weird spin offs, those are rarely ever good."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I don't know, I'd love some spin offs of some shows I miss a lot, just to feel the story live a bit again."
