"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are you planning on checking out the new DJ Khaled album?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not really."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why not?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He seems to only work with newer artists. I don't know any of them."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's not true. He's got songs with Nas, Fat Joe, and Raekwon on the new album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a pleasant surprise."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And either way, his music with the newer artists isn't bad."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who else has he worked with."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's done songs with guys like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake. All solid rappers."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Alright, then. I'll give them a chance."
