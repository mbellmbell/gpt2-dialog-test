"__MOVIES__ Are you excited for The Mummy reboot?"
"__MOVIES__ I sort of am, but not sure."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the original trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ The first was fun, the second as well, but less so. The third was okay but I think I grew out of it."
"__MOVIES__ What about the extensions?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ The Scorpion King has its own trilogy, I think."
"__MOVIES__ I won't go near those; they're awful."
"__MOVIES__ So, what would it take to make you see the new movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It would have to have great reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it will?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. Tom Cruise makes good movies."
"__MOVIES__ Plus he runs all over the place."
"__MOVIES__ They even have a 'run while the floor around you is collapsing' trope in the trailer, which I hate."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know who plays the actual mummy?"
"__MOVIES__ No idea, who?"
"__MOVIES__ Sofia Boutella"
"__MOVIES__ Never heard of her -- what's she been in?"
"__MOVIES__ She was most recently Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond."
"__MOVIES__ Ooooh, gotcha. Eh, she hasn't won me over yet."
