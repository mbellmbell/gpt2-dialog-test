"__MUSIC__ Are you going to a music festival this summer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I'm going to attend Pitchfork Music Festival with some people."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, who's on the line up this year?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't remember all of the bands, but LCD Soundsystem is headlining, along with Broken Social Scene and the Dirty Projectors"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, LCD Soundsystem! I haven't seen them since their 'final' show at Madison Square Garden!"
"__MUSIC__ This will be my first time seeing them, so I'm very excited!"
"__MUSIC__ You're in for a treat! They're incredible live, like MIND blowing."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think about the reunion?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was a bit cheap at first, but I'm just glad that more people get to see and hear this incredible band!"
"__MUSIC__ Right on! What about you, are you going to a festival?"
"__MUSIC__ I just bought a house, so money is tight this summer. However, I'm going to drive to Chicago in September to see the last day of Riot Fest because Jawbreaker is playing"
"__MUSIC__ Jawbreaker? Never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ They're a punk/emo band from the 90s. They're from the San Francisco Bay Area sound, they played shows with Green Day and Nirvana back in the day, but broke up after signing to a major label."
"__MUSIC__ What happened? Why weren't they huge like NOFX or Rancid?"
"__MUSIC__ They signed to a major label and received a ton of backlash for being 'sellouts.' Their record 'Dear You' was a critical and commercial failure, but many people still adored it and the band. They've become a bit of a cult sensation over the last few decades."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that sounds interesting. Maybe I should check them out sometime soon. Any recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ If you were into punk in the 90s then you won't be disappointed! Pick up the aforementioned 'Dear You' or at least listen to the song 'Boxcar' on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I'm pulling them up on Spotify right now."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Hope you dig it and have fun at Pitchfork this year!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man, see you in the pit!"
