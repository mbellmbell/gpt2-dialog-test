"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I took my kids to see it."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Emma Watson was better than I expected. Dan Stevens was great. And of course Audra McDonald was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Did the kids like it?"
"__MOVIES__ You could say so. My daughter's been listening to the soundtrack nonstop ever since."
"__MOVIES__ Did your son like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, although he was a little too fond of Gaston for my taste!"
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like Gaston?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the actor was great, but he's not exactly an admirable character, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ That's definitely true."
"__MOVIES__ But we had a nice chat about how he made fun of Belle for reading and being smart."
"__MOVIES__ Teachable moment, eh?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! There's always a few."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it on opening night, but I wouldn't mind seeing it again."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither."
"__MOVIES__ I want to hear the Beast's new song."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that one, but I wonder why they changed it from the original."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't really all that different, was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think so. But I still liked it."
