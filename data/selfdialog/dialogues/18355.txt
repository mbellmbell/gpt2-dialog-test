"__MOVIES__ I remember when The Conjuring first came out and everyone said it was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ It was. It was super scary!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I wanted to see for myself, so I rented it. It was okay, but nothing special."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe you didn't like it. Didn't you think it was frightening?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I liked the story, and I liked the characters, but I didn't think it was scary."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad. I guess it isn't for everything."
"__MOVIES__ Well, later that year, it was Halloween, and I didn't have anything to watch, so I thought I'd rent a couple films. One was Lights Out, the other was The Conjuring 2."
"__MOVIES__ How did that go?"
"__MOVIES__ Lights Out was okay. Kind of interesting, but not too scary. But I gotta say, The Conjuring 2 really blew me away!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! Really, you liked it that much?"
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't that scary, but everything just clicked for me otherwise. The characters, the setting, and I just loved it."
"__MOVIES__ That's great! It's funny you mention Lights Out, too, since James Wan the director of those movies also produced that!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he also produced that Annabelle spin-off which I also later rented. I liked it too, but not as much as the Conjuring films."
"__MOVIES__ Annabelle is okay. A second one is going to come out soon."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and I'll be sure to rent it some time. It looks better than the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it'll be an Ouija scenario where the second film really outshines the first."
"__MOVIES__ Could be. If not, there's always hope that The Nun spin-off will be good."
"__MOVIES__ I don't expect it to be as good as its parent films, but fingers crossed that it isn't all bad."
"__MOVIES__ I'll probably watch that at some point too, but I just hope we got a Conjuring 3!"
"__MOVIES__ You and me both, man! You and me both!"
