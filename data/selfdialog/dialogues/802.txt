"__MUSIC__ What kinds of music do you like to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I like most kinds of music, but it depends on what I'm doing at the time.  That determines the music that I listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean.  If you look at my music list on my phone, you would have no idea what my favorite is."
"__MUSIC__ If I want to relax, then there's nothing better then soft classical or soft jazz.  It makes me so relaxed that I want to take a nap."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean.  If I want to work out, then I don't think you can beat 80's rock."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love 80's rock.  Brings back such great memories."
"__MUSIC__ I think some of the latest pop music kind of does that as well.  Some of it's good to work out with."
"__MUSIC__ It really depends on the beat.  I like a lot of Bruno Mars stuff.  He's easy to walk on the treadmill or jog with."
"__MUSIC__ I especially like 'Uptown Funk.'  That has a great beat."
"__MUSIC__ I like how catchy it is.  At a wedding I was at, the band played that.  People kept requesting it because it was so easy to dance with."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'm weird, but I also like listening to that ambient music, especially at work.  It helps drown out other sounds."
"__MUSIC__ I used to play that in my kids' rooms when they were going to sleep.  I think it helped them to relax and get to sleep."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like country music?"
"__MUSIC__ Really, there are only a few artists that I like.  I always liked Tim McGraw and I still like George Strait and Toby Keith."
"__MUSIC__ I like dancing to country music, but I don't really just listen to it at home."
"__MUSIC__ I will say that I don't like hip-hop.  There is some rap music that I like though."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  If you were in my car, I would drive you crazy though.  I flip around a lot on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I drive my kids crazy."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'm just a lover of music, and I hate to define one specific type that I listen to exclusively."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  There is good music in a lot of different genres.  There's so much talent out there."
