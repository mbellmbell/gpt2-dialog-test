"__DISNEY__ Wasn't Tom Hanks in Toy Story?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so, was that the movie with the cowboy and the space explorer?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! They were toys that came to life at night. I think Tom Hanks was the voice of the cowboy."
"__DISNEY__ You're right, and Tim Allen was the voice of the space explorer, Buzz Lightyear!"
"__DISNEY__ I remember watching that show as a kid and being so afraid of the neighbor boy, Sid."
"__DISNEY__ He was such a bad kid!"
"__DISNEY__ I was so scared when the toys were stuck at Sid's house, but the best part was when they escaped."
"__DISNEY__ With the help of the other toys! The barbie doll legs with the hook head and the baby that had spider legs."
"__DISNEY__ They seemed scary at first but were actually good!"
"__DISNEY__ I know! Those toys just had bad luck being with Sid."
