"__STAR_WARS__ What is with all the killer moons in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's no moon! It's a trap!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly! Two death stars and then Starkiller base. Shouldn't they expect that by now."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they handled that well in The Force Awakens. Han made jokes about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know, by blowing up three bases of that size the Jedi have killed more people than died on Alderaan."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought about that. They were all bad people though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not necessarily. They were probably full of innocent droids and slaves."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh no! Probably maintenance workers too. I doubt the storm troopers were cooking their own meals."
"__STAR_WARS__ Face it. Luke and the Jedi are a mass murderers with good intentions."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, you just ruined Star Wars for me."
