"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you heard any new Lady Gaga music lately?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No I haven't. I did hear Bad Romance the other day."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, I like that one. It makes me want to sing along."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me too. And I did. Even though I don't know all the words."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't either, I just stumble along with it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think my favorite one is still Paparrazzi."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, was that her first one?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No I think Poker Face was."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah Poker Face, still a good sing-a-long song, too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I really can't think of a song of hers that I don't like."
