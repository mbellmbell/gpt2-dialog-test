"__MUSIC__ How does that work?"
"__MUSIC__ I may like a song and have no urge to seek out anything else by the band or artist. It's just how I am."
"__MUSIC__ I can't imagine that. If I find an artist I like, I try to get everything they perform."
"__MUSIC__ Do you use iTunes?"
"__MUSIC__ Now I do. Back in the day, I would pirate music on Napster and such."

"__MUSIC__ There aren't a lot of those kinds of sites anymore. It's mostly torrents now."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes if I can't find something, I'll look it up on YouTube and make a recording with Audacity."
