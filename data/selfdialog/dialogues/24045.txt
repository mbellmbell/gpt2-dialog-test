"__SUPERHERO__ Why is Iron Man such a jerk?"
"__SUPERHERO__ He's just confident, that's all."
"__SUPERHERO__ No, he's a jerk.  Every movie he's been in, he's been a complete jerk to anyone that gets near him."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's part of his allure.  He's an anti-hero of sorts."
"__SUPERHERO__ It doesn't help that Robert Downey plays him and he strikes me as kind of a jerk in real life too."
"__SUPERHERO__ You seem very opinionated on this."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, I'm just a bit sick that Iron Man has been in, what, five, six movies now and he's the same guy he was since the beginning?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Some characters don't have the same story arc."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm hoping they kill him off in the next Avengers movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ I bet they will actually.  His story is pretty much over at this point."
