"__MUSIC__ That music sounds strange. What language is it in?"
"__MUSIC__ This is a Japanese band called Sound Horizon. They're what's known as a revolving door band."
"__MUSIC__ It has a nice beat. What is a revolving door band?"
"__MUSIC__ That's where the band has only one or two core members, and they bring in other musicians and artists to perform with them for a set period of time. In this case, Revo founded the band and is the only core member."
"__MUSIC__ What genre does he play in?"
"__MUSIC__ He incorporates a lot of different styles in his music. He even uses different languages and draws from different eras through history."
"__MUSIC__ Like the Revolutionary War?"
"__MUSIC__ Each album more or less encompasses a story he's created that takes elements of history, culture, or a language and builds around it. For this album, 'Seisen no Iberia', he took the Iberian Peninsula war and created a love story,"
"__MUSIC__ That explains why the music has an almost Latin feel in some places."
"__MUSIC__ If you listen to the lyrics, the woman uses fragments of Arabic, while the man, Revo's character named Shaytan, uses Spanish."
"__MUSIC__ He's very talented, then. Who writes the music for him?"
"__MUSIC__ He composes it himself, and even writes his own lyrics. He also has an album based around France and the tradition of burying infants and children with dolls."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that was a thing."
"__MUSIC__ Another album, called Marchen, is set in Germany and has references back to the Black Plague as well as Spanish conquistadors. Revo is a master at weaving his albums together so that all of them take place in the same universe."
"__MUSIC__ There aren't many bands that produce music in the form of full stories. I'll have to look them up."
"__MUSIC__ Revo also has a band named Linked Horizon. He even works solo to compose music for anime, such as the opening for the new Sailor Moon series."
"__MUSIC__ Anime music can have a lot of variances in how it sounds."
"__MUSIC__ That's even true with him, but most of his music you can tell comes from him. He has a tendency to incorporate orchestral scores that give his music the sensation of grandeur."
"__MUSIC__ Does he play any instruments as well?"
"__MUSIC__ He has a signature guitar that he likes to use for live performances. He also plays the accordion,"
