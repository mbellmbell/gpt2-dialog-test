"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So have you ever been into rap or hip hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ A bit.  I really liked mid-2000s era, with 50 Cent's first album, Ludacris and the Bit Tymers from that era."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah that was a good party era.  How about the hardcore rap of the '90s."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I didn't get too into that, but I remember it.  I specifically remember that was when MC Hammer fell from grace."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, that was too bad.  He didn't keep up with the times and his 'party-pop' style went out of style."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I watched the VH1 movie about his life and it was interesting.  I remember saying 'I'm hyped!' like he said when he was getting ready to record a song."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I saw that one too.  It was the part when he was on Death Row Records and he was trying to get relevant again."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Haha, those scenes with him and Tupac Shakur were funny!  He said, 'Let's get you up and all perky' and Tupac said , 'You're gonna get yourself shot!'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah classic.  Fun stuff indeed."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Did you see the movie Straight Outta Compton?"
