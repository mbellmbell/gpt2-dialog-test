"__MUSIC__ Ever heard of Cage the Elephant?"
"__MUSIC__ The band out of Kentucky?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard a few songs by them."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty good, they kind of have a 60's vibe about them."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that. Have you heard their new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Not sure, when did it come out?"
"__MUSIC__ Last year, it's called Tell Me I'm Pretty."
"__MUSIC__ Don't think I've heard of it. What are some of the songs from it?"
"__MUSIC__ There's Cold, Cold, Cold, Mess Around and Trouble."
"__MUSIC__ I think I heard Trouble before on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ All those songs are on the radio now. They're hitting it big, they even won a Grammy this year."
"__MUSIC__ Really, I always thought of them as a small indy band."
"__MUSIC__ Me too but they're hitting the big time now."
"__MUSIC__ That's great for them. I'm from Kentucky and love seeing local boys turned good."
"__MUSIC__ They are also getting their stuff on TV and movies as well. I heard Trouble on the Netflix show Santa Clarita Diet."
"__MUSIC__ I think I remember that, very fitting song for the show."
"__MUSIC__ Indeed, you should check out their older stuff as well, I think you'll dig it."
"__MUSIC__ I will, thanks for the suggestion."
