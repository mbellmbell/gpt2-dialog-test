"__MOVIES__ Do you remember Lost Boys from 1987?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was such a cool vampire movie back then."
"__MOVIES__ I know the vampires were starting to get cool. Now they are almost too cool for their own good."
"__MOVIES__ I know. That movie had a little bit of camp and humor thrown in with horror."
"__MOVIES__ I remember. I thought it was a little scary then but pretty entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ The make up was pretty good. Later the vampires in Buffy would kind of look like Keifer Sutherland."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that guy had some wicked eyebrows. I think there were 2 sequels that followed."
"__MOVIES__ There were. Lost Boys: The Tribe and Lost Boys: The Thirst and spawned the franchise by the same name."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Corey Feldman in all three?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, he actually seems to quintessential 1980's."
"__MOVIES__ He did a slew of films in a similar genre. Gremlins (1984), The Goonies (1985), Stand by Me (1986), The Lost Boys (1987) and The 'Burbs (1989)."
"__MOVIES__ I remember most of those. I like the comedy horror aspect of them"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those were pretty good but I remember thinking Lost Boys was a different kind of movie that the ones I had seen before then."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too. There is always that insurmountable conflict and the heroic act that creates resolution."
"__MOVIES__ Man, when you say it like that, it totally takes the fun out of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Hehe, 2 semesters of film class."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that. We actually talked about Lost Boys and how it brought about a more youthful vampire."
"__MOVIES__ You mean very un-grandpa like. For instance the Munsters or Vincent Price."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those dudes were old then but this new vampire takes it out of the Dracula realm."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. It will be interesting to see where they go with from here."
