"__MOVIES__ I read an article today about how they are warning there has been a big increase in the number of great white sharks on the east coast."
"__MOVIES__ Uh oh, just like the movie Jaws."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, it's that time of the year. Every July, the sharks are out and so are the people on the beaches. That's why they play the Jaws movies all month long every year."
"__MOVIES__ That shark in Jaws was so fake looking."
"__MOVIES__ Well, these sharks aren't fake. They said three years ago they counted eighty sharks, and last year they counted 147."
"__MOVIES__ Why are the great whites increasing so much? Does it have something to do with global warming?"
"__MOVIES__ No, they said it's because since the 70s they have been trying to help conservation of gray seals, and that's what the great whites eat."
"__MOVIES__ According to the Jaws movie, they like to eat people."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't allowed to watch the Jaws movies when they came out. I was a young teen and my parents said they were too scary."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's not like you ever had to worry about it living in Indiana. The worst thing about the beaches on Lake Michigan are the rip currents. That's what kills people every year who go too far out."
"__MOVIES__ Back then, parents were a lot more conservative about what they let kids watch on tv and at the movies. No violence, scary stuuf, cussing, sexual scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. My sister's grandson came over last summer, and wanted to watch one of my dvds, Fast and Furious 7. I asked him if his dad lets him watch those movies at home, and he said yes and was telling me all about them to prove he's watched them. He's only six years old."
"__MOVIES__ Six is too young to be watching movies like The Fast and The Furious. He should be watching Disney movies at that age."
"__MOVIES__ His dad would probably let him watch the Jaws movies then if they are on this summer."
"__MOVIES__ I was 14 and my parents wouldn't let me go to the movies and see it."
"__MOVIES__ I probably would let a 14 year old watch Jaws, but not a six year old."
"__MOVIES__ To tell the truth, it's probably better I didn't watch it back then. I was the type to scare easily and have nightmares. I still don't watch scary movies nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ But you're comfortable now with Jaws?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, last summer when I was watching it, I was sitting really close to the tv, and talking to my daughter and son-in-law. I wasn't paying close attention, and I looked over at the screen, and suddenly the shark jumped up on the screen, and I jumped back. Everyone had a good laugh at me."
"__MOVIES__ Oh how funny. I would have laughed too."
