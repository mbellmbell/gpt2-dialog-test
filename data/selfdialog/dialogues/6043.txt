"__STAR_WARS__ Which is better: Episode I or II?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, they're both awful."
"__STAR_WARS__ Awfully entertaining!"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, they're just bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, which is worse, hater?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Episode I for sure. Two has awful dialogue, but One has no actual use."
"__STAR_WARS__ They found Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and that's it. Plus, he's obnoxious."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know he got bullied so hard he quit acting, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Guess the Force wasn't strong with him, was it?"
