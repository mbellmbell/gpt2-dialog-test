"__DISNEY__ Did you like 'Finding Nemo?'"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was cute, but I liked the sequel way better."
"__DISNEY__ Disney movies are some of the rare exceptions in film, in that sequels are actually good."
"__DISNEY__ You're right.  Take a look at 'Toy Story 3' and how great that was."
"__DISNEY__ Don't forget the 'Pirates' franchise."
"__DISNEY__ That's right!  While the first was the best in my opinion, the second and third movies were worthy additions."
"__DISNEY__ Are there any you can think of that weren't good Disney sequels?"
"__DISNEY__ I think 'Cars 2.'"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, that was pretty bad.  Though I am curious about what the third movie will be like."
"__DISNEY__ I am too.  I hope the third installation redeems the 'Cars' franchise."
