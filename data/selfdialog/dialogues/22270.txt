"__DISNEY__ What did you find?"
"__DISNEY__ My old Pinocchio video."
"__DISNEY__ I remember that. Parts of it kind of scared me."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's surprising how many kids movies have scary elements in them."
"__DISNEY__ The whole Monstro thing freaked me out."
"__DISNEY__ You mean when the whale swallowed him?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. That and when they were turned into donkeys."
"__DISNEY__ What was up with that?"
"__DISNEY__ Trying to teach us about following rules, but what a scare tactic!"
