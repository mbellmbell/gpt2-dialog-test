"__MUSIC__ I really enjoyed the visual album but the songs themselves were weak."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the only song i liked was Six Inch Heels."
"__MUSIC__ Is that the one with The Weeknd?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he adds something special to that song."
"__MUSIC__ That is the only stand out, i can't believe that didn't become a single."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like it is too slow for a single."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that is accurate."
"__MUSIC__ I hate how everything has to be mainstream to be a hit."
"__MUSIC__ Well think about her other great hits, they've mostly been up beat."
"__MUSIC__ That;s not true. She has great hits such as Irreplaceable and Halo."
"__MUSIC__ This makes me miss her old days."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, she should release an acoustic and raw album."
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately i don't see that happening any time soon."
"__MUSIC__ Let's hope! Maybe after this pregnancy."
