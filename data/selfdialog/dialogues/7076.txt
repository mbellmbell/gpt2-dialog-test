"__ICEHOCKEY__ Have you been watching the Stanley Cup Playoffs?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah! Have you?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, who are you cheering you?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am cheering for Nashville, as they are really the underdog and have way outperformed their expectations."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too! I love PK Subban and think the team hasn't got the credit they deserve"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They are a young team and have a lot of potential going into the future too"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Very much agreed. It's hard not to pull for a Canadian team though too."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree - I always feel a little bad that the Canadians haven't won the Cup in a while."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right - I would love to see a Nashville Ottawa final"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who would you cheer for?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think Nashville, but I wouldn't really care at that point. I don't want the Ducks or Penguins to get there"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They've won too recently, it wouldn't be that interesting"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How about Erik Karlson's play?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He basically carried Ottawa in game 7, didn't he?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, and he's such a good guy! The team basically sat on his back for the entire game, didn't he have 3 points or something?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That sounds right. I'm also shocked that Crosby is still playing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They should have pulled him out the other day in that game - when he went head first into the boards."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm going to be shocked if he makes it ten more years in the league, he has had a lot of concussions."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He might even be having the same CTE stuff that NFL players are all having issues with."
