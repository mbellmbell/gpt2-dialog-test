"__STAR_WARS__ I was shocked last year when Carrie Fisher said she had an affair with Harrison Ford."
"__STAR_WARS__ She did?  I never heard that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, supposedly while they were filming, they were having an affair."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow.  Well, they definitely had chemistry.  The sparks were almost visible."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly.  And , it's Harrison Ford.  He's a hunk."
"__STAR_WARS__ Poor Carrie Fisher.  I heard she was supposed to have a large part in the upcoming film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and her death was tragic - unexpected.  I wonder what they'll do now."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who knows.  Maybe CGI?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Star Wars franchise loves CGI, so that makes sense/"
"__STAR_WARS__ They definitely can't replace her.  Fans wouldn't support a new Leia."
