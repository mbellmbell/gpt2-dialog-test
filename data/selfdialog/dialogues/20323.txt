"__MOVIES__ My nephews are in town this weekend, and I was thinking of taking them to see a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Smart move! They'll sit still for a few hours that way."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Those kids love movies."
"__MOVIES__ How old are they?"
"__MOVIES__ One is 8 and the other is 10. Both boys."
"__MOVIES__ So what movie are you going to take them to see?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking about that new Cars sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Cars 3?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one. They like Pixar movies."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the first two Cars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, unlike my nephews, I'm not a fan of animated movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, just a fair warning - Larry the Cable Guy does the voice for one of the cars."
"__MOVIES__ Yuck, I'm not a fan of his. Who else does voice acting?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't remember who else. There's some big name actor voicing the main car."
"__MOVIES__ Now I kind of want to go see the Despicable Me sequel instead of Cars. I can't stand Larry the Cable Guy!"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you should ask your nephews which they prefer."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I could do that. But what do I do if they pick Cars 3?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you could say that the tickets are sold out."
"__MOVIES__ Very tricky! I like how you think."
"__MOVIES__ I have had to deal with kids in the past myself!"
