"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think about the Ravens' chances this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope they do better than last year but I don't know if the offense will be good enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, losing Steve Smith was tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely! Perriman is unproven and Wallace has had a good season before only to tail off the next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm personally hoping they'll sign Gary Barnidge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am too. He's not the greatest tight end but he's decent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd also like to see them sign Nick Mangold. We need a center."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes we do. I don't understand why nobody has signed him yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. How do you think Flacco will play this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully good...he needs to elevate the players around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ USA Today just listed him as the most overpaid player in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't agree with that. He's overpaid, but so are most quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he would just be postseason Joe all season long!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely, he's a beast in the playoffs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the defense? Will they be feared again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so..that's what we've always been known for, defense. They need to play better in the secondary though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do...but I think Tony Jefferson was a big signing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely was. Hopefully he and Weddle will lock it down this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's hope so...GO RAVENS!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely man, we'll find out in a few months!"
