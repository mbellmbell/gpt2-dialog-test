"__MOVIES__ Watched anything good lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw that movie 'Get Out', actually."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I heard awesome things about that!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was really great. Better than I expected."
"__MOVIES__ Did Jordan Peel write it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and direct it. It was only kinda funny though, but it wasn't supposed to be a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ I've only heard good things about it. I love the sketch show."
"__MOVIES__ It's written just as well. Really smart writing."
"__MOVIES__ Is it scary?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of - it's more jumpy than scary."
"__MOVIES__ I missed it in the cinema, I'll have to watch it on DVD."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame - I'm really glad I saw it in the cinema."
"__MOVIES__ Was it more scary?"
"__MOVIES__ That, and the kind of shared tension in the room, y'know."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that always adds to the effect. I saw The Blair Witch Project in cinemas."
"__MOVIES__ I bet that was freaky!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I wasn't even that scared, but because it was in the dark..."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't want to watch it by myself, that's for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely. I haven't watched it since then. Freaked me out too much."
"__MOVIES__ That movie freaked me out, too."
