"__DISNEY__ I told my mom last night I thought what she said was disgusting, and she just laughed at me."
"__DISNEY__ What? Why was what she said disgusting?"
"__DISNEY__ She was talking about how her neighbor brought her deer meat, and how much she loved it. I told her that was disgusting."
"__DISNEY__ So she laughed at you?"
"__DISNEY__ She laughed cause I said how could you eat Bambi?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that Disney movie Bambi really was touching."
"__DISNEY__ I cried so hard when Bambi's mother got shot in that movie. I was only seven, and I have never forgot that moment."
"__DISNEY__ I know, that seems like too sensitive for something in a kid's movie."
"__DISNEY__ I loved Bambi, and his little friend the skunk Flower, and his little friend the rabbit Thumper. I don't know how anyone could eat Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean, I've never eaten deer either. They're too cute to eat."
