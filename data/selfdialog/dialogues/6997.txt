"__ICEHOCKEY__ Man, did you see the end to the Penguins and Senators game last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that was such a good game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Of course, it's always a good game when Pittsburgh loses!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You can say that again."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Bobby Ryan is really turning his season around in the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know, to think he ended up on the 4th line during the regular season ans now he's back to his scoring form."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The way he was able to beat the D and then the goalie was awesome."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know Fleury never had a chance."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Kessel must of broke his stick when that goal went in."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know the way he hit the cross bar at the end of the 3rd was crazy."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm sure they'll come out flying for game 2"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I bet, being held to 1 goal will not sit well for them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If I were the Penguins coach I would not change a thing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Agreed, even their defense played well which is a shock."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If I was Ottawa I'd play the same style, clog the neutral zone and do not let them enter with speed."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yep, and on offense I'd chip into the corner and play the body."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh yeah, try and wear down that defense which is already hurt."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'd love to see Ottawa take the 2nd game as well and shut the fans up for once."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Time for someone else to come out of the East."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Either way I'm pulling for the Western conference, who ever that may be."
