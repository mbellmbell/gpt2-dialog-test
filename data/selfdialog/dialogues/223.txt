"__MUSIC__ If you could see any band in concert, who would it be?"
"__MUSIC__ I would love to see Tool in concert."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard they put a really good show on."
"__MUSIC__ Yes same here, and they are still touring as well."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Where abouts have they been touring?"
"__MUSIC__ I have heard they play in the Northwest quite a lot."
"__MUSIC__ I would love to see them as well. They had such a unique sound."
"__MUSIC__ Yes they do, it is easy to pick out a Tool song when one is playing."
"__MUSIC__ The lead singer has such a great voice."
"__MUSIC__ I know they made another band, I think it was called A Perfect Circle."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, I have heard one or two songs. Same lead singer too."
"__MUSIC__ I am unsure if it is the same other band members though."
"__MUSIC__ I would imagine they use a lot of lights and graphics when in concert."
"__MUSIC__ I have seen some videos of them in concert, and they sound great playing live."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard they sound just like their music when playing live."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that is rare for some bands to actually sound like the songs they make in studio."
"__MUSIC__ Those are the best kind though, the ones that are real and don't need special effects to sound good."
"__MUSIC__ It is another reason why I want to see them in concert!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, we have to go see where they are playing next."
"__MUSIC__ It would be a dream come true to see them play live!"
