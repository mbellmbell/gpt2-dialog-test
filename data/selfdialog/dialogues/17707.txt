"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie The Circle?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't heard of it. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Emma Watson and Tom Hanks."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that sounds like a good cast. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about social media companies breaking privacy boundaries."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds really relevant. What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately, it wasn't that good."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ It was just kind of disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It had the opportunity to be so good because it's a unique concept but it really fell flat."
"__MOVIES__ I'm surprised that it's bad with those actors in it."
"__MOVIES__ I know I figured it would be good because of Watson and Hanks, but it was just filled with unfulfilled potential."
"__MOVIES__ Was it supposed to be a joke?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it was supposed to be a serious drama, but I feel like it would have been more successful as a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess it just proves even great actors can be in bad movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it does. I wouldn't go see it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I probably won't. I don't want to waste my money."
"__MOVIES__ It would definitely be a waste."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks for the heads up."
