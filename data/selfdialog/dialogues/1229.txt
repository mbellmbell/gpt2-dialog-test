"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite movie composer?"
"__MUSIC__ Gotta be John Williams."
"__MUSIC__ Funny.  I was going to say the same thing."
"__MUSIC__ He's written all the classics."
"__MUSIC__ Star Wars is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ For me, I'd go Raiders of the Lost Ark."
"__MUSIC__ See, Star Wars is the most iconic."
"__MUSIC__ Just because of how it is on the movie scroll?"
"__MUSIC__ No, when that music hits you from the beginning, you know it's Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not denying it's a great piece of music, but Raiders is still number one."
"__MUSIC__ It's a good theme no doubt.  I like how it slowly builds."
"__MUSIC__ Right, that's why it's better than Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ That makes no sense."
"__MUSIC__ What I mean is that it doesn't hit you over the head, it's willing to wait."
"__MUSIC__ But there's just something about watching a Star Wars movie and you getting engaged from the get-go."
"__MUSIC__ I don't need music to get me engaged in Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ I guess we'll have to agree to disagree."
"__MUSIC__ But we can both agree that John Williams is awesome overall."
"__MUSIC__ No doubt.  Wonder what he'll do next?"
"__MUSIC__ It will be great though!"
