"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey how do you think the Seahawks will do this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man, their team is seeming weaker than in seasons past."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They didn't really seem like they picked anyone up from free agency in the off-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah their draft didn't seem very strong either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who knows though, they've made some good picks in past drafts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Russell Wilson turned out pretty well, and he wasn't drafted until the later rounds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just wonder if they'll ever be able to overcome that devastating loss in the super bowl a few seasons back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The one where they threw the pick on the goal line?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, against the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was such a stupid play call."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. Why would you throw the ball when you still have a time out, and its only second down?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and you have Beast Mode in the backfield. Ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should have won that game. All they had to do was hand the ball off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, even if he doesn't make it in, you still have the time out, and 3rd and 4th down to try again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't believe all the people trying to say that was the right call to throw it there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh well, I guess the Patriots just have a knack for getting gifted super bowls, the same thing happened this year too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I saw that, what a pathetic choke job by the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, all they had to do was run some clock and kick a field goal to put the game away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I hate the Patriots and Tom Brady."
