"__DISNEY__ Did you have a favorite Disney movie growing up?"
"__DISNEY__ I always loved The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ I can't watch The Lion King because it makes me cry."
"__DISNEY__ I cry when Mufasa gets trampled, but the rest of the movie is so good."
"__DISNEY__ Scar still scares me even though I'm an adult now."
"__DISNEY__ When I was little, I was scared of the elephant Boneyard."
