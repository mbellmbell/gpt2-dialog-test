"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see Rogue one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it's not one of my favorites from the Franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know what you mean, it was good though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well that's a given, anything is better than episode 2."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, I just didn't like how it ended."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well who ends a movie by killing everyone to set up a movie from 40 years ago?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was so sad when that happened."
"__STAR_WARS__ Though it was great to see the Princess again."
"__STAR_WARS__ That made me cry even more. I can't believe she died."
"__STAR_WARS__ The number of people that cried after hearing that; I'm pretty sure it raised the sea level more than global warming did."
