"__MUSIC__ Hey what's the saddest song you've ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ I'd think I'd have to go with 'See You Again' by Wiz Khalifa"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, thats definitely one of the saddest I've heard."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think that the fact it's dedicated to Paul Walker makes it even sadder for me."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that definitely."
"__MUSIC__ Every time I hear the song I literally see him driving off into the sun set and it gets me every time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I wasn't trying to ruin the mood."
"__MUSIC__ No not at all. What about you? What is the saddest song you've ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ I'd have to say 'Someone Like You' by Adele."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? How come?"
"__MUSIC__ Whne she sings it you really hear her anguish and what the song means to her."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, if I'm not mistaken she always crys at the end of the song because it's that painful for her."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I had no idea."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that song really means and represents a lot for her."
"__MUSIC__ Thats nuts, but I respect it a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Artists like her are really far and between in the industry."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I agree whole heartedly. It's very rare to have artists like that."
"__MUSIC__ I wish we would see more of them."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know it's probably best to have the few we do. It would probably numb us other wise."
