"__THRILLER__ So, did you ever see Inception?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, yeah, I LOVED that film!"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, my favorite part was that scene where those two guys are fighting and the gravity keeps shifting around on them."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, yeah, that was really cool.  Humor wise though, I thought the funniest part was where that guy turns to Ellen Page's character and he's like, 'Quick, kiss me!'"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and then he's all, 'Oh, darn, that didn't work.'"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, the whole theater laughed at that one."
"__THRILLER__ What's really amazing is few of the effects that did using computer graphics.  I've read they used them rather sparingly."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that was cool.  I only have two major nitpicks with the movie though."
"__THRILLER__ What's that?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, I didn't feel the guys on the third stage of the dream much of a threat, even though they had automatic and stuff.  And two, too many movies started using that 'bwwwwwwang' sound in their trailers."
