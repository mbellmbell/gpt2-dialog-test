"__MUSIC__ Do you know much about Jazz music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really. It's never appealed very much to me."
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't that fond of it either. But I've been changing my mind."
"__MUSIC__ What's caused you to change your mind?"
"__MUSIC__ The catalyst for it was my trip to Oakland. I went to a Jazz club."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I remember you mentioning that trip."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, probably the highlight of the trip was going to that club."
"__MUSIC__ Live music in general is pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ In this case, the person playing was Mose Allison, apparently a really famous Jazz musician."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ I hadn't either. Apparently he's been in movies and stuff."
"__MUSIC__ So the music was good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was amazing! A lot of improvisation - Jazz is famous for that."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard that."
"__MUSIC__ So now I've been listening to Jazz more."
"__MUSIC__ What artists have you been sampling from?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of the old greats. Thelonius Monk, Louie Armstrong, guys like that."
"__MUSIC__ I always feel like I should give that music a shot, but I never do."
"__MUSIC__ That's how I was for a long time. But that Jazz club made me a convert."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's cool you found some new music!"
