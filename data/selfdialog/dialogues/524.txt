"__MUSIC__ You know how once in a while you listen to someone and expect to dislike their music because of their image?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that happens to me sometimes. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I just listened to Pink's album 'I'm Not Dead' and I really like it."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't expect to?"
"__MUSIC__ Whenever I think about her I get this image of a drunk rocker chick sticking her pierced tongue out at me and then puking on my shoes."
"__MUSIC__ That's vivid, and kind of icky."
"__MUSIC__ Right? But I listened to the album and really liked it!"
"__MUSIC__ What did you like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ I think most of it is actually her voice. I really like her voice."
"__MUSIC__ What about it do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's gravelly but somehow it doesn't sound like it hurts."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the raspy kind of sound?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Sometimes that sound in men doesn't bug me but it almost always does in women."
"__MUSIC__ Most female rock singers do have smoother voices than hers."
"__MUSIC__ But hers doesn't bug me. It reminds me of an old jazz singer in a spy movie."
"__MUSIC__ Sultry and smokey?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! That and there's one song near the end of the album that really sold me."
"__MUSIC__ What's the last song? I've heard a lot of her music but not in album order."
"__MUSIC__ The One That Got Away I think is the title. It's the 11th song and it's this cool solo acoustic story-song which I loved."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard that one, but will definitely look it up!"
