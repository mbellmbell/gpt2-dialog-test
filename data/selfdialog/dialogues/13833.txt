"__BASKETBALL__ Are you ready for another Cavs Warriors finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am. It's exciting but it makes the games leading up to the Finals really boring."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know. There hasn't been a competitive series that has involved those teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's great for the league to have two really good teams, but it makes the playoffs worse until the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ And it'll probably be the same next year. I can't see Lebron declining anytime soon."
"__BASKETBALL__ The guy never gets injured and never loses any of his athleticism."
"__BASKETBALL__ How old is he?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He's going to be 33 by next year. Most NBA players start slowing down after 30."
"__BASKETBALL__ The most impressive thing about Lebron is his durability."
"__BASKETBALL__ The fact that he came into the league at 19 and simply has not stopped producing."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's a machine. People are saying he could play like this until he's 40."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he'll retire the moment he notices himself slowing down."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. He won't be able to mentally handle not being the best in the world."
"__BASKETBALL__ The guy has believed he's better than his peers since the age of 16. He's not going to accept a smaller role."
"__BASKETBALL__ So when do you think he'll retire"
"__BASKETBALL__ In five years. Probably 38 or 39."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's it? We both agree he'll be every bit as good next year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but he'll want to retire while he's on top."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think we'll view Lebron as the greatest player ever."
"__BASKETBALL__ It depends on these next five years. If he wins 2 more championships, I believe we have to."
