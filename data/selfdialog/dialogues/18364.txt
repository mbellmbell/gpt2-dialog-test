"__MOVIES__ Have you watched any movies on Netflix recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I have! We watched 'Trolls' last week."
"__MOVIES__ 'Trolls'?!? The animated movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was cute!"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that a child's movie?"
"__MOVIES__ We watched it while my husband's parents were in town. No kids either!"
"__MOVIES__ Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ I like it! There were some funny jokes, and it had a great message."
"__MOVIES__ It looks like the visual colors and animation of it are very appealing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the colors are bright, and I'm sure it engages kids who watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Justin Timberlake in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he did the voice of one of the main characters. There are a ton of famous actors in it."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Who else?"
"__MOVIES__ Anna Kendrick, Zooey Deschanel, Russell Brand, Gwen Stefani, and James Corden are all in it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! That's a lot of big names for an animated movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure there are others too that I just did not pick up on."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. I may have to give it a try."
"__MOVIES__ You should. I mean, if you don't like it at least you didn't pay anything extra if you stream it from Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Good point."
"__MOVIES__ I think you'll be suprised though, and really enjoy it."
