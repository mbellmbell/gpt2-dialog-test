"__HARRY_POTTER__ So do you think Draco got a fair shake in the story?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know, he was a spoiled brat but if you had to go to school with Harry Potter, it might be annoying."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Actually, I think Harry and I would have been friends."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? I don't know what house I would have been put in but those actors did not look like what I imagined compared to the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No? Snape was casted well and so was the first Dumbledore. Harry was okay...but Ron was supposed to have a long skinny nose."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, Hermione....don't get me started. Her hair was fake frizzy and it took me while to get used to her. Not what I imagined."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me neither. I'm not sure Voldemort looked right either."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it's not anything like what I imagined though I'm not sure what that was...given the description in the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe more like the James Earl Jones in Conan the Barbarian?!?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, that would have been cool."
