"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Enya?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. It is a female artist or a group?"
"__MUSIC__ Enya is a lady and she has the most beautiful music I have ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music does she sing? It sounds like it is not heavy metal or rock."
"__MUSIC__ Not at all... Enya sings like an angel and she has the most soft almost spiritual sounding background music."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I like that kind of music. It helps me to relax."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah... before my mom passed away she asked me to play Enya for her. My family and I played Enya in the background for almost 10 hours straight."
"__MUSIC__ Aw.. that sounds so sad.. Your mom loved Irish music. Is Enya Irish?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually she is. As far as I know Enya is born and raised in Ireland. She even owns a castle that she uses for her home."
"__MUSIC__ Is here music like traditional Irish ballads? I know your mom liked that stuff."
"__MUSIC__ No, actually Enya is more lie new age music. It is hard to describe since she is just so unique."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm. I love new age stuff. Is it like Yanni?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually it is Enya, though, has her own twist that I find to be unlike any other."
"__MUSIC__ Are all Enya's sounds the same.. like the same music in the background?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that s another thing I love about Enya. She seems to have an eerie, almost scary, song on each of her albums."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of scary? Like loud and 'catch you off guard type'?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that's what makes Enya's eeriness more unique. Her song still keeps that soft soothing sound but with this fright to it."
"__MUSIC__ Wow.. I think I may like to hear her."
"__MUSIC__ If you pick up one of Enya's albums you have to listen to the whole thing straight through to really get her theme."
"__MUSIC__ I will definitely check Enya out. She really sounds like someone I would like to listen to."
