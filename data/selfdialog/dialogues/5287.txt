"__STAR_WARS__ Who was the better mentor to Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi or Yoda?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course Yoda is the better mentor!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is Yoda the better mentor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's because Obi Wan Kenobi got killed by Darth Vader in the first movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ah, that's true."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right! Obi Wan Kenobi did not really teach Luke Skywalker anything before he died."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he told him about the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ He did, but Yoda was the one who helped train Luke Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would of been better if he was trained by the both of them at the same time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! He would have better skills."
