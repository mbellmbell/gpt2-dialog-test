"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think will be picked for MVP this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron James."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he sounds like the obvious pick."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you want to see get it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Anyone but Isaiah Thomas."
"__BASKETBALL__ Isaiah's the new bad boy in the league, isn't he?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Nah, he just needs to control his temper a bit."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's no Dennis Rodman, that's for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Rodman was a real character, wasn't he? Did he ever win MVP?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I doubt it."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'd like to see Kawhi Leonard of the Spurs become MVP."
"__BASKETBALL__ What are his chances?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he has a decent chance. He's team's highest scorer."
"__BASKETBALL__ Advancing in the playoffs would probably help him get the award."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron James will probably get it, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ When will the award be announced?"
"__BASKETBALL__ After the end of season."
"__BASKETBALL__ After? Since when?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Since this year. It's the first time the NBA has waited until the season is over to announce the MVP."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess they want to build up the anticipation, or something."
