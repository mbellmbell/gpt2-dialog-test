"__MUSIC__ Do you know if Green Day still makes music."
"__MUSIC__ As far as I know, they do. I haven't heard anything from them recently."
"__MUSIC__ True, it's been a while since I've heard something from them."
"__MUSIC__ The last song I remember is 'Know Your Enemy', and I believe that came out in 2009."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that song came out that long ago? That's almost a decade ago."
"__MUSIC__ For real, time has flown. Just think, it's been over 20 years since Green Day came on the scene."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, back in the days of High School. I still remember when Basket Case came out."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, 1994, I believe it was."
"__MUSIC__ They took off right after Basket Case and made hit after hit for the next decade."
"__MUSIC__ Some hard following fans would suggest they sold out."
"__MUSIC__ I prefer to think they made it big."
"__MUSIC__ They seemed to get too political also sometime in the middle of the 2000's. I hate when artists become political."
"__MUSIC__ For real. I think that the whole American Idiot album was a backlash against George W Bush."
"__MUSIC__ It was around that time of the 2004 election and many people saw the album as a movement for the left."
"__MUSIC__ They had a few good hits on that album. That seems to be their last big album that I remember."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe the politicizing of their music really turned people off."
"__MUSIC__ Could be a possibility. Not to mention they are getting older as well."
"__MUSIC__ True. I do miss their older stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I love the beat to their music. It is good music to go jogging or exercise to because of the rhythm and beats."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That makes sense though. I'll have to put some of their music on my playlist next time I go for a jog."
