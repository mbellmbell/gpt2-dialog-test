"__DISNEY__ What did you think of Disney's spin on Sleepy Beauty with Maleficent?"
"__DISNEY__ I really liked it! I know people will argue that it wasn't pure to their original movie because they turned Maleficent from an evil witch into a heroine, but I really liked the spin on the story."
"__DISNEY__ That's good because I really liked the new story too. I thought Angelina Jolie did a fantastic job as Maleficent and Elle Fanning did a good job as Sleeping Beauty. The story gave as a better look at Maleficent's background."
"__DISNEY__ She always deserved a good background story and this movie really gave us the perspective we needed to see."
"__DISNEY__ The way they made her turn spiteful and hateful I felt was justified since she was in love with the would be King and he literally stabbed her in the back."
"__DISNEY__ Sharlto Copley did a fantastic job playing the King. I liked how they turned him into the villain. Such a surprise."
"__DISNEY__ The action scenes with the dragon were really good towards the end too. I was rooting for Maleficent."
"__DISNEY__ I like how the narration in the end was from Sleepy Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ The ending really touched my heart."
"__DISNEY__ I wish Disney would do more spins on their classic stories. If it's done as well as in Maleficent I will definitely watch those."
