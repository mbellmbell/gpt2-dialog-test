"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Queensryche?"

"__MUSIC__ What's some of their other stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ They have some really good albums with interesting sounds."
"__MUSIC__ Like which ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Empire is really good, there's a lot of really high quality stuff on there."
"__MUSIC__ What's that sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's like good 80's rock with some pop."
"__MUSIC__ Ah I like that."
