"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Green Bay Packers will be able to bounce back this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Green Bay Packers will be in it every season as long as Aaron Rodgers is healthy and playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So Aaron Rodgers or Matt Ryan as best current quarterback in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you exclude Tom Brady from that debate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not, I'm just bringing up a scenario where it's excluding Tom Brady because we know he's a future Hall of Famer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay fair enough. I think Aaron Rodgers over Matt Ryan as best current quarterback by a large margin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do think that? Matt Ryan has shown he's very capable and he's even made the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan did, but he fell short. Aaron Rodgers already is a champion and Superbowl MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point. Until Matt Ryan wins a Superbowl I guess it's hard to put them on the same level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, he has to prove himself a champion before he can be compared to a champ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know by that statement you could say that Eli Manning is a better quarterback then Aaron."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point. It seems like when we compare who's better than who we use Superbowl rings as a marker unless it's someone we feel is less talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah seems to be always the case, but there's a fair argument that can go both ways."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I stand by my choice of Aaron Rodgers over Matt Ryan but I'm not discrediting Matt Ryan's achievements so far. He has a bright future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It helps when you have Julio Jones to throw passes to!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just wondering if Matt Ryan will have the same opportunities next season now that Kyle Shanahan the offensive coaching mastermind has left for the San Francisco 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Atlanta Falcons will retain a lot of his playbook and I'm sure Matt has picked up a lot from the past seasons to be competent enough to continue with his success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that. Now I'm wondering if Aaron Rodgers can keep performing like he has."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Green Bay Packers will look even better this year. They're going to be healthier and they've added more weapons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm looking forward to it as you know Aaron Rodgers is my favorite current NFL quarterback."
