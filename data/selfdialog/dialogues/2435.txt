"__MUSIC__ Have you gotten into the Lumineers?"
"__MUSIC__ I heard them on the radio a few times, but I haven't listened to a whole album. What do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Their latest album, Cleopatra, from 2016, is really solid."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about their music?"
"__MUSIC__ It's upbeat and catchy, yet their stories are very well thought out."
"__MUSIC__ I think I did see a music video from them! 'Sleep on the Floor'?"
"__MUSIC__ Ah yes! That's the one where the girl goes on an imaginary road trip with a boy after a funeral?"
"__MUSIC__ That's the one. A very cool concept."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that they feature the same woman in two other videos? At different ages."
"__MUSIC__ No way! That's creating a world outside of the music, almost."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I thought. I think about the songs differently now."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to watch the others, then!"
"__MUSIC__ They had another album out a few years ago, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they did! It was just called 'The Lumineers.'"
"__MUSIC__ How did they get started?"
"__MUSIC__ They are from Denver, and I think they started after one of the members lost his brother."
"__MUSIC__ That's a sad start. But some good music came out of it."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Music always helps to get through a hard time."
"__MUSIC__ And now people are using the Lumineers for their own hard times."
"__MUSIC__ And that's the beauty of music."
