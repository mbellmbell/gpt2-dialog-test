"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see the original Alice in Wonderland by Disney?"
"__DISNEY__ I've seen Alice in Wonderland, but I don't know if it was the one you are talking about."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, there are so many versions of the story."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but I think Disney really popularized it as a movie."
"__DISNEY__ They probably did."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure the one I saw was the original.  It had the look of it."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't Disney redo Alice in Wonderland recently?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think they did."
"__DISNEY__ I actually didn't see the newer one."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't either, but my sister said it was awesome."
