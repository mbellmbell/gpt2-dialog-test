"__MUSIC__ Do you like Ed Sheeran?"
"__MUSIC__ I love him! Shape of You is my favorite song of 2017."
"__MUSIC__ I think he is good, but I still think that John Mayer is much better."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Ed Sheeran is a way better lyricist. Whether it be his more faster tempo songs like Don't or his slower songs like Thinking Out Loud, they are all beautifully written."
"__MUSIC__ I would contend that John Mayer's faster tempo songs like No Such Thing or his slower songs like Daughters are superior to your mentioned Ed Sheeran songs."
"__MUSIC__ Agree to disagree. Maybe it's a generational thing."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I really like Shawn Mendes."
"__MUSIC__ I don't. I find songs like Treats You Better to sound way too cliche."
"__MUSIC__ I love the pop guitar influence on that song. Moreover, his slower songs like Mercy are beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I would prefer someone like Nick Jonas to Shawn Mendes."
"__MUSIC__ My problem with Nick Jonas is that aside from Jealous, all of his music is terrible."
"__MUSIC__ Really? You didn't like his song with Tove Lo, Close?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all. I found it way too slow and boring. I do like Tove Lo."
"__MUSIC__ I think Tove Lo is great. Talking Body was the most underrated song of 2015 in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ That was a good song. However, I'd argue that Ellie Goulding's On My Mind was the most underrated song of 2015."
"__MUSIC__ That song was fun. Did you believe the rumor that the song was about Ed Sheeran?"
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard that rumor before. It does sound like a response to Don't now that I think about it, so it's very possible."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. However, I prefer Ellie Goulding's song with Calvin Harris, Outside."
"__MUSIC__ Also a great song. Calvin Harris is super talented."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. I also really liked his collaboration with Haim, Pray to God."
