"__SUPERHERO__ How do you think The Incredible Hulk ended up on that planet in the new Thor movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, Ragnarok? Yeah, this is going to be a weird movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ It seems pretty silly."
"__SUPERHERO__ It'll have problems of being a standalone movie when Marvel is off-the-charts involved."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think he got kidnapped."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why? And how? He's huge and unstoppable."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, the witch broke Thor's hammer. So, she probably was able to trap him."
"__SUPERHERO__ They mentioned he's a 'candidate' - what do you think that means?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Probably a candidate to rule a huge part of the galaxy."
"__SUPERHERO__ I just hope it's not 'Gladiator, but with friends'."
