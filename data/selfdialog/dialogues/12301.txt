"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you like Jacksonville's chances this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not much to be honest with you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they're getting better don't you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense is getting better, not the offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They seem to have a carousel at QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't think Blake Bortles is the answer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's been a drag on them for the most part."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll give up on him after this year and rebuild."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the defense though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, lots of talent there.  Jalen Ramsey is a real good player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a good pick for them for sure.  Tons of upside."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And if he can get healthy, I want to see what Dante Fowler can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I miss not seeing him rush the passer.  Sad that he missed his whole first year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know who I'm excited to see on defense for them is Myles Jack."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that guy should be a beast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping he's healthy now to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had tons of talent coming out of UCLA."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, now's the time to bounce back from his knee injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who knows, maybe their offense will click for them this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not likely, but Leonard Fournette will help."
