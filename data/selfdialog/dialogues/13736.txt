"__BASKETBALL__ That's not as sad as flipping burgers at a local fast food joint for the rest of your life."
"__BASKETBALL__ Nope. And it's actually a pretty good job. You might even be able to get Phys ed teacher certification and get paid twice. For the teaching and then for the coaching job."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wonder how much that is."
"__BASKETBALL__ Some make a lot more as a full fledged coach. Others get a teaching salary and a stipend as a coach. it all varies."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wonder who the highest paid high school basketball coach is."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know people who get paid more than 100K a year for coaching high school b-ball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who?"
"__BASKETBALL__ A guy named Kevin Boyle. Used to coach at St. Patrick High school. Got headhunted by a school in Florida."
"__BASKETBALL__ Nice sunny weather vs Joisy. Hard to pass that up."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, Yep. He's now making over 130K a year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but how many of these D-leaguers will make it as a high school coach to that extent?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Not many for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well. Maybe we should commercialize amateur sports in the US."
"__BASKETBALL__ Um. no."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why not?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Because Amateurs do it for the love of the game. They have to learn the love of the game first before they can love the money."
"__BASKETBALL__ Everyone loves the money."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's why we can't let commercialization of the amateur games at college/high school levels."
"__BASKETBALL__ Colleges make so much money if you have a good football team, or even nationally ranked basketball teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ But most of these amateur programs are money losers. Commercializing them won't help much."
