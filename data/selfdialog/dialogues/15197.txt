"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think the saddest part of the series is?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's a toss up between the death of Dumbledore or Fred's death."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The whole Dumbledore death and lead up was phenomenally done."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Agreed, from the cave scene on I had a feeling but I didn't think it would happen."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Then Dumbledore begging for death when Harry forced the potion down his throat. Heartbreaking."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh that part killed me. Then when they get back and get to the tower."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh no! I always hated Malfoy, but in that moment I'm not sure if I hated him or pitied him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Clearly he's despicable, but I felt for him a little too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Then, with his final act of power, Dumbledore keeps Harry bound under the cloak."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And Harry only realizing he was free because Dumbledore had died. Oh, I hated it so much but it was so well done."
