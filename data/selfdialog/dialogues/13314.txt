"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, man. Ready for this upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it. I love football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. Who do you think is going to the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see the Patriots and Cowboys playing each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's too easy! I'm gonna say the Steelers and Saints play this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is also plausible. Steelers look great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. Big Ben, Brown, and Bell... wow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they should have beat the Pats last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited to see Marshawn's return to the field as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. He's gonna be running fools over!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I'm hoping for! Beastquake!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how the Seahawks fill about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably a bit upset, I'd imagine. He is one heck of a player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also wonder if Romo will come back after a little bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I've heard he might, after he finishes announcing for a year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder which team he would fit in with..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No idea. He needs a great offensive line though, since he's so old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes indeed. He has bones made of paper, it seems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited about the preseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, no doubt! I can't wait to be watching football!"
