"__MOVIES__ Hey so have y'all seen the Despicable Me and Minions series yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, of course!  I love that series!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too!  I'm waiting on them to make another one now."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when I first saw the trailers I thought it looked silly but I'm so glad I gave it a chance.  I loved it!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I thought the same thing!  I only watched it because my kids wanted to."
"__MOVIES__ Me too!  That's funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but then I wound up totally enjoying it.  The first and second ones were especially hilarious to me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought so too.  I liked Minions but it wasn't quite as good as the rest."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but even so.  I'm glad they kept making them."
"__MOVIES__ Have you heard anything about a new one coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ No, nothing yet.  It seems like they were such a hit that they'd want to continue with the series."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but maybe they're getting burnt out on plot ideas."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, they could go on and on with the kids and things they grow up to do."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's true.  There's a lot of opportunity there."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess we'll find out in the next few years, won't we?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is true!  Have you seen anything else good recently?"
"__MOVIES__ What, animation movies or just movies in general?"
"__MOVIES__ Just in general I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Finding Dory was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I haven't seen that yet!"
