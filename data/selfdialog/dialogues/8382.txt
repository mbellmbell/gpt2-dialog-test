"__POP__ So let's play a game. Best pop male vocalist right now, go!"
"__POP__ That is simple. Adam Levine."
"__POP__ Adam Levine? The absolute best is Adam Levine?"
"__POP__ What is wrong with Adam Levine? He is so talented!"
"__POP__ He is great, don't get me wrong. But he has a band to back him up."
"__POP__ Well who would you suggest?"
"__POP__ Bruno Mars, he is the only vocalist so you know all that talent is him."
"__POP__ I do love Bruno Mars, but I don't think Adam Levine being part of a band has any impact."
"__POP__ I guess we just disagree."
"__POP__ Have you listened to Adam Levine's solo stuff? Try that and I know we will agree."
