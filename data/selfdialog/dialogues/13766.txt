"__BASKETBALL__ Hey Fred! Did you watch the Nuggets game last night?!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea man, that was a nail biter but Gallinari sure sunk a sweet one for the win!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea he did! I wish I could have been at that game. You goin to any games soon?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Actually I am. I'm going when the Suns come to town. I have some really good seats. You wanna join? I have an extra ticket."
"__BASKETBALL__ I would love to join! I never miss an opportunity to go to the Pepsi Center and see our boys live!!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Fantastic! Nuggets vs Suns here we come!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I can't wait! I'm hoping our young team can really come together this season. A lot of promise there."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea they really have to come together cause our Western Conference opponents play some fierce ball."
"__BASKETBALL__ We'll see what these guys have in them. I know that the individual development I've seen is pretty impressive."
"__BASKETBALL__ They really have to focus on road games. That's an area needing serious improvement if they want to see the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Absolutely. 15-26 on the road is not playoff material."
"__BASKETBALL__ Seven of our last nine are on the road! That is going to be crucial."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Beasley is going to be a huge factor. And you can see him shake that rookie mentality/play now that it's his second year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed. And you can really start to see the team build around Jokic."
"__BASKETBALL__ We are making progress that's for sure. Probably won't be this year but watch out next year!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea I think we will make the playoffs but won't go anywhere. Still need time to build."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea. Did you see Bradley's jersey got retired at his high school where he played."
"__BASKETBALL__ No I didn't! That's awesome. The kid definitely showed his talent from day one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Murray is having a speedy recovery too which is nice."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea Coach Hess is really focusing on him and his recovery. A lot of special workouts and PT. Well, I'll catch you later. Don't forget about the Suns game!"
