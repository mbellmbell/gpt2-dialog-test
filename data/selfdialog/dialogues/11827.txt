"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose you're counting down the minutes until the new NFL season, am I right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You bet! I can't wait."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the same old team will rise to the top? The Tom Brady team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It;s a pretty good bet. He is a great player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A great player that cheats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He doesn't cheat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Deflategate anyone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They didn't prove it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh please, he cheated. They all do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you know about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that Brady is married to Giselle, that Ben Afflec seems to be in love with him, and that people cheat to get ahead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I can't argue with that logic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got that right!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure they even cheated at the very first Olympics games back in ancient Greece."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably. They found loaded dice on an acrhiological dig in the Holy Land. People always cheat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't doubt it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thing is, a skilled player is a skilled player even without cheating. So the NFL should really crack down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Other than testing there's not much they can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'd stop cheating so much if every time they were caught the indvidual player and the entire team had not be fined but have $5,000,000 per year taken out of their salaries in perpetuity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That might just do it."
