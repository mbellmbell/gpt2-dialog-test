"__DISNEY__ Didn't you used to love Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I still do. She is my favorite Disney princess."
"__DISNEY__ Her dress is the prettiest, I think."
"__DISNEY__ Even though the pink dress was pretty, the one the Fairy Godmother made ended up being beautiful."
"__DISNEY__ It was so sad when the step sisters destroyed the pink dress, though."
"__DISNEY__ I know, the mice and birds had worked so hard to make it special for Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ I think that Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters. They were so cute."
"__DISNEY__ And they loved Cinderella very much. They really tried to look out for her!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, even though her step-family was so mean to her, she did have good friends in the animals."
"__DISNEY__ And she was lucky to have such a good fairy godmother!"
