"__MOVIES__ So the best movie series of all time will be airing this weekend on tv!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?  What is that?"
"__MOVIES__ The Back To the Future Trilogy!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I love those movies!  When is it coming on?"
"__MOVIES__ It starts Saturday at four p.m. and they will run all Saturday night."
"__MOVIES__ Those are truly the greatest.  I wish they would re-make them and we could see new versions."
"__MOVIES__ You mean new versions of the same story, or like a continuation set in modern times?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, both would be cool!"
"__MOVIES__ I disagree!  I think the originals are great just like they are."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Michael J. Fox really was amazing.  I guess they wouldn't be the same without him."
"__MOVIES__ No, and the crazy thing as that they are set in the future which is like here now!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, it's wild to think that that was how they envisioned the world today."
"__MOVIES__ Imagine if we had hovercrafts and those tiny pizzas that they warmed up!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well we don't have those things but we do have lots of similar crazy technology."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're right.  Well those movies are timeless."
"__MOVIES__ I can't ever get sick of watching them.  I guess if they made one now, it'd be set in the late 21st century?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like 2050 or something like that.  It'd be bizarre."
"__MOVIES__ It would have to take place on another planet because we probably will have destroyed this one by then."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, it could still take place on earth.  Who would they get to play Michael J. Fox's role, though?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  I can't keep up with all these young actors anymore."
