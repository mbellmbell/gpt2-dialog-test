"__MOVIES__ Do you think that David Lynch will ever make another movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know! He has been busy with Twin Peaks lately."
"__MOVIES__ I know. But I love his movies and want more from him."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Mulholland Drive. Naomi Watts is amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, she is great. She takes on a lot of interesting roles."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she does. I also love her in I Heart Huckabees."
"__MOVIES__ She is so funny in that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ That's a great cast. They're all amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness, you're right."
"__MOVIES__ Dustin Hoffman steals the screen in that one."
"__MOVIES__ He really does. He plays the goofy professor type so well."
"__MOVIES__ He did it in Stranger than Fiction too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's the one with Will Ferrell, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was such a shift for Will."
"__MOVIES__ I like seeing him in a comical yet serious role."
"__MOVIES__ I know. He tends to stick to the same sort of character so that was a departure for him."
"__MOVIES__ I would like to see him take on more of those roles."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I think he's really talented."
"__MOVIES__ Even as a goofball, he is always entertaining."
