"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I love the Fast and Furious movies."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why? It's mindless garbage."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think it's fun and enjoy the action."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think it's made for idiots. I don't get the appeal."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's supposed to be ridiculous. It's over the top and the corny dialogue makes it even better."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The only reason I'd watch it is because Ludacris is in it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, he's great in all of them. I think they're all worth watching besides Tokyo Drift."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Maybe one day if I catch one of the movies on TV..."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I highly recommend 2 Fast 2 Furious. That's the funniest one by far."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'll remember that, but don't get your hopes up."
