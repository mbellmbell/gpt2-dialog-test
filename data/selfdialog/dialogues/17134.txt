"__MOVIES__ So what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ About what?"
"__MOVIES__ The new Star Wars trailer that we just watched silly!"
"__MOVIES__ The trailer looked really awesome, but I'm still not that excited to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Really, you? You are the biggest Star War fan that I know!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I know, I don't know if you know this, but I even read all the non-canonical books as well. I could never get enough."
"__MOVIES__ So what changed?"
"__MOVIES__ The movie, A New Hope, kind of killed the franchise for me."
"__MOVIES__ Don't you think that is a little extreme?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it destroyed a lot of the original Star Wars mythology for me."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Rey didn't even know that the Force existed an hour ago, and now she is using mind control!"
"__MOVIES__ So what is wrong with that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Luke trained with Yoda and Obi Wan for a very long time, and she just 'knows' How is that possible?"
"__MOVIES__ I never thought about it like that."
"__MOVIES__ Also, she has never even seen a Millenium Falcon and fixes it better that Han! Oh and don't get me started on the 'convenient' timing of everything."
"__MOVIES__ But it's Star Wars!"
"__MOVIES__ In name only!"
"__MOVIES__ So, you don't think that you'll go see it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I will, I'm keeping the faith that they will be more faithful to the story and explain some of the major plot holes."
