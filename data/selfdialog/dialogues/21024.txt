"__THRILLER__ Rosemary's Baby is one of my favorite thrillers."
"__THRILLER__ Really? Why's that?"
"__THRILLER__ There aren't any real 'jump scares.'"
"__THRILLER__ So it's not scary?"
"__THRILLER__ It is, but because everything that is normal in Rosemary's world slowly becomes strange an ominous."
"__THRILLER__ Like her life has never been normal?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it's scary to think of it happening to me."
"__THRILLER__ Do you get to see the baby?"
"__THRILLER__ Not really; they more describe it than show it."
"__THRILLER__ That sounds scarier."
