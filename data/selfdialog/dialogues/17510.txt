"__MOVIES__ I watched the most elegant gangster movie the other day, if you can imagine such a thing."
"__MOVIES__ What movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Brother. It is directed by Japanese auteur Takeshi Kitano."
"__MOVIES__ Is it all in Japanese?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's a split between Japanese and English. It takes place in LA."
"__MOVIES__ What made it elegant?"
"__MOVIES__ You have to see Kitano's films. He brings an elegance to everything he touches, even violence."
"__MOVIES__ Can you elaborate?"
"__MOVIES__ He doesn't do any cheesy action. The films are gritty."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds grim."
"__MOVIES__ It is offset by beautifully composed music."
"__MOVIES__ Is the music done by anyone I know?"
"__MOVIES__ Joe Hisaishi. He actually scores a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films, which I know you are a fan of."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that sounds like a strangely interesting audio/visual experience."
"__MOVIES__ He also has the best Japanese fashion designer - Yohji Yamamoto - doing the costumes in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ I can see how well dressed gangsters will add an air of elegance to the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Another funny thing about Kitano's movies is that characters who talk a lot are always portrayed as idiots."
"__MOVIES__ This is reflective of real life, I suppose."
"__MOVIES__ It was his first and final foray into American cinema. It's a totally underrated movie with a compelling soundtrack."
"__MOVIES__ I will have to check it out!"
