"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite character is Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can understand that. It's pretty amazing all of the stuff he gets away with in the Millennium Falcon."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am really glad that Luke turned out to be Leia's brother so that she could end up with Han instead."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's kind of strange that his best friend is Chewbaka."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not really sure how Han and Chewy carry on conversations, but I think they are cute together."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so glad that Harrison Ford has lived long enough to continue to play Han Solo in the newer movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I completely agree. I will be so upset when he dies. I cried and screamed in the theater when Han was killed."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's pretty terrible that his son, Kylo Ren killed him like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was absolutely horrible! I hope Kylo Ren gets what is coming to him in the next movie. He needs to be punished!"
