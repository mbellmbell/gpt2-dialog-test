"__MUSIC__ Hey mom, are you using the surround sound for your shows?"
"__MUSIC__ Not today, why?"
"__MUSIC__ I just wanted to listen to a new album I bought today."
"__MUSIC__ You don't want to just listen in your room?"
"__MUSIC__ I really wanted to enjoy the bass, it's the new Kendrick Lamar album."
"__MUSIC__ I see, yeah go for it!"
"__MUSIC__ Thanks mom, did you want to listen with me?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I can get into the rap genre."
"__MUSIC__ It's rap but he has some producers that have a more jazzy style."
"__MUSIC__ I can't imagine it's the type of jazz I like."
"__MUSIC__ Thundercat is one of the producers, he is a new age jazz and hip hop artist."
"__MUSIC__ I guess if you put it on I can see, I want to know how they can blend them to sound remotely nice."
"__MUSIC__ There is a reason it is so popular mom."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you are right, I have heard a lot about Kendrick on the news and what not."
"__MUSIC__ What is the album called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's actually not his newest album, but it is called To Pimp a Butterfly."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting name."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I just never got around to hearing the album when it was newly released, so it is new to me now."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good, I'll take a listen."
"__MUSIC__ I think you and I will love it!"
