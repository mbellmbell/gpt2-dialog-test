"__MOVIES__ Did you like the movie ET?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I liked it as a kid and liked it when I saw it recently."
"__MOVIES__ It is a really touching movie and the special effects are impressive for when it was made."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly I was going to say that."
"__MOVIES__ While I was happy ET finally gets to go home. I wish he could have stayed with Elliot and his family."
"__MOVIES__ I know you could tell ET liked their home and being around the family."
"__MOVIES__ But at the same time the other humans looked at him as an outcast."
"__MOVIES__ That is the sad part. They treated him like dirt and basically almost killed him."
"__MOVIES__ I was sad at that part and worried they were going to kill ET."
"__MOVIES__ What a great ending when you think about it. The ending was happy but sad at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ You are happy that ET gets to go home but then realize both Elliot and ET are losing a special friend."
"__MOVIES__ This is a movie I wish had a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ An ET sequel would have been amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you 100 percent! There are so many story lines they could have explored."
"__MOVIES__ Not every sequel works out though."
"__MOVIES__ I see your point. So maybe we are lucky ET was a great movie and nothing ruined it."
"__MOVIES__ That is what I was thinking. A lot of great things were somewhat ruined by poor sequels."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and if they tried to make an ET sequel now I'm not sure if it would have the same feel as the original."
"__MOVIES__ If it did I would love to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah don't get me wrong if an ET sequel came out I would go and see it as soon as I could."
