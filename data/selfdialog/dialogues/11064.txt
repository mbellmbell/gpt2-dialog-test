"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My boy Zeke is going to tear it up this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's Zeke?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ezekiel Elliott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah, that Zeke.  Yeah, hard to see him not doing good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a rookie last year and led the league in rushing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he did play behind a good line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, his line is good, but he made tons of plays after contact."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think on another team, he maybe breaks 1,000 yards if he's lucky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're just a hater."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not hating, just stating a fact."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny that you think it's a fact when it's unproven."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just saying, probably a bit overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, so what RB would you take over him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Le'Veon Bell for one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not saying he's not a good player, but he's no Zeke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for one, he's a more patient runner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, but why else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's also a better pass catcher."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Zeke is younger and more durable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All it takes is one hit and he's riding pine this year."
