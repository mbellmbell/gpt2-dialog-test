"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love when I get a chance to rewatch the Harry Potter movies. Any of them really, but especially when I end up having a Harry Potter marathon and can watch several of them back to back."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it's still hard to believe there won't be another one coming out. I got so used to there always being a new Harry Potter to see."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite character from the movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love Hagrid and McGonagall. Robbie Coltrane is the perfect Hagrid and I've love Dame Maggie Smith since I watched Peter Pan as a kid."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Same here! I wish McGonagall had as big of a part in the movies as she did in the books because I definitely wanted to see more of Maggie Smith in each movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I even fell for some of the actors that played awful characters too; like Helena Bonham Carter playing Bellatrix, I don't know who else could have pulled that role off so perfectly."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, she was fantastic as Bellatrix. Same with Timothy Spall as Wormtail; I loathe the character but he did such an amazing job with it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I felt the same way about Alan Rickman, I think he got better and better as Snape with each movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I did like Rickman and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the part. I didn't really love Snape's storyline, though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I think he's one of those love it or hate it characters. A lot of people jumped into loving him because he died and how he died but I think that kind of misses the whole point of his character."
