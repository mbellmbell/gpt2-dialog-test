"__BEATLES__ Do you like early Beatles songs better or later Beatles songs?"
"__BEATLES__ What do you mean?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, most people consider the Sgt. Pepper album like the transition album where they went from early to later Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Oh really? I'm not sure I know that album, what songs are on it?"
"__BEATLES__ It's designed to sound like a live album, so it sounds really distinct."
"__BEATLES__ Is Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds on that album?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes! I think it's the third song on that album."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, nice. I love that song! It's probably one of my favorite songs by them."
"__BEATLES__ So then you actually are a later Beatles fan, huh?"
"__BEATLES__ I guess so! I learned something new about myself today, huh?"
