"__DISNEY__ The boys and I are trying to figure out what to watch tonight. I miss the good old family movies, like you could watch on Sunday night by Disney."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, forgot about that, it was called 'Wonderful World of Disney' I looked forward to it all week. What was your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ One of my favorites was a really old one.. 'Swiss Family Robinson'"
"__DISNEY__ We watched that one too! We always said we wished we would get shipwrecked so we could live like them."
"__DISNEY__ And the parent trap! We loved that one. Good old fashioned stuff you didn't have to worry about watching with your kids."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Disney has done alot of good family movies. Toy Story will always be my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I think we've watched all 3 a zillion times."
"__DISNEY__ Although Inside Out comes close. It was so funny and real."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, we loved that one too.  I heard they are doing an Incredibles 2. That would be so cool."
"__DISNEY__ No way! I love that one!"
