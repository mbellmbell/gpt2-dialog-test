"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite metal musician?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. I'm a huge fan of Corey Taylor."
"__MUSIC__ He's a singer, right? I've heard his name before."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. He performs in Slipknot and Stone Sour."
"__MUSIC__ Got it. Why do you like him?"
"__MUSIC__ First of all, because he's very outspoken."
"__MUSIC__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ He has a very loud opinion of just about anything, and he's not afraid to speak it."
"__MUSIC__ That's admirable, I guess. Any other reason why you're a fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Because of his singing ability. It's amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Does he have a wide range or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly that. He can go from sounding like a maniac to sounding like an angel in a second."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to need some proof of this."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. For some straight up crazy vocals, look up Eyeless by Slipknot."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds uncomfortable. Okay, now what else?"
"__MUSIC__ For some absolutely beautiful vocals, try Snuff by Slipknot."
"__MUSIC__ It's by the same band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but it's very different from their normal stuff, and in a good way."
"__MUSIC__ Okay then. I'll give them a try."
"__MUSIC__ You won't be disappointed."
