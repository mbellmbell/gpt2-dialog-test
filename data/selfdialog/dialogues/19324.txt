"__MOVIES__ I'm really looking forward to the new infinity wars marvel movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! They are going to have so many superheroes in them!"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I wonder how they are going to even fit that many characters into one movie."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they will spread them out over several movie chapters."
"__MOVIES__ No, they all have to be on screen at the same time for a lot of the scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, so that's a lot of people then."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, there's hawkeye, black widow, captain america, spiderman, thor, and even antman."
"__MOVIES__ Yea and you can't forget about the hulk too, he's huge."
"__MOVIES__ Yea and what about all the members from guardians of the galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea! I wouldn't be surprised if they brought in some new people as well."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget about iron man. I wonder if Robert downy junior will retire as ironman after the infinity wars."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. I wonder if they will get deadpool in there?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm not sure that they are allowed to have any xmen in marvel movies."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think they are owned by fox? I'm not really sure."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see, well that's a shame then, because you have to have the xmen in there."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it's a bummer, but let's get real, how could they put all the xmen along with all those other superheroes in the same movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea I guess that's true."
"__MOVIES__ This also means no deadpool appearance either."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that really sucks!"
