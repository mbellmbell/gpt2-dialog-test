"__DISNEY__ What do you think ever happened to Sid?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean the bad kid from 'Toy Story?'"
"__DISNEY__ Yea.  After the toys revealed themselves to him."
"__DISNEY__ I'm assuming that he either became a better person, or he ended up losing his mind."
"__DISNEY__ I think both those options are likely.  I mean as a kid, how would you react to seeing toys start talking?"
"__DISNEY__ Especially in a scary fashion like that."
"__DISNEY__ I don't get how the Woody and the other toys got away with that."
"__DISNEY__ I agree.  I would assume there's some cosmic law or consequence for revealing themselves to humans."
"__DISNEY__ And if not, how would the toys know, or feel inclined to pretend to be inanimate every time Andy enters a room."
"__DISNEY__ I know it's a children's movie so the questions will never be answered.  But it's fun to think about."
