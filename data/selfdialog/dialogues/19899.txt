"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet, but it looks really good!"
"__MOVIES__ It is amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ Who did they get to play Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ An actress named Gal Gadot, she's a great fit for the role."
"__MOVIES__ Have I seen her in anything before?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, she was in the last three Fast & the Furious movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I have seen those, they are a lot of fun."
"__MOVIES__ They are fun, but I think that Wonder Woman is even better for her. She gets to really show her skill."
"__MOVIES__ That's wonderful. I was worried about this movie being bad."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I've wanted a Wonder Woman movie for a long time and I would have been disappointed if it had sucked."
"__MOVIES__ Like the Jem and the Holograms movie? That was a wreck."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. With that one, I think the problem was that it wasn't a terrible movie, but it was a terrible Jem movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's good to know that Wonder Woman really lived up to it's source material."
"__MOVIES__ It really did. I'm excited for the sequels.."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they keep up the quality, sequels aren't always great."
"__MOVIES__ I know but I have hope."
"__MOVIES__ I should go see that movie now."
"__MOVIES__ You should go see it. Right now, before it leaves the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, you buy the popcorn, I'll save the seats."
