"__MUSIC__ The way we listen to music these days has changed so much."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ I remember when I was younger, I'd save up and buy CDs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's true. But that's not much different."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it is. For example, I didn't know what any of the songs sounded like!"
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, unless they played on the radio and I caught them, getting a CD was like a blind grab bag."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I guess that's true. I've kind of not thought about it."
"__MUSIC__ Nowadays we can listen to music online for free. For example, on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the people on YouTube get paid by ad revenue. So it's free music."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that part is kind of like the radio, but you can look up what you want to hear, when you want to hear it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you get to listen to exactly what you want to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Another thing that's different is that, if you don't like all the music, you can just buy specific songs."
"__MUSIC__ For about 99 cents each or so. And you download them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've got to say I'm not keen on that. I like having hard copies, like CDs."
"__MUSIC__ Young people would probably have no clue what we're talking about!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they have it so easy now with getting to listen for free online. And maybe never spend a cent on music."
"__MUSIC__ They could just listen to it for free, legally, all day."
"__MUSIC__ Now do you see my point about how things have changed?"
"__MUSIC__ I sure do. But it makes me nostalgic, and now I want to go out and buy a CD!"
