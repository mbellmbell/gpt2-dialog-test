"__MUSIC__ My niece told me yesterday that she had heard this really cool new song on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? What song was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Livin' On A Prayer by Bon Jovi."
"__MUSIC__ That is so funny, did you tell her the song wasn't new?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I did, and she was shocked."
"__MUSIC__ I bet she was."
"__MUSIC__ I think what shocked her the most was when I started to sing the song."
"__MUSIC__ That had to be funny."
"__MUSIC__ It was, but I pulled out the album, Slippery When Wet and let her listen to some other songs from it."
"__MUSIC__ That is a good album."
"__MUSIC__ Yes there are a lot of good songs on that album."
"__MUSIC__ What other songs are on that album?"
"__MUSIC__ You Give Love A Bad Name, Wanted Dead Or Alive, I'd Die For you, there are a lot of good ones on that album."
"__MUSIC__ You should play some White Snake for her."
"__MUSIC__ I should, they are another good band."
"__MUSIC__ I like there song Here I Go Again."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, that was the graduation song for our class."
"__MUSIC__ That is so cool."
"__MUSIC__ It is funny how kids hear a song for the first they assume it is new."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I bet we were once like that."
