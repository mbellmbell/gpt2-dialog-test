"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been following the Celtics and Wizards series?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it's been pretty incredible so far."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think is going win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Celtics will take it in seven games."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hope they do but the Wizards have been pretty tough the past few games."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they have. But Boston has home court advantage."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah all the games have been won by the home team this series."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about Kelly Oubre getting suspended?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he deserved it. It was a bad choice to push Olynyk like that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he should have just backed off.  The pick was hard but legal."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think either team stands a chance against the Cavaliers next round?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know. I think they might win a game or two but the Cavaliers are really good."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, The Celtics would have home court in that series, do you think that would make a difference."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah a slight one but I still think the Cavaliers would win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think is gonna come out of the West?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Warriors for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Rockets could possibly beat the Warriors but probably not."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. I think the Spurs are too old and too injured to keep winning in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. I had them winning this series with the Rockets but now I'm not sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ We'll see in the next few days."
