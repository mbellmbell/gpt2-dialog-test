"__MOVIES__ I just rented the new Power Rangers movie from Redbox last night."
"__MOVIES__ Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good. They tried to keep it fun like the cartoons but it actually was a little bit darker."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that fans are pretty disappointed with it."
"__MOVIES__ At least it didn't flop as bad as Jem and the Holograms.  That was based off a kids show."
"__MOVIES__ I actually liked Jem and the Holograms but I've never seen the cartoons so I didn't know what I was looking for.  I thought Aubrey Peeples did really well."
"__MOVIES__ She sang her own parts right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she did.  They seem to be making lots of new movies off of shows or kids shows."
"__MOVIES__ They made a Max Steel movie recently too."
"__MOVIES__ That was just awful.  I saw it in the theater and wanted to ask for my money back."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Ben Winchell was the main character."
"__MOVIES__ I don't even know who that is."
"__MOVIES__ He's not been in anything big, just tv movies."
"__MOVIES__ You know what they should make a movie out of?  Thundercats.  Remember that show?"
"__MOVIES__ That could be good.  Could be bad.  If I remember that cartoon is was really campy."
"__MOVIES__ It was, they'd have to cut out some stuff I think."
"__MOVIES__ We need some good fantasy and action movies out. The Lord of the Rings were the last ones that I really enjoyed"
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like the Hobbit?"
"__MOVIES__ It drug on too long I thought.  The Hobbit cartoon was better."
