"__BASKETBALL__ So what do you think about the MVP race this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's going to be close.  Harden or Westbrook probably, right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think will win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well there are two questions here.  Who do I think will win, and who I think should win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, who do you think will win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it will be James Harden."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why Harden?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well to be honest his individual numbers aren't that much worse than Westbrook, and his team had more success."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true.  And to some degree the MVP award does reward team success."
"__BASKETBALL__ But I think Westbrook should win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think he should win because of his triple double average?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, definitely.  This was a historic season that should be rewarded."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think about the argument that he was just racking up stats for the sake of getting a triple double?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think that's a silly argument.  Every player racks up stats to some degree."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true.  And it's not like it's easy just to get triple doubles, no matter how much you try to rack up stats."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly.  Everyone would do it if it were that easy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ok, truthfully I think Kawhi Leonard should be MVP."
"__BASKETBALL__ Interesting.  I mean I am sure he will get some votes."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he's the whole package.  Good player on both offense and defense, and his team has had success."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess you could argue what else would you want from an MVP, right?"
