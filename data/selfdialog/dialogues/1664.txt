"__MUSIC__ Oh man, I miss the DC Talk of the old days."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They couldn't stay together forever though."
"__MUSIC__ I know they needed to do their own thing, but I feel like all of their solo ventures combined weren't any better than DC Talk as a whole."
"__MUSIC__ Tobymac was pretty successful solo though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know he's popular, but I feel like the quality of songwriting went down."
"__MUSIC__ Who was your favourite voice from DC Talk?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Michael's voice, I thought he was most diverse in what he could do with it."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I like Kevin's voice, his was so unique compared to the other 2."
"__MUSIC__ Unique, yeah, I just think there's a very limited style of songs that work with his voice."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. Maybe that's why he didn't have as much success going solo as the other guys."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I mean, Tobymac had his whole solo thing, Michael Tait has Newsboys now, but Kevin just sort of fell off the radar."
"__MUSIC__ I hear he's singing lead for Audio Adrenaline now."
"__MUSIC__ That's good, he needs something."
"__MUSIC__ And Audio Adrenaline lost their lead singer due to that odd voice condition."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that. Still miss that guy."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favourite dc talk song?"
"__MUSIC__ That's tough. Jesus Freak is a classic, but  I also like the mellow sound of My Will."
"__MUSIC__ Those are both good. I always liked Mind's Eye."
"__MUSIC__ I used to have that on a mixed cd. I think I just listened to it so many times I got tired of it."
"__MUSIC__ That happened for me with 'Luv is a Verb'."
