"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new album from Tech N9ne?"
"__MUSIC__ Which one? The album from December?"
"__MUSIC__ No. He relased a new one last month."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard it. Hopefully it is better than The Storm."
"__MUSIC__ It is. There are a lot of featured artists on the album."
"__MUSIC__ Great. I'll listen to it tonight."
"__MUSIC__ What album is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I usually listen to Absolute Power, and more of his old music."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, the tune has changed a lot with his more recent work."
"__MUSIC__ The Storm was not a great album. That is probably why I did not know a new one was out."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I only made it through one listen of that album."
"__MUSIC__ Do you prefer his old music as well?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, although my favorite album has to be All 6's and 7's."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I forgot about that one."
"__MUSIC__ The featured artists on that album were amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I know. And the album had at least 20 songs!"
"__MUSIC__ I hope he goes back to his roots in some of his future work."
"__MUSIC__ I hope so too. I am not sure which direction he is taking his music."
"__MUSIC__ I'll keep an eye out for the next release."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! Fingers crossed!"
