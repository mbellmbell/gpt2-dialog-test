"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen the Wonder Woman movie yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, it was awesome! I am happy they finally made a good movie for a female superhero."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. I thought Gal Gadot did a wonderful job."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did you know she was pregnant while filming part of the movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Wow, she truly is Wonder Woman. Did you also see Batman vs. Superman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, I heard it was not that good."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, it had some pretty bad reviews. But Wonder Woman was in that movie, too."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, maybe I will give it a try."
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't think it is worth it. You should just wait for the Wonder Woman sequel."
"__SUPERHERO__ Okay, let's see it together when it comes out."
