"__MUSIC__ Dude, have you heard the new Arcade Fire song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I saw that on Spotify. It's called Creature Comfort, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I've been waiting for a new release since Reflektor."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, can you believe that was 2015?"
"__MUSIC__ I know. And this is only a single. We still have to wait for the full album."
"__MUSIC__ Is Reflektor your favorite album of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. I absolutely adore The Suburbs."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I mean, there's a reason it won best album of the year."
"__MUSIC__ Reflektor is a great album too, though. It took me a while to get into it though."
"__MUSIC__ Really, why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, it didn't grip me at first. I heard the song Here Comes the Night Time on SNL and I thought it was OK, but it didn't wow me. Now I just love the whole thing."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I sure like it. I just wish they would give Regine Chassange more vocals."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I love the sound of her voice, especially on the song Joan of Arc."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, I just realized. Joan of Arc. Arcade Fire."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, nice! Bur her French singing on Joan of Arc is great."
"__MUSIC__ Totally. I do like Win Butler too. He's a great lead vocalist. The combination of the two is perfect."
"__MUSIC__ DId you know they were married?"
"__MUSIC__ Really? Wow. That makes a lot of sense."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're from Montreal."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. I always thought they were British or something."
