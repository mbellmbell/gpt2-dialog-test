"__POP__ How do you feel about Cyndi Lauper?"
"__POP__ She's the best!"
"__POP__ I'm also a big fan, from girls just want to have fun, to true colors, great stuff."
"__POP__ She always seemed to be more individual as a person than a lot of other pop artist's."
"__POP__ I agree with that assessment, remember the sing she did for The Goonies?"
"__POP__ Oh how could I ever forget that, had a really fun video as well."
"__POP__ Actually it's my favorite video ever made."
"__POP__ It's in my top five or so, is she still performing?"
"__POP__ She is, opened for Cher a couple years back, didn't get to go though."
"__POP__ Too bad, would've been a really fun show to attend."
