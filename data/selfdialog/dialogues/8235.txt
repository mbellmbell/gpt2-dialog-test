"__POP__ How did country music become pop music?"
"__POP__ That's a good question! It's a bit strange that artists like Taylor Swift have become so huge."
"__POP__ Yes, I agree. Why has this phenomena occurred?"
"__POP__ In the 1950s, the 'Nashville Sound' tried to dampen down country music a bit."
"__POP__ How did they do that?"
"__POP__ Well, the 'Honkey Tonk' of the 1940s was too raw to become popular. So, the smoothed everything out."
"__POP__ And, that worked well enough to turn country music into pop music."
"__POP__ It did! And, I think you see that same pattern today."
"__POP__ What do you mean?"
"__POP__ Well, Taylor Swift was a lot more country music when she started. And, she's gradually become more and more pop music."
