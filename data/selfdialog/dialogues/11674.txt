"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ who do you thnk is the GOAT?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I know the media will tell you Tom Brady but I think thats debatable"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ agreed"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ who would you say is the best of all time"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say top 5 would start with Brett Favre"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ and then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ probably Dan Marino"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah I loved the Dolphins who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Payton Manning for sure would be another one"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah he is really good in those Papa John commercials"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ lol yes he is, I would probably also include Big Ben"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ okay I can see where you are coming from but that guy is a jerk"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah I am doing this on gameplay only not on how they are as a person"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ okay so include Big Ben who would be the last of the top 5"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say Aaron Rodgers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Aaron is good but I think Eli Manning should be included"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ honestly?  why him he's not that good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Here is why he has 2 superbowl rings and can turn it on when he needs too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah he for sure has more rings than his brother"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right"
