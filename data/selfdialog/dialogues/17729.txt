"__MOVIES__ Hey man, do you want to go see that new Alien movie with me?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually saw it this past weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't love it. I keep waiting for that franchise to get good again."
"__MOVIES__ Ah man, that's disappointing. I love those first two movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. 'Aliens' is probably in my top five movies ever."
"__MOVIES__ What's your number one?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I kind of just have a general top five. Maybe Saving Private Ryan?"
"__MOVIES__ That is a good one. Can't go wrong with Tom Hanks"
"__MOVIES__ Dude has been in some classics. What's your favorite movie of his?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, tough question. I have a soft spot for 'Big', believe it or not."
"__MOVIES__ That's a bold choice."
"__MOVIES__ I know, not exactly a classic, but my brother and I used to watch that movie all the time when we were kids."
"__MOVIES__ I hear you. For my sister and me that movie was 'Back to the Future'."
"__MOVIES__ I LOVE 'Back to the Future'."
"__MOVIES__ Who doesn't? That may be a perfect movie."
"__MOVIES__ It holds up so well even today. I've probably seen it 50 times."
"__MOVIES__ Same here man. I miss young Michael J. Fox so much."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that he was actually in his 20's when they made that first movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't, but that doesn't surprise me."
