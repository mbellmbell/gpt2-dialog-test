"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I caught that a few weeks ago!  Got it from the local library."
"__STAR_WARS__ Cool, what did you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I thought it wasn't too bad... had a lot of good action scenes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I thought so to, but I do think they could have developed the characters a bit more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that one girl, for instance uh.. shoot.. Jin?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jyn, her name was Jyn Erso.  She was played by Felicity Jones"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I wish they had delved more into her background and given her a bit more personality."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I agree with that.  But you gotta admit, the Darth Vader was pretty awesome!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was, although you do wonder why he didn't use any of those 'slam people into walls/ceiling' tactics in the other films."
