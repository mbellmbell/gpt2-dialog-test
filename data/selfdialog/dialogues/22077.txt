"__DISNEY__ Did you ever watch Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I watched Mulan years ago."
"__DISNEY__ I wanted to be just like Mulan when I grew up. I wanted to be tough and pretty like she was."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but it was Eddie Murphy doing the part of Mushu that really made the show."
"__DISNEY__ He was so funny and when he broke the head of the Great Dragon, I laughed till I cried."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, his job was to try to help bring honor to the family but he did not always help her."
"__DISNEY__ No, remember the scene where he was 'helping' Mulan think up a name for herself."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and Chi-Fu makes the comment about no wonder General Li never spoke of a son."
"__DISNEY__ I did like the part where she finally figured out how to climb to the top of the pole."
"__DISNEY__ That was the part that showed that intelligence could play more of a role than just physical toughness."
