"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Eh, the newest ones are okay, but I don't really like the older ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same here, the newer ones are much more entertaining. I don't care much for older movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ My main problem with the older ones is that the special effects look silly and I can't follow the story easily."
"__STAR_WARS__ I could follow the story, I just don't like how they look. The newer ones are much more attention grabbing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and aside from that the characters are way better now."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, Rey was a good addition to the last movie. She was a good role model for young girls, I believe."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, she exhibited a lot of strength and independence and I liked that about her."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. The ending was crazy though, the Luke Skywalker thing had me so confused."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same here, on the last scene my jaw hit the floor!"
