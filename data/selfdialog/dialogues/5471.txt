"__STAR_WARS__ So you know any good Star Wars trivia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, a few things yeah... for instance, you noticed in the prequels how Mace Windu's lightsaber is purple?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's like the only purple lightsaber we've seen in the films so far."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that was Samuel L Jackson's request.  He asked Lucas if he could get a purple, but didn't find out until seeing the movie that Lucas actually granted his request."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that's pretty cool.  Hey, here's a good one... the movie The Force Awakens takes place thirty year after Return of the Jedi, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Uh... I guess... not too familiar with the chronology."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it does.  And get this, The Force Awakens was released 32 years and 7 months after Return of the jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow... that's pretty neat.  You got that from IMDB didn't you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Guilty as charged."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha!"
