"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team do you think is going to win it all this year, NFL-wise?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've got to go with my Jets! I feel it this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, that's crazy! Who is your QB!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Umm... I must admit.. I'm not entirely sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See! They're gonna be trash, once again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's still Fitzpatrick! He's decent!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Decent doesn't win championships!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He just needs the right cast around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More like a miracle around him!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, yeah. Let me guess... you think that the Saints are gonna take it all this year, huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ AP is there, so you know it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's old now though. In his thirties!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So? So is Lynch, and you KNOW he's gonna tear the field up!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ LaGarette Blount DID have the most TDs last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa, whoa. No need to bring the 'Cheatriots' into this conversation!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My bad. I know how much you hate them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But yeah, the Saints just need a defense, and they made some good moves this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Brees, you know that much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. He deseres another one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a QB in the most pure sense. I agree."
