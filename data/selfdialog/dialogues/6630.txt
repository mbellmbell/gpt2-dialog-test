"__STAR_WARS__ You know keep the footages and just add more modern touches?"
"__STAR_WARS__ if they have the green screen originals then I guess that's possible."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why wouldn't they?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they're either destroyed or gets archived and gets old to a point where they become unusable."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's an extremely short sighted thing to do."
"__STAR_WARS__ Be that as it may, not sure if they have the original green backrgound footages."
"__STAR_WARS__ if they don't have them, then there is no way to add modern CGI to them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe not. There is always a way. It would be so cool to see the deathstar gets blown up in a more realistic way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even computer science phds probably won't be able to do it without the original green background footage"
"__STAR_WARS__ They can still do it, but it just takes too long. Have to do it frame by frame, pixel by pixel."
