"__MOVIES__ Do you know the movie Alice in Wonderland?"
"__MOVIES__ The live action one or the original cartoon version? I've seen them both."
"__MOVIES__ I meant the cartoon version. I didn't know there was a live action version."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, a first and a second one!"
"__MOVIES__ Are they any good?"
"__MOVIES__ I've only seen the first one, but it's a Tim Burton film, so it's a little weird."
"__MOVIES__ Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors."
"__MOVIES__ You would love this movie then! Lots of colors and trippy scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter both are, obviously."
"__MOVIES__ Who do they play?"
"__MOVIES__ Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter is the Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is also in it, as the White Queen."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like it any more or less than his other movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Personally, I think it's one of his best ones."
"__MOVIES__ Really!? Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ I just thought he put an interesting spin on the original tale. It's very action packed."
"__MOVIES__ Would it be okay for my children, do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it would be okay for most. There is not much violence."
"__MOVIES__ Good to know. I'll check it out!"
"__MOVIES__ Let me know what you think of it!"
