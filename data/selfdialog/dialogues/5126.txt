"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I didn't really care for the fast and the furious franchise."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really?  Why?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, it's a bunch of racers.  How entertaining can that really be?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Don't you watch the Indy 500?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No way!! It's all just rednecks and left hand turns."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ But it can be exciting, especially when there is a wreck"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes but why would you want to watch a car accident?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, there is definitely more to fast and furious than left hand turns and car accidents."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I suppose, but I still don't like the idea of a racing movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ To each their own i guess."
