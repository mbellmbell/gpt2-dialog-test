"__MOVIES__ There was more than one version of it?"
"__MOVIES__ There was the foreign film version made first, and then the English one."
"__MOVIES__ I only saw the English one, was the other one as good?"

"__MOVIES__ I am not a fast reader, so I probably wouldn’t be able to keep up."

"__MOVIES__ The American version was pretty graphic."
"__MOVIES__ I think the foreign one was more graphic than the American version."
"__MOVIES__ I think I went to it with my girlfriends, thank goodness I didn’t go with a guy I didn’t know well.  That would have been awkward."
"__MOVIES__ They both were graphic. Neither was a very good first date movie."
"__MOVIES__ Sexual assault in a movie is kind of weird in a romantic situation."
"__MOVIES__ The other books in the series were made in to movies as well."

"__MOVIES__ They were made by the same people as the foreign version."
"__MOVIES__ Were they good as well?"
