"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they should release the original unaltered version of Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, because all you can see now are the special editions."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I want to see it when it was just Star Wars and not A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ I doubt people know that it was originally released not as Episode 4."
"__STAR_WARS__ The original is much different than the new updated ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, there is the werewolf in the space port scene and so many other things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also, there was no Jabba."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the movie works much better without him."
"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite scene in the first movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The R2-D2 scene where he gets captured."
