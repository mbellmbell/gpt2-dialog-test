"__ROCK__ You know who's early music is frequently being overlooked by radio stations?"
"__ROCK__ No, who are you talking about? American or British, or what?"
"__ROCK__ I'm talking about David Bowie...He was British."
"__ROCK__ Oh, sure. 'Space Oddity', I know it."
"__ROCK__ Well, that's what I mean. Most people know that one, from his earliest American release."
"__ROCK__ Well, what else is there? 'Changes' is another that I recall."
"__ROCK__ Yep, that's another that gets played a lot. But my favorites hardly ever get played, like ones off the album, 'The Man Who sold The World'."
"__ROCK__ Didn't Kurt Cobain do a cover of that? Wasn't it with Nirvana?"
"__ROCK__ Yes, but my favorite is called 'The Supermen'. It's about a society of supermen that are so desperate to die that they battle each other in games every year, on purpose."
"__ROCK__ Didn't he also write a tune about a computer who wanted to destroy the word in 'Savior Machine'? I love that one too, and wish they would play it on the radio more often!"
