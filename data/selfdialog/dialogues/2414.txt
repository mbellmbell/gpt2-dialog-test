"__MUSIC__ Did you hear Iggy Azalea's new song SWITCH?"
"__MUSIC__ I did.  I also saw the leaked video."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what did you think?  I loved both of them."
"__MUSIC__ Both video and song reminded me of Nicki Minaj's work.  I like Nicki better."
"__MUSIC__ You think she's copying Nicki?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely!  The costumes look like she robbed Nicki's closet!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but the music was very different."
"__MUSIC__ She used Nicki's 'mirror, mirror on the wall' line."
"__MUSIC__ Everyone's using that line these days!"
"__MUSIC__ Iggy's voice didn't even sound like Iggy."
"__MUSIC__ What's wrong with experimenting with different sounds?  She's trying something new."
"__MUSIC__ New to her, but not new to mainstream pop or rap."
"__MUSIC__ Fine.  What do you think of the song without comparing her to Nicki?"
"__MUSIC__ It's okay.  I would dance to it, but I'm not in love with it."
"__MUSIC__ What about Anitta?  That was the first time I've heard of her."
"__MUSIC__ She's a Brazilian pop star, but I don't know much about her."
"__MUSIC__ I thought she was good on SWITCH."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  I might look her up on youtube."
"__MUSIC__ It looks like Iggy is creating a new image of herself."
"__MUSIC__ I'll watch the video again, but my initial impression was that she's stealing an image."
