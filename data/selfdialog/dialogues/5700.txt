"__STAR_WARS__ What are your thoughts on Luke Skywalker?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Kind of nerd, but ultimately turned into a pretty bad a** dude."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he got ripped in Empire"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I wouldn't say exactly ripped."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well he showed of his guns while carrying Yoda in Dagoba"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's true. Had that back pack thing to carry him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then he had that cool black outfit in Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, with the black glove."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah because his hand was shot in battle."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Jabba's sand cruiser thing."
