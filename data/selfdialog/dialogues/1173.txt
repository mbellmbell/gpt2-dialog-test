"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Tegan and Sara?"
"__MUSIC__ I like some of their songs, but I'm not a huge fan or anything."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Did you know they sing the Everything is Awesome song on The Lego Movie?"
"__MUSIC__ What! I had no idea."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. It sounds so much different than their other songs."
"__MUSIC__ It's so surprising. I almost can't believe it."
"__MUSIC__ They won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for it."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's amazing."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of The Lonely Island? They starred on that song."
"__MUSIC__ Now that I can expect. I like The Lonely Island for what it is, a funny twist on popular music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Their song I'm On A Boat is so funny."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe they got T-Pain in that song."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. His lyrics make it even funnier."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Weird Al Yankovic?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he's clever, but I don't really like his songs."
"__MUSIC__ I feel the same way."
"__MUSIC__ Hasn't he been sued before for Copyright Infringement?"
"__MUSIC__ Hm. I don't know."
"__MUSIC__ I was just wondering because it seems like he copies people's songs."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't say that. He makes the songs his own by coming up with his own lyrics."
