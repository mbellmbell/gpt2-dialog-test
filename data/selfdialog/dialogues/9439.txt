"__BASEBALL__ How do you think the Dodgers are going to do this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's hard to say, I guess it depends on how many injuries they have."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I know what you mean. For what, about four years now by the time they get to the play offs they're pretty beat up."
"__BASEBALL__ It's pretty discouraging, they win their division every year and then they fizzile in the play offs."
"__BASEBALL__ I know right, they kind of remind me of the Atlanta Braves in the 90's. They just couldn't quite win the big one."
"__BASEBALL__ They had a heck of a team back then though."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, with Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz, that was quite a pitching staff."
"__BASEBALL__ It was. Smoltz was pretty unbelievable after he got injured and came back as a relief pitcher."
"__BASEBALL__ It was like he had two careers. I wonder if he'll make it to the hall of fame."
"__BASEBALL__ I dunno. There's a lot of good players who don't get into the hall."
"__BASEBALL__ I think it's all a lot of political B.S."
"__BASEBALL__ Could be. But as long as Barry Bonds doesn't get in, I'm good with that."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he was just such an incredible jerk."
"__BASEBALL__ Not to mention the thing with the steroids."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, one year he was thin, and then the next year he shows up with an extra 30 pounds of muscle."
"__BASEBALL__ There is no way he wasn't taking steroids. Him and a lot of other players."
"__BASEBALL__ Look how long it took Piazza to get in to the hall, and he wasn't even suspected of using steroids."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep. Just because he played during that era, he was automatically assumed to be guilty."
"__BASEBALL__ I was really broken up when the Dodgers traded him. I think he got the royal shaft."
"__BASEBALL__ He did. The Dodgers can be jerks, and they can't win the World Series, and yet we root for them every year."
