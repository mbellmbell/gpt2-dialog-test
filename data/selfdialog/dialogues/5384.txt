"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they'll bring Leia back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Only if they already have the footage."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Fisher Estate won't allow it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They won't allow any electronic recreation of her image."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sad."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, I hope they already filmed her."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Knowing Disney, They probably already have the other two movies in the can."
