"__MOVIES__ People hate on Adam Sandler all of the time but I still like him."
"__MOVIES__ Really, his movies haven't been good in awhile."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but have they ever been?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you saying we have nostalgia goggles for him?"
"__MOVIES__ Possibly, his movies have always been pretty stupid comedies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but they hold up compared to his newer stuff, I still laugh at his old stuff."
"__MOVIES__ When is the last time you watched Billy Madison?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, years ago?"
"__MOVIES__ Give it another watch and you'll see it's in a similar style to his newer stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Do I actually want to do this and ruin my memories?"
"__MOVIES__ Or will it improve your perception of his newer stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure that's possible."
"__MOVIES__ Anything's possible, just as I've watched Big Daddy at least 50 times."
"__MOVIES__ Is that really your most watched movie by him?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, just something about it that's so rewatchable and heartwarming."
"__MOVIES__ That is true, it's one of his better stories, really likeable."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like it doesn't get enough credit sometimes as being a legitimately good movie."
"__MOVIES__ None of his movies do sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh now you're starting to sound like me."
"__MOVIES__ I take back what I said."
