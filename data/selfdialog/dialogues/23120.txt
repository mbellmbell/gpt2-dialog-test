"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie?  Mine is The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ The Lion King is pretty good, but Mulan is by far the best.  It has the strongest protagonist."
"__DISNEY__ No way, she's barely even a princess."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly why I like Mulan so much.  Most girls watching aren't princesses."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Disney movies are often about escapism and fantasy for children.  Does Mulan provide that over, say, Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ How many female soldiers do you know that overcome prejudice to save the emperor of China?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, fair point, but Mulan's story still seems more grounded in reality."
"__DISNEY__ It is!  And that's what is amazing about it.  It is so much more human than a story like The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Now that might be going too far, The Lion King is largely the story of Hamlet, retold with talking animals."
"__DISNEY__ Well, minus the talking ghosts.  Unless we count the Whoopi Goldberg's Hyena, since she was in Ghost!"
