"__BEATLES__ Hey, what's your favorite Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ Probably 'I wanna hold your hand'. Why you ask?"
"__BEATLES__ I dunno just because. I really don't see why they are so popular."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I know what you mean. Maybe must because they we're like the first rock band."
"__BEATLES__ That could be true."
"__BEATLES__ You know what, I really don't hear anyone talk much about the Beatles anymore."
"__BEATLES__ I rarely see them on t.v nowadays."
"__BEATLES__ It would be so cool if they made a comeback."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, they should come out and make some new songs."
"__BEATLES__ That would be awesome. We all need some new good, songs."
