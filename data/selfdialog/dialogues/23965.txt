"__SUPERHERO__ What superhero movies would you recommend for a family?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I would say the incredibles. It is a super hero family."
"__SUPERHERO__ I guess each family member would have someone to identify with. Do you think adults would actually enjoy it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I do. I enjoyed it myself, many animated films now a days have a lot of adult humor, it may go over the heads of you little ones but still lots for them to enjoy."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think you have a point, Sometimes now I catch jokes now that I did not when I watched a film as a child."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too. I would also recommend maybe the original 90s batman films, batman forever and returns, but maybe a little dark depending on ages of family."
"__SUPERHERO__ I love those films, ya I think my daughter is a little young still for those just yet."
"__SUPERHERO__ If you want to appeal to your daughter I would suggest the new wonder woman or kick ass both have strong female role models."
"__SUPERHERO__ That is a good suggestion. I heard the new wonder woman is wonderful."
"__SUPERHERO__ Gal godot is great and the film is all around enjoyable."
