"__THRILLER__ Action films have violence and strong heroes, while thrillers have suspense and innocents in jeopardy. Is Taken action or suspense?"
"__THRILLER__ That's easy. All three Taken movies are both; they are action thrillers."
"__THRILLER__ I get you. They're action movies with a strong hero, Liam Neeson as the dad--"
"__THRILLER__ Yes. And thrillers with a vulnerable innocent, Maggie Grace, as his estranged daughter Kim."
"__THRILLER__ Then there are the villains, the evil human traffickers. Unfortunately, the films stereotyped these villains terribly."
"__THRILLER__ They did, and it's jarring. On the other hand, there is the action movie element of beautiful scenery in foreign lands--"
"__THRILLER__ Mixed with the thriller element of tight, dark, threatening scenes."
"__THRILLER__ The action hero shows near superhuman fighting skills--"
"__THRILLER__ While the thriller lead endures unbelievable torment without giving in."
"__THRILLER__ Of course. It's an action thriller."
