"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So you're saying Kanye West is an egomaniac?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are you saying he's not? Have you gone deaf and blind? I mean I'll admit he's made some great albums."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Did you just say 'albums'? Are you the last person on earth who doesn't DJ but still uses that word?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey, don't get mad at me because I have an appreciation for the classics."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think you mean 'ancients'. You gonna pull out your Victrola too? And later on go see one of those talking picture shows?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Dude. Now you're avoiding the Kanye Concession. I know this little game."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You're about to have to admit that he's more conceited than he is talented. And ever since '808s  and Heartbreaks' you've been very sensitive about him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's got a kind soul, I can just tell. 'Heartless' is a timeless classic and absolutely pure of spirit."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I beg to differ. Nothing is pure after that much auto-tune."
