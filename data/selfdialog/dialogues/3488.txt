"__MUSIC__ I'm so tired, I went to see Otep last night and it wasn't over until almost midnight."
"__MUSIC__ Otep. Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's metal, I first saw her in 2002 at Ozzfest and I've followed her since."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't know that I know her. What does she sing?"
"__MUSIC__ Last night she did a lot of songs from the first album, Sevas Tra. You may have heard Battle Ready or Blood Pigs."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, is she the one who uses a pig head on stage?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! That's her! She uses it for Blood Pigs. Her stuff is really political and social, a lot of people don't like her."
"__MUSIC__ I remember seeing her at Ozzfest, I liked her. Doesn't she have a thing with Butcher Babies?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she was saying something about them. I like them, their music is catchy and their show is really high energy."
"__MUSIC__ I saw them at Mayhem fest a few years ago. I went to see Machine Head and caught their set that I really liked."
"__MUSIC__ I love Machine Head. Did you see when they did their solo tour?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! What's your favorite album of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ I love the Unto the Locust. I generally don't like bands who have really long songs but there's something about theirs that I really like."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I liked their really old stuff. I picked up the new album but I'm not crazy about it, there's a song or two I like."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to anything else good lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to see Stitched Up Heart the other night with Hell or Highwater, that was a good show."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard Stitched Up Heart. Who is Hell or Highwater?"
"__MUSIC__ The drummer and singer from Atreyu's new band. It's not all screamy like Atreyu, I really liked them. I met them after the show and got their new album."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I'll have to check them out. I forgot about Atreyu, I used to like them a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I haven't seen them in years, I think the last I thought about them was when they played an Ozzfest."
