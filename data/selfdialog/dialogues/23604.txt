"__DISNEY__ Who are your favorite non-main characters in Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, like not Aladdin or Woody?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, like in Beauty and the Beast, I like Belle's dad."
"__DISNEY__ Oh sure he was funny, and invented some really interesting things."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, so who is one of your favorites?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I like the side kick characters best, like the crab in The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Do you mean Sebastian?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, his song was one of the best in the whole movie."
"__DISNEY__ That's true - he really added a lot of fun and humor into The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think that's what the side kicks do best, is to be able to add jokes to the movies."
