"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the opening credits for the Star Wars franchise?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I remember being confused at what I was looking at the first time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it was a little confusing wasn't it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought so but the music was incredible and hooked me right away."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that star wars theme music will last for many more years and is so iconic."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think there is any music similar to it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You know i've never thought about it but I don't think so, nothing quite gives the same feeling."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right the music just mesmerizes you and get's you excited."
"__STAR_WARS__ The credit scroll speed was nice, do you think it was too fast?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No I think it was perfect."
