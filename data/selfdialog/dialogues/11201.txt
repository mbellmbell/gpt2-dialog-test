"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really mind football, Shirley, do you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I don't dislike it, Jean. I enjoy the pageantry, the bands, and they sometimes have really good singers too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or really bad ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but you can enjoy the bad ones, too in a way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, and I know I'm always affected by the national anthem, when it's sung in the stadium. It moves everybody, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What I dislike, and this is just a minor complaint, is that we have to come so early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they absolutely must tailgate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And eat greasy food, and drink beer"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But of course its better that people drink early. It gives them time to sober up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because the traffic is murder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it's my least favorite thing about football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite thing is seeing your old friends from the section. Visiting with the neighbors, you know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, you get to see them again every year, all season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can catch up on what they did that summer. And see what's new."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that's always nice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then, if the 49ers win, everybody's in a good mood."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It kind of sets people up for a pleasant week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then, if they go to the playoffs, everybody's happy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or if the 49ers win the superbowl, the men say 'we won.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As if they'd scored those touchdows themselves."
