"__DISNEY__ Did you see Zootopia?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that was an excellent movie!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree.  It seems like they set up for a sequel."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know when that is coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ I just looked and it may be coming out in 2021."
"__DISNEY__ That is so far away!  Why would they make us wait so long?"
"__DISNEY__ It's unfortunate because there aren't a lot of other animated movies that seem really good coming out in the upcoming future."
"__DISNEY__ Cars 3 is out, I'm excited to see that."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not a big fan of the Cars series, so I don't much care about that."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I will go see it without you then."
