"__MOVIES__ Did you see the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it like Pirates of the Caribbean 5 now?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it's called Dead Men Tell No Tales. Did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ No and I have no desire to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it and I liked it a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well I guess I just thought the movies kind of wrapped up after the third one."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the fourth Pirates?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I don't remember much about it, so it must not have been that great."
"__MOVIES__ The fourth one wasn't as good as the others because it didn't have Orlando Bloom in it."
"__MOVIES__ Does the fifth one have Orlando Bloom in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to spoil it, but kind of."
"__MOVIES__ What even happens in the fifth movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You really should see it. It has to do with Captain Jack getting himself into trouble again."
"__MOVIES__ Of course it does. They just use the same plot over and over again for those movies."
"__MOVIES__ I think this one is different enough. It has amazing graphics too."
"__MOVIES__ Does it still have the same humor the others movies had?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that never gets old to me."
"__MOVIES__ To me it does."
"__MOVIES__ I still think you would like it if you saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll see it when it if it's ever on Netflix."
