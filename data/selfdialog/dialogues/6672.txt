"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars, the original, had a lot of ground-breaking special effects."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was a real feast for the eyes."
"__STAR_WARS__ It deserved all those craft Oscars it won."
"__STAR_WARS__ Too bad that was back in the day when the Academy never took scii-fi seriously enough to give it a Best Picture Oscar."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe the Academy was still ticked off that George Lucas refused to put any credits at the beginning like the Academy wanted."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a really big deal back then, wasn't it? Like Lucas broke some kind of sacred Academy rule?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think so. They had such a row that Lucas resigned from the Academy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not a good look for the Academy, chasing away a premier filmmaker of the day."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Academy has always been pretty stuffy and stodgy. Hard to get new blood in there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Things seem to be changing nowadays, with novel wins for unusual projects. They still need to recognize more sci-fi though."
