"__MOVIES__ Did you get to see Arrival yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea! We watchedâ€‹ that the other day. It was during the day because I was scared."
"__MOVIES__ It does get pretty intense, I don't blame you."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know what it is about alien films, they seem more real, and scare me much more."
"__MOVIES__ No that's totally fair. I felt they handled the human response to the ships really accurately."
"__MOVIES__ Right? Like all the military involvement and secrecy around it."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely, and the media speculation around it."
"__MOVIES__ Man it was good. Amy Adams is always awesome though."
"__MOVIES__ I do love her. Who is her male co-star again?"
"__MOVIES__ It was that guy who plays Hawkeye in the new Marvel movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, Jeremy Renner."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. He's in the newest Bourne film too right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah The Bourne Legacy, after Matt Damon left it."
"__MOVIES__ Those were fun flicks!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they were. I think they're done making them after the Renner one."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad. It was a fun series. It felt a lot like Mission Impossible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it really did!"
"__MOVIES__ Lots of extreme action that's just sort of believable because maybe we really do have spies that advanced."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I believe it could be possible. They just have to train an insane amount."
"__MOVIES__ Either way, it was a great set of movies."
