"__MUSIC__ What's your feeling on country music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like some of it, but I prefer the newer pop country."
"__MUSIC__ Well then you don't like country! That is just a terrible version of true country."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I don't know. I think it is pretty catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I'll agree that it can be catchy, but I'd take Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, George Jones, and that era over anything else."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I do like Dolly Parton."
"__MUSIC__ She's definitely got more traditional country and pop country too."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I have to admit though, I do think I like her older music better."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that she was the original singer of I Will Always Love You?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean before Whitney Houston?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was originally Dolly's song."
"__MUSIC__ I had no idea. I guess Whitney really made it famous though."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, hers is more powerful ballad whereas Dolly's is just a sweet love song."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. I really love what she does with Kenny Rogers."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I mean, it isn't Christmas without the Dolly/Kenny Christmas album."
"__MUSIC__ That is so true. I grew up listening to that. Maybe that's why I'm partial to Dolly."
"__MUSIC__ I just think it is really powerful that she draws on growing up very poor in many of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, she's an excellent songwriter too."
"__MUSIC__ I would love to see her in concert, but she's getting older so I don't know if she'll be touring much more."
"__MUSIC__ Well if she does, just make sure you snag those tickets."
