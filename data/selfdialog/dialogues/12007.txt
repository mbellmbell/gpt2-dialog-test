"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been getting ready for the new Fantasy season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, I've got a lot of studying to do still."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should get on that! Everyone's been getting really intense with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya, everyone usually does haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm still not sure who I want my first pick to be, There's so many good choices."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya, I'm not really sure either, I was thinking about maybe getting Gronk or Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are good players, but I'm not sure if that's the route you should go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just not sure if they're good first picks ya know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They just might not get as many points as some other choices."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya, you're right, I definitely need to do some research."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya, we're going to have a draft party in about 2 weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really? Is everyone going to be there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya of course! We got a nice 4K TV just for this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that sounds awesome! I guess I'll have to start doing some research, huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya, I would get on that, we're upping the stakes this year too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really? Are we putting in more money than normal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya, everyone is thinking about putting in $50 so there's a huge prize pool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds cool, I'm definitely game for that."
