"__MUSIC__ So, what's been good, friend?"
"__MUSIC__ In Music, you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. What have you been listening to."
"__MUSIC__ Man, you know what? I cannot stop listening to Nile lately."
"__MUSIC__ What is Nile, precious?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you like heavy music?"
"__MUSIC__ Like Slipknot?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of. Imagine if Slipknot wasn't idiot rap metal and pretty singing like Celine Dion, but good."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what do they do?"
"__MUSIC__ All their songs are about ancient Egypt."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I love that place!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there's all these gods and curses and sand demons and pyramids and stuff."
"__MUSIC__ But what sort of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It is relentlessly brutal death metal. But the music is like Egyptian scales mixed with modern  minor keys and stuff like that."
"__MUSIC__ So, it's like authentic?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they even use old timey Egyptian instruments."
"__MUSIC__ That's a cool gimmick."
"__MUSIC__ It's more than a gimmick. The guy who orchestrates it, Karl Sanders, he's like a straight up Egyptologist."
"__MUSIC__ Oh,he has a degree?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know about that, but he walks around wearing like the eye of Ra or something, so that's probably the same thing."
