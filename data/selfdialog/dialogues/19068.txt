"__MOVIES__ Did you see Baby Face?"
"__MOVIES__ When did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Around 1934, pre-code."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the Hays Code?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they didn't really enforce it until 1935."
"__MOVIES__ Baby Face is worth seeing?"
"__MOVIES__ It's amazing."
"__MOVIES__ How are pre-code films different?"
"__MOVIES__ They don't have all the censorship and restrictions that came in with the Hays Code. It affected all American films from 1935 until the late '60s."
"__MOVIES__ So who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Barbara Stanwyck is probably the most famous name."
"__MOVIES__ She's great!"
"__MOVIES__ It starts with her alcoholic abusive father prostituting her from his dive bar!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I'm guessing it's not a Disney movie!"
"__MOVIES__ They did all kinds of stuff like that then, dealt with subjects that were never explored the same way for 3 decades."
"__MOVIES__ So what happens next?"
"__MOVIES__ She kills her father, runs away with the black maid and works her way to the top."
"__MOVIES__ College?"
"__MOVIES__ Hardly. But she's in charge the whole way. There's a lost print they found about 10-15 years ago, makes the film even better."
"__MOVIES__ I'm putting it on my list."
