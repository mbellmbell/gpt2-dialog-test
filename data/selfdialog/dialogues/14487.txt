"__HORROR__ Oh my god, I just saw a horror movie and it freaked me out."
"__HORROR__ That's their purpose."
"__HORROR__ Worse than usual."
"__HORROR__ Which one is it?"
"__HORROR__ Insidious, the original one."
"__HORROR__ Why did it freak you out?"
"__HORROR__ I have those same experiences."
"__HORROR__ The out-of-body while dreaming?"
"__HORROR__ More than that, it's the wandering and going places. It's a real thing."
"__HORROR__ Dang, that seems freaky."
