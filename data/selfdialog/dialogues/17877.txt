"__MOVIES__ Someone asked me what my favorite movie of all time is. I have so many I don't know how to answer!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm the same. There are so many good ones."
"__MOVIES__ I'm torn between Forrest Gump and Schindler's List."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, well those are certainly very different types of movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I know. Both Oscar winning ones though."
"__MOVIES__ I've always wanted to rent/buy DVD's of every single Best Picture Oscar winning movie, and watch them all."
"__MOVIES__ What a great idea!"
"__MOVIES__ If only they were sold as gift sets like that!"
"__MOVIES__ Who knows, maybe they are. That is really good idea, but it would take you forever to watch them all."
"__MOVIES__ I'd watch them over time though. Some I have already seen."
"__MOVIES__ I'm really bad with those things - I think I haven't seen many Oscar winning movies."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe  because you have bad taste in movies..."
"__MOVIES__ Very funny! You may have a point though.."
"__MOVIES__ Based on some of the movies I've seen you interested in, they're more likely to win Razzies that Oscars"
"__MOVIES__ What is a Razzie?"
"__MOVIES__ A Razzie is an award show for terrible movies! Worst picture, worst actor etc."
"__MOVIES__ Give me an example of a movie or actor that has won recently"
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Paris Hilton won for worst actress"
"__MOVIES__ Well that makes sense!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she's terrible!"
