"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, so you see how the deflated football incidents with the Pats, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What if someone paid the Pats to do that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NO WAY. They debunked that stuff a long time ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, sure. But what if there was someone behind it, and not the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're overthinking this a little bi."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, come on! Sure, the Patriots wanna win the Super Bowl badly!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but that doesn't justify how someone else could be behind the deflated balls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think about it, though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugggh, I'm not so sure, man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, who else could have done it, then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Someone in the football team, obviously not among the players!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NOOO, dumb-nut! I meant the mastermind behind it all!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uhhhh, I don't think there's anyone behind the incident."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, why you gotta be so stubborn sometimes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's me, man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever, so who do you think is an alright thrower?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kaepernick's pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wanna watch Aaron Rodgers throw at practice?"
