"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the 'Brat Pack'?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. What were some of their movies again?"
"__MOVIES__ The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire, stuff like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, most of those actors sorta fizzled out didn't they?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when was the last time you heard anything about Emilio Estevez or Andrew McCarthy?"
"__MOVIES__ Who's Andrew McCarthy?"
"__MOVIES__ He was the rich kid in Pretty in Pink."
"__MOVIES__ Molly Ringwald's crush?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, that's the one. What in the world happened to him?"
"__MOVIES__ Beats me, I completely forgot about that guy."
"__MOVIES__ Who was the rich jerk in that movie? The dude with the slicked back hair?"
"__MOVIES__ James Spader wasn't it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's right. He's really come into success with his TV career."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty in Pink was a John Hughes movie wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Shermer in Illinois all the way."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of weird that all of Hughes' films took place in the same town."
"__MOVIES__ That is kind of weird. The Breakfast Club was my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Judd Nelson was fierce in that one."
"__MOVIES__ Molly Ringwald was really cute too. Where's she at now?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea. Probably married with a couple of kids."
