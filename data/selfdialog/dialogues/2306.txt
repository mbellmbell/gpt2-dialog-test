"__MUSIC__ How crazy is it that New Found Glory is still making music?"
"__MUSIC__ It is not that crazy they are a good band."
"__MUSIC__ But to be around this long is insane nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ Funny thing is they probably dont get in the rock and roll hall of fame."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because typically bands from this genre dont get in."
"__MUSIC__ Because they arent on a major label?"
"__MUSIC__ No because they arent radio hits."
"__MUSIC__ What is actually even played on radio anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ I know thats sort of my point."
"__MUSIC__ So if they played semi-indie music from Britain they would be in?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah sure if you look at it that way"
"__MUSIC__ What other way is there?"
"__MUSIC__ They just dont have a song that the masses know."
"__MUSIC__ I think they have a ton of hits"
"__MUSIC__ But thats with a specific group of people"
"__MUSIC__ So their music doesnt have mass appeal?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldnt say they dont have mass appeal but its just not there with sales."
"__MUSIC__ They have survived this long I think they are doing just fine."
"__MUSIC__ They do have quite an exquisite tour bus from what I have seen."
