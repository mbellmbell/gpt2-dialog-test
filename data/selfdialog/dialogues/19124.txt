"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite Disney animated movie, growing up as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ For me, it's Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ That one was pretty good, but I'm more of a Lion King fan."
"__MOVIES__ Yuck! Lion King was one of my least favorites."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy, it's so good. The songs were outstanding!"
"__MOVIES__ I liked 'Circle of Life', but most of them weren't doing much for me."
"__MOVIES__ 'Hakuna Matata'? That song is so fun and catchy."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was corny, and I didn't like Timon or Pumba."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not going to say Beauty and the Beast was bad, but Lion King was way more beautifully animated."
"__MOVIES__ I can't agree with that. Some of the stuff they did in Beauty and the Beast had never been done before. Remember the ballroom scene?"
"__MOVIES__ That was nice, but that was one scene."
"__MOVIES__ I think Beauty and the Beast actually won an Oscar for Best Picture."
"__MOVIES__ No, they were nominated but didn't win. No animated movie has ever won the Oscar for Best Picture."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, that's right. But still, Lion King didn't get nominated."
"__MOVIES__ Neither did Little Mermaid, or Pocahontas, or any of the others. So what does that prove?"
"__MOVIES__ That Beauty and the Beast is the best one!"
"__MOVIES__ I still think the Lion King was better. Simba is my dude!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you watch any of the direct-to-DVD movies they made tthat were sequels to Lion King?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't even know they made them."
"__MOVIES__ Consider yourself lucky not to have known, it could have destroyed your childhood."
