"__MUSIC__ So what do you think of classical music."
"__MUSIC__ It's okay. I played a lot of it in band class."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah we did in orchestra class too."
"__MUSIC__ Really what were some of your favorite songs to play?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite was 'Ave Maria'. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Mine was 'Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring.'"
"__MUSIC__ Really, why that one?"
"__MUSIC__ It was great. It was really complex to play on the clarinet because it went over the bridge."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I remember we had to move quickly with the bow when playing."
"__MUSIC__ Yes and it has such a smooth sound to it."
"__MUSIC__ Looks like we were both Bach fans."
"__MUSIC__ Oh for sure. He was a great composer. One of the greatest we have had."
"__MUSIC__ At least as far as classical for sure. He of course composed all his songs."
"__MUSIC__ Not like today's artists. Some of them do but usually they have a group to revise them now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I really like the classic sounds of music like this."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Have you heard the electric violins playing some of these?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I did not know they had electric violins."
"__MUSIC__ You should check out Lindsey Stirling. She is one of the best."
"__MUSIC__ Really I will have to listen to her. What is a good song to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Check out 'Stars Align.' Not classical in nature but great for electric violin."
