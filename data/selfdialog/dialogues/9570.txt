"__COMEDY__ White Chicks is one my all time favorite comedies."
"__COMEDY__ Me too. Every time I watch that movie I laugh non-stop."
"__COMEDY__ The absurdity of it is what cracks me up."
"__COMEDY__ I know. It's so unbelievable that anyone would mistake the Wayans for two spoiled white girls, but that's what makes it so funny."
"__COMEDY__ I definitely enjoy the Wayans more in this movie than in the Scary Movies."
"__COMEDY__ I agree. I think they are able to showcase their talents more in White Chicks, although I find both movies to be funny."
"__COMEDY__ Really? I can't stand the Scary Movie franchise."
"__COMEDY__ Wow, why?"
"__COMEDY__ I just think parody movies are so overrated, and they don't require much talent."
"__COMEDY__ I guess you could say that, but they still manage to make me laugh."
