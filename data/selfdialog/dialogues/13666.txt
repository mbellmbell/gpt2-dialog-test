"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Golden State Warriors game tonight?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, they won and swept the Jazz."
"__BASKETBALL__ They will probably win another championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ The only team that has a chance to beat them is Cleveland."
"__BASKETBALL__ Cleveland may win a game or two, but that's about it."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're probably right."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kind of isn't fair that they had a great team and added Kevin Durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the NBA is kind of always that way; one or two teams are stacked and everyone else is mediocre."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I wonder how they managed to stay under the cap."
"__BASKETBALL__ The cap in the NBA is a soft cap, and essentially a joke."
"__BASKETBALL__ The NHL and the NFL have it right with a hard cap."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it creates more balance. Did you know that only about 8 teams have won the championship since 1985."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's it? The same old teams always seem to win a championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I believe it was only the Lakers, Celtics, Pistons, Spurs, Bulls, Rockets, Cavaliers, Mavericks, Heat, and the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's 10 teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ Still, that's not too much of competitive balance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kind of sucks that it will be one of those teams again: Cavaliers or Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ You mean the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, the Warriors. Nobody will beat them."
"__BASKETBALL__ What a boring league."
