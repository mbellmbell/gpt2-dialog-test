"__MOVIES__ You know what I like to do is go see classic old movies in the theater when they have revival screenings."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's cool. I should do that more."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's so much fun. I saw Gone With the Wind at the Cinerama Dome several years ago, which was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ That's a long movie. I think I'd get bored."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I thought, too, to be honest. But I didn't get bored at all. I was totally into it."
"__MOVIES__ That's great. What else have you seen that you liked?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's see, I saw Casablanca, which is so romantic and sad and wonderful."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that one I would like to see, for sure. I'm kind of embarrassed that I've never seen it."
"__MOVIES__ It is a classic, for sure. Let's see, what else have I seen?"
"__MOVIES__ How about The Maltese Falcon?"
"__MOVIES__ Have never seen that one, but it's on my list. Anything with Humphrey Bogart."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's one of those perennially cool guys. Clark Gable, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, those guys were real men. Forget the action heroes we've got today, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, I agree with you. You know who I think is great? Gregory Peck."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess. In To Kill A Mockingbird."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, he's such a hero in that movie. So noble, so much integrity."
"__MOVIES__ He's like the perfect dad in that movie. Don't tell my dad I said that, okay?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I won't. I think your dad would understand though."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. We should go see something at the revival movie theater."
"__MOVIES__ I'd love that. Let's go see what's playing."
