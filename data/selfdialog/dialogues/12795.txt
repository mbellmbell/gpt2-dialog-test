"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts about the Arizona Cardinals?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have some great young players, perhaps not enough for a superbowl run"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carson Palmer is getting up there in age so I can see that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not only Palmer, but Larry Fitzgerald is on the fence of retirement also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One guy I do like is David Johnson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he is a good young RB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a steal in the draft, he was what a 3rd or 4th round pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure but I think you are close if not correct."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has been dominating the past few seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he has a legit MVP shot this year if he can stay healthy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Health and the fact if the Cardinals can keep up the pass game to keep the pressure off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone knows Johnson is going to get his touches so keeping the safetys deep is crucial"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is there anyone else that sticks out to you on the Cardinals?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like LB Deone Bucannon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the Safety that converted to Linebacker"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was a great move. His speed and coverage skills are awesome for a LB"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only downside is that he is undersized, he is still in the same weight as he was at Safety"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true but he makes up for it in speed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So David Johnson and Deone Bucannon. The future of the Cardinals perhaps?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those two are a good group to build around that is for sure."
