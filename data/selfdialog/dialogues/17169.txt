"__MOVIES__ Have you see Priscilla Queen of the Desert?"
"__MOVIES__ That is such a fun movie. I love the soundtrack."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe that that guy is Guy Pierce in 1994!"
"__MOVIES__ And what about Terrence Stamp? He is always so manly. I can't believe he went drag."
"__MOVIES__ He seemed to really enjoy doing that movie too. He was nothing like that in the Limey!"
"__MOVIES__ Well look at Hugo Weaving. Can you believe he was in the Matrix?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Mitzi Del Bra! I think all those guys had the best time doing that film. How could you not?"
"__MOVIES__ I know it's so uplifting and the costumes were so great. I'd like to try something like that just for fun!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Too Wong Foo? I think that as Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it. It was pretty good but not as good as Pricilla."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was 1995."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Pricilla is a hard act to follow."
"__MOVIES__ I saw John Leguizamo in something recently. He still acts a good bit. Unlike Guy Pierce. Has he done anything lately?"
"__MOVIES__ He must be doing a lot of Aussie films now. I haven't seen him in anything since The Hurt Locker in 2009."
"__MOVIES__ Geez was that when that was? What was that about?"
"__MOVIES__ That was the war thriller film. Iraq War Explosive Ordnance Disposal  team who are being targeted by insurgents with booby traps, remote control detonations and ambushes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I remember that. It was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but not as good as Black Hawk Down."
"__MOVIES__ That was a killer movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's a ton of actors who were no bodys at the time and are now huge names, like Tom Hardy."
