"__BEATLES__ Who was a better song writer, Lennon or McCarthy"
"__BEATLES__ That is the $64,000 question.  And it is really hard to answer"
"__BEATLES__ I think it was John Lennon"
"__BEATLES__ What makes it hard to answer was an agreement that McCarthy and Lennon made early in their collaboration."
"__BEATLES__ They had an agreement?"
"__BEATLES__ They said no matter who wrote the most of or the least of a song, the song would only be credited as written by Lennon and McCarthy"
"__BEATLES__ So how can you tell who wrote it."
"__BEATLES__ In the early years it was probably a fair share collaboration between the two"
"__BEATLES__ In later years, especially when the songs where big hits, like Yesterday and Imagine, each got their own credit."
"__BEATLES__ I still think John Lennon was the best composer.  I really liked the Ballad of John and Yoko"
