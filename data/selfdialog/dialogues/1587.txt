"__MUSIC__ Are you into classic rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Like 60s and 70s era? Yeah, definitely."
"__MUSIC__ What are your favorite bands from that era?"
"__MUSIC__ Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, that kind of thing. You?"
"__MUSIC__ I love Led Zep and Pink Floyd too. Do you like The Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ I always thought they were a bit overrated to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, really?! What have you listened to?"
"__MUSIC__ Not much beyond the really well-known stuff, if I'm honest."
"__MUSIC__ That's the problem then - the Rolling Stones best stuff is their least known stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Like The Beatles, huh? What would you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Just play a classic Stones album through - the non-single tracks will show you what a great band they are."
"__MUSIC__ I will do, thanks. I had the same thing with The Beatles. They're best stuff is the least-know."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, all the early pop Beatles that everyone knows is way before they started experimenting."
"__MUSIC__ With both drugs and different genres! That was most bands back then, though."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Beatles album?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably 'The White Album', because it has so many different types of songs. You?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Revolver' or 'Abbey Road' - they're both really different but I love them equally."
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles never made a bad album, which is pretty extraordinary."
"__MUSIC__ All four were so talented and in tune with each other... there'll never be another band like that."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe one day, you never know. That was a great era for rock music though."
