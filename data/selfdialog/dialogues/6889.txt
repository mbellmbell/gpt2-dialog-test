"__STAR_WARS__ How did you enjoy Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was great! I can see why everyone recommended it."
"__STAR_WARS__ A lot of people were worried that Jyn Erso was going to be a bad copy of Han Solo, but she wasn't, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, and I liked how her values never quite aligned with anyone else's, even as she was fighting so hard for their cause."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was so sad at the ending. I mean, it was perfect, but I loved those characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would watch a movie just about Chirrut and Baze."
"__STAR_WARS__ So would I! I wanted to know more about their temple."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would sit and watch those two banter about anything."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was kind of cool realizing that there were probably all sorts of force-sensitive people around going without training."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe there were pseudo-Jedi enclaves springing up everywhere!"
