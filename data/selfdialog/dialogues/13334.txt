"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ do you think there was a good draft this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there is a good draft every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because there are always some people taken in the late rounds who end up surprising everyone. Those are the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh? Like who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, for example, in the 2000 draft there were 6 quarterbacks drafted before Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, he wasn't taken until the 6th round and look at him now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess that's pretty impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You never know who is going to turn into a great player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you love every draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, That's a possibility for every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But a lot of times it's the first picks that count."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ not always, Sometimes players picked in the first few picks end up being a bust."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ryan Leaf. He was drafted 2nd overall by the chargers in 1998."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His career ended in 2001. And he ended up in prison eventually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You never know what you're really getting from your draft picks."
