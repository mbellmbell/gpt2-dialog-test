"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Royksopp?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what is Royksopp?"
"__MUSIC__ They are an electronic music group from Norway."
"__MUSIC__ I don't listen to a lot of Norwegian music. Is it really good?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they're very unique and creative. They write songs with good lyrics and an interesting sound which definitely sounds European."
"__MUSIC__ I'm always looking for something different, so I sometimes check out European groups. Are they really new?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, they've been around since the late '90s."
"__MUSIC__ I see. It's funny that I haven't heard of them. They must be obscure."
"__MUSIC__ They never had any really big hits here in the United States, but one of their songs was used on a Geico commercial. You would definitely recognize it if you heard it."
"__MUSIC__ Which commercial was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the one where the caveman was in the airport and he was on the conveyor walkway."
"__MUSIC__ I think I remember that. The song was talking about 'remind me of another place and time.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's the one. It's called 'Remind Me.'"
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check that out on Youtube. I liked that commercial."
"__MUSIC__ There is also a female vocalist that sings with the group on some of their albums. She has a really cute voice."
"__MUSIC__ That can be fun. Which song should I check out featuring her vocals?"
"__MUSIC__ I think 'The Girl and the Robot' is a good one. My favorite one with her is 'This Must be It.'"
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check those out too. What bands do you think they're similar too?"
"__MUSIC__ Compared to bands in America, I really can't think of one right off the bat. They have a very electronic techno kind of European style, but the vocals are also very good."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I'll have to just listen to them in order to find out."
