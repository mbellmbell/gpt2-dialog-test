"__DISNEY__ Can you believe it is the 15th anniversary of Lilo and Stitch?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you serious, it can't have been that long ago..."
"__DISNEY__ I know I feel so old. Disney store is having 15th year anniversary products."
"__DISNEY__ You're telling me, I swear it was just yesterday that came out. Anything cute up for sale?"
"__DISNEY__ Umm when is stitch not cute? He is totally still my favorite Disney character!"
"__DISNEY__ I know you love him. But I mean come on Pascal is pretty cute too and he has Maximus as a side kick."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but Stitch has Angel and like 625 other cousins to keep him company! And Pudge of course..."
"__DISNEY__ True true... I had totally forgotten they did more than one Stitch movie. And I mean who can argue about Pudge; I mean he controls the weather..."
"__DISNEY__ How could you forget that? There were three movies and a tv show; once again proving he is the best."
"__DISNEY__ Agree to disagree. Although now I am hungry for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
