"__MUSIC__ Question for you, who do you think was more talented Michael Jackson or Prince?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really sure, I've got mixed feelings on it.  They were both amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but overall, I think Prince was more talented."
"__MUSIC__ I can see your line of thinking, but I'm going to have to say Michael."
"__MUSIC__ See, that's what I thought at first too, he definitely has more hits."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, everyone knows his songs."
"__MUSIC__ But, I think overall, Prince was more talented."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he tears it up on guitar, had one of the best voices in Music, and he wrote a lot of his stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, so I guess on talent he does have one up on Michael."
"__MUSIC__ Even though he's more talented, I think I'd still rather see Michael Jackson in concert."
"__MUSIC__ That would be awesome, I'm sad it'll never happen.  I think there's only one other band I would rather see then him."
"__MUSIC__ More than Michael? Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Queen."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know how I didn't think about them!  Good call."
"__MUSIC__ Freddie Mercury had the best voice in Rock, and seeing videos they put on an amazing show."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they did, what's your favorite queen song?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Bohemian Rhapsody."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too.  We will rock you is a classic too."
"__MUSIC__ Can't argue with you on that."
