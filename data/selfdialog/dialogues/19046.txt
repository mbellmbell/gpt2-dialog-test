"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the trailer for the new Reese Witherspoon movie, Home Again?"
"__MOVIES__ I did! Doesn't it look great? I still can't get over her in Big Little Lies."
"__MOVIES__ She's represented herself so well throughout her whole career."
"__MOVIES__ From Legally Blonde to Walk the Line to now? She can do it all."
"__MOVIES__ She's as relatable as an actress can be. So in Home Again, her character lives with three guys?"
"__MOVIES__ And it looks like her ex-husband comes back for a bit? That's a set-up for some complications!"
"__MOVIES__ More and more, movies are showing women without the perfect lives."
"__MOVIES__ We don't have to have it all. It's okay if women make mistakes, if we make a mess of things."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Finally we're admitting that as a society--and Hollywood is catching on."
"__MOVIES__ How do you think the character lives with three men at once?"
"__MOVIES__ It looks like she's kinda playing Mom to them. Even if there's romance involved."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think that says about being 40? Women have to play the Mom role?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so--I think it's just saying moms get used to being moms."
"__MOVIES__ But she also breaks out of that a bit. Going crazy on her birthday?"
"__MOVIES__ You can't only be a mom, silly!"
"__MOVIES__ I hope I have crazy birthdays until I'm 80, not just until I have kids."
"__MOVIES__ Reese Witherspoon's character would probably say the same."
"__MOVIES__ You can be a mom and a person! Home Again seems to explore that idea."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely want to see it. Not just because I love Reese Witherspoon."
"__MOVIES__ She can do no wrong!"
