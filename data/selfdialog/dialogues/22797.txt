"__DISNEY__ Did you know that the new Beauty and the Beast movie recently came out on Blu Ray and DVD?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I actually even pre-ordered it because I wanted it so much!"
"__DISNEY__ I love the new songs in this version of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ I really like the song in the tavern about Gaston, especially the new additions with the lines LeFou adds."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I like the line where he talks about not being able to spell Gaston's name."
"__DISNEY__ I think Josh Gad might have improvised a lot of those lines like that one. I know he did that when he played Olaf in Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Well, he must be pretty creative then!"
"__DISNEY__ I also enjoy how the character of LeFou has been developed more from the animated version."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, he doesn't seem quite so evil in this one, like he might actually have a conscience."
