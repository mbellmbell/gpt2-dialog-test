"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, what is your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Baltimore Ravens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's unfortunate. Im a Steelers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch, guess we are rivals huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I dont like the Ravens, but I respect them"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I dislike the Steelers but the rivalry is great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will get the better of the series this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to say the Ravens, since Im a fan, but I think both teams will be pretty good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Plus the teams always play tight games regardless of how good they are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats for sure! There definitely arent many blowouts when they play each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are always rough, hard hitting games too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love that. The teams play so hard against each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it seems like they are mirror images of each other. They both play a very similar style."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I love about the AFC North. The games are close and the style is really fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Except for when the Browns are playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Looks like we agree about one thing! The Browns are a joke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they are. Even though I dont like them, I want to see them get better so there's more competition in the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. I want the AFC North to be the best division in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. As much as I hate to say it, Id rather a team from the division won the Super Bowl even if I hated that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, me too. I dont see the Browns doing that soon though!"
