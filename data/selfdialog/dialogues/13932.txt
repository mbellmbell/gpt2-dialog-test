"__BASKETBALL__ Did you watch the Cavaliers and Celtics game on Friday night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ For a while.  But it was so uncompetitive I eventually turned it off."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too.  I can't believe how one-sided it is."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know Lebron is unstoppable and all, but the Celtics are supposed to be the number one team in the East and lost by almost 50 points at home!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it's incredible.  And now with Isaiah Thomas out it could be even worse the rest of the way."
"__BASKETBALL__ Please no!  Maybe they'll figure out a way to pull things together and make the next couple games interesting."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hope so but wouldn't count on it.  You know uncertainty is the only certainty in sports but I think this has 4-0 sweep written all over it."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're probably right.  It's the same thing with the Warriors and Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the radio guys have been saying 'Why even play these other games?'  Just have the Warriors and Cavs play a best of 11 series or something."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ha!  That would be good and what everyone really wants to see!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I really wish Kawhi Leonard hadn't gotten hurt.  They could have made it a series."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, I don't know why everyone had the Spurs such a big underdog."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, it's not quite the same Spurs team from a few years ago.  But it's still the Spurs!"
"__BASKETBALL__ If Kawhi and Parker were both playing, it could have been really interesting."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh well!  What's your prediction for the Finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Cleveland wins in six."
"__BASKETBALL__ Really?  I disagree.  This is a revenge year for the Warriors!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe.  But Lebron is just too tough right now and Steph and Durant don't seem to play that well against him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but the Warriors had it won last year if it hadn't been for Draymond getting suspended and now have Durant too! I say Warriors win in six."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I guess we'll find out soon enough.  Go Cavs!"
