"__MUSIC__ I want to make a Summer playlist for the party on Saturday."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of songs do you want to put on it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, at first I was thinking about some pop music."
"__MUSIC__ That's always easy."
"__MUSIC__ But I'm leaning towards something a bit more relaxed."
"__MUSIC__ It is going to be a lazy kind of Sunday party."
"__MUSIC__ Right. So, do you have any ideas for that?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, maybe Daft Punk? Doin' it Right?"
"__MUSIC__ I can add that."
"__MUSIC__ And then maybe some jazz."
"__MUSIC__ Jazz might be a good idea."
"__MUSIC__ Post-rock is also usually pretty laid back."
"__MUSIC__ Got any recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe toe?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Okay. I was also thinking, what's that song at the end of Lost in Translation that you recommended?"
"__MUSIC__ Kaze wo Atsumete?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. That was nice and breezy. Do they have other songs like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Happy End? Yep. Should I lend you the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Please do!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll go get it!"
