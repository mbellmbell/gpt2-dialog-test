"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My boyfriend loves the NFL!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just about everyone I know loves to watch football. Do you like it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I like it more now that my boyfriend has explained the game to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team does he like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He likes the Dallas Cowboys best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that your favorite team too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, for now it is because that is the team I have watched the most but I may choose another team at a later date."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really watch football much because I don't have live television."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My boyfriend says that games on television are better than live games because they show the replay in slow motion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand that but wouldn't a live game be really exciting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose so but it's so expensive I don't think I'd ever really go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could get tickets to a Cowboys game for your boyfriend for Christmas. He'd love that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good idea. He has all kinds of Cowboys memorabilia."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A steering wheel cover and floor mats for his truck, shirts, and even a seat from the old stadium that his Dad bought him for his Birthday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What in the world does he do with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly it is just sitting in his closet collecting dust."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What a silly waste of money!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, it means a lot to him that his Dad thought to buy him something he would like. They aren't close but he wishes they were."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I guess that is nice then, but I wouldn't want that old thing in my house!"
