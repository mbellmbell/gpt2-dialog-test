"__BASKETBALL__ Hey did you see that article about Kevin Durant?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What about him?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Apparently he removed Russell Westbrook from his phone contacts."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you serious? Wow...how do you know?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Because they said that Westbrook tried to call him when he was in town and Durant texted back 'Who is this?'"
"__BASKETBALL__ I never thought that would happen, it's a shame. I really don't like Golden State."
"__BASKETBALL__ Dude, me either. I respect Durant's game but I don't like these things they've been saying about him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Same here. Russell Westbrook is doing so well though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed! All those triple doubles, it's insane."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm actually trying to get tickets to an OKC game next week. Would you want me to get you a ticket?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course man, that would be so much fun!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'll make sure to do that. I'm really liking Westbrook lately and they're playing the Timberwolves."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are they from Minnesota?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah! Their team is really stepping it up lately."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed. Karl Anthony Townes is my favorite player probably."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, way less drama on that team. Plus, they have a great spirit."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know what you mean. We should try to go to games more often."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah we should. I just hope that I can still enjoy watching the Thunder without Durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah its too bad...but I'll see you next week then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes of course!"
