"__DISNEY__ Hey did you end up seeing the new live action Beauty and the Beast movie??"
"__DISNEY__ No not yet but I heard that it did really well at the box office."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. I heard because of the success of this one they're going to make a live action The Little Mermaid too!"
"__DISNEY__ That's awesome! That was one of my favorites growing up."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I'll be excited to see what they do with it."
"__DISNEY__ Well I heard that the live action Beauty and the Beast was really well done and that Emma Watson was the perfect Belle."
"__DISNEY__ I saw the photographs of her in the yellow ball gown. Remember the scene where Mrs. Potts is singing 'Tale as Old as Time' and they're dressed up and dancing?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course I remember that! And I saw the photographs too. I agree Emma Watson was the perfect Belle."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder who they'd cast for The Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm, I think that Bella Thorne or Karen Gillan could do it. They both have red hair and are young."
