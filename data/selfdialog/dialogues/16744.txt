"__MOVIES__ Hey what are the best actions movies that everybody should see?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say the John Wick movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I can agree with that. Those films where fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely, you know how long it's been since a good old fashion action flick has come out with no special message?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean special message?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, like trying to be some kind of avdocate for something."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Like women's rights, or LGTB, Race, Religion, etc."
"__MOVIES__ What do you have against all that stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing, but it's annoying to see it in almost every film."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I'll admit there is a bit of an over satuaration in the majority of films out now."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that is exactly my point. The John Wick movies didn't have any of that stuff in it and it was a breath of fresh air in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't look at it like that but now that you mention it I see what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ I just hope they continue to make films like that in the future."
"__MOVIES__ I can agree with that. It's nice to have unfiltered movies on the market."
"__MOVIES__ Nice? It's a blessing to have movies like that on the market. The industry has way too much junk in it now."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure most people would agree with you. I jsut don't think anyone would really speak out about it."
"__MOVIES__ The reason no one would say anything is because they don't want to be seen as some kind of anti 'whatever group.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that is true."
"__MOVIES__ If I could I'd send all directors a copy of John Wick with a letter saying 'Take notes'."
