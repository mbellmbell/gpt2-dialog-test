"__MOVIES__ So my better half is obsessed with the movie Knight and Day."
"__MOVIES__ That's the one with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in it, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ It is a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is. When she has it on i will watch it."
"__MOVIES__ I know you girlfriend loves it, what do you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's a Tom Cruise action film but it is different from his others."
"__MOVIES__ Like the Mission Impossible or Jack Reacher series?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he brings a couple of elements from both but it is it's own vehicle."
"__MOVIES__ That's what i originally thought. Chick Flick meets Mission Impossible."
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha, Yes, that would be a good analogy."
"__MOVIES__ I'm suprised they didnt do a sequel of it."
"__MOVIES__ They may. I know there were a couple of copycat movies like it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, like Killers."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that had Asthon Kushner and Katherene Heigl in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was ok but not as good as Knight and Day."
"__MOVIES__ True. It didnt grab me as much as Knight and Day did."
"__MOVIES__ it had it's moments."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Killers had a 75 million dollar budget and Knight and Day had a 117 million dollr budget so that may had been a issue."
"__MOVIES__ Well, still when you are in the price range you can get some good dialog and action."
