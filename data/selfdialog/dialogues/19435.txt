"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'Coraline'?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't, what kind of movie is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a stop-motion picture based on a storybook."
"__MOVIES__ So it's kid-friendly?"
"__MOVIES__ Hm, see, it's animated, but it might be a little scary for kids to see."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any famous voices in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Teri Hatcher from 'Desperate Housewives,' and Dakota Fanning voice some of the characters."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great, I love both of these actresses."
"__MOVIES__ It's also a great movie for those who have a big imagination. It's really seen through a child's eyes."
"__MOVIES__ Where does the movie take place?"
"__MOVIES__ So Coraline has recently moved from Michigan to Oregon."
"__MOVIES__ That's great! So it includes all of that great Pacific Northwest scenery?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, absolutely, it looks dreary and rainy for some parts, but it also looks nice and snowy, with those Evergreen trees at some parts."
"__MOVIES__ What's the story about?"
"__MOVIES__ Coraline has recently moved from Michigan to Oregon, and her parents are renting an apartment at a house full of interesting characters. Coraline stumbles upon a hidden doorway in her house, which leads her to another world. The same characters are in this other world, they're just different forms of themselves."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that sounds really cool! How is the animation?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it's beautiful. There's a lot of blue, which I know is your favorite color."
"__MOVIES__ I really do love blue and stop movie films. Sounds like a must-see."
"__MOVIES__ You can stream it now! I think I saw it on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I think I'll head home and try to watch it. I can't wait!"
