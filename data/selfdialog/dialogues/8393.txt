"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ I like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band but my favorite has to be the White Album."
"__BEATLES__ Really? I thought that album was a bit of a downer."
"__BEATLES__ Are you kidding? The first time I heard, 'While my guitar gently weeps,' it absolutely blew me away."
"__BEATLES__ That's not even in the same league as 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.'"
"__BEATLES__ I never really got into that song."
"__BEATLES__ Too bad, that whole album absolutely captivated me for an entire year."
"__BEATLES__ It's really hard to find a bad Beatles album, isn't it?"
"__BEATLES__ I know what you mean. I can't imagine how they produced so many epic songs."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, even the song 'Imagine' is the first song you thing of when you hear that word."
