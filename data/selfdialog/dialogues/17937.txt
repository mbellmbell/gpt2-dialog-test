"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Vin Diesel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh you mean the one that already has like what 7 or 8 parts to it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes the one that is number 8. My husband took me to it and I thought that it couldn't be any good."
"__MOVIES__ And let me guess there was a lot of crashes and stealing of cars and hot sexy men."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but there was actually a good story line to it. It actually had all the adventure and of course hot cars and Vin Diesel and the Rock."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know the Rock played in it."
"__MOVIES__ He returns back as head of the group leading a mission. And of course he had his big gun along side. Nathan Staten was in it."
"__MOVIES__ I like my Nathan Staten movies. I might have to go and see it this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ I promise you will not be disappointed. It takes on a whole new flavor."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Nathan Staten a bad guy in one of the previous movies?"
"__MOVIES__ He was but it was great. They are able to get the bad guys and the good guys all on the same page to go after a really bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ Now you really have me interested in going and seeing it."
"__MOVIES__ I loved how the writers just put the twists and the turns in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Suprisingly most of the franchise movies are the same over and over again. That's why I was not interested at first."
"__MOVIES__ They actually did a good job writing in the most of the scenes and made them a little more convincing."
"__MOVIES__ It is hard to believe that this movie was made without Paul Walker. Did they write him out completely?"
"__MOVIES__ No they just made his character retire. I sure do miss that handsome guy."
"__MOVIES__ I will have to find a friend to go with me to watch it since my husband doesn't really like the movies."
"__MOVIES__ I'm free on Saturday and I wouldn't mind seeing muscles and sexy cars again."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds good. I can't wait to go."
