"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard you're into football. Who's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dallas Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, they're pretty popular and also pretty hated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, it seems like with football fans there is no in-between on them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've just recently become a fan and I don't have a favorite team yet, but I really love the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's great because of the athletic ability and speed of the players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll probably decide on a favorite team before the season begins. Do you have any tips for that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think you should make your own choice. Think about the teams you're drawn to and the qualities you like in a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a friend who is a big Raider fan and we watched a lot of their games last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're very popular because they have a great history of success and right now they're an up and coming team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have some players I really like to watch like Khalil Mack, Amari Cooper and Derek Carr."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They re very good players. Carr should come back strong from his injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really thinking about adopting them. My wife is from Tampa and I have also gravitated toward the Buccaneers because of that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's another up and coming team with good young players like Jameis Winston and Mike Evans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They narrowly missed the playoffs last year and I think they have a good chance this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do because they've added some good veterans and some good talent in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But then there's one other team I like, which is the Indianapolis Colts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're kind of floundering the last couple of years. They have some talent but are deficient in lots of areas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What I really like about them is their uniforms. I've always loved horses, so I like the horseshoe on the helmet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's fine too, people have lots of different reasons for choosing a team. They are interesting to watch."
