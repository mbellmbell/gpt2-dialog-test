"__POP__ What is your favorite Bruno Mars song?"
"__POP__ I really like Uptown Funk."
"__POP__ Oh I agree. I don't think there's anyway to listen to that song and not become happy."
"__POP__ Yeah, it's so infectious."
"__POP__ What do you think about his new hit?"
"__POP__ That's What I Like? I'm not loving it."
"__POP__ Me either. The beat is not as catchy."
"__POP__ Oh I dislike the lyrics."
"__POP__ I can see that. Almost makes me start to think of Blurred Lines."
"__POP__ Yeah, they're not quite at that level, but the lack of the actual woman's voice in the song really takes away women's agency  inadvertently."
