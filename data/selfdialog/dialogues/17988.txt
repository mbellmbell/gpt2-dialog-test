"__MOVIES__ So let's say you had to pick one Batman movie, it has to be the best. Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ Does it have to be the Nolan ones ?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. Any Batman movie. There is a lot."
"__MOVIES__ I like Batman Returns. Dark and classic."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was just funny enough. Do you think they hold up still?"
"__MOVIES__ With all the different movies with all the different directors and main characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I think the new films make them hold up even better. They had a sense of junior."
"__MOVIES__ I think superhero movies need a bit of humor. Like the comics they come from."
"__MOVIES__ I think the Nolan Batman movies lost that a bit."
"__MOVIES__ They were more serious renditions."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they would of added more than just a few jokes in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ They were a bit sad. Like very little comic relief."
"__MOVIES__ That's why I like the old ones too. The comedy."
"__MOVIES__ The older ones really stayed true to the sad, but also that funny Batman humoir."
"__MOVIES__ Very dry and overly over done villains?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Poison ivy, the old joker. Made the films fun."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think the Nolan joker was good?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he was the joker his movie needed."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you did there. I think he made the movie more real"
"__MOVIES__ That movie was better with him in it for sure."
