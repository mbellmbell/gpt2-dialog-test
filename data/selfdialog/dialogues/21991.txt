"__DISNEY__ Are you a fan of the Disney movie 101 Dalmations?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!  It is one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, I think the dogs are so cute in it."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, I've loved it since it was a child."
"__DISNEY__ Did you hear about the new movie called Cruella?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I heard it's live action too.  I just can't get into those types of movies."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's so weird when you see a villain in a cartoon get a backstory movie in a live action flick."
"__DISNEY__ I don't like villain backstories either."
"__DISNEY__ Villains shouldn't be getting sympathy.  Plus, she killed dogs for her coat!"
"__DISNEY__ Exactly!  It's ridiculous!"
