"__DISNEY__ Frozen the cartoon?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ What about it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it's been so popular for years.  And off of one cartoon."
"__DISNEY__ Okay.  What's your point?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, they could have easily turned it into an animated series."
"__DISNEY__ I guess they could have, but why?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean, why?"
"__DISNEY__ It's already super popular.  It's not like they need to extend its popularity."
