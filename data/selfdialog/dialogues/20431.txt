"__MOVIES__ I just saw this new movie the Pirates of the Caribbean, have you seen the others?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, one was my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I liked two better."
"__MOVIES__ Two was alright, how was the new one?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was quite awesome, there was a lot of action and of course our hero Johnny Depp."
"__MOVIES__ I really don't like Johnny Depp much as an actor, I like the supporting cast more."
"__MOVIES__ That's the first time I've heard that, have you seen him in anything else?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I saw him in the notebook and he had a good performance but everything else is subpar."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well the new one was good, you should see it."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, I might wait till it dies down a little, how many people were in the theatre?"
"__MOVIES__ It was completely packed with adults and kids."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I don't enjoy going to a movie with kids, I'll have to wait till its out a little longer."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I usually go to Matinee's to avoid that."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool, they're cheaper as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, by almost three dollars. Why are movies $15 now a days?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, but it's a rip off."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, that's why I usually wait for videos to come out on blu ray."
"__MOVIES__ I do like blu ray, but I like watching movies on the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah me too, but it's too loud in the theatre sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ It can definitely get too loud."
