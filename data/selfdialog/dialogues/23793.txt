"__SUPERHERO__ Do you consider Deadpool to be a superhero?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I had never even thought about it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I mean, the X-men are always trying to recruit him."
"__SUPERHERO__ But he is sort of an anti-hero."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, but there are superheroes that help him. It is a super hero film."
"__SUPERHERO__ He is a hero, and super I guess."
"__SUPERHERO__ He is. And, he is associated with Wolverine, a super hero."
"__SUPERHERO__ Wolverine is kind of an anti hero as well though."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, but he always ends up helping to save the day."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think then, Deadpool is a super hero."
