"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about Pete Rose?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think he is one of the greatest, most hard-working players in MLB history."
"__BASEBALL__ And...?"
"__BASEBALL__ And he bet on the game. He should be banned--it's the rules."
"__BASEBALL__ But he never bet on his team to lose."
"__BASEBALL__ So?"
"__BASEBALL__ So that means he wasn't intentionally throwing games as a manager. He was trying to win."
"__BASEBALL__ So?"
"__BASEBALL__ So he didn't really do anything WRONG, just went against a rule that had been around for a while."
"__BASEBALL__ He still broke it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but in a good, competitive way. He wanted to win and make some extra on the side."
"__BASEBALL__ I still think he should be banned."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he should be recognized as the second-greatest hitter ever."
"__BASEBALL__ Why second? You're clearly a fanboy."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, he's not baseball's all-time hit leader."
"__BASEBALL__ In 17 years, he got 3,000 hits ... but had far more in Japan."
"__BASEBALL__ How much more?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, last year he passed Pete Rose as the all-time hit king."
"__BASEBALL__ Dang, I didn't realize that."
"__BASEBALL__ You'd hate him. He didn't bet on the game."
