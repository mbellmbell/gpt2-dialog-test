"__THRILLER__ Oh, you mean with all the versions of his character?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, of course. I just didn't want to include any spoilers for you."
"__THRILLER__ Don't worry. I already heard about him portraying a character with 23 different personalities."
"__THRILLER__ Actually, in the end there were 24. How's that for a little spoiler?"
"__THRILLER__ That's interesting. Even more excited to see it now."
"__THRILLER__ The rest of the actors do a really good job as well. Especially Anya Taylor-Joy in the role of Casey Cooke."
