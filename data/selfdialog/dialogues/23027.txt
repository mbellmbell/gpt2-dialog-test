"__DISNEY__ Do you feel bad for those poor unfortunate souls from the little mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ A little, but I still like Ursula."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you like the villain?"
"__DISNEY__ Well maybe like isn't the right word for it."
"__DISNEY__ Well it's a simple question, do you like her or not?"
"__DISNEY__ Well it's more that I feel sorry for her."
"__DISNEY__ How do you feel sorry for her, she tried to steal Ariel's voice?"
"__DISNEY__ Well she didn't think her voice was good enough."
"__DISNEY__ What does that have to do with anything?"
"__DISNEY__ Well I loved her song, it was incredible."
