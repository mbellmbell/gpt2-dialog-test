"__MOVIES__ I just recently watched Mad Max again."
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Just out of curiosity I read some about it online, and it was fascinating."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Like how?"
"__MOVIES__ Well they had a very small budget. They even used an actual biker gang and paid them in beer instead of hiring actors."
"__MOVIES__ That's hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the bikers had to ride to the set everyday in their costumes, and with their prop weapons, and they were given a letter from the director explaining things if they were stopped by the cops."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny, like a Get Out Of Jail Free card."
"__MOVIES__ That's exactly what the cast started jokingly calling it."
"__MOVIES__ What else did you learn?"
"__MOVIES__ They had such a small budget that of all the leather-clad cops, only Goose was wearing real leather and everyone else was wearing cheap faux leather."
"__MOVIES__ I never noticed that."
"__MOVIES__ If you rewatch it, look at their knees. The cheap fabric would frequently rip out so you can see lots of knees or repaired knees."
"__MOVIES__ What else? This is interesting."
"__MOVIES__ They had such a small budget that they didn't have roads closed for filming, they just closed them themselves to film - illegally."
"__MOVIES__ Did they get in trouble?"
"__MOVIES__ The police caught on, probably from stopping bikers, and they were nice about helping them close roads to film."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool."
"__MOVIES__ And I had forgotten about the big, tough-looking bald cop being named Fifi."
"__MOVIES__ That's awesome!"
