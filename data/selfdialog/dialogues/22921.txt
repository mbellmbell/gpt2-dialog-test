"__DISNEY__ What do you think of The Little Mermaid, now that you've read the original?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm surprised they made it so happy! The original story is so sad."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Disney has a magic way of making things feel better."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean. Snow White could also be a lot worse."
"__DISNEY__ Right. But they both got happier endings than the original."
"__DISNEY__ Fairy tales can be intense sometimes."
"__DISNEY__ Are there any others that are based on fairy tales?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Aladdin is?"
"__DISNEY__ That makes sense! It totally has that feeling."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if the original is also sad?"
