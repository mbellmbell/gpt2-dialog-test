"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ EJ just got picked by the Bills."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard they grabbed him in the first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't imagine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got EJ for 6 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait, Manuel is going to be stuck with the Bills for six years?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what they signed him for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ej's not evne that bad. Six years with the Bills is more of a punishment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is young enough that he can still come out on top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but I still think they overpaid for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking that too, but he's all the Bill's got"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That doesn't mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably just wanted to get the ticket sales. Buffalo doesn't really support the Bills that way you think they would."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer."
