"__MUSIC__ Hey, so what do you think of Britney Spears?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, she was one of my favorites back in the early 2000's!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I loved her when she first came out, too!  She had such style and her hits were great."
"__MUSIC__ Like the original Hit Me Baby One More Time and Oops! I Did it Again?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, those were amazing.  I loved the videos, too!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she had some great dance moves.  It was such a clean pop sound with those songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I didn't like her subsequent stuff as much though."
"__MUSIC__ Well in 2007 she really started to go downhill.  I think she released her fifth album then but her personal life was a mess."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it distracted from her music a lot.  She had all sorts of nonsense going on."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, and then Circus and Femme Fatale were her sixth and seventh albums.  I thought they were a flop."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't like them at all either.  To me, her original hits were really what made her a success."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I agree.  Toxic was a great song, though."
"__MUSIC__ That was from In The Zone, right?  Her fourth album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was.  It was reminiscent of some of her original music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think that was before she started to go downhill."
"__MUSIC__ It's really a shame.  She was a great musician."
"__MUSIC__ Well we all have to grow up someday.  She was kinda outgrowing the pop industry."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, but look at people like Cher.  They stuck around much longer."
"__MUSIC__ Well Cher was in a different league than Britney Spears."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right.  They don't compare."
