"__HARRY_POTTER__ I rewatched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone last night."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Is that your favorite movie from the series?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It does tend to be the one that I end up rewatching more often than not. I think it's my favorite simply because of nostalgia - plus, it reminds me how much I love Neville Longbottom."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, he's one of my favorite characters too! I love Luna Lovegood too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which is your favorite movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It has to be tied between Sorcerer's Stone and Order of the Phoenix."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite part about Order of the Phoenix? I really like that you get to see Harry with Sirius more, as sad as it ends up being by the end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like that there's a little bit more action and things start to get more intense. And Tonks, I wish we got to see more of her."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I could enjoy a whole movie of just Tonks' story. I did like her more in the books but I think the actress was a good pick."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Same here, her backstory has to be so interesting. And I love that scene where she's making Ginny and Hermione laugh by changing her face."
