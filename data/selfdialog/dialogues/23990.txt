"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen any movies about super heroes lately?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes.  I recently saw the new movie Logan."
"__SUPERHERO__ What did you think about the movie Logan?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought it was refreshing to see the character of Wolverine depicted without a strong supporting cast of X-Men.  I think Wolverine's personality is quite unique among heroes and deserves solo endeavors."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did you like the new female character that was Logan's biological offspring?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I liked her somewhat, because she shares some of the same personality traits as Wolverine."
"__SUPERHERO__ You keep mentioning Wolverine's personality.  Could you elaborate on that?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, Wolverine is a very wild, almost uncontrollable person.  But, he usually has moments where he can control himself and make strong positive contributions to himself, his team, and the world in general."
"__SUPERHERO__ I see.  So you like that he could be perceived as a type of 'wild card.'"
"__SUPERHERO__ Sure.  Unpredictable actions in movies can make for a wide variety of interesting scenes and interactions."
