"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that the hard cap in the NFL has helped the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. Look at it's popularity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It may be popular no matter what the cap situation is. Football in the United States is that popular."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could be true. However, I think the growth of the NFL and the uncertainty really keeps everyone's interest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Partly true, I suppose. Most every team comes into the season with some hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Except for maybe the Browns and Bills fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha. Yeah. Well, most everyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Another point with the cap. I think that the cap has also helped the balance of team worth and team revenue for all 32 teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think every NFL team is worth at least a billion dollars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you think it's held back some franchises from becoming even more valuable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. I think if there wasn't a cap, teams like the Cowboys would probably be worth billions more than they already are worth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking of them when I was asking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ However, I don't feel sorry for Jerry Jones. His franchise is worth plenty with the salary cap rules in place."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I would love to have his billions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't we all. It's really helped the smaller franchises like the Vikings gain their worth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much are the Vikings worth?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think every team is worth at least a billion dollars now. Last time I looked the Vikings were valued at 800 million, and that was 5 to 6 years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I would have to figure they are over a billion dollars now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking the same thing. The Jaguars probably are now the least valuable franchise since the Vikings got their stadium issues figured out."
