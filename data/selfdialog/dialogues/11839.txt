"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey there, are you excited about this upcoming football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally am! I am hoping to get to a few games this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very cool, I hope that the Cowboys go all the way this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard a rumor that Tony Romo is going to retire this year, is that true?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gosh I hope not! Hes my favorite player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am really hoping that my team will do well this year. I say that every year and they dont but I wont give up hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really want to see the Lions go all the way to and win the superbowl once in my life time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HAHA, the Detroit Lions really!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck yeah, Matthew Stafford is the man,  he broke Peyton Manning's record of most fourth quarter comebacks in a season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That may be true but really, the lions last championship was back in 1957. Thats before you were even born."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know it but the lions are my home team, what can I say Im loyal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The cowboys have a much better chance of winning the superbowl in 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Statistically you are right. I'll probably hit some Cowboys games this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Makes sense since you live in Texas now. So when Detroit and Dallas play who do you want to win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Detroit of course! Man it would be cool to go to one of those games, Lions jersey and all!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you honestly believe that you will see them win the Superbowl?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah what can I say, they are my home team."
