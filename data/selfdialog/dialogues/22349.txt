"__DISNEY__ Who is your favorite Disney princess?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm...that's a tough one.  I like a lot of them."
"__DISNEY__ But if you had to pick a favorite?  Who would it be?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess Jasmine."
"__DISNEY__ Why Jasmine?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know.  She's different from the other princesses.  She's more exotic."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she's pretty.  Aladdin is a good movie."
"__DISNEY__ I agree.  I like the magic carpet."
"__DISNEY__ The carpet is cool, but I loved the genie.  Robin Williams did his voice."
"__DISNEY__ That's right!  The genie was awesome!  So funny!"
