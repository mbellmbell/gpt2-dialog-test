"__SUPERHERO__ Logan was absolutely amazing."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know!  I'm a huge fan of all the X-Men movies.  Hugh Jackman has been a great Wolverine."
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought they had kind of done him to death actually because he was the only one that got an Origins movie and then they made that movie Wolverine."
"__SUPERHERO__ That one wasn't good to be honest.  His origin story was ok but they messed up a lot of parts."
"__SUPERHERO__ You really need to give Logan a chance.  They finally went R rated and it's awesome!"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'll give it a shot.  I really need to rewatch all the X Men movies.  How do you feel about this reboot they're doing?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm ok with it.  Some of the casting isn't great. Jennifer Lawrence isn't a great casting for Mystique."
"__SUPERHERO__ No, I don' think she really fit in.  She's just so in demand right now."
"__SUPERHERO__ Now, Marvel they've got their casting right for sure."
"__SUPERHERO__ Definitely Robert Downey Jr definitely is a great Iron Man.  Plus you got Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy."
