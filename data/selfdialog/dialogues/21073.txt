"__THRILLER__ Have you seen Blue Velvet?"
"__THRILLER__ Of course I've seen it, I love David Lynch."
"__THRILLER__ I figured you would've. Really neat that Kyle McLaughlin and Laura Dern are in it, since they do so much with Lynch."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah two of his standby actors"
"__THRILLER__ Where would you rank it among Lynch films?"
"__THRILLER__ Near the top honestly, I'm partial towards The Elephant Man and Fire Walk with me since I love Twin Peaks so much, but it would be right behind those two."
"__THRILLER__ My list would best be the same, but Blue Velvet would be first and those other two second and third."
"__THRILLER__ Did you know Blue Velvet had really mixed reviews?"
"__THRILLER__ I didn't, but it doesn't surprise me. Lynch is unique enough that not everyone will get it so to speak."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah I know Ebert for example absolutely hated it, his loss I say!"
