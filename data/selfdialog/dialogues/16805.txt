"__MOVIES__ Do you have any special Christmas movies you watch every year?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe not every year..."
"__MOVIES__ What one?"
"__MOVIES__ Gremlins."
"__MOVIES__ Gremlins?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's hard to explain..."
"__MOVIES__ What are gremlins?"
"__MOVIES__ They start off as these cute soft creatures, but if you break one of the rules, they turn into little monsters."
"__MOVIES__ There are rules?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're supposed to never get them wet, never expose them to direct sunlight and never feed them after midnight."
"__MOVIES__ But every time is after midnight from the last midnight!"
"__MOVIES__ See I told you it's hard to explain."
"__MOVIES__ But okay, I'm intrigued."
"__MOVIES__ It's actually a really sweet movie for being about little monsters. There's a character in it that makes my blood boil though."
"__MOVIES__ Not one of the monsters?"
"__MOVIES__ No, this pesky lady who tries to make trouble for everybody."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like she doesn't have the Christmas spirit."
"__MOVIES__ She really doesn't. You gotta watch it though."
"__MOVIES__ I will."
"__MOVIES__ Then you'll get the reference when I say 'bye bye woof woof!'"
