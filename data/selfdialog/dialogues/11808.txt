"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited for the NFL season to begin?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't wait! I've been dying to watch my Packers play again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will make it to the super bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure. I know they will do well, but they have a lot of young guys on defense and have a lot of work to do to get there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope the Broncos make it to the playoffs. It would be fun to watch them play the Packers in the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't mind the Broncos, but they haven't been the same since Peyton Manning left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. What do you think about their new quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know much about him, but I heard that he has a lot of potential."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No one will ever be as good as Aaron Rogers, am I right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some people could argue with that statement, I however couldn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do they call Packer fans again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you mean cheeseheads?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yea! That's right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love a good cheddar. Their fans are pretty serious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is Lambeau field enclosed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, it's an outdoor stadium. It gets incredibly cold in the winter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right, I've heard lots of teams hate playing there in the winter due to the cold temps. Must be really hard to catch a football when it's that cold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it is. And incredibly enough, I can't remember a single game ever getting cancelled due to being too cold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Boy the Packers must be a pretty tough team to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, and I can't wait to watch them in August!"
