"__BASKETBALL__ I am always fascinated to tune into a basketball when they are in the play offs, do you?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I too am fascinated by the play offs, though I also watch extensively lots of games leading up to the play offs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I get that, I wish that I could watch more often, though time and circumstance may not always afford me that opportunity."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who are you hoping will make their way to the play offs this season?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm a huge fan of the Chicago Bulls."
"__BASKETBALL__ They are one of my favorite teams as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh really? Great! Great minds think alike."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah we do! I even got season tickets for them as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Season Tickets! My how I envy you."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, well I know someone, who knows someone, and they make sure I can purchase at a very reasonable price."
"__BASKETBALL__ There's is something that I'd love to have, but to purchase a season pass, I'm hesitant and unsure how many games I'd actually be able to attend."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hear ya, if you know that more than likely you will not be able to attend over half the games, then it wouldn't be feasible to have season tickets."
"__BASKETBALL__ You are so correct on that call."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm such a huge fan, I make sure that my seating is as close as I can get, third row."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow, that's spectacular."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, any closer like the first or second row when mean forking over a lot more cash."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hear ya, I feel ya, I know exactly what you mean."
"__BASKETBALL__ Though the third row gives me ample opportunity to get a close up view of all the best plays."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is so true, my friend."
"__BASKETBALL__ Indeed, and I am so stoked about it."
