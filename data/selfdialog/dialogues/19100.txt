"__MOVIES__ Whatever happened to Charlie Kaufman?"
"__MOVIES__ Who? You mean the guy from Taxi?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Charlie Kaufman. Dude who did all that stuff, 15 years ago. Adaptation. Being John Malkovich. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. That thing with Jim Carrey? That was weird, man."
"__MOVIES__ I guess. I mean. It was one of his less weird ones, but. I mean, he was everywhere for a while. He was one of the only screenwriters people talked about the way they talked about directors and actors."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well. What's the last thing he did?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I mean, the last I saw was Synecdoche, New York. If you want strange, that's strange. That was... like, a decade ago. I think he did something with puppets a little while ago. I guess I need to look into that."
"__MOVIES__ Well, there you go. Puppets. Guy does sound pretty weird."
"__MOVIES__ Well. Puppets aren't so strange in themselves -- though it's interesting, when you think about Being John Malkovich. Dude there was a puppeteer."
"__MOVIES__ John Malkovich? Thought he was... like, super serious."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, no, I mean the main character in that. John Cusack."
"__MOVIES__ Man, speaking of what happened."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, John Cusack. Guess he got overexposed or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Dunno!"
"__MOVIES__ Funny thing is, I think he was in a horror film that came out about a year after Adaptation, that pretty exactly followed the plot of Donald Kaufman's script."
"__MOVIES__ Donald? Thought this guy was.... uh."
"__MOVIES__ No, Charlie. Donald is his imaginary twin brother."
"__MOVIES__ Like, for the unions, or?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I mean in the movie. He wrote himself into the movie, then he wrote himself a twin brother."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I need to start writing screenplays now."
