"__DISNEY__ What would you say is your favorite Disney character?"
"__DISNEY__ There are so many to choose from, but if I had to pick just one, I think I'd say Robin Hood."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that's an oldie but a goodie! Why Robin Hood?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, he seemed to have a lot of morals as well as charisma with the ladies. I kind of like that."
"__DISNEY__ He robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. I don't know if that's great morals or not."
"__DISNEY__ True, but the rich he robbed from where all kind of jerks. Not that it's right to steal from anyone."
"__DISNEY__ True! I wonder if they will ever re-make that one."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, I haven't heard anything in years about Robin Hood."
"__DISNEY__ That would be something though, don't you think?"
"__DISNEY__ With today's technology and graphic ability, it could be amazing!"
