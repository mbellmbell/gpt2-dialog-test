"__FASHION__ Did you see the 2017 Oscars best dresses?"
"__FASHION__ Yes I really think Emma Stone was the best!"
"__FASHION__ What? I totally though Scarlet Johansan's dress was perfect fit her perfectly!"
"__FASHION__ No way Emma's beaded golden 20's style gown was amazing."
"__FASHION__ Well Scarlet's was way more unique!"
"__FASHION__ How so? Didn't really look like it belonged at the Oscars if you ask me."
"__FASHION__ What do you mean by that?"
"__FASHION__ The dress looked way to casual and the style was dull!"
"__FASHION__ Yeah well Emma's was  not unique at all."
"__FASHION__ How's that?"
"__FASHION__ Just a copy of a millon dresses from the 20s."
"__FASHION__ I don't know about that."
"__FASHION__ It totally was just look up dresses from the 20s you'll see what I mean."
"__FASHION__ Either way I still think Emma looked classy."
"__FASHION__ I also think her shoes were ugly."
"__FASHION__ I didn't much like the shoes either."
"__FASHION__ They were too plain and similar to her dress."
"__FASHION__ Yeah I agree. I gotta say though I think Leslie Man's dress was a total disater."
"__FASHION__ Yes! It was so gaudy and looked like mustard."
"__FASHION__ Yeah like a bad prom dress from the 80s."
