"__MUSIC__ Woah, wait a minute. What is this you are listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Father John Misty. You heard of him?"
"__MUSIC__ No! I love it though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, this guy's great. He's really only gotten big in the last couple of years."
"__MUSIC__ Do all his albums sound like this?"
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately no. This one is Fear Fun. His first album."
"__MUSIC__ First. So he has others?"
"__MUSIC__ A couple now, but they're just not as good. He just really nailed it on this album."
"__MUSIC__ Well, some bands never even get one great album."
"__MUSIC__ That's true! This guy also played with Fleet Foxes."
"__MUSIC__ Oh nice! Another one that's great is The Morning Benders: Big Echo."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I heard that one!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and like this album, from what I've heard of it anyway, it's the same thing. The rest of the Morning Benders' stuff isn't very good."
"__MUSIC__ How does that happen? I can't understand how a band can make such a mindblowing album but then turn out mediocre work."
"__MUSIC__ It's the producer a lot of times, I think. Big Echo was produced by Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear, who has a penchant for producing great records."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good point. I need to check out other albums he's produced. Including more Grizzly Bear records too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh definitely!"
"__MUSIC__ And I would like to see Father John Misty live. Just because Fear Fun is so good."
"__MUSIC__ We should go. Next time he tours!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely!"
