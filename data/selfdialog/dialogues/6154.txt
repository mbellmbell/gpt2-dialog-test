"__STAR_WARS__ Here's a fun fact. Star Wars Episode I was the only prequel film to be shot on actual celluloid film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, George Lucas switched to digital film-making after The Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that reminds me, didn't they go back to film with Episode VII?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, The Force Awakens was made on film. Not that it really matters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why doesn't it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because, it was filmed on film, but then the CGI and other digital effects were put in digitally."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I didn't even think of that."
"__STAR_WARS__ The final product is digital too, as all films are nowadays. So it really made no difference to film on celluloid to start with."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess they did it so they could say it wasn't digital like the prequels, even if it really was."
