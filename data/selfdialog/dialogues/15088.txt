"__ACTION__ So, what makes an action movie an action movie?"
"__ACTION__ For one thing, it needs a chase scene. A  car chase, preferably with cars turned over and stunt men laying down motorcycles."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, like in Bullit. That was so cool. You could see McQueen actually driving that thing, all through it."
"__ACTION__ Bullit didn't invent the chase, but it perfected it."
"__ACTION__ No doubt. Then there's the chase in The French Connection. That was a new action movie high, too."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I remember. All along under the tracks. Gene Hackman was so great."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, and there's a car crash in it, you remember?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, of course I do. Blam, crumples him."
"__ACTION__ Well, that was real. Some guy was on his way to work, and didn't know they were filming. They paid him, and fixed his car."
"__ACTION__ No kidding. No wonder it looked real."
