"__FASHION__ Did you watch the last episode of Keeping up with the Kardashians?"
"__FASHION__ I did! I thought Khloe looked so hot in her body suit and skin tight jeans."
"__FASHION__ I know! With her sexy little outfits she always wears, she has an endless line of guys trying to get with her."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, it's just too bad most of them are black though."
"__FASHION__ Well, black guys actually have a great sense of fashion!"
"__FASHION__ I'll agree with you there... Some colors just look so much better on them than on white people!"
"__FASHION__ Yes, especially a fresh white T shirt that is a couple of sizes too big."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, no way a white guy can pull that off."
"__FASHION__ True that. But I will say, plaid shorts look excellent on a white man."
"__FASHION__ Mhm. Especially with a light grey t-T-shirt."
"__FASHION__ But not plaid shirts. Save those for the mexicans."
"__FASHION__ Haha! Yeah that sounds about right."
"__FASHION__ Know what is really hot?"
"__FASHION__ No, What?"
"__FASHION__ When a girl who has a perfect badonkadonk wheres some tight yoga pants."
"__FASHION__ Oh I know! I see those everywhere these days. They had that whole body shameing scandel over them at the high schools..."
"__FASHION__ What do you mean?"
"__FASHION__ Well, as nice as a girls butt is to look at in those pants, people where claiming they were a distraction to male students and teachers."
"__FASHION__ Oh thats not fair, they should be able to control themselves over a womens fashion choice."
"__FASHION__ I agree!"
