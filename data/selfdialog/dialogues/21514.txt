"__DISNEY__ You know the opening song in The Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I know it, the one that everybody makes up the words to cause they don't speak the actual language."
"__DISNEY__ That is the one. Did you know that it translates to 'There comes a lion. Oh yes it's a lion' and its just repeated a bunch of times."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that, but that's pretty funny!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I read about it the other day online."
"__DISNEY__ Here's something I bet you don't know..."
"__DISNEY__ What is it?"
"__DISNEY__ The Lion King was the first Disney movie that was completely original. Think about it! Every other Disney movie before that is from a story."
"__DISNEY__ Wow I never realized that before! That's really interesting."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but if you look at the original story of some of the Disney adaptations, the Disney movies are way different."
