"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man who is the best quarterback to play in the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's easy, Joe Montana. No question!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude where have you been? Tom Brady is way better than him!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he has more Superbowl wins, but is he really better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, with winning Superbowl 51 he has the most Superbowl wins....it is the Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the most wins don't make you the best. He deflated his balls so...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude that's not cheating, he just thought of it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but how can you beat 40,551 career passing yards? Joe Montana is the man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is impressive but I still think Brady is the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if it's not all about Superbowls, you have to count John Elway. He had 51,000 total passing yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? That many? I don't think he won any Superbowls, did he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he won 2."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmmm...but Brady has been in the league as a quarterback. Longer than anyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have Brady bro crush!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, he's a role model and has a model a model for a wife."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but there are so many other great quarterbacks. What about Dan Marino? Brett Favre? Peyton Manning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Brett Favre was pretty good. Wasn't he the quarterback for the Packers when they were good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he dominated. 71,838 total yards.....even though he only had one Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dang! He was a beast!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was really good. He just didn't make to the Superbowl. The Superbowl is not the end all."
