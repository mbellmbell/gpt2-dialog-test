"__ROCK__ Do you remember Counting Crows?"
"__ROCK__ Sure.  I liked listening to them when I was in school."
"__ROCK__ Do you still listen to their music?"
"__ROCK__ Not really."
"__ROCK__ Why not?"
"__ROCK__ I think I liked their sound more back then.  It's just not fun to listen to anymore."
"__ROCK__ Didn't the singer used to date one of the girls from Friends?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, his name was Adam something.  I want to say he dated Courteney Cox, but it might have been Jennifer Anniston."
"__ROCK__ He was the guy with weird hair."
"__ROCK__ I don't know if it was weird, but he had dreads."
