"__MOVIES__ Hey, fellow nerd. Do you prefer Marvel or DC Comics for their movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, fellow nerd. I prefer Marvel strongly."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Other than them being factually better based on reviews, overall they are more fun and well-made."
"__MOVIES__ What about the villains?"
"__MOVIES__ What about them? What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, in the MCU, the villains are after-thoughts. Look at the dark elves in Thor 2, any villain in Guardians of the Galaxy, even Ultron. They all lose somewhat easily."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's a good point. But the DC movies are all too heavily edited."
"__MOVIES__ True, the director and producers are far too heavy-handed in it and make it into a massive mess."
"__MOVIES__ Marvel also is far too silly. Did you see Guardians 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was fun, but far too silly, I see what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ I get the characters are how they are supposed to be, but it's so comical it's unrealistic at that point."
"__MOVIES__ There's lots of stuff that they'll have to address in the MCU, too."
"__MOVIES__ Like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Peter Quill saw the universe, and everything. He may have lost his god powers, but he didn't lose his memory."
"__MOVIES__ Think he'll use that to defeat Thanos?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know; maybe he'll be a 'bad guy' for a bit, or tease it."
"__MOVIES__ Did they ever put him and Gamorrah together? Or just hint at the sexual tension?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea. Speaking of not knowing anything, we now see TONS of species of aliens in MCU thanks to Guardians, yet none of these worlds have been addressed on Earth."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, didn't Thor claim just 9 realms? This movie had like 20 types of people..."
