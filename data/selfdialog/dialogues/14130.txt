"__HORROR__ Have you seen the movie They're Watching?"
"__HORROR__ I think so, is that the movie with Brigid Brannagh?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, I really enjoyed it. I thought they did a good job creating a creepy element with the town and townspeople."
"__HORROR__ Agreed, the scene with all of the townspeople gathered outside of Becky's house was very creepy."
"__HORROR__ It was! I thought the ending was interesting too."
"__HORROR__ Agreed, you pretty much expected Becky to be the witch though."
"__HORROR__ True, but they did it in a unique enough way that you don't mind how predictable it was. The effects were well done too."
"__HORROR__ They sure were! The magic at the end was really good, and the parts where they found Kate and Vladimir were very well done."
"__HORROR__ They were, though those scenes were a bit gory for my taste."
"__HORROR__ That's understandable, but they certainly made an impact!"
