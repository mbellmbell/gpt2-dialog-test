"__MOVIES__ What was the last movie you saw?"
"__MOVIES__ At a theater?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah"
"__MOVIES__ God, I dunno um Harry Potter I think. I need to get out more. Put me in a nursing home. Sell the house. (Sigh)"
"__MOVIES__ So have you just not seen anything interesting to get you out?"
"__MOVIES__ Not for the prices they charge. I'll just wait for it to come out on dvd."
"__MOVIES__ Aren't you afraid you'll miss movies you really want to see?"
"__MOVIES__ Not with all the other options today."
"__MOVIES__ Is it because you're single?"
"__MOVIES__ That's part of it.  I've thought about going there, buying a ticket, sitting there watching it, then going home, and it's just not appealing"
"__MOVIES__ I get that. There's not anyone to analyse the movie with after, or reminisce with."
"__MOVIES__ It just doesn't appeal to me.  I get it that some people enjoy that, but that's not me."
"__MOVIES__ My friend becky enjoys it. She goes to art movies by herself."
"__MOVIES__ I know there are, and that's fine, just not for me"
"__MOVIES__ I've thought about going to movies by myself. Mostly Disney and pixar, that I can't get anyone to go with me. I wanted to see a dogs purpose,  still want to see guardians of the galaxy 2, and the new minions movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, pick one and we'll go. I need to get out of the house. We might have to leave early if I'm in too much pain"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well never mind then. I don't want to walk out of a movie half way through,  that would suck."
"__MOVIES__ Well I know, and I'd try to make it, but with my broken hip, there's only so much I can take"
"__MOVIES__ I dunno. I'll think about it. The new guardians looks good and Chris pratt is hot."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I think baby groot will be the best part of the show! I am groot!"
