"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think would win in a lightsaber battle, Luke or Rey?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Obviously Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why? Luke has more practice."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke is also older, and Rey is already good without learning anything."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. Still, I think Luke would win."
"__STAR_WARS__ Actually, we're both wrong."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda wins, obviously."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda always wins."
