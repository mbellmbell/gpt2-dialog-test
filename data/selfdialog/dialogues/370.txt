"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of Jodeci from the 90s?"
"__MUSIC__ I absolutely loved Kci and Jo Jo. That was my group."
"__MUSIC__ They had a string of hits back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Love you for Life is definitely one of my favorites from them."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know Devante actually wrote and produced all of those songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I had no idea. He's really talented in that case."
"__MUSIC__ Kci and JoJo went solo for a while but that didn't really last long."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think we all liked them better as a group."
"__MUSIC__ Kci and Mary J Blige were a couple for a while when they first came out."
"__MUSIC__ Right they were all under Bad Boy under P Diddy at the beginning."
"__MUSIC__ That's when the music was great. It's not the same as it used to be."
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember when Mary and Jodeci came out on The Arsenio Hall show?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow that is so old school. I remember that show, they were on there with Stevie Wonder."
"__MUSIC__ Right and they sang You Will Know by Stevie together."
"__MUSIC__ Right and Stevie was worried that they were going to mess up the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Which they did. They put the first verse second and vice versa."
"__MUSIC__ That was funny. They did a great job singing it together though."
"__MUSIC__ I hope Jodeci comes out with a reunion show."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. My Heart Belongs to You is my favorite of theirs."
"__MUSIC__ They pretty much defined 90s era r&b if you ask me."
