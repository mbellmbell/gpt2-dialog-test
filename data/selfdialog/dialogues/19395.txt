"__MOVIES__ I could go for a good spaghetti western right about now."
"__MOVIES__ A what?"
"__MOVIES__ A spaghetti western! You know..."
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea what spaghetti has to do with westerns."
"__MOVIES__ Well, let me enlighten you!"
"__MOVIES__ Please do."
"__MOVIES__ The term 'spaghetti westerns' refers to a genre of movies made about the old west. They were created starting in the 1960s."
"__MOVIES__ You are kidding!"
"__MOVIES__ No, really! One of the most famous stars appearing in these movies was Clint Easwood!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't get it.  What do they have to do with spaghetti?"
"__MOVIES__ These movies were mostly directed by italians. Sergio Leone was one of the directors that was made famous through these movies and his suspenseful dramatic style.!"
"__MOVIES__ That makes more sense than what I was thinking!"
"__MOVIES__ What were you thinking?"
"__MOVIES__ When you said 'spaghetti westen' I had some strange ideas about what you meant."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Cowboys dressed up like Super Mario Brothers..."
"__MOVIES__ No way!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Wearing chaps and riding Yoshi around the dusty, sun-filled badlands."
"__MOVIES__ That's hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ I just could figure out how they rounded up the veal parmigiana!"
