"__MUSIC__ What's your opinion on Kayne West's music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think a lot of his music is good but a fair amount of it is bad too."
"__MUSIC__ Do you consider him mediocre then?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't go that far, the guy obviously has some talent but I wouldn't consider him great."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't consider his music good at all."
"__MUSIC__ Really? You don't like any of his work?"
"__MUSIC__ I won't say I don't like any of his works but I find about 90% of his music to be terrible."
"__MUSIC__ That is an extremely high amount. Why do you feel that way?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I think most of his good songs are just samples of others. i don't feel that is very creative."
"__MUSIC__ That is valid, a lot of artists that sample music from others are often considered untalented."
"__MUSIC__ Thats not all, I also feel most of his music is just a bunch of songs designed to hype himself."
"__MUSIC__ I can see why you'd say that, he does have a lot of music in which he talks about himself like he is a god or something."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly it's pretty obnoxious but people seem to eat it up."
"__MUSIC__ I know, you should see what hardcore fans say to defend him."
"__MUSIC__ I don't even want to know because I know it's already dumb."
"__MUSIC__ It is, but back to his music what songs do you like from him."
"__MUSIC__ I like the song where he sampled Daft Punk's 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger'."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that one too, it was mainstream but it was still pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ I don't care if a song is mainstream or not as long as it sounds good."
"__MUSIC__ I'm a bit against mainstream songs because you hear it so much you get tired of it."
