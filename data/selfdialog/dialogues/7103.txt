"__ICEHOCKEY__ That series between the Pens and Caps was impressive."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Totally. I thought Pittsburgh was going to run away with it after taking the first two in Washington."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The entire feel of the series turned when Crosby got knocked out."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree. The Pens power play went down hill in a hurry."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It seemed like they had no idea what to do without him."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Penguins looked completely lost."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I was surprised they were able to come back in game 4 without Crosby."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes. That was the swing game in the series I think."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The overtime game was also exciting."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Playoff hockey is so much more intense than the regular season, and overtime games even more so."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think the first round this year set a record for overtime games."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I heard that too. Wasn't it 17 games?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That sounds right. Who do you like in the Western conference."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think the Predators are going to take care of business. They're playing great hockey already knocking off the Blackhawks and Blues."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What about the East?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm sticking with the Pens. I can't really explain how Ottawa got by Boston or NY."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think you're right on both. If that happens, I think the finals will be pretty intense."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, the Pens are ready for that. Washington was all over them and outshot them by a huge margin last round."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They'll have to get past Ottawa first."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think it will go 6 games and the Predators will win in 5."
