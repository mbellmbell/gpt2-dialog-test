"__COMEDY__ Do you like Will Ferrell movies?"
"__COMEDY__ I don't think I've seen a Will Ferrell movie that I didn't like."
"__COMEDY__ Same here.  Anchorman is my favorite."
"__COMEDY__ That's a good one!  Anchorman 2 was pretty bad though."
"__COMEDY__ I thought it was okay.  It wasn't as good as the first, but I felt it still had some funny parts."
"__COMEDY__ I just felt that they tried a little too hard."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah you're probably right.  I feel that the first didn't really end in a way that would allow a very good sequel."
"__COMEDY__ Have you seen Land of the Lost?  I felt that that was a pretty bad Will Ferrell movie."
"__COMEDY__ I haven't seen it, but my girlfriend told me it was bad."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah it's bad.  It was quite poorly written and I don't recall laughing out loud at any point during it."
