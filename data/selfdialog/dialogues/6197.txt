"__STAR_WARS__ So, what did you think of Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Weeel... I liked parts of it.  It had a lot of great action scenes and it was really neat to visit the Star Wars universe from the perspective of non-Force powered characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I'm with you on that.  I thought Felicity Jones did a great job playing Jyn.  And I liked Donnie Yen's character."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was the blind guy, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was him.  Dude is nearly fifty years old and still kicking butt in Hollywood movies!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he was pretty cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ One the less positive side though, I thought the CGI scenes with Tarkin and Princess Leia weren't quite there as far as completely realistic.  It fell squarely in the Uncanny Valley section of things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, especially with Tarkin.  They had the guy look waaay more cadaverous than I remember him being in the first film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I know, I heard one critic even saying something like, 'Was that CGI, or did they find some way to revive the actor's corpse?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that's terrible!"
