"__ROCK__ would you say rock music is dead nowadays?"
"__ROCK__ well of course not, there are plenty of rock bands that still draw huge crowds"
"__ROCK__ But doesn't there seem to be a significant lack of new rock bands these days?"
"__ROCK__ I suppose, yeah. Most of the big touring acts nowadays have been touring for decades."
"__ROCK__ Why do you think that is?"
"__ROCK__ I think there's a total genre shift happening in general right now - towards rap and edm."
"__ROCK__ hmm, why would rap and edm invalidate popular rock music the way it seems to?"
"__ROCK__ maybe because of the technology - digital instrumentation is so sophisticated now that real instrumentation is pretty rare these days"
"__ROCK__ I've noticed the distinct digital sound now - maybe it's part of a changing social philosophy?"
"__ROCK__ perhaps, we're definitely looking at a different aesthetic now than we were 30 years ago."
