"__MUSIC__ I'm not really into most popular music nowadays?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh? What kind of music do you like, then?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I'm pretty well into folk music."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's kind of different."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but I really like the sound of the music and the stories that the songs tell."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of like country music, with the storytelling."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but the sound of the music itself is more subtle, and way less twangy."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I can even name any folk artists."
"__MUSIC__ Well, according to my Pandora radio station, Mumford & Sons count as folk music, but I think that's kind of a stretch."
"__MUSIC__ It's got to be the banjos that do it, then."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe so. But I like Sarah Jarosz, who's more typical of the genre nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of her, but I guess I should check her out if I want to learn anything about folk music."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, she's not a definitive example, or anything, but I just enjoy her music."
"__MUSIC__ So she doesn't just sing old-timey songs about maidens dying and all that kind of thing?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I guess she's more of a neo-folk singer, where some of the songs seem to have an older vibe. But her sound is more modern, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ So you don't like modern music?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I don't mind it, but there are sounds that I prefer more. And anyway, folk music can still be modern."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose you're right. I guess I'm just more mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, there's nothing wrong with being mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and I guess folk music was mainstream two hundred years ago too, huh?"
