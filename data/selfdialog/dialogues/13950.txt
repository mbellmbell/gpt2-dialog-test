"__BASKETBALL__ You know what's funny though?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What?"
"__BASKETBALL__ If we look at the points per game, Jabbar doesn't really rank that high."
"__BASKETBALL__ But he's a legend everyone says."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep. Even was in that Kung Fu movie"
"__BASKETBALL__ What does he rank at, then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He's at 14th in terms of points per game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think can break Jabbar record?"
"__BASKETBALL__ His total points over career record?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hm. that's a tough one. We have to see who's most likely to last as long as Jabbar did"
"__BASKETBALL__ And score at least as much per game as he did."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep."
"__BASKETBALL__ Can Lebron do it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm thinking, if he stays healthy, yes. he's currently behind 9600 points to match Jabbar's record, and he's 499 games behind Jabbar"
"__BASKETBALL__ How long has Lebron been playing? 13 years?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Something like that. And he's still on his top game, more or less. And in a season there are 82 games, so, 6 more years which is about the same length of career as Jabbar"
"__BASKETBALL__ But he averages 27 points per game which is better than Jabbar."
"__BASKETBALL__ Let's see, if Lebron plays all the games in the next 6 years, and scores the average he's been doing, then he will amass 13473 points which will shatter Jabbar's record"
"__BASKETBALL__ Now, will he, or can he stay healthy enough for that?"
