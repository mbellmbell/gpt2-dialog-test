"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yo J.D., did you by chance see the new Chargers stadium being built?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't catch that one, are they still in San Diego?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I am a Titans fan, but our city finally has a stadium!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is a stadium in Los Angeles, the Chargers are here now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah dude we have two teams, we run this sport!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, the Rams are with us too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems so man, the new stadium should be here by 2020."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We gotta head to a few games, I would love our team vs any top squads."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This means we have to get jerseys and pick a new favorite player!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then so be it, we finally have a legitimate football team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We also have a legitimate stadium and we don't have to resort to driving so far."
