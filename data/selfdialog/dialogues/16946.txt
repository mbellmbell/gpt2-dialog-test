"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest rumor for The Last Jedi?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they say that Luke is gonna head off at the end of the movie to kill snoke"
"__MOVIES__ But does he fight during the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, but if the rumor is true then we at least know that Luke doesn't die."
"__MOVIES__ That's good, I didn't want him to die."
"__MOVIES__ He is supposed to change through the movie to want to be a jedi again."
"__MOVIES__ He didn't want to be a jedi anymore?"
"__MOVIES__ No, remember the trailer where he said 'the jedi must end'?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah."
"__MOVIES__ Well, apparently something changes his mind and he decides to kick some butt."
"__MOVIES__ I hope he does."
"__MOVIES__ They also say that he doesn't have a lightsaber at the beginning, but an old cane instead."
"__MOVIES__ He was walking fine in the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah, but he also has some kind of zapper for the animals on the island"
"__MOVIES__ A zapper?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah to keep the animals from bothering him or something."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he's a jedi he could just use the force and get rid of them."
"__MOVIES__ True."
"__MOVIES__ I hope the movie is good."
