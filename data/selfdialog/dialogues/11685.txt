"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Raiders this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like their team, they're young and hungry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love David Carr, he's a great leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you on Carr, he's got a bright future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also love their offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's probably the best line in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not totally sold on Lynch coming back though. It's tough for a guy to sit out a year and come back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In his prime he was a fun running back to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, don't you think he's over the hill?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might be older; however, he's running behind the best line in the league.  He'll have a good year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your prediction for stats for Lynch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say 1,000 yards rushing and 15 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 15 touchdowns? I think you're way over - I'm thinking 8 max."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He'll get at least 15, David Carr even said if they're on the 1 yard line he's giving it to Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's too bad they are moving to Vegas.  Oakland is one of the toughest places to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't like the move at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet in 5-years the NFL looks at expansion and Oakland will be on the list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and they'll build a new stadium for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Too bad, they won't be called the Raiders though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, surprised Oakland didn't fight to keep the Raider name like Cleveland did when the Browns moved."
