"__STAR_WARS__ What's your least favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That would have to be The Phantom Menace, as it just failed to deliver an interesting story line."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I agree and it was just ridiculous when they introduced Jar-Jar. I mean who likes that character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar-Jar was such an unnecessary character, but I liked how they introduced the concept of a Grey Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Qui-Gon Jinn was perhaps the only redeeming character in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ That and the epic fight scene between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really enjoyed that fight scene and the music that accompanied it was awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you ever wish that they would make a movie more dedicated to the Sith and their origins?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be interesting for sure, as there is so much mystery surrounding the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hopefully we will get to see something in the future."
