"__STAR_WARS__ What did you like most about Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I've seen them all and I think I like the story of young Anakin the most."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's from Star Wars Episode I right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  It's the fourth movie but the beginning of the series as a whole."
"__STAR_WARS__ I remember, that's the movie with the speed pod racing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right.  And Anakin is the pilot of the winning pod, but I just like seeing him when he's young before he becomes Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought of it like that.  Darth Vader was certainly a very menacing person."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, that's why it was nice to see him as a young and innocent child."
"__STAR_WARS__ Looking back, it didn't take long for him to lose that innocence either.  By Episode II he was already showing his dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely.  You can already see the Darth Vader in him by that point."
