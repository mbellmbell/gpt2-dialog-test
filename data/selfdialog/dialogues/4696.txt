"__MUSIC__ So who is your favorite all-time musician?"
"__MUSIC__ Gosh, that's such a hard one to answer!  I would have to say Garth Brooks."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, really? I didn't know you like country music so much."
"__MUSIC__ Well it's not so much that, but he's an amazing artist with such a great voice."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I do know what you mean.  He plays music well and sings well and writes beautiful songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and such a variety, too.  Some are fast, some are slow."
"__MUSIC__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely Friends in Low Places!  I never get sick of hearing that song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a great song.  They were talking about him on the radio the other morning and how amazing he is live in concert."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I bet it is unbelievable.  I'd go see him live if he came anywhere near here."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  There aren't any singers like Garth around anymore."
"__MUSIC__ No, there aren't.  So who's your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, it's a really tough call, too.  I guess I would say Dr. Dre."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I never would've guessed that."
"__MUSIC__ He has such amazing beats.  They were unique and different."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he did kinda re-write hip hop at the time.  I think he had a really positive impact on the genre in general."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so too.  Everything he ever produced came out unique and with a great sound."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know about everything, but most things."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, true.  He worked with a lot of different people, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Biggie, Eminem, Tupac, the list goes on."
