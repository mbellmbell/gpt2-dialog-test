"__MOVIES__ If you had to choose, what would be the best movie death of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a big question. I think it would have to be Sean Bean in 'Fellowship of the Ring.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! That was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Such a noble death. And that line: 'My brother, my captain, my king.' It gets me every time."
"__MOVIES__ The one I really like is Samuel L. Jackson in 'Deep Blue Sea.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, yeah. Not in the same vein but that was an awesome scene."
"__MOVIES__ It's the last thing you'd ever expect. That's why I like it."
"__MOVIES__ It really did shock me utterly. You never saw it coming."
"__MOVIES__ If you want emotional, though, there will always be Mufasa in 'The Lion King.'"
"__MOVIES__ That one still makes me cry. First, it's James Earl Jones, which makes it tough."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. He's not one we're used to seeing die, even in animation."
"__MOVIES__ Then Simba's reaction and how Scar makes him feel guilty. It's heartbreaking."
"__MOVIES__ Poor little guy! It's all so very Shakespearean."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. It reminds me of 'Hamlet.'"
"__MOVIES__ It's essentially the same the story, though in 'Hamlet' you don't get to witness his father's death."
"__MOVIES__ Disney is good about breaking our hearts watching baby animals lose their parents."
"__MOVIES__ One word: 'Dumbo.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh forget it. 'Dumbo' gets me every time. Even though you know it turns out okay."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. I can't watch the scene where he visits his mother in her trailer without tears rolling down."
"__MOVIES__ If you could, you'd have no soul."
