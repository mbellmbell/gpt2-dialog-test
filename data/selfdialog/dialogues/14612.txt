"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Have you heard any good rock songs lately?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, not really. Music has really gone down hill since the late 90's."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You aren't kidding. I wish music today was like the music back then."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. Everything is too commercialized today."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Even though early 90's music and rock was good, there were still some good bands in the early 2000's."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, Godsmack, Disturbed, Three Days Grace."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Our Lady Peace, Slipknot."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I forgot about those two bands."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How could you forget about Slipknot?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Maybe they blew out my eardrums and part of my brain."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Haha. Yes, they were loud and intense."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Have you ever been to one of their concerts?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nope. I wish I had back in the day. I went to a Rob Zombie and Godsmack concert back in 2001."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Rob Zombie. He's awesome."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. He was awesome. His newer stuff really mellowed out and became uninteresting."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I tend to agree with that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ His early stuff was headbanging, and then sometime around 2007, he really went down hill."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think maybe because he was focusing more on making movies than making music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's a shame because he was a music genius when he put his full energy and time toward music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. For sure."
