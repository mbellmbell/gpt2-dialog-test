"__BEATLES__ I love how the Beatles always wrote their own material. They were the ultimate songwriters."
"__BEATLES__ No, not in the early part of their career."
"__BEATLES__ What?!"
"__BEATLES__ In the early days of their career, the Beatles played a lot of cover versions, not originals."
"__BEATLES__ Really? Who would they typically cover?"
"__BEATLES__ Actually, a lot of African American girl groups, for one thing. Think Motown, but a little earlier."
"__BEATLES__ Wow, that's surprising."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, you know that song 'Please Mr. Postman?' It's by the Marvelettes, but the Beatles made a cover version of it."
"__BEATLES__ Did they change much?"
"__BEATLES__ No, not really. They even do the hand claps that the Marvelettes did, too."
