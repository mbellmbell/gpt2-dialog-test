"__MOVIES__ Did you know that they are making a Spider-Man spin off movie?"
"__MOVIES__ This is my first time hearing of this. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Silver Sable and Black Cat. Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Have you seen the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ No. 'Silver and Black', that is the title of it,  is looking to start production this fall."
"__MOVIES__ Silver and Black."
"__MOVIES__ Who's directing it?"
"__MOVIES__ Gina Prince-Bythewood."
"__MOVIES__ Who's that?"
"__MOVIES__ She wrote and directed The Secret Life of Bees."
"__MOVIES__ The Secret Life of Bees? I have never heard of this."
"__MOVIES__ What can they do with Black Cat? The only thing that's fun about Black Cat is her relationship with Spider-Man."
"__MOVIES__ You're right and  I don't know how you make a movie with her that doesn't have Spidey."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think many people will care about these characters with out Spider-Man"
"__MOVIES__ They might. You never know."
"__MOVIES__ I want to know is why are they being kept separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe ."
"__MOVIES__ No Spider-Man could very well spell out no hit with this movie."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed."
"__MOVIES__ It looks like Sony is chipping away at Spider-man's supporting cast until the MCU has nothing to work with for the sequels."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe one day we'll have a perfect world where Marvel has full control of all its properties."
