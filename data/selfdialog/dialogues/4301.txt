"__MUSIC__ Are you going to the Third Eye Blind concert next weekend?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure yet.  I'm still trying to convince my husband to come with us."
"__MUSIC__ They are one of the greatest rock groups of all time!  What more does he need to convince him?!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he thinks the tickets are too expensive."
"__MUSIC__ Since he's a lawyer, I think he could easily afford to buy the tickets."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, he doesn't like listening to alternative rock music."
"__MUSIC__ What music does he enjoy?"
"__MUSIC__ He likes heavy metal songs from Scandinavia and electronic music."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I can't stand foreign songs; I love to listen and understand song lyrics!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too!  I love singing along to my favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if he doesn't want to go to the concert will you come with us anyways?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know yet.  Give me a chance to change his mind!"
"__MUSIC__ Remind him of their singles from his childhood!"
"__MUSIC__ I will!  I'm sure he's forgotten how much he actually likes their music."
"__MUSIC__ If that doesn't work, try offering to buy the ticket for him."
"__MUSIC__ I would offer but I couldn't afford the tickets on my meager teacher's salary."
"__MUSIC__ Luckily for you, I'd be willing to buy his ticket for him if it means he will come."
"__MUSIC__ You are the best friend I could ever wish for!"
"__MUSIC__ You owe me one!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I do!"
