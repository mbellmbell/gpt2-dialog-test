"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you see the last Fast and Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The Fate of the Furious, yeah like 4 times already."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I just watched it for the first time last night."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Ok, first question, how did you 'just' see that movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know I'm super late, but I couldn't get a chance to see it in the theaters."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well anyway what did you think of the first part in Cuba?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Where Dom freaking drove a car backward to win?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, I mean where he drove a car backward, that had been ripped down to the studs, and was on fire?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It is by far the best way to open that movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Are you kidding me, every action movie should open with that scene; not just racing ones, I mean action movies in general"
