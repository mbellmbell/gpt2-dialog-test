"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Cars 3 yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I hadn't realized it was coming out so soon."
"__DISNEY__ It came out last weekend.  At least I think it did."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know what it's about?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, but I can't wait to see what kind of trouble Mater gets into this time."
"__DISNEY__ Poor Mater.  He always stumble in to some kind of trouble, doesn't he?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes he does, and then Lightning McQueen is generally right there with him."
"__DISNEY__ True.  They kind of bail each other out."
"__DISNEY__ Well, Whatever this one is about, I'm sure it will be enjoyable."
"__DISNEY__ I agree.  Maybe we should find out when it's playing and go."
