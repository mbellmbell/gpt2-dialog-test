"__MUSIC__ The only time I can handle Mariah Carey is during Christmas with that song playing on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Not a fan? Didn't see Glitter?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not and I did not, no, haha."
"__MUSIC__ You gotta admit though she's got a fantastic voice. Like, her range and pitch is crazy."
"__MUSIC__ I'll give you that. But I just don't like the music she does. It just doesn't resonate with me."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Christina Aguilera? She's similar in talent, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I can actually dig her music. It's more fun and dancey than Mariah's kind of... maudlin sentimentality..."
"__MUSIC__ I see that, sure. I remember her music video to 'Fighter'-"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, that was bad ass! With the spider thing? She was a spider or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I remember that came out around the same time as Britney's 'Stronger.' I get them confused..."
"__MUSIC__ Holy crap and Destiny's Child came out with 'Survivor,' too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sensing a pattern..."
"__MUSIC__ It's not ripping anyone off if they all become successful, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they all had different melodies. Just same theme or message or whatever."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah no it wasn't plagiarism or anything. Wasn't Survivor the first time Beyonce tried to rap?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. Jay-Z influenced her?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, haha. Eh, she didn't do too bad."
"__MUSIC__ Nah, that was a decent song."
"__MUSIC__ I saw this thing years ago with Rihanna saying she was influenced by Destiny's Child as a little girl."
"__MUSIC__ Ahhh I feel old, now."
