"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So who is your favorite rapper?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I like Jay-Z and Drake."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Did you hear that Jay-Z and Beyonce had their babies?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I guess we won't be getting another album from him any time soon."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That song he did with MIA a few years ago was really good, I think it was called XXXO."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I liked that album but I really preferred his old stuff like Hard Knock Life."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's true, his older stuff was better.  Ever since he had his 'retirement party' it feels like his stuff just isn't as fresh."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ After The Black Album is when it started to go downhill for me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wish he would collab with some of today's artists and come out with a really good album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but like I said he probably won't be able to work on anything for a while.  Plus, he kind of isn't that relevant anymore."
