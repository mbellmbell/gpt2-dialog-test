"__DISNEY__ What's your least favorite Disney Pixar movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Most of them are really great, but the Cars series, 1 and 2, haven't done much for me."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I am mainly perplexed by the premise of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Same. Kids like cars I guess?"
"__DISNEY__ That's true."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder how well Cars 2 did at the box office."
"__DISNEY__ Google says 562 million dollars."
"__DISNEY__ Wow! A half billion dollars from a movie."
"__DISNEY__ It's super impressive."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, although, it's also super impressive how much they spent making it. 200 million!"
