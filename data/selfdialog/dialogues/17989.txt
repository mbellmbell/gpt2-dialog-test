"__MOVIES__ You know, I tried to watch that movie From Dusk Til Dawn. And there were no vampires at all and i just turned it off after a while."
"__MOVIES__ The first part of the movie is practically a different movie, about these two criminals on the run."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but that isn't what the commercials for it showed."
"__MOVIES__ It just suddenly changes from this ordinary movie, all at one, into a vampire movie. It's so abrupt it's crazy."
"__MOVIES__ So I just gave up on it too early?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. The first part of the movie is interesting, and you actually get a feel for who the characters are."
"__MOVIES__ Then everything goes batshit crazy?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. And you're sort of rooting for these guys, because you've gotten to know them. But of course that isn't really the best part."
"__MOVIES__ What's the best part?"
"__MOVIES__ The director's commitment to showing either vampires or people die in outlandish, brutal ways."
"__MOVIES__ Now you're talking. That was the movie I wanted to see!"
"__MOVIES__ It totally delivers as a good gory vampire movie."
"__MOVIES__ Dang, I shouldn't have given up on it so quickly."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think it's on Netflix, but I think I still have the DVD around somewhere if you want to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ You still have your DVDs?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, why? They cost a lot of money, I wasn't just going to toss them out."
"__MOVIES__ It's just funny because nowadays you can find almost any movie instantly because cable has it on demand, or it's on Netflix or Hulu."
"__MOVIES__ Well I didn't see any reason to get rid of my old DVDs."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously, you're the only person I know who still has DVDs."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
