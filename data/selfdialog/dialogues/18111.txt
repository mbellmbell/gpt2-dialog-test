"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ I just did!"
"__MOVIES__ How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it, Chris Pratt is a great leading man"
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I was surprised he was so funny and charming"
"__MOVIES__ If you saw him on Parks and rec you know he was a goofball"
"__MOVIES__ I was really impressed by the CGI in the move"
"__MOVIES__ I was too, they weaved it in so well, most movies you can tell they're using special effects"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they had a lot going on, but it didn't distract from the movie"
"__MOVIES__ Who was your favorite, Rocky Racoon or Groot?"
"__MOVIES__ That is a hard one, but I did love Groot"
"__MOVIES__ I though Rocky Racoon was hysterical"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but Groot was so sweet"
"__MOVIES__ I heard that there's a baby Groot in the sequel!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I have not seen it yet"
"__MOVIES__ Me neither. I hope it is as good"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if they have the same cast it has to be good"
"__MOVIES__ You are right. We should see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Is it still playing?"
"__MOVIES__ I just checked it is!"
