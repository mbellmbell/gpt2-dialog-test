"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Um.. Wreck It Ralph."
"__DISNEY__ Really? That's pretty modern for a 90s kid like yourself."
"__DISNEY__ Are you saying I'm too old to watch Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ No I just thought you'd pick something older like Aladdin, The Lion King, or even Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ Well... if I had to pick something from my childhood then it'd probably be The Rescuers or yeah Aladdin was another favorite."
"__DISNEY__ That's more like it. Mine is Beauty and the Beast and DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp."
"__DISNEY__ Oh? Did you see the recently released live action Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson?"
"__DISNEY__ I was there at the midnight premier! They did an absolutely fantastic job with it!"
"__DISNEY__ I couldn't agree more. Disney has been doing an amazing job with their live action reimaginings like Maleficent and Cinderella."
