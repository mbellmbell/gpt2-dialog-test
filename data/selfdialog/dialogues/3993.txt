"__MUSIC__ This whole week has been my Pantera week!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?  That's some hard music"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, hard music and awesome music, I love it!"
"__MUSIC__ What album have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I started with Cowboys From Hell but for some reason, Far Beyond Driven has been my fave this week."
"__MUSIC__ Cowboys is my all time Pantera favorite album, I mean, come on, it's got Cemetary Gates on it!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love that song, soft and then boom!  Here comes Dimebag wailing away."
"__MUSIC__ Some of his riffs are impossible to duplicate."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he certainly had the talent and dexterity to be impossible to copy."
"__MUSIC__ So sad what happened to him, being murdered on stage."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I'll never for get the day I heard the news.  The guy that opened fire was crazy, I'm glad he's dead!"
"__MUSIC__ They were playing in their new band, Damage Plan, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, brothers Vinnie and Dime formed Damage Plan after they were having trouble with Phil Anselmo."
"__MUSIC__ Why was Anselmo a problem?"
"__MUSIC__ Anselmo had side projects going, Super Joint Ritual, Down but his main problem was heroin and this led to the demise of Pantera."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think of Damage Plan?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I really didn't care for it.  To me it was kind of a band that was trying to hard and could never get the magic of Pantera back."
"__MUSIC__ Even with Dimebag's guitar playing?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was almost as if the band didn't click, great musicians that they were, it just didn't work for me,"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the whole Damage Plan story is tragic, but I'm glad we can still listen and appreciate the awesomeness of Pantera- the music will always live on!"
