"__MUSIC__ Hey, are you doing anything Friday night?"
"__MUSIC__ No, why?"
"__MUSIC__ There's really great band playing locally, I thought you might like to go with me."
"__MUSIC__ Who is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Fall Out Boy,  have you heard of them?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't.  What are they like?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a pop  punk band that I started listening to back in high school, when I bought a CD out of their drummer's trunks."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool!  Have I heard any of their songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably.  They are played on the radio quite a bit and they have had some songs on movie soundtracks."
"__MUSIC__ What was on the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ They did that song, 'Dance, Dance' that was popular a while bank.  They also did 'Sugar, We're Going Done.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I have heard those!  They were really big when I was in college."
"__MUSIC__ They also re did the 'Ghostbusters' theme song when they re released the movie last year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's awesome, I loved thae original movie!  I haven't seen the new one yet, actually."
"__MUSIC__ We should watch it together sometime, I have it on blue ray."
"__MUSIC__ I'd like that.  Is  it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was pretty funny, and obviously I love the soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, good point.  Maybe we can watch it before we go see the show Friday?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd like that, why don't you text me later and we'll figure it out."
"__MUSIC__ Can do, I'll get with you as soon as I get a babysitter lined up."
