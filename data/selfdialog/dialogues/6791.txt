"__STAR_WARS__ So judging by your shirt, you must be a big Star Wars fan!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Actually I'm not.  My father gave me this shirt for Christmas and I wear it around the house."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I see.  Have you seen any of the movies though?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes of course.  I've probably seen more of them than not."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't you also have a Star Wars key chain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I do.  It's a Star Wars Episode 1 key chain that my parents got me way back when Episode 1 came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow!  It lasted that long, eh?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it did.  I never used it because I though it looked too good, so I put off actually using it for many years."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, did you see Rogue One last year?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was a very good movie and I look forward to seeing The Last Jedi when it finally comes out.  It's sad that Carrie Fisher passed on."
