"__MOVIES__ What movie are you looking forward to?"
"__MOVIES__ The new Spiderman!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I heard about that. What does it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it premieres on the 7th."
"__MOVIES__ Nice! It's coming up soon then!  Did you like the older Spidermans?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not really."
"__MOVIES__ What makes you excited about the new one then?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like how he was portrayed in the movie with the Avengers."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that.  It was cute.  He has a different personality."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he seems younger too. Kind of innocent."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm sure something will happen to make him throw up."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if it will follow the comic books with his uncle or if it will be a bit multiverse."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, like something else happening and his uncle living?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if that will be. The trailers only showed his aunt."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that!  It was funny how Iron Man is flirting with her."
"__MOVIES__ I think Iron Man's interaction with Spiderman will sure make it different."
"__MOVIES__ That's what might make him grow up!"
"__MOVIES__ Could be. Iron Man is pretty out there."
"__MOVIES__ He is, but I think he'll make it very interesting. I'm so looking forward to it.  You should see it too!"
