"__DISNEY__ Do you think Belle or Ariel makes a better heroine?"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely Belle I think."
"__DISNEY__ Why Belle? She really didn't triumph anything."
"__DISNEY__ Not true. Belle used compassion and morals to overcome her obstacles as where Ariel's answer was to make a deal with the devil so to speak."
"__DISNEY__ I never thought of it that way."
"__DISNEY__ Belle gave up freedom to protect her father, then swayed the staff to adore her while convincing a think headed man he was worth something."
"__DISNEY__ And you don't see the sacrifices Ariel made just as important?"
"__DISNEY__ No because Ariel's answer was to try to cheat to get a man to love her while keeping secrets."
"__DISNEY__ So if this a feminist thing?"
"__DISNEY__ Not feminist per se but I do see Belle as a stronger female since she didn't try to take the easy road out."
