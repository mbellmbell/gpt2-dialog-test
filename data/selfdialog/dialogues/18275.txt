"__MOVIES__ It's weird, but it seems like every time I become close friends with someone, it turns out they like horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's hilarious. Any idea why?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, it must say something about me, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you even like horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ I do. From time to time. Like, I really liked The Conjuring."
"__MOVIES__ The Conjuring was good. Any others you've seen lately."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm not sure if it's a horror movie or its own thing, but Get Out was also pretty great."
"__MOVIES__ Get Out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the movie Jordan Peele directed."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard a lot of great things about that."
"__MOVIES__ It's an intense experience, but the whole audience loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I should see it."
"__MOVIES__ The whole audience applauded when I saw it in the theatre. That almost never happens."
"__MOVIES__ I think that only happened when I saw Avatar opening weekend."
"__MOVIES__ I actually haven't seen that!"
"__MOVIES__ You should. I'm not sure it's as good without the 3D though."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot it was in 3d."
"__MOVIES__ That was what made it so special, I think."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I can buy a pair of those glasses!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't see why not."
