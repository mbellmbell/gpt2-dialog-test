"__MOVIES__ I've never really been into sports movies, but lately I've been thinking that maybe I should try them out."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know I have a lot of fun with them. But my definition is pretty broad."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite sports movies?"
"__MOVIES__ So, this is maybe a controversial choice."
"__MOVIES__ That's okay! Tell me!"
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite sports movie is The Sandlot."
"__MOVIES__ The Sandlot? I've never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's great. It's kind of a coming of age story about kids playing baseball."
"__MOVIES__ So I should watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Most definitely. It was a big deal for me growing up."
"__MOVIES__ Any others?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm also a huge fan of Air Bud?"
"__MOVIES__ Air Bud?!"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, there's no rule that says a dog can't play basketball, is there?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that really the reason they let him play?"
"__MOVIES__ In the movie? Yep."
"__MOVIES__ That's ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ It's such a funny movie though."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'm not sure either of them are sports movies, but I'll watch them."
"__MOVIES__ You should!"
