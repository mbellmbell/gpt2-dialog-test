"__MUSIC__ I used to listen to a lot of rap, but nowadays I just can't get into it."
"__MUSIC__ You're starting to sound like an old man."
"__MUSIC__ I know and I hate it! There's nothing worse than people droning on about how much better it was in the old days. But ..."
"__MUSIC__ But you can't get into the newer stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Right. There seems to have been a point when everyone got very serious. Too serious."
"__MUSIC__ But there was serious stuff in the past, 'The Message' by Grandmaster Flash came out in the early '80s for example."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I mean that there was more of a mixture in the old days. Plus everyone these days is a solo artist, I miss the groups."
"__MUSIC__ That's not true either, Migos for example are a trio and huge at the moment."
"__MUSIC__ Okay maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic but you get my point?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you should try and pinpoint when the change came for you, that might help you more."
"__MUSIC__ Well I suppose my rap fandom came in two waves. Firstly the late '80s stuff like Public Enemy, Tribe Called Quest, NWA and so on."
"__MUSIC__ All groups I notice. Go on."
"__MUSIC__ Then in the '90s I was really into stuff like Pharcyde, Gang Starr, Diggin in the Crates, all that sort of stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Still all groups. So what is the first thing you heard when you thought 'This isn't for me'?"
"__MUSIC__ I suppose it was when everyone stopped sampling as much and started using digital keyboards instead. A lot of that West Coast Dr. Dre sound."
"__MUSIC__ So you weren't a fan of Tupac then?"
"__MUSIC__ He was OK but I much preferred Biggie. Maybe I'm a East Coast hip hop snob!"
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like it! It made sense for the producers to play synths rather than pay for all those samples though."
"__MUSIC__ I guess so, I remember reading that Lou Reed demanded 100% of the royalties from that Tribe song 'Can I Kick It' that sampled him."
"__MUSIC__ That was their big hit too, if I was them I'd have stopped sampling the day after that happened!"
