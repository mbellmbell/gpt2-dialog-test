"__MUSIC__ Okay, I hate to do this.  But I'm going to do it anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, let's hear it."
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles or the Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, here we go; Beatles ALL the way."
"__MUSIC__ I knew you'd say that.  No way, definitely the Stones."
"__MUSIC__ How?!  The Beatles are the most influential musicians of the last century."
"__MUSIC__ Three words: 'Paint. It. Black.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's everyone's answer."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't make the song any worse."
"__MUSIC__ Way too much grief and death in that song."
"__MUSIC__ But that's what makes it so exciting.  Very edgy, but exciting at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ It doesn't really do it for me.  I preferred 'Gimme Shelter'"
"__MUSIC__ That's my second favorite.  Let's hear your 'Beatles' pick now."
"__MUSIC__ 'Hey Jude'"
"__MUSIC__ Great pick.  Though songs like 'Sympathy for the Devil' and 'Midnight Rambler' top anything by the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Agree to disagree.  At the end of the day, I love them both."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, both bands had their own style but it worked for them."
"__MUSIC__ And they contributed so much to music."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  Let's listen to some music."
"__MUSIC__ Only if we start with the Beatles!"
