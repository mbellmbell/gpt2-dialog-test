"__ROCK__ What rock band are you listening to nowadays?"
"__ROCK__ I've been listening to Eagles of Death Metal a lot recently. They're a lot of fun."
"__ROCK__ Really? I heard they are great live."
"__ROCK__ They are, I saw them just last month on tour, but Josh Homme was not touring with them."
"__ROCK__ He's really busy with the new Queens of the Stone Age record. Do you like them too?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, they're fun and the steady rhythms are always catchy."
"__ROCK__ They're a call back to when rock stars were rock stars."
"__ROCK__ Definitely. Josh Homme has that old school swagger about him."
"__ROCK__ I know he met Jesse Hughes in high school, and they became friends years before starting a band together."
"__ROCK__ Really? I didn't know that. They seem so different."
