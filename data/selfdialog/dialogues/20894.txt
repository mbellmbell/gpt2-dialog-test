"__THRILLER__ We watched a pretty good thriller the other day."
"__THRILLER__ I LOVE thrillers, what was it."
"__THRILLER__ It was 'Kidnap'. It had Halle Berry in it. It was pretty good. Not the best I've ever seen, but still good."
"__THRILLER__ Was it better than 'Get Out'?"
"__THRILLER__ They are very different. Get out is a little weirder. I wasn't sure if I like that one. It felt like they were trying to make a political commentary a little bit and I despise that in movies."
"__THRILLER__ Hmm, I din't get that..."
"__THRILLER__ It feels like they don't make good thrillers anymore. They are mostly horror and I don't like horror."
"__THRILLER__ The new one 'Baby Driver' that's coming out looks good."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, I really want to see that. It has Jamie Foxx in it right?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah. It should be good."
