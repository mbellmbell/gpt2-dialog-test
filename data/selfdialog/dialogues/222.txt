"__MUSIC__ It's interesting how iconic a song can be, if heard in the right context; you always think back to the first time you heard it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I know what you mean. I first heard Tainted Love on an episode of Dr. Who and now every time I hear that song I think back to that episode."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that by Soft Cell?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so . . . but anyways that song reminds me more of Dr. Who than the actual lyrics and meanings."
"__MUSIC__ That's how it is for me too, with Places I Remember."
"__MUSIC__ What movie - or book - did you hear it in?"
"__MUSIC__ It was in a Lassie movie. It really resonated with me because I experienced the same feelings in the songs."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know who it's by?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the Beatles! I didn't realize it until later, though."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of books, there was a song I read about, that I had made up a tune for in my head."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, an actual song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was. I heard it on the radio and suddenly the scenes it was in made a whole lot more sense."
"__MUSIC__ What song was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was Handsome Polly O; the books I read it in was the Tillerman Cycle by Cynthia Voigt."
"__MUSIC__ That song sounds interesting - what style is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's an Irish song. You can probably find it on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds good!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was fun exploring it. It was the first time I'd really listened to Irish folkmusic."
"__MUSIC__ What other Irish songs do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Loch Lomond - although I suppose that's more Scotch than Irish."
