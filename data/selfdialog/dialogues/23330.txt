"__DISNEY__ One thing I’ve always felt Disney did great was tell stories in their films.  Any movie that really stands out as telling a great story to you?"
"__DISNEY__ I’d have to say, Beauty and the Beast. I have always thought that movie was just a great story."
"__DISNEY__ I completely agree. It’s an amazing movie, but also a classic story that speaks for itself."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely. While it is simple, it’s quite compelling at the same time."
"__DISNEY__ A formally man, now cursed to be a monster manages to find love."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and the thing is, they present Belle as believable in terms of falling for him."
"__DISNEY__ I also like the character development of The Beast, especially. As the film goes on, you get to see his softer side."
"__DISNEY__ I think that is part of what makes the movie so great. You begin to really like him."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. Overall, Beauty and the Beast is an amazing story."
"__DISNEY__ I completely second that. It’s a classic and always will be."
