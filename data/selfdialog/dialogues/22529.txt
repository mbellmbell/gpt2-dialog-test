"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! It was incredible!"
"__DISNEY__ I know. I loved Emma Watson in it."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, so did I. She really made it special."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah she did. I have heard a lot of people complain about the computer-generated animation though."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I thought it was great."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. Mainly in the scene with the wolves."
"__DISNEY__ Oh okay. I do remember then looking fake but I didn't really mind."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. I think it was still such a good story line."
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad they came out with it. Beauty and the Beast is my favorite."
