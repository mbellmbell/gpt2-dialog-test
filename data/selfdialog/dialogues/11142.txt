"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to win the NFC West this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks probably have it locked down, the rest of that division needs a lot of work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Even the niners? They had a great draft and Kyle Shanahan is going to be a great fit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that's true, but nothing will change the fact that they still don't have a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't be so sure, Hoyer may surprise you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! That guy is terrible, don't defend him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even so, I think the niners will surprise a lot of people. I'm thinking at least 8 wins this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well yeah, they have to play the AFC South so they're bound to win a few of those. I give them 6 wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why only 6?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because they have to play the rest of the NFC West 6 times and those are basically a guaranteed loss - save the rams maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dunno man, Lynch is a genius as the GM - and he just started!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, he just started and has no experience with this. What makes you think he has the right mentality for the job?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well like I said, they killed it at the draft. I can't believe the Bears traded up for a pick that the niners weren't even going to make."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha yeah, I'm not sure what the bears were thinking, but I will admit that the niners did have some good picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh by the way, did you hear Marshawn wants to go to the Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's a shame, he was such a beast on the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he grew up in Oakland so this is going to be a much better fit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't care about that though. i just want our running back to return."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha yeah, I do miss frank gore. This season will be interesting with hyde."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hyde gets hurt too much to be a contender, sorry friend."
