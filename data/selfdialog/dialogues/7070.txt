"__ICEHOCKEY__ How was your daughter's ice hockey game this morning?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It was good.  She played well but unfortunately they lost 5-7."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's too bad.  Was she terribly disappointed?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ A little bit, but she's a good sport.  She just loves to play!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What position does she play?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It varies.  It's a rotational system, so sometimes she plays offense and sometimes defense.  Today she mostly played defense."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's nice.  I'm sure it's good for her to get experience with both.  Does she ever play goalie?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, she plays both offense and defense but doesn't ever play goalie.  It requires extra equipment and extra practices.  She would like to do it, but so far haven't let her."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that makes sense.  It's already a big commitment I'm sure!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Definitely.  She plays two to three times a week most weeks.  It's pretty intense for a six year old!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Wow, and she does a travel league, right?  How far and how often do you have to travel?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, she has a game every weekend for 8 weeks.  Four home games and four away games.  The furthest was about an hour and a half away, so definitely a commitment."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Wow, I guess!  I would love to come see her play sometime!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, you should!  It's so cute.  She is the only girl on her team and is the smallest to it is so cute to watch her play."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ok, I would love to see that.  I'll try to come to her next home game.  When is it?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Two weeks from today at 2pm.  She would love for you to come!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ok, great.  I'll definitely be there.  I can't wait to see her play!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Great, she will love to see you.  That will be her last game too so it will be a good one to come to!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Great, see you then!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ OK!"
