"__DISNEY__ Did you see the live action of The Jungle Book?"
"__DISNEY__ I did. That movie was intense in some scenes but really good."
"__DISNEY__ I found it interesting that they had Kaa as a female in this one verses the cartoon version."
"__DISNEY__ Yes but 	Scarlett Johansson's version made Kaa's voice sound very scary as the snake was trying to eat Mowgli."
"__DISNEY__ I was sad though when Shere Khan killed Akela."
"__DISNEY__ I was too. Shere Khan was definitely fearsome and intimidating compared to the animated version."
"__DISNEY__ King Louie was pretty entertaining."
"__DISNEY__ I liked him a lot but I wasn't expecting him to be so huge."
"__DISNEY__ I also really liked Baloo and Bagheera's banter a lot."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah those two were really great in their performance."
