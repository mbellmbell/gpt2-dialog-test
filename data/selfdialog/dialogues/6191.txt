"__STAR_WARS__ So, Kylo Ren and the Knights of Ren are Siths, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, no, no. They can't be."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, why not? They use the Dark Side, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Using the Dark Side doesn't make one a Sith. The Sith were wiped out, anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ So there couldn't be more?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the Sith followed the Rule of Two, meaning that there could only be two Sith at one time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, well, maybe Darth Vader had a secret apprentice or something, so there were actually more than two?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's unlikely, and even if go ahead and say Snoke was Vader's apprentice even then he probably wasn't a fully trained Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, he wouldn't be considered a Sith, and so Kylo Ren wouldn't either, even Snoke had some Sith training?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, even being trained by a Sith Lord isn't enough to be considered one. It's a whole thing, really."
