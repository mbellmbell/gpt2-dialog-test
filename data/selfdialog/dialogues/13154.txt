"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, you think they're gonna pay Leveon Bell a lot this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will, he's gotta be the best runningback in the league!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think David Johnson is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cardinals guy? I don't know much about him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, the NFL doesn't showcase stars that aren't in prime viewing areas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why's he so good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he led the league in all-purpose yards last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought Ezekiel Elliot did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, that's all the NFL cares to talk about is the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well ok then, so who is better, David or LeVeon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly it's a toss up, I think the kicker is the fact that Bell is going to miss games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like he did at the start of the 2016 season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, the guy has a history of either getting in trouble, or getting hurt.  Neither of which I'm too fond of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is marijuana that he got suspended for at the start of the season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and I don't think Johnson has missed a game yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't he young though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I think that just adds to his attractiveness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where did Bell play in college, it feels like so long ago?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm pretty sure it was Michigan State."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was good then, but I never would have guessed this good!"
