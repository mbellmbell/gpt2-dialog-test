"__MOVIES__ They dont do nearly as good as Marvel films."
"__MOVIES__ I think its a different way they film them."
"__MOVIES__ They are darker I know that"
"__MOVIES__ And they have more depressing story lines."
"__MOVIES__ I mean look at the Batman films."
"__MOVIES__ Thats exactly what i was going to."
"__MOVIES__ And the Superman films."
"__MOVIES__ Most of them center on how the hero doesnt love what he does."
"__MOVIES__ And is all alone in their universes."
"__MOVIES__ So I think that contributes to something"
"__MOVIES__ They should bring in Marvel directors."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but the writers are the one doing the meat of the films."
"__MOVIES__ Joss Whedon directs both Marvel and DC"
"__MOVIES__ DC also goes to CW for their TV stuff"
