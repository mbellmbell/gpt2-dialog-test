"__BEATLES__ Do you have a favorite sequence of Beatles songs on a studio album."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, you know I do. It's on Abbey Road, does that give it away?"
"__BEATLES__ I can actually think of a few great sequences on that album. Which one is the best?"
"__BEATLES__ She Came In Through The Bathroom Window into Golden Slumbers into Carry that Weight."
"__BEATLES__ Right! Those songs flow together so incredibly well!"
"__BEATLES__ I know, it's a brilliant transition musically. It doesn't feel forced at all. What song transitions did you have in mind?"
"__BEATLES__ I was thinking of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band into With a Little Help from My Friends into Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It's such a great range of pop songs."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, and it shows that even the doofy Ringo could write a great song."
"__BEATLES__ Oh man, it has been a long time since I've listened to Sgt. Pepper. I think this year is the fiftieth anniversary."
"__BEATLES__ I think you're right. It came out in 1967 so that would make fifty years."
