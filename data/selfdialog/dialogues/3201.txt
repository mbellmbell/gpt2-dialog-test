"__MUSIC__ Do you like Nick Cave?"

"__MUSIC__ They blew my little teenage mind. I have been following him ever since. It's been amazing to watch his progression as an artist and song-writer."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. He has a lot of material. I have been a fan for years but he still has material I have yet to hear."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I saw him live in Detroit a couple years ago."
"__MUSIC__ How was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was absolutely electric. He really communicates with his audience. I was in a fairly large auditorium but it felt very intimate."
"__MUSIC__ He's getting older. Did he seem worn out?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely not. I was surprised by his energy and physicality. It was very exciting. My version of seeing Elvis or The Beatles!"
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite album?"
"__MUSIC__ Hard to pick one. Probably Henry's Dream or Let Love In."
"__MUSIC__ I like the Boatman's Call."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Grinderman?"
"__MUSIC__ No. What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a side project. Another Nick Cave led band. They are great!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Does he ever sleep? He certainly is prolific."
