"__DISNEY__ I loved the new Beauty and The Beast movie. Have you seen it?"
"__DISNEY__ Eww, absolutley not. Nothing could be better than the original. And tell me how will the clock and candle holder be real?"
"__DISNEY__ They get it done, i promise. Emma Watson is a perfect Belle."
"__DISNEY__ I wish they would make a remake of Lion King, and not in the musical way. But a real actor play."
"__DISNEY__ I dont know if i could take that in real life. I love the cartoon movie, and a dead Simba's dad would make me cry. I am a softie."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, it would be fake though. I would love to see someone play Timon and Pumba. 'Akauna Matata'"
"__DISNEY__ 'It means no worries for the rest of your days!' That was one of the best parts of the whole movie."
"__DISNEY__ That, and when Rakifi holds up baby Simba and it goes, aaaaaayaaaananenenenenam"
"__DISNEY__ Nice spelling singing there. I guess a new Nala and Simba could come to town and I would go watch it."
"__DISNEY__ I would be the first one there, hoping JTT still plays Simba. Nineties crush forever."
