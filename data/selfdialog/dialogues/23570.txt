"__DISNEY__ Why don't you like Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Because they're bad influences on our children, that's why!"
"__DISNEY__ How on Earth are they bad influences?"
"__DISNEY__ Cinderella stayed out all night with a man she didn't know, Snow White shacked up with SEVEN men she didn't know, and Tiana was kissing on animals."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, it was totally different back in their times. And Tiana didn't go kissing on animals, just one frog!"
"__DISNEY__ Like that makes it better?"
"__DISNEY__ He was a talking frog, and he told her he was a prince. He told her a kiss would set him free."
"__DISNEY__ Okay? That still doesn't make it okay. He could've just been a talking frog who was lying to her."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. But what is life if you don't take chances?"
"__DISNEY__ I suppose. But nothing would ever make ME kiss a frog!"
