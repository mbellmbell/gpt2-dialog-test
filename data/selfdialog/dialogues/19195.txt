"__MOVIES__ I watched this movie called The Last Face last night."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the latest Sean Penn movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes Sean Penn directed it and it stars Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard anything about it. How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty terrible surprisingly. With the star cast and talent of Charlize and Javier I was expecting something a bit more than what I got."
"__MOVIES__ What was the problem with it? Sean Penn directed Into the Wild and I really liked that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he did a fantastic job on Into the Wild. In The Last Face I thought overall it looked fine, but the story was so flat and all over the place."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about these two people who are working in Africa trying to help the children there from the on going political war."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a political thriller or a romance?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that's the problem. It was trying to be both, but failed pretty horribly at both. It was a very melodramatic, shock value movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think when it sounds that bad a lot of the blame has to go to the writer don't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I forgot who the writer was but the story was just very poorly paced, and the tone was just up and done. It has shocking violent images of the casualties of war, the medical procedures, then it goes into Tree of Life like narrations and montages."
"__MOVIES__ Sean Penn was also in Tree of Life."
"__MOVIES__ Yes he was. The great Terrence Malick directed that and the haunting narrations and montages are usually his style. I think Sean Penn took some inspiration from that for The Last Face."
"__MOVIES__ It just didn't work for you?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it would've worked if the overall movie was consistent. It was just a little too preachy while at the same time not really making me feel anything too much for the characters."
"__MOVIES__ So you wouldn't recommend this as a watch?"
"__MOVIES__ I would definitely not rush out there to find it. If you're bored on a rainy Sunday afternoon and it's available on Netflix, give it a shot."
"__MOVIES__ Well I like Charlize in everything she does so if anything, I'll watch it for her performance!"
