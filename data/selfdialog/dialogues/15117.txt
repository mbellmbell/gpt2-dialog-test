"__ACTION__ The latest Jack Reacher film, Never Go Back is so improbable. Reacher is supposedly huge, but actor Tom Cruise is not."
"__ACTION__ I know, but the worst action movie I ever saw was Contraband. Did you see that one?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah. Mark Wahlberg is an ex-drug-runner who's gonna just do one last job."
"__ACTION__ Right. Like in Heist, and so many others. Just one last job."
"__ACTION__ In The Usual Suspects they were doing one last caper."
"__ACTION__ Great great flick though. I believed it all, all the way through."
"__ACTION__ How about The Town. It's one last job, and a romance."
"__ACTION__ Oh yeah. Ben Affleck, he was totally believeable."
"__ACTION__ Yeah. A great actor, in any role."
"__ACTION__ The Italian Job was one last job, both the first version and its remake. And its sequel was The Brazilian Job. No rest for the wicked."
