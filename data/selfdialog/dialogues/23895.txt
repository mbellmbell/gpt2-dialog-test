"__SUPERHERO__ So I guess the next Avengers movie is actually two parts.  Is that right?"
"__SUPERHERO__ You mean Infinity War?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yep, that's the one I'm talking about."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think it's the last Avengers movie so they're going out big."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, anything would beat Age of Ultron.  Such a disappointment."
"__SUPERHERO__ Definitely was not a good follow-up to the original."
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't understand why it's so hard for them to put together a good plot.  They totally blew it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think it was rushed into production."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm sure they'll learn their listen on this next one."
"__SUPERHERO__ I hope so.  The series needs to go out on a high note."
