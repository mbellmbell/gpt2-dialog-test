"__MUSIC__ Who's your favorite Classical composer?"
"__MUSIC__ Beethoven.  Who's yours?"
"__MUSIC__ I also really like Beethoven, but my favorite is Tchaikovsky.  What's your favorite Beethoven piece?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably his third symphony (the Eroica)."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a great piece.  Very exciting music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and it also had huge historical significance, as it ushered in the Romantic era."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that.  Very interesting.  I knew it was an important piece but I didn't know why."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Tchaikovsky piece?"
"__MUSIC__ There are so many to choose from, but I really like his 5th symphony."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know that symphony, what's it like?"
"__MUSIC__ Of his symphonies 4-6, it's probably the most melodic.  It's best known for a recurring 'motto' across the movements."
"__MUSIC__ Very interesting.  Is the 'motto' idea similar to the 'fate' theme of Beethoven's 5th symphony?"
"__MUSIC__ They don't sound the same, but kind of.  The motto gets transformed from minor to major and shows up explicitly in each movement."
"__MUSIC__ Cool.  In Beethoven's 5th, the 'fate' motive isn't as explicit but the 'short short short long' motive shows up in all movements."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, well in Tchaikovsky's 5th, it's pretty obvious and very exciting.  Different instruments carry the motto."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting.  I'll have to listen to it sometime."
"__MUSIC__ You should.  I like the Berlin Philharmonic's version with Herbert von Karajan."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the recommendation.  I'll check it out and let you know what I think."
"__MUSIC__ Great.  If you like that, also listen to Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like a plan."
