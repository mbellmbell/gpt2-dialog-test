"__DISNEY__ I just saw Disney's The Good Dinosaur!"
"__DISNEY__ How did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I enjoyed it a lot. A bit of a tearjerker though."
"__DISNEY__ Some of the Disney movies are."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah this young dinosaur's dad died early on, like Bambi's mother did."
"__DISNEY__ That was definitely sad."
"__DISNEY__ Then it gets terribly lost, and goes on a long journey."
"__DISNEY__ How does it go?"
"__DISNEY__ It meets a lost human boy, they both have adventures, and it finds a family for the boy."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds like a typical sweet Disney tale."
