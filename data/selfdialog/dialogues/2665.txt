"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite musical instrument?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I played a bunch, as you know."
"__MUSIC__ Right, pretty much everything, showoff."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I have a favorite, but I definitely have a few."
"__MUSIC__ So, what are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Tuba, obviously. Then the horn, the mellophone, cello, and English horn."
"__MUSIC__ The ... French horn?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. But technically speaking it's not actually French; it's just a mistranslation"
"__MUSIC__ So why do we call it that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because us Americans are stupid. Look at the scores from around the world: they just call it 'horn.'"
"__MUSIC__ So why those?"
"__MUSIC__ They have deep, full textures, and are typically lower instruments."
"__MUSIC__ So why the cello and not the bass?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the bass just sounds 'muddy' to me. Especially if they are doing fast runs."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the notes kind of blend together given the thickness of the strings, which delay sound a bit. Everything kind of runs together."
"__MUSIC__ So why do you like tuba? It's the brass bass."
"__MUSIC__ We only do one note at a time, and have a much more clear tone. Plus, you know..."
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like farting."
