"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you remember Eva Mendes in Fast 5?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No I don't remember her being in that. Wasn't she only in 2 Fast 2 Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ She was the lead actresses in 2 Fast 2 Furious but she made a post credit cameo in Fast 5."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wow, I didn't realize that! What did she do?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ She basically works for the Feds I think. She was handing the Rock some files."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What were in the files? I need to watch Fast 5 again."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The files she handed over to the Rock post credit was a file on Letty. Remember she supposedly died in the 4th one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's really interesting! I didn't realize this scene existed. It kind of makes sense now that Michelle Rodriguez's Letty just appeared in Fast and Furious 6."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know it's one of those Fast and Furious Easter eggs! I put it right next to that scene of Paul Walker driving to Miami, and Dom driving around Mexico."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I've watched those scenes! I need to go and catch that Eva Mendes scene!"
