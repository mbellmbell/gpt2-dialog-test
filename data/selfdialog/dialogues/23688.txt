"__DISNEY__ What do you think is better, Pixar or Warner Brothers Animation?"
"__DISNEY__ That's easy man. Pixar is Disney and Disney makes all classics."
"__DISNEY__ Can't we say the same about Warner Bros. animation?"
"__DISNEY__ They've made a number of good movies, sure. However, Disney/Pixar has Toy Story, Inside Out, Finding Nemo, Finding Dory, Monsters, Inc., the Incredibles, WALL-E, and so many other classics."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I guess you're right. You just named a bunch of great movies and didn't even mention Cars, or A Bug's Life, or Up."
"__DISNEY__ See? Disney Pixar has so many great movies."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know who was associated with Disney Pixar?"
"__DISNEY__ Specifically? No."
"__DISNEY__ Steve Jobs of Apple fame."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I had no clue!"
