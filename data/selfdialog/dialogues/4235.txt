"__MUSIC__ So, do you listen to any Japanese metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've heard of any metal bands not from America or Europe."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you should definitely look up some Japanese bands. They're insane compared to some you've heard of."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine they'd be very different. Japan are a very inventive country after all."
"__MUSIC__ That's an understatement. Have you heard of Babymetal?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them, yes. I haven't listened to their music, though."
"__MUSIC__ They're basically the epitome of the uniqueness of Japanese metal."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ They blend the instrumentals and imagery of different styles of metal with vocals and lyrics you'd hear in J-Pop."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. That sounds interesting."
"__MUSIC__ And would you like to know something else?"
"__MUSIC__ What? Does it get crazier?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. They dance to the music."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, now that just sounds plain silly."
"__MUSIC__ I know it does, but it's so good."
"__MUSIC__ I have to check them out just to see and hear this in action. Any suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Try out Karate."
"__MUSIC__ They named a song after a martial art?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and it's awesome. The music video perfectly captures what Babymetal are all about."
"__MUSIC__ I'm about to look them up right now."
