"__LADY_GAGA__ What are your thoughts on Lady Gaga's most recent album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Aside from Perfect Illusion, it had too many ballads."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really? I thought you liked the ballads, especially A Million Reasons."
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, that song makes me cringe."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well then you must have a really good Poker Face."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That was funny. I prefer her older stuff more."
"__LADY_GAGA__ When you say older stuff, are you referring to Born This Way or all the way back to The Fame?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Definitely the The Fame. Just Dance is such a good song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, although my favorite song from that Album is LoveGame."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I must have listened to that song and Paparazzi 1,000 times during the summer of 2009."
