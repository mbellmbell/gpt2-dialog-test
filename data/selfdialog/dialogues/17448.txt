"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite movie when you were a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say it was Aladdin. That, or maybe Cinderella."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the classic Cinderella of course, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, absolutely! What about you? What was your favorite movie as a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ Mine was probably The Little Racals."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man. That is a classic! I loved Porky in it, and also how they featured Whoopi Goldberg."
"__MOVIES__ She was great as Buckwheat's mother. You know what other classic movie I love?"
"__MOVIES__ Could it be...The Breakfast Club?!"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one! I could watch that movie over and over and never get sick of it."
"__MOVIES__ Same here, along with Sixteen Candles."
"__MOVIES__ Molly Ringwald was amazing in that. I really miss seeing her in her younger days."
"__MOVIES__ She was an amazing actress. She still is, but the movies she was featured in back then were all so cool."
"__MOVIES__ I know! You knew if you saw her in the credits, it was going to be a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. What about newer movies? Have you seen any lately?"
"__MOVIES__ The latest movie I saw was the kid's movie Trolls. It was a super cute movie."
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie! It has to be one of my most well-loved modern kid's movies."
"__MOVIES__ It sure was entertaining! I coudn't believe I loved watching it so much!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That and Finding Dory were both awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that one as well and loved it. What about How to Train Your Dragon?"
