"__MOVIES__ Some of these movies are not even real Disney movies, I don't think."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ Just because the story lines are lame, and the animation is really bad, it just looks like it was all generated by computers from China or something. And the movements are all choppy."
"__MOVIES__ Where did you buy it? In China? On vacation?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. they're fakes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh great."
"__MOVIES__ They do have fantastic rips though. You won't be able to tell the difference between the real dvd and their rips. But they might be hard to find. I dunno."
"__MOVIES__ Whatever, you know what's weird?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ Netflix and chill."
"__MOVIES__ Um. Howzat weird?"
"__MOVIES__ It's weird because 1. it's become synonymous with 'let's hook up'. 2. Netflix is Ok with it."
"__MOVIES__ Netflix and chill wasn't, at one point, synonymous with 'let's hook up.' So when and how it became that way, is that your question?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and how come netflix is ok with it? they're a streaming platform, and they shouldn't want to be associated with such things."
"__MOVIES__ Well, as they say, there is no such thing as a bad publicity."
"__MOVIES__ I guess not."
"__MOVIES__ As for why it became a booty call, i think it began on twitter. All the twittards were using it and then it just became a thing some time in the last 3, 4 years."
"__MOVIES__ Did you just make up twittards?"
"__MOVIES__ What? twitter retards, twittards. It's only apt."
