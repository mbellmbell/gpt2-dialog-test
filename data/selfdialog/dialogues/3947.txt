"__MUSIC__ Lately I've been really into post-rock."
"__MUSIC__ Post-rock? What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's usually really quiet, lyricless music. But with rock instruments."
"__MUSIC__ I could get into that."
"__MUSIC__ I've always had trouble listening to music with lyrics when I'm working. It's distracting."
"__MUSIC__ I can relate to that. So you think this would be good work music."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely."
"__MUSIC__ What bands should I try?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been really into this Japanese group, Toe."
"__MUSIC__ What's good about them?"
"__MUSIC__ It feels like the rhythms they use are really unusual."
"__MUSIC__ Wouldn't that also be distracting?"
"__MUSIC__ You'd think so. But it's actually weirdly soothing."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. I wonder if they do that on purpose."
"__MUSIC__ If I were them, I would if I could."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder how much of that a musician can control?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess that applies to composers, too."
"__MUSIC__ Writing music must be so difficult."
"__MUSIC__ I bet it can be rewarding, though."
"__MUSIC__ It must be."
