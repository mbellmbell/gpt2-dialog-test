"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides the Patriots, who do you think wins the AFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Broncos have a great chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm worried about their quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With their defense, as long as their QB doesn't make mistakes they will be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think wins the QB job in Denver?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Lynch will win it. He's got more talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also like Jamal Charles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wasn't he hurt most of last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he can come back in a as a spot starter and be solid.  He adds a speed dimension to that offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agree, but the Chiefs are still in their division. They are going to be tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agree and love their defense, but you can't win with Alex Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alex Smith is decent, but he's not a game changer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Ravens?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Forgot about them, they have a decent defense and love Flacco."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Flacco is an underrated QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agree, for a guy who's won a Super Bowl and played in big time games - he doesn't get the respect he deserves"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, none of this matters because the Patriots will win it all this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm seriously thinking they will go undefeated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they do, they will be know as the greatest franchise in NFL history!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed!"
