"__MOVIES__ What was the last Ben Affleck movie you watched?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was either Live By Night or The Accountant."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen Live By Night, but The Accountant was my last Ben Affleck movie."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed The Accountant, Ben Affleck's performance as an autistic accountant that was also a hit man was really cool."
"__MOVIES__ Anna Kendrick was in that movie, I wish she had a bigger role. She was basically just damsel in distress."
"__MOVIES__ I know she just disappeared mid way into the movie."
"__MOVIES__ How was Live by Night?"
"__MOVIES__ It's interesting, but not too original. It takes place during the prohibition era, set in the '20's. Ben plays a character looking to gain power for his employer by taking over territories."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in this movie. I'm surprised I haven't heard of it before."
"__MOVIES__ It also stars Elle Fanning and Sienna Miller makes a short appearance."
"__MOVIES__ I love both of those actresses. I think Sienna Miller is really good. She was terrific in Factory Girl. Do they play Ben's love interest in Live By Night?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Sienna plays his love interest at the start, the conflict is that she's also the wife or girlfriend of a competing crime boss. Elle plays the daughter of a Police Chief played by Chris Cooper."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Chris Cooper is a superb actor! Remember him as the neighbor in American Beauty?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Chris is a terrific actor. In Live By Night he's Elle's father, also a moral and virtuous man. He helps maintain the peace while trying to not cause more violence."
"__MOVIES__ So he works with Ben or does he try to stop Ben's character from seizing power in the city territories?"
"__MOVIES__ He really doesn't help or try to get in the way. He basically is telling Ben the areas to operate in, and to not go beyond the borders."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting. So Elle's his daughter in Live By Night, but does she have any prominence in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ She actually plays a big role later on. I want spoil things, but she has a rapid character change."
"__MOVIES__ Did you enjoy the movie? Would you recommend it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think if you enjoy those old 1920's gangster style films and that era of prohibition you'll enjoy it. Overall I thought it was very mediocre movie that could have been executed better, but I was entertained."
