"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Les Miserables?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean the one with Hugh Jackman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one. It also starred Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see it. Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was fantastic but then again I really like musicals."
"__MOVIES__ It was a musical? I didn't know Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe could sing."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't either until I saw the movie. Apparently Hugh Jackman was on Broadway in his early career."
"__MOVIES__ What about Russell Crow? I just can't imagine him singing."
"__MOVIES__ There was a little bit of controversy over his singing. You either loved it or hated it."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that he did a great job! His character was Javert who was all about following the rules."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean? Was he like a judge or something?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he was like a policeman. He was very unhappy and legalistic and his voice was strained but that just made it seem authentic."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you mean because he was an uptight kind of guy."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! He was trying to catch Hugh Jackman's character because he thought a man could never change and once a criminal he would always be a criminal."
"__MOVIES__ What was the character's name that Hugh Jackman played?"
"__MOVIES__ Jean Val Jean was the name of the character. He was a criminal but he had been shown mercy by a priest and had really become a new person."
"__MOVIES__ So Javert had no mercy or compassion and just hunted criminals to bring them to justice?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and in the end he had so much bitterness and hatred inside that he actually committed suicide."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! That's really sad. It's too bad no one had shown him mercy."
