"__THRILLER__ What did you think of Idris Elba's performance in No Good Deed?"
"__THRILLER__ I think he was great. I can't say the same about the movie, though."
"__THRILLER__ I guess that means you didn't like it? I thought it was good."
"__THRILLER__ It started off okay, but it missed the mark in a few areas for me."
"__THRILLER__ Like where?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, I thought that around the end it was too convenient how Henson's character escaped being tied up."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, you mean how the broken glass was within reach for her?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I think it would have been better if her daughter came in a untied her. The girl was just a prop in the whole movie."
"__THRILLER__ Maybe. I still liked it."
"__THRILLER__ I liked it, too. It just had some bad writing."
