"__MUSIC__ Hey, so what do you think of Snoop Dogg?"
"__MUSIC__ He's the best rap artist of all time, that's what!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I totally agree!  He's done so many amazing things besides just make music, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think I even heard he's written a kid's book."
"__MUSIC__ I think he has.  But either way, he's been in movies, on television shows, and has continued to make great music."
"__MUSIC__ I swear, his albums are some of the only ones I know of that I can listen to straight through."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Doggystyle was definitely the best."
"__MUSIC__ Doggystyle was amazing but his others have been amazing too."
"__MUSIC__ Even some of his newer stuff like Vapors and Midnight Love has a totally different sound but is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I heard those, they are great!"
"__MUSIC__ And his music videos play like mini-movies, they are awesome too."
"__MUSIC__ He's just a genius.  Everything he's done is brilliant."
"__MUSIC__ I actually saw him live in Fresno, California back in 2003 or so.  It was the Up In Smoke tour."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, seriously?  How was that!"
"__MUSIC__ It was awesome!  It was a really small venue so I could see him pretty up close."
"__MUSIC__ I bet it was amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the sound was a little strange just being live hip hop music, but it was still awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I would've loved to see him in person."
"__MUSIC__ I bet he's still touring, isn't he?"
"__MUSIC__ At some point he may.  I don't know."
