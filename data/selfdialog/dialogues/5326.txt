"__STAR_WARS__ This Star Wars stuff, the movies, how do I watch them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean in what order?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, they are really confusing, the old ones, the new ones, the newer new ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I would watch them how they were made to be watched, in order of release, the way the plot plays favors that order."
"__STAR_WARS__ The plot, what is the plot, on a whole of all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is complex, but could be brought down to a fight between dark and light, good and evil. And lasers."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so, I only know a little."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the force is everything, in the movies, it is good, it is bad, it is all. All the films struggle with the aftermath of finding a balance of that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like the Luke guy trying to kill the Vader guy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That, no that never happen, not really. He wanted to save Vader more than kill."
