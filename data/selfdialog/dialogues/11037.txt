"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! I got two tickets to the big game this weekend. Wanna go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, which teams are playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas Cowboys and The New England Patriots! This game is gonna be sweet! Cowboys are definitely gonna win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt that! Watch Tom Brady take this game as usual."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm gonna get ready for the big game tonight. The Oakland Raiders against The New York Giants. Hands down on Oakland taking the win tonight.q"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli Manning has nothing on Derek Carr! His skills just don't match up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, the Giants ALWAYS take home the game! Come over and let's see whose team wins!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like a plan, I'll be over there by 8."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah! Seattle Seahawks against the Pittsburgh Steelers tomorrow night. Who do you think is gonna win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding? That's not even a question, Seattle Seahawks. Have you seen how well Russel Wilson has been playing lately?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but, Ben Ben Roethlisberger has been throwing down such powerful throws lately. I think Steelers would win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, let's see who wins tomorrow then, shall we?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The game is about to come on! Are you going to watch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been so busy lately, I don't even know which teams are playing tonight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Green Bay Packers and the Denver Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see how well The Green Bay Packers are doing? Aaron Rodgers has such speed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree. I think the Broncos might win this one though. Rodgers' speed is no match for Trevor Siemian's skills!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey who's playing the game this weekend?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers. This is going to be such a great game. I'm excited to see how well Carson Wentz improved."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's gotten better but not as good as Brian Hoyer. Watch the 49ers take this game this time."
