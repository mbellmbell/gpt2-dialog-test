"__BASEBALL__ Who are the best starting pitchers in the league right now?"
"__BASEBALL__ Loaded question. If you go by stats right now Ervin Santana is dominating."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah must be back on the stuff."
"__BASEBALL__ He was always up and down with the Angels but when he gets dialed in he's tough to hit."
"__BASEBALL__ He'll come back down to earth."
"__BASEBALL__ For my money I still ride with the proven guys like Scherzer, Bumgarner, etc."
"__BASEBALL__ What's with Greinke?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah Greinke's numbers haven't been great since moving to AZ. He's not getting lit up though."
"__BASEBALL__ Sabathia actually isn't terrible this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Not as terrible as he was, but still past his expiration date IMO. Yankees need some SP help."
"__BASEBALL__ Agree. Wang doesn't look good either."
"__BASEBALL__ Wang?"
"__BASEBALL__ LOL Tanaka I mean. Not Wang."
"__BASEBALL__ They'll be in the market at the deadline most likely, need something."
"__BASEBALL__ Who's even available for SP's?"
"__BASEBALL__ Won't know until some teams fall out of contention. Chatwood would be a target but Rockies are winning ballgames."
"__BASEBALL__ Always liked Chatwood, never got to see him come up to the Angels before he got traded."
"__BASEBALL__ He's one of those guys where you look at what he's done in Colorado and think maybe he'd be even better on my team."
"__BASEBALL__ So who else is available besides Chatwood though?"
"__BASEBALL__ IDK I'd look at guys who are free agents at the end of the year and are on teams that might tank."
