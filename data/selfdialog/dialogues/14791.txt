"__ACTION__ The most recent Indiana Jones movie was just awful."
"__ACTION__ i remember seeing it at the theater when it came out and wondering what they were thinking."
"__ACTION__ It was just a bad plot.  Aliens?  Come on now."
"__ACTION__ It didn't help that they made it so unrealistic."
"__ACTION__ Which part are you referring to?"
"__ACTION__ Well, take your pick, but I mean the nuke scene."
"__ACTION__ Oh, the one where he hid in the fridge?"
"__ACTION__ Yep, that's the one.  Completely ridiculous."
"__ACTION__ To me, that pretty much signaled the end of the Indiana Jones ever being in danger."
"__ACTION__ Agreed.  Kind of takes the mystery out of it."
