"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you remember the scene in the Sorcerer's Stone when Harry puts on the sorting hat?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah! He almost gets sorted into Slytherin right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah! But then the hat decides to put him in Gryffindor."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just like his parents James and Lilly!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What house do you think you'd be sorted into?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think I would be Ravenclaw because I love to read. How about you?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Slytherin I think because I'm not nice enough to be a Gryffindor."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? I think you'd be a Hufflepuff like Cedric Diggory."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Maybe! What does it mean to be a Hufflepuff?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It means you are a loyal friend!"
