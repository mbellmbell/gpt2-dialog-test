"__FASHION__ Isn't it funny how popular flannel is again?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, it's just like the 90s."
"__FASHION__ I owned something like 20 flannel shirts."
"__FASHION__ Wow!  I maybe had five."
"__FASHION__ Back then, it was all about grunge rock."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, grunge rockers in Seattle and their flannel shirts."
"__FASHION__ I think they just wore them because they were cheap."
"__FASHION__ I think so.  It's not clear why they're so popular now."
"__FASHION__ Maybe people are inspired by Duck Dynasty."
"__FASHION__ Ha!  I doubt it!"
"__FASHION__ Maybe the fashion industry just started prompting the shirts themselves."
"__FASHION__ That would make sense."
"__FASHION__ You know what else was popular in the 90s?"
"__FASHION__ What?"
"__FASHION__ Baggy jeans."
"__FASHION__ That's the opposite of the way things are now."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I can't believe the skinny jeans some people fit into."
"__FASHION__ I think they'd be really uncomforable."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, life is too short for skinny jeans."
"__FASHION__ Agreed."
