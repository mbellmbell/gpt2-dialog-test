"__MOVIES__ What are some movies that you really liked watching growing up?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man. I have a lot of those."
"__MOVIES__ Pick two and tell me about them."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I really liked the Ace Ventura movies."
"__MOVIES__ What are those about? I haven't heard of them."
"__MOVIES__ They're about this crazy guy played by Jim Carrey that loves animals, but is really vulgar and silly."
"__MOVIES__ That kind of sounds like a Monty Python skit."
"__MOVIES__ It's really the same kind of humor."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, nice! I love that kind of humor."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, Jim Carrey does a great job with his role. He's very funny and wild."
"__MOVIES__ What's the other movie that comes to mind?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked The Secret of Nimh a lot."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that one either."
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty good, though it's a cartoon."
"__MOVIES__ What's that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ This one is about rats and mice that have been experimented on."
"__MOVIES__ That's an interesting idea. Are they still normal or what?"
"__MOVIES__ They become super intelligent and create a whole city underground."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, that's wild!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the rats are pretty scary in the movie and have electric spears."
