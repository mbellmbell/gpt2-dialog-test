"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you see Guardians of the Galaxy 2 yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it last weekend with my sister!"
"__MOVIES__ Cool! What'd you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was even better than the first one!"
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think the characters were more rounded in this one."
"__MOVIES__ I dunno, I thought the first one was funnier for sure."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, the first one had its moment, but this one had baby Groot."
"__MOVIES__ Okay yes, baby Groot was super cute!"
"__MOVIES__ And funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Remember that part when he dragged a desk out?"
"__MOVIES__ And Rocket was like, 'I told you 'this' big!'"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, yeah, it was super funny."
"__MOVIES__ Did you remember to watch the end credit scenes?"
"__MOVIES__ As in plural?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there were like four credit scenes in this one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh shoot, what where they about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, one of them featured a teenage Groot."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that sounds hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess that means you gotta go again!"
