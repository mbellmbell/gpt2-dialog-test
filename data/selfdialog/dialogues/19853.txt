"__MOVIES__ I watched a really wacky movie last night you should check out."
"__MOVIES__ What is its name?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called 'Zombeavers.'"
"__MOVIES__ What type of movie is that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a B Horror film."
"__MOVIES__ Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not a 'good' movie but it is very entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ What's so entertaining about it?"
"__MOVIES__ As a Hoosier, I appreciated that they make a lot of jokes about one girl not knowing facts about beavers because all people from Indiana are supposed to know beaver trivia."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty goofy."
"__MOVIES__ There's also an amazing song that plays over the credits."
"__MOVIES__ What song is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's an original song that rehashes the premise and plot of the movie, in a Sinatra jazz style."
"__MOVIES__ That seems like an odd way to spend what I'm guessing was a low budget. Would I know anyone in the film?"
"__MOVIES__ John Mayer is in it, believe it or not."
"__MOVIES__ The singer? I didn't know that he acted."
"__MOVIES__ It was his first role, and it's pretty small."
"__MOVIES__ Did he sing the credits song?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't believe so."
"__MOVIES__ Oh well. I might check it out."
