"__SUPERHERO__ Are you a Marvel fan or DC?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I like both but I prefer Marvel."
"__SUPERHERO__ Same here. What's your favorite Marvel movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I would have to say Captain America: Civil War."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh really? Mine too! I loved how they introduced Black Panther, and I can't wait for that movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me neither. Did you know T'Challa has the highest IQ of all the Marvel Universe except Reed Richards?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Wow, and that's a big deal because he's super smart."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know, and he's richer than Tony Stark."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right, I did know that. That battle scene at the airport at the end of the movie was epic."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes it was! That's my favorite part. I must have rewound that part at least 3 times the first time I watched it."
