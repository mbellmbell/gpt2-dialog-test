"__FASHION__ Did you see the gowns at the Met Gala this year?"
"__FASHION__ I did! Who was your favorite?"
"__FASHION__ I thought that Rihanna looked amazing. She wore the designer being honored, you know."
"__FASHION__ She did make an impact, but her look was too much for me. I preferred the simpler looks, like Gisele."
"__FASHION__ But the designer is all about crazy looks, and Gisele was so boring!"
"__FASHION__ Simple, but not boring! Her metallic gown was so beautiful."
"__FASHION__ No, I still think that it was boring. Who were some of your other favorites?"
"__FASHION__ Dakota Johnson looked beautiful too."
"__FASHION__ I don't remember her look. What did it look like?"
"__FASHION__ She wore a black dress with these shoulders that puffed up."
"__FASHION__ Oh, right, I remember that one now. That was a nice look too."
"__FASHION__ Who were your other favorites?"
"__FASHION__ I thought Zendaya looked amazing--not as outrageous as some, but her dress made a bold statement."
"__FASHION__ I don't remember her. What did she wear?"
"__FASHION__ She wore this orange gown with giant parrots on it."
"__FASHION__ That sounds interesting. Did you see Solange?"
"__FASHION__ I did! She looked like she was wearing a giant sleeping bag, but it was fun."
"__FASHION__ You're right, it did look like a sleeping bag!"
"__FASHION__ Some of the looks were really crazy this year."
"__FASHION__ Yes, some of them really were."
