"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Rey and Fin will end up together?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, I guess there is always a chance.  I think the more important question is, 'should they?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Can you elaborate?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I just think that their dynamic in 'The Force Awakens' was great without the romance.  It could maybe detract from the story."
"__STAR_WARS__ But they have so much chemistry."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, but I would rather they focus on the hero's journey in itself rather than romantic entanglements."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I see your point.  By the way, do you think Fin will be okay after the last movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm sure he will be, but he did get severely injured."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wouldn't be surprised if his rehabilitation takes a while."
"__STAR_WARS__ Good point.  He may be at a disadvantage physically during the second movie of the sequel trilogy."
