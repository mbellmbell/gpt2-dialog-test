"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Coldplay?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard that name in a long time. I don't like his music."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really know anyone that does anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like it doesn't appeal to the younger crowds at all."
"__MUSIC__ In my opinion, his type of music has evolved beyond his abilities."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, still you have to give credit for the success he's had."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. At the time I don't think there was anything like it."
"__MUSIC__ Any time people push musical boundaries is respectable, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if he still makes new music."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. I haven't heard of anything."
"__MUSIC__ The closest I get to that type of music is deadmau5."
"__MUSIC__ That's another person who really was unique when he came out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think the mouse mask is what pushed him to the next level."
"__MUSIC__ Totally. That's some genius branding."
"__MUSIC__ It's unmistakable. I guess it doesn't hurt that his music is really beautiful, too."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever listen to 'Faxing Berlin' by him?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I remember the first time I heard that song. I had never heard anything like it."
"__MUSIC__ It's too bad so many people have stolen his sound."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. It's a bit watered down now."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, but I still enjoy it when I'm just trying to relax."
