"__BEATLES__ Hey what do you think about the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ I think they're one of the icons in the music industry."
"__BEATLES__ it's amazing to see in some videos, when they performed some many years ago, the stage was pretty bare, unlike performers we see today."
"__BEATLES__ I agree and their songs are very simple. You know the well known ones like Yesterday, Hey Jude and many others."
"__BEATLES__ I thought it's cool that the movie That Thing You do, the song was made to sound like Beatles' at least in my opinion they do."
"__BEATLES__ I can't remember which song but I know the song was so short, like maybe only two minutes when maybe Paul or John were recording in the studio they tried to add stuff to the intro, play a bit of harmonica solo or something to lengthen the song enough to be recorded."
"__BEATLES__ Wow yeah i can't remember what song it was but i remember reading about it too."
"__BEATLES__ I like McCartney even collaborated with modern artist like Michael Jackson."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah i like that one duet they did together. What song was it?"
"__BEATLES__ The girl is mine."
