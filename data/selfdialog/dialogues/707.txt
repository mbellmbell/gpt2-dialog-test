"__MUSIC__ I always thought 2Pac was better than Biggie."
"__MUSIC__ You're crazy man, Biggie was an amazing rapper."
"__MUSIC__ I think you're crazy man. Do you see the longevity Pac's discography? it's insane!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah its a lot of filler man."
"__MUSIC__ Filler? Are you insane dude. A lot of it is grade A material."
"__MUSIC__ Yes filler. Biggie didn't have any of that."
"__MUSIC__ That's because he had two records. You can count them, two!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but they were both classics."
"__MUSIC__ His second album wasn't a classic. If it has Puffy talking in the background."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, well Puffy added to the songs."
"__MUSIC__ Puffy was awful man, he added too many dumb things to the song."
"__MUSIC__ Enough about puffy. It's about Pac and Biggie. Biggie was way better."
"__MUSIC__ Biggie's was good, don't get me wrong. But he never had the emotions that Pac had"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah ill give you that, but biggie had a better flow and rhyme sceme."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, i'll give you that. I also think Pac had a bigger global impact on everyone. Look at the popular rappers out, they're influenced by him."
"__MUSIC__ Name some. I dont hear it in radio."
"__MUSIC__ I can name two prominent ones. J Cole and Kendrick Lamar."
"__MUSIC__ Oh true, that's very true."
"__MUSIC__ So you're getting my point now?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah 2pac might be better."
