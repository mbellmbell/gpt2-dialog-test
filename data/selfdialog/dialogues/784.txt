"__MUSIC__ Hey quick question."
"__MUSIC__ Sure shoot."
"__MUSIC__ If you could learn to play any instrument what would it be?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd want to learn to play the guitar the most I think."
"__MUSIC__ What makes you want to play that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I think having a piano is a bit much. I can't carry it around and they can be expensive."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, with a guitar I can bring it around, play songs, and maybe even get a couple of tips while doing it."
"__MUSIC__ Ha. You mean like begging for change?"
"__MUSIC__ Musicians don't beg for change man. They just are practicing playing for large crowds."
"__MUSIC__ Never thought of it that way actually."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's a good way to get over a far of playing infront of people."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure some do it for money though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh of course, but I'm sure they all start off trying to get over a fear of playing in front of people."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ What about you? What instrument would you want to learn?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd go for the piano."
"__MUSIC__ Why, it's way too much work."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, when you brought up your reasons those did stand out but I still like the instrument enough to deal with that downsides."
"__MUSIC__ You're a better man than me."
