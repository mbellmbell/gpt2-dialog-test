"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Nothing on the radio really, mainly alternative and J-pop or J-rock."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I know a couple of those!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really? What ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to UVERworld? They were pretty popular for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I do! I really like them."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I haven't heard anything new from them in a while though, have you?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think so. They had a new single like 6 months ago, but that was it."
"__MUSIC__ Aw, thats a shame. What other bands do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, I like Sawano Hiroyuki's vocal stuff a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Someone that does soundtracks for shows, but does a lot of normal rock/pop songs in those soundtracks. Those are amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, thats interesting. Anyone else?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite band was School Food Punishment, but they broke up several years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Oh no! Thats the worst when that happens."
"__MUSIC__ For real, I couldn't even listen to their music for a while after cause it was too sad."
"__MUSIC__ Are you finally able to listen to them again?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, haha. I haven't listened to them a lot though, I should go back through all their songs again sometime."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we can listen to some together! I want to know what they sound like now."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that sounds fun!"
