"__THRILLER__ What was the name of that movie from the 90's where the nanny terrorizes the house?"
"__THRILLER__ The Hand That Rocks The Cradle?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, that's the one! It was on television last night."
"__THRILLER__ That was a pretty solid movie. I usually watch it if it happens to be on television as well."
"__THRILLER__ Rebecca DeMornay was so evil in the film!"
"__THRILLER__ She really was. She did a good job of controlling her rage and facial expressions, but you still could feel her seething underneath it all."
"__THRILLER__ The ending, when Annabella Sciorra and Rebecca DeMornay are fighting in the attic was incredible!"
"__THRILLER__ It seemed to go on forever! I remember the first time I watched the movie, the anxiety was killing me."
"__THRILLER__ Me too, that was intense!"
"__THRILLER__ I almost think it went on just a tad too long!"
