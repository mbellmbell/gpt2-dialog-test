"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, do you remember Jabba the Hutt's palace?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The one from Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, where they were using Han Solo as a decoration."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I remember it.  What about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think Jabba built it there?  The planet is a desert, and he is basically a giant slug."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think he would have liked a wet planet better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wouldn't that make more sense?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, he was a gangster, and the Empire seemed to ignore Tattoine."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think he was basically using it as a low key hideout?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe.  Might make for a nice spinoff movie.  How did Jabba end up there in the first place?"
