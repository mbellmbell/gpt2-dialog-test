"__HARRY_POTTER__ There's a Harry Potter Marathon on today! Squee!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh my God, I love HP marathon days. What number are they on now?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right now, number 3. Prisoner of Azkaban."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah! My favorite is up next!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why is Goblet of Fire your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's so exciting, and sad all at the same time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it's one of my favorites as well. I love it when they get to the Triwizard Tournament scenes."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And the part in the graveyard when Cedric Diggory dies. Ugh, makes me cry every time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Looks like an HP and pajama type of day. Wanna come over and join me on the couch?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Um, yeah! I'll bring my pjs and some snacks!"
