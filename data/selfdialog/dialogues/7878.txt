"__POP__ I was reading an article about the band 5th Harmony yesterday about why they're not changing their name."
"__POP__ Why would they want to change it anyways?"
"__POP__ Well, one of the members left for a solo career, so there's only four in the band now."
"__POP__ And they didn't want to change it to Four Harmonies?"
"__POP__ No, they said it's their brand. The fans helped pick the name, and it's what they're used to."
"__POP__ Maybe they will get a new member?"
"__POP__ It didn't say they were looking for someone. They just figured out a corny angle to it."
"__POP__ What was corny?"
"__POP__ They said since the fans named them, the fans would be the fifth member."
"__POP__ Well, at least they appreciate their fans."
