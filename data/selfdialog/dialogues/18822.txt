"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the Scream movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I only saw the first two though."
"__MOVIES__ Why didn't you see them all?"
"__MOVIES__ It got repetitious after a while."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one was good, but it should have ended at that."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I see."
"__MOVIES__ Why make it a trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, actually they did make a fourth."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they didn't need that one either."
"__MOVIES__ I guess not."
"__MOVIES__ The first one was great.  It was a new type of horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the others weren't as good.  I see what you are saying."
"__MOVIES__ And then there were other movies that did the same thing."
"__MOVIES__ Like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer?'"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  That didn't need a sequel either."
"__MOVIES__ Which did you like more?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably 'I Know What You Did Last Summer.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's because you are a Jennifer Love fan."
"__MOVIES__ Probably.  But Scream wasn't nearly as good."
