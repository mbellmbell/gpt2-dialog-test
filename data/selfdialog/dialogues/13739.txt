"__BASKETBALL__ did you see the warriors/spurs game yesterday?"
"__BASKETBALL__ yeah, I can't believe Golden State came back"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Kawhi Leonard injury killed San Antonio"
"__BASKETBALL__ They can't compete without him"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, there's no way they can win this series if he can't go"
"__BASKETBALL__ They'll be lucky to win a single game"
"__BASKETBALL__ Even without him though, there's no way they should have lost that game"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it was one of the largest blown leads in playoff history"
"__BASKETBALL__ Golden State is too good to simply give games away like that"
"__BASKETBALL__ Game 2 is probably a must win now"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah it's hard to see anyone beating Golden State four times in five games"
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed. But San Antonio can never be counted out"
"__BASKETBALL__ Still, if Leonard can come back, the Spurs can definitely hang with Golden State"
"__BASKETBALL__ maybe, but it's hard to see Golden State playing as poorly as they did for the first two and a half quarters"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's pretty clear the Spurs can't really guard Golden State"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Warriors were getting just about any shot they wanted over the last quarter and a half"
"__BASKETBALL__ Still, Leonard is the key"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he can create his own shot and at least give San Antonio a chance on defense"
"__BASKETBALL__ It was amazing how out of sorts Golden State looked in the first half"
"__BASKETBALL__ It'll be interesting to see how much of that was San Antonio's defense and how much was Golden State simply playing poorly"
