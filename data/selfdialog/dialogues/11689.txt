"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am in the mood for some football!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! Will the NFL ever return?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like it has been gone for such a long time! We are getting close at least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am excited to start having my Detroit Lions watch parties again. You will have to come over this Fall!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did not know you did that, I would love to come!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea we just grill out here at the house and watch the Lions play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like a great time, count me in this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Awesome! Speaking of the Lions, what kind of team do you think we will have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My hopes are high! I am pretty excited about where we are right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being a Lions fan has been painful over the years, so I am keeping my hopes in check."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can understand that; although I think we finally have the parts to make a decent run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Matthew Stafford and some of our other pieces. I am just hoping they come together the right way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Jim Caldwell knows what he is doing, so I am confident."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like in order for us to really become a contender, we have to get better on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you there. We can not simply be in the middle of the pack in every category and expect to make a run!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We need to get better at linebacker first and foremost!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I am hopeful that rookie Jarrad Davis can be the answer there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He will really have to play well in order for us to get back to the playoffs in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Our depth has been an issue for quite some time!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I wished the front office would really address that in the coming years."
