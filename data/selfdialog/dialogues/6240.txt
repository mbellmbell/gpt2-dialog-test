"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the original Star Wars movies or the new one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess being older I like the original ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Boba Fett"
"__STAR_WARS__ Boba Fett? Really why Boba Fett? Although he is a prime character he never says anything?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, That is why I like him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Seriously? Can you explain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure. Darth Vader if narcissist and talks about himself, Luke talks about 'Whoa is me, I'm the victim' and Leya talks about saving the world. Boba Fett is quiet, does his job, and causes no issues."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well that might make sense on a basic level, but you do realize that there is more to the movie than that on a deeper level, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yup but you didn't ask me that?"
