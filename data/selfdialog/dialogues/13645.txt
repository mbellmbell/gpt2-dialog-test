"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which two teams do you want to make it to the SuperBowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really want to see the Patriots and Seahawks rematch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man, it wouldn't even be the same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because Beast Mode isn't on the team anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but they both still have a lot of the same players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just wouldn't want it to be a close game this time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you want to win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would really love for the Seahawks to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just feel like, I want to mix it up, I don't want the Patriots to even make the Playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that to mix things up? Or just because you don't like them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm.. Why can't it be both?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots are a good team though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Talent wise, I guess. I'm just really sick of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if you will get what you want this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not, but I can always hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they will make the playoffs, but lose early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would work for me I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Keep your fingers crossed."
