"__BASKETBALL__ Hey do you think it's fair to say Michael Jordan is the greatest player of all time?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, he is generally regarded as the best of all time. But if he is the greatest, where are all of the rings?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He might not have the most rings but he helped bring Basketball to mainstream America with his crossovers."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Jordan is the most prolific basketball player that was able to do everything, from defense to offense."
"__BASKETBALL__ True.  People can claim that people have done much more impressive things than him, like Wilt Chamberlain's 100, Bill Russell's 11 rings and Kareem's with the most points ever."
"__BASKETBALL__ They even claim that LeBron is near or even on Jordan's level, and that he wouldn't have been that good without Pippen/Rodman,"
"__BASKETBALL__ Shoot. His Airness has created a threshold that players, professional or not, try to reach or recreate."
"__BASKETBALL__ Michael even mentored Kobe and he's without a doubt one of the best players ever to play."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know about all of that.Kobe is and was a ball hog in my opinion."
"__BASKETBALL__ You just don't like Kobe."
"__BASKETBALL__ What is there to like about a selfish player like him?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I wouldn't go that far.  And yes I think it is fair to say Jordan is the best NBA player to ever play the sport."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it's more than fair."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah.  With his ability to do everything and his high flying dunks, I agree."
"__BASKETBALL__ Nowadays, so many new and upcoming players are copying Jordan's dunks."
"__BASKETBALL__ True. You can tell they watch tapes of the man and strive to be like if not better than Jordan."
"__BASKETBALL__ You know some people say though, 'If Jordan was the best player ever, why doesn't he have the scoring title or the most championships?'"
"__BASKETBALL__ This is logic that I've heard before, and it's quite frankly ridiculous."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, me too. I was watching a program last night and they were saying Jordan couldn't win until Bird and Magic declined."
"__BASKETBALL__ I honestly never understood this reasoning. It's like saying 'Kobe wouldn't have won if Prime Jordan was still playing'"
