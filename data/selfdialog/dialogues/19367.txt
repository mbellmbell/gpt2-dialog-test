"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the last Mummy movie yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I have not.  It sounds like an action movie.  Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I was wondering if you would like to go to the movies tonight with me?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see, well tell me about the movie plot first."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is about a team or army of people that basically awaken a mummy from sleep, happens to be evil of course!"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds fun! Alex Kurtzman is the director for this movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think they have made close to $280 million so far on this movie."
"__MOVIES__ The critics have been a little harsh on this one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw the reviews, some were quite bad."
"__MOVIES__ I think I will try this movie with you, and see what I think."
"__MOVIES__ Great, what time do you want me to pick you up?"
"__MOVIES__ How about 7pm? Is that good?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I will head to dinner before hand, if you want to join me for that I can come earlier."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, as long as its quick and cheap!"
"__MOVIES__ Ok! We will head to the restaurant near the movies."
"__MOVIES__ How long is the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It is about 2 hours long"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I do not work tomorrow, so that will be great."
"__MOVIES__ I will pick you up at 5:30!"
"__MOVIES__ See you then!"
