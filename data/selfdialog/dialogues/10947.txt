"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't wait for the upcoming NFL season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't either. It will be here before you know it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are some memorable games from last season that really stand out for you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Super Bowl certainly stands out for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It stands out in NFL history, that's for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers Ravens game on Christmas really stands out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a great game. Steelers looked down and out and Antonio Brown made that memorable play near the end zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He stretched out and clinched a playoff spot by inches. He doesn't get in there, game over, season over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That Chiefs Broncos game really stands out for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The one on Thanksgiving night?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that one. It went back and forth and the Chiefs won in overtime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't that have some crazy thing happen at the end of that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe that's when the field goal banked in off the goal post."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do remember something like that. Speaking of goal posts, remember the Arizona Seattle Sunday night game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish I didn't remember."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. But that was a strange game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It ended in a tie, correct?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe it did. Something like 6-6 or 9-9."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There was some bad field goal kicking in that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certainly was. I don't think there will be a game like that for a long time."
