"__MOVIES__ You're a fan of WWE wrestling, right? Did you see that movie The Marine 5?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen it yet. Why, is there a wrestler in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's a bunch of them in it. The Miz and his wife Maryse, Naomi, and one or two others."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love The Miz and Maryse. They're hilarious! What characters do they play in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The Miz is a military EMT who gets caught up in some warfare, he's the main character of the entire movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see. How was his performance?"
"__MOVIES__ It was mediocre. He wasn't really as engaging as he is in wrestling promos."
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of normal though, especially for a movie that's in its fifth sequel already. You can't expect much."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. But the movie isn't all that bad. It's better than the previous ones, except for the first one."
"__MOVIES__ The first one hard John Cena in it, didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's another big wrestler who has gone to Hollywood, just like Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson."
"__MOVIES__ I'm kind of sick of The Rock. He's in almost every single blockbuster movie these days."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's the Fast and Furious franchise, he did Central Intelligence with Kevin Hart, and so many others."
"__MOVIES__ Now he's doing the Baywatch remake with Zach Efron."
"__MOVIES__ That actually looks kind of funny. I was thinking of seeing that."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it's funny, if you like hearing some more jokes about The Rock's muscles."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway back to the Marine 5, Maryse isn't in it much, she's really just in the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ Who is she in the movie? And what about Naomi?"
"__MOVIES__ Maryse is a girl who is trapped in a car accident, and The Miz rescues her. Naomi just plays a bartender, I think."
"__MOVIES__ Lame."
