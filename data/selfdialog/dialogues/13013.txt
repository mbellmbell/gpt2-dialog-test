"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think of the Super Bowl? Crazy game right?!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was absolutely nuts. I cannot believe that the Falcons let the Patriots back into the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was certain that the Falcons had the game won going into the fourth quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As was I. I feel really bad for Falcons fans around the world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady may be the best quarterback to ever play the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you are right about that. I do not know any other quarterback that could have manufactured a comeback in a game like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When the game went to overtime and the Patriots won the toss I knew that the game was over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Falcon's defense was gassed by then and the Patriots just marched down the field for the win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was at a party watching the game with a couple Falcons fans and they were in complete disbelief."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can imagine so. I would be devasted if that happened to my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel bad for Matt Ryan. He played a great game and now he will be remembered for this loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I agree. I am happy for hi that he won MVP for the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he had a fantastic season and the offense was on fire all year long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did hear that their offensive coordinator is expected to take a head coaching job in Los Angeles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I he is expected to sign with the Los Angeles Rams. Good move you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to say because he had a rough first year in Atlanta but then had a great year this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will have to wait and see how they draft because they have a lot of needs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure do need a lot of depth on both sides of the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am sad the NFL season is over. What will I do on Sundays now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know it always seems like weeks go slower when there is no football. I guess we will just have to wait."
