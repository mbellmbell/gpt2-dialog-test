"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like The Phantom Menace?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nah, it was pretty campy"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was pretty good actually"
"__STAR_WARS__ What? Are you crazy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I thought it had some really cool effects"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought they looked pretty silly"
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus I liked learning about a young Darth Vader"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well his name was Anakin Skywalker at first"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I know, but he did become Darth Vader eventually"
"__STAR_WARS__ Umm, yes I understand"
