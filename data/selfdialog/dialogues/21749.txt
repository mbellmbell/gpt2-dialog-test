"__DISNEY__ I loved watching Disney movies when I was younger."
"__DISNEY__ I still watch them now."
"__DISNEY__ I have a few that I will watch even if the kids are not in the room."
"__DISNEY__ Me too.  And sing along!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, the Disney songs are true Classics."
"__DISNEY__ Every movie has that one song that pulls it together."
"__DISNEY__ But sometime you get real tired of hearing it over and over."
"__DISNEY__ 'would you like to build a snow man?'"
"__DISNEY__ Funny!"
"__DISNEY__ You know you want to sing the rest of it."
