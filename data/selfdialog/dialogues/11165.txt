"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will be tough to repeat last year I reckon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, schedule is much harder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That in itself will probably get them a few more losses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will still probably go 10-6."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  That seems high to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so.  Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the rest of the division all got better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Philly maybe, Washington and the Giants will be the same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, I think they all made improvements."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Dak will have another year as a starter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Defenses will key on him more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he's experienced now and will adapt to the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will still blitz him all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That didn't rile him last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that was last year.  Again, lots more tape to look at."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Cowboys will only get as far as he takes them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, QB play means everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I expect him to make the Pro Bowl again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Competition is tough, so we'll see."
