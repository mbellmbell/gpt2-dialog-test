"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't wait for the football season to get here. Summer will not be over soon enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Baseball is fun for a while but the season just drags on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. In football, the season is much shorter and much more exciting"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think will be the best team this year.?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Da bears!  I heard mike ditka is coming out of retirement to bring the bears back to the promised land."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hah ha. Aren't you a comedian. The bears will have to beat he packers first. And we both know that will not happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not necessarily. Aaron Rodgers is getting older. And Mitch trubisky is the real deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you delirious?  Trubisky was maybe the third best quarterback in the acc last year. And how you think he can win in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certainly. He went to UNC. They develop smart players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh?  You are not smart if you get As in fake classes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever. You know that you are scared of the bears this year.  Probably worried about the Vikings and the lions too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have lost your mind. The packers will dominate the NFC north"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might win a few games at lambeau because the rest of the league is not used to playing in ice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will win 7 of 8 at lambeau and win 5 more on the road for a 12 win season. Then it is on to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will bet you that the packers will not make the playoffs this year. If they do, I will wear a Rodgers jersey for a day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok what size do you wear?  I will be ordering the jersey later today"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wear an extra small. Same as the chance that mike McCarthy survives the season as the coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Doesn't matter who the coach is.  Go pack go!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The pack is wack. I hope they get stuck in godforsaken Green Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not listening to that nonsense. Holler at me when the bears score a touchdown this year."
