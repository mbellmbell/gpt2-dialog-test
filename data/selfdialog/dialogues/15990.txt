"__ROCK__ If you could see one band in concert, who would it be? It can be now or the past."
"__ROCK__ Wow..That is a hard question to narrow down to one band."
"__ROCK__ What about a band still playing?"
"__ROCK__ I would probably choose AC/DC because I had a chance to see them in concert, but something came up and I couldn't go."
"__ROCK__ I've heard they put on a great show live."
"__ROCK__ We ought to look up their schedule and plan a road trip. Who is the band you would like to see?"
"__ROCK__ I always wanted to see Aerosmith. Tyler is a great showman."
"__ROCK__ I saw them years ago and they were incredible. I didn't want it to end."
"__ROCK__ I would love to take a month or so and see as many concerts as possible."
"__ROCK__ What a great idea. Let's start with AC/DC and Aerosmith and go from there."
