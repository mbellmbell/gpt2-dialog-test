"__MUSIC__ Hey man can you please turn that music down i am trying to concentrate i have a test to take in class tomorrow?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't want to turn it down I love music i am a fanatic fan of music i am devoted to all kinds of music."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's nice but i cannot seem to study if you keep blasting that music and that record you are playing right now by Rhianna what is the name of this song? it's really loud."
"__MUSIC__ It's called Umbrella the lyrics are really loud it has the rapper Jay-z starring in it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah she slammed that hit record. I like all of her songs she can really sing and dance."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's nice and it's cool but listening to that loud music isn't going to help me pass my test tomorrow."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you are right but before i turn it down i have to listen to a few more records first. I like this one too it's also by Rhianna Don't stop the music."
"__MUSIC__ It's okay but i like some of her other hit songs how about only girl in the world. Her video wasn't too bad it was mostly just with her performing in it."
"__MUSIC__ You got that right and she had a red wig on and was standing inside this huge field dancing all around in a bunch of flowers."
"__MUSIC__ Then she came out with diamonds was that before or after either way she did great with that song too."
"__MUSIC__ You know she was dating Chris Brown and he brutally beat her up and i did not like that violence is not cool."
"__MUSIC__ I heard about that they were in court quite a few times and that,s not healthy for someone's music career."
"__MUSIC__ But she stayed strong and left Chris alone she didn't let that interfere with her music career."
"__MUSIC__ Nope she continued making her albums she is an out standing artist. and she sings good."
"__MUSIC__ What else was rocking by her oh yeah she also did a song with Chris Brown and Jay-Z."
"__MUSIC__ Until all that nonsense had to happen then she begin seeing drake. I know she made some music with Drake."
"__MUSIC__ Of course she made a few songs with Drake I know one is work another one is What's my name."
"__MUSIC__ Wow you know Drake and Chris Brown had been fighting not good for the music business."
"__MUSIC__ That is all over with I think i listened to enough loud music while also talking to you for a while. So i will turn it down now."
"__MUSIC__ Alright thanks so much i really appreciate the conversation about the music and you finally turning down the music."
