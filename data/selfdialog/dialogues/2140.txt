"__MUSIC__ Man, I miss Biggie Smalls."
"__MUSIC__ You? I miss him and Tupac."
"__MUSIC__ What was you favorite Biggie joint?"
"__MUSIC__ Man, he had so many of them. I like all of his stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Word. Me too."
"__MUSIC__ But for real though, that Life After Death album was tight."
"__MUSIC__ Man, he copied off of Tupac with that joint."
"__MUSIC__ What you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Pac put out a double cd, then here come Biggie doing the same."
"__MUSIC__ But 'Pac did it twice. He did All Eyez on Me and then he did R U Still Down."
"__MUSIC__ R U Still Down came out after he was dead."
"__MUSIC__ But that's because he had already recorded so many tracks it had to be a double cd."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I like Ambitionz of a Rider from that All Eyez on Me joint."
"__MUSIC__ Man I like that whole thing."
"__MUSIC__ Then you got Biggie with Nasty and I got A story To Tell."
"__MUSIC__ Man, both them dudes were the truth."
"__MUSIC__ I know right."
"__MUSIC__ Damn shame Both of them is gone."
"__MUSIC__ Rap game ain't seen nothing like either one of them ever since."
"__MUSIC__ And never will my dude."
