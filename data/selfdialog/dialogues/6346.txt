"__STAR_WARS__ Hey what's your favorite Star Wars movie out of all of them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Including the new ones, you mean? I think Empire Strikes back is the best, but I can't really pick a favorite"
"__STAR_WARS__ As strange as it sounds, I think I liked Revenge of the Sith the best"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Everyone says the prequel movies were really bad"
"__STAR_WARS__ They weren't perfect, but I think Episode III wrapped up that part of the story really well. And it led into the original trilogy, so you saw some of the same characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, did you see Joel Edgerton as Uncle Owen? Too bad that wasn't a bigger role because I like him as an actor"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe if they make an Obi-Wan movie they will have Joel Edgerton come back as Uncle Owen"
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be a great idea. I heard that one of the books had Darth Maul come back and attach Obi-Wan near Owen's home or something"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's awesome, but I also heard that the books don't really have anything to do with the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now that Disney owns Lucasfilm, they're more willing to take risks with the stories. Here's hoping they give this storyline a chance!"
