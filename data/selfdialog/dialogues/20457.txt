"__MOVIES__ Do you like any of the Harry Potter movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do, but only the first and second. They were too complicated after that."
"__MOVIES__ I liked them all. The first and second were great though. Have you seen Emma Watson in 'Beauty and the Beast'?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet. I know she's in it, but I don't think it would be of interest to me."
"__MOVIES__ What movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'When a Stranger Calls'? That's a favorite of mine."
"__MOVIES__ I have! I have seen them both, the older version and the newer version."
"__MOVIES__ I've only seen the newer version, but it is seriously so good."
"__MOVIES__ Can you believe the killer was in the house the entire time and the babysitter had no idea?"
"__MOVIES__ That was crazy. I was nervous that he would hurt the children, but thankfully he didn't."
"__MOVIES__ When the babysitter found the housekeeper dead underwater I got so freaked out!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Same here! That part was scary. The babysitter was smart to hide underwater."
"__MOVIES__ She was, but she stayed inside the house too long. She should've run out as soon as she knew the killer was there."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. I just think it was harder for her because she had to make sure the kids were okay first."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I didn't think of that."
"__MOVIES__ Besides Harry Potter, what other movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the eighties brat pack films. 'The Breakfast Club' is a favorite."
"__MOVIES__ That was a classic. Judd Nelson was hysterical, and Ally Sheedy really did a great job on her character."
"__MOVIES__ I read that Ally Sheedy was having trouble playing her part at first, but got really into it as the filming went on."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I didn't know that. She's a great actress!"
