"__MOVIES__ Was it interesting?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, but even if the story was boring Tom Hanks seems to make every movie he's in good."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I like him."
"__MOVIES__ He really brings life to his character. Sort of like he becomes them."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it wasn't too long?"
"__MOVIES__ Only about an hour and a half."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you couldn't drag a movie out about a plane taking off and having to land right away."
"__MOVIES__ Could you imagine having to land in a river."
"__MOVIES__ I guess he did some quick thinking."
"__MOVIES__ Did it look real in the movie when the plane went down."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, the special effects were pretty neat."
"__MOVIES__ You should see if it's on a pay per view channel."
