"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think about the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wow, that's a big question. Aren't there 8 of them? Which one do you mean?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, which ones are your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought they started getting really good around the third movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Not a fan of the first two?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No. They were boring. The characters are too young to be interesting. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson weren't interesting people until the third movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So the third it is, then?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, the third through the sixth. It started to fall apart after that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, why is that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was far too serious and about the villains by that point, I think. Snape killing Dumbledore was sort of the climax of the series."
