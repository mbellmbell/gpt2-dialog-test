"__ACTION__ Are you going to watch the Transformer: Last Knight?"
"__ACTION__ I might, I'm looking forward to seeing more of Michael Bay's work"
"__ACTION__ he's good with visual effects, isn't he?"
"__ACTION__ yea, he also made the movie 13 hours, do you remember that movie?"
"__ACTION__ No, please remind me"
"__ACTION__ it's about a group of soldiers got stranded in Syria and the efforts and sacrifice they made in order to escape"
"__ACTION__ oh, I think I know what you are talking about, yea, it's pretty intense movie"
"__ACTION__ indeed, sometimes I don't even know if there is any CG elements, I suspect Michale Bay used a lot of practical effects"
"__ACTION__ could be, it certainly feels more organic than the effects in Transformer"
"__ACTION__ indeed"
