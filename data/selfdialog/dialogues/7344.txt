"__LADY_GAGA__ I love Lady Gg's music, don't you?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yup! Have you bought any of it?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah I have her .mp3 albums."
"__LADY_GAGA__ If you get her albums on CD, don't get them from Walmart."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'd never go there anyway, but why shouldn't I?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ They censored her music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, Walmart censors their music to go with their 'family-friendly' status."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I wish I had known that at the time. 'Bad Romance' isn't the same with certain words deleted."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Ha! Well you can also not buy a CD anymore. It's 2017."
"__LADY_GAGA__ At least her music rocks, all of her songs."
