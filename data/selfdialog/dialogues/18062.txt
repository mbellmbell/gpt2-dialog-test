"__MOVIES__ I've been on a big noir kick lately."
"__MOVIES__ I've never really watched a noir film. Do you have any recommendations?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, The Maltese Falcon is a classic. It's based on a Dashell Hammet novel."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard of that one!"
"__MOVIES__ Humphrey Bogart plays the lead, it's really a classic."
"__MOVIES__ So that's a good place to start?"
"__MOVIES__ It's definitely not a bad one. I also like The Petrified Forest."
"__MOVIES__ That one's new to me."
"__MOVIES__ I can't say much about it without giving it away, but the ending is very moving."
"__MOVIES__ What is it you like so much about noir films?"
"__MOVIES__ It's really easy to feel like you've been transported to another time and place. Even the language is different."
"__MOVIES__ So you know a lot of 40s slang then."
"__MOVIES__ Not really! But it just feels different in a way that films today can't be."
"__MOVIES__ So you don't want them to be remade?"
"__MOVIES__ It'd probably be a mistake. What they should really do is adapt more Patricia Highsmith novels."
"__MOVIES__ Do I know anything?"
"__MOVIES__ She wrote the original Strangers On a Train."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it? Very clever premise."
"__MOVIES__ It is. I hope they make more like it."
