"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for football season to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. I still can't get over that Superbowl game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, how the Falcons blew that lead is beyond me. Who are you rooting for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well not the patriots I know that. I think Seattle is going to play big this season. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am hoping the Panthers will come big this year. Cam Newton is definitely talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely. What do you think about Victor Cruz signing with the Bears?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, I don't know, he'll always be a Giant to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Odell definiteyl took his place on the team as the lead receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but he can't do anything if Eli doesn't tighten up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think this is Eli's last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know but I hope he can retire like his brother Peyton with one more Superbowl win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A Superbowl win over Brady would be epic!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Did you get any tickets yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not yet, they haven't released the pre-season schedule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. Who's you favorite rookie this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't really been paying attention to the rookie class this year. Any stand outs to you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Bleacher Report says The 49er's Joe Williams is someone to keep an eye on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does he play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Running back. The Redskins also have a great new rookie running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cool, well it looks like it will be an exciting season."
