"__DISNEY__ Have you ever happen to see the movie Dumbo, which had been made in 1941 by Walt Disney!"
"__DISNEY__ Dumbo, yes i have seen that movie few years ago."
"__DISNEY__ Dumbo was a baby elephant, who was growing up with a circus performing team."
"__DISNEY__ Yes i remember that, Dumbo had quite a larger ears than other elephants right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes thats right, all the time he was thinking its really hard to manage his larger ears."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah i was also wondering why he has such a larger ears when i was watching the movie for the first time."
"__DISNEY__ Everyone thinks the same i guess, his larger ears was noticable all through the movie."
"__DISNEY__ And but it has really inspiring climax, it is such a beautiful story told in a brilliant way!"
"__DISNEY__ You are right, Have you seen it till the end?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes i did, and it gave me goose bumps when the baby Elephant flew using his larger ears as wings!"
