"__SUPERHERO__ The superhero movies out now are so 'modern' and angst ridden. What do you think of an older, classic superhero film like the 1977 Superman, and that series?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I really liked Christopher Reeve's Superman. He had a natural nobility about him that was really admirable."
"__SUPERHERO__ I liked the traditional, old fashioned feel too. The majesty of the opening scenes on Krypton. Using Marlon Brando as Jor-El was reallly cool, added gravity."
"__SUPERHERO__ The music by John Williams just couldn't be beat, either. It was a wonderful experience watching that one."
"__SUPERHERO__ I remember the first time Superman lifts off and flies across the screen, it was so perfect. You really thought they figured out a way for him to fly."
"__SUPERHERO__ Those were the days, when special effects were done with sweat and blood on the set, not just inside a computer."
"__SUPERHERO__ Watching those older superhero movies, knowing how much work went into making the heroes super, I really get a kick out of those."
"__SUPERHERO__ Sometimes I watch the modern superhero films, and I feel like I'm watching Super Mario Bros, the way the CGI heroes bounce around and don't look real at all."
"__SUPERHERO__ That first Hulk movie, the one Ang Lee did. Besides being kind of embarrassing, the Hulk was just awful, he was so plastic."
"__SUPERHERO__ At least the CGI these days is starting to approach realism, when there's enough money. Obvious CGI, you can have it, I'll go watch Christopher Reeve flly again."
