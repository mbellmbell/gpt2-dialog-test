"__DISNEY__ I agree, she's so dark and violent."
"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite part of Sleeping Beauty?"
"__DISNEY__ Actually the ending. When she's dancing with the Prince and her dress is changing colors. You?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked when the fairies gave up and used their magic wands to get the cottage ready."
