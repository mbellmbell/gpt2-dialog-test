"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think is the best part of the Harry Potter series?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know if I could pick! But one of my favorite things is how much Snape loves Lily. It makes me so sad at the same time though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why do you think that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ His love for Lily really dictates how he acts throughout the entire series. Ultimately, all of his actions are to protect Harry because he's the last piece of her that he can ever hold onto."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He does a really good job of hiding that love, though. I just think of when Snape is trying to teach Harry Occlumency and he's being so mean when he goes into his memories."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he was being mean. But Harry is mean too. He gets into Snape's mind and sees some of his earliest memories as well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that Snape really wanted Harry to see some of his earlier memories, especially when he was dying. He pulled them out of his brain in his last minutes and Harry watched them in the Pensieve."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that's one of the defining moments of Snape's character for me. You really get to see what was going on in his brain the entire time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think one of the biggest turning points for me is when Dumbledore gets killed."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think so too. You can tell that he knew he was going to get killed, but he had planned everything out so that it would be okay even after his death."
