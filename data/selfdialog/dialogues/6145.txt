"__STAR_WARS__ So who do you think is the worst character of all time in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Man, that's easy it has to be Jar Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see where you would think that he is the worst one but I have to disagree I would think that Jabba The Hut is the worst."
"__STAR_WARS__ What? Man you are crazy Jabba the Hut is one of the best characters in Star Wars,"
"__STAR_WARS__ How do you figure that, he's just a big blob of jello that cannot even speak english."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's like the Tony Soprano of Star Wars, he cannot even move and people and aliens fear him"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay I can see where you are coming from and I do agree that Jar Jar is a tool"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly he runs around like a chicken with his head cut off and doesn't really contribute except by accident"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe I should have asked what your favorite character was instead lol"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh well there is always next time."
