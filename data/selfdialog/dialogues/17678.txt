"__MOVIES__ My mom has never seen The Departed! I can't believe it."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen it either."

"__MOVIES__ Really? I don't know much about it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It's one of Martin Scorsese's best films."
"__MOVIES__ So it's like a gangster film?"

"__MOVIES__ Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Everybody! Jack Nicholson, Math Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen.."
"__MOVIES__ That's a lot of great actors!"
"__MOVIES__ You bet! I think it's Leo's best work honestly."
"__MOVIES__ I'm surprised I haven't seen it before."
"__MOVIES__ You should definitely watch it. It's so good."
"__MOVIES__ When did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ 2006 I believe."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, so it's not so old."
"__MOVIES__ No, not at all. And it's still holds up really well."
"__MOVIES__ Is it long?"
