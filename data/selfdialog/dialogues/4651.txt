"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of Adele lately."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? How come? Were you just in the mood?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I was because Adele sings the best love songs on the planet."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! Which one's are your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ So many! I would have to say Hello and Someone Like You."
"__MUSIC__ I love those songs too! But they're so sad."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. But she has sung plenty of uptempo, happy songs too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? I didn't know that. Like what for example?"
"__MUSIC__ Send My Love is a fun song, for example."
"__MUSIC__ I could be wrong, but isn't that also about heartbreak?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, sure. But it's also about moving on and forgiveness."
