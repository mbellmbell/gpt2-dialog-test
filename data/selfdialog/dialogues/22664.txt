"__DISNEY__ So what did you think about Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ I was really surprised that Anna was more a main character than Elsa."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that was odd but Oloaf was my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Definatly. He was so funny. Some things he said when he was dreaming about summer."
"__DISNEY__ Or when kristoff said 'I'm going to tell him'"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that was funny too."
"__DISNEY__ I still don't understand how all of a sudden she could contol her power at the end."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that was odd. And every one in the kingdom had turned on her and then poof everything is back to normal."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah oh well I still think it was a good movie."
"__DISNEY__ Meh. There was too much singing and all the songs get stuck in my head."
