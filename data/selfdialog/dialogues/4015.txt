"__MUSIC__ I heard you hate John Phillip Sousa."
"__MUSIC__ Duh. He's one of the worst composers I've ever come across."
"__MUSIC__ Why? Everyone loves him. His music is so patriotic!"
"__MUSIC__ Is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes?"
"__MUSIC__ Is it patriotic, or is it a march that was LATER turned into patriotic because people used it at concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ It's both--he did write these intentionally for a touring American band."
"__MUSIC__ Right, but it's a march. It's not outwardly patriotic."
"__MUSIC__ What bugs you the most about him?"
"__MUSIC__ Stars and Stripes Forever. I hate that march."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the supposed super-difficult piccolo solo is so easy that high schoolers can play it, and on any instrument. It's not hard."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe it's just nostalgiac."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. But it's overplayed."
"__MUSIC__ How much have you played it?"
"__MUSIC__ I was touring in Europe with a band, and we played it at every concert. And in undergrad, we did an all-Sousa concert."
"__MUSIC__ My God. Even I think that's torture."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was pretty excruciating."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry you had to live through that."
"__MUSIC__ I avoid his music at all costs now."
