"__MOVIES__ Did you see the movie Takers?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. That was my joint."
"__MOVIES__ Which do you think was better, Takers or Heat?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Heat with Al Pacino and Robert Dinero?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ I think Heat was better."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Why you say it was better?"
"__MOVIES__ Because it was more realistic. It had me thinking about that bank robbery out there in California some years back."
"__MOVIES__ I know right. Takers seemed a little bit unrealistic."
"__MOVIES__ You must be talking about when they blew the hole in the street?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. You know dang well ain't nobody blowing up no street in the middle of the day."
"__MOVIES__ I know right. Plus T I was a little creepy dude, little scheming snake."
"__MOVIES__ What you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ You ain't going to prison and running your mouth to the Russians and then planning a big heist like that."
"__MOVIES__ I know right. And for him to even be dealing with them, he was selling his boys out."
"__MOVIES__ All because he went to jail and his man took his girl. Dudes always trippin' over a woman."
"__MOVIES__ In Heat, you see the bull Chris had a rider. They went to get him and she secretly let him know that it was a setup."
"__MOVIES__ Now she was a real rider."
"__MOVIES__ But really though, I watch either one of them whenever I see they are on cable."
"__MOVIES__ Me too my dude."
