"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which Deathly Hallows do you think was better?  The first or second."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think the first one was."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree, there was the story lesson about the Hallows themselves."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, the last movie was great especially the battle.  But it seemed to be all battle."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know what you mean, it was like a huge cool battle but not many plot devices."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Except wasn't that the one where Snape revealed his memories?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes it was, easily one of the best scenes in the entire series."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also liked the part where Nevel killed the snake."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was great, Nevel became a total hero."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just like they always said don't sleep on anyone."
