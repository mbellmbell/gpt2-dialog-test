"__MOVIES__ So Kristy and I went to go see that one new movie last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't think of the name of it; ya know, the one with Chris Pratt?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! Guardians of the Galaxy 2? How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was surprisingly decent, I didn't actually see the first one, though."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean you didn't see the first one? Why would you watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Kristy really wanted to see it and I figured it'd be a nice night out.  I'll probably watch the first one though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's really into those comic book movies, isn't she?"
"__MOVIES__ Mhm, she is. She practically started drooling when the trailer for that 'Logan' movie came out."
"__MOVIES__ Of course, I thought that movie was pretty awesome myself."
"__MOVIES__ We still haven't seen it. I think she's upset with me about it."
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah, no kidding! That movie was great!"
"__MOVIES__ Dude I'm really not a fan of movies, but Doctor Strange? That movie was insane!"
"__MOVIES__ Man, that looked really good."
"__MOVIES__ It was, we saw it when it released in 3D? I thought my head would explode!"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't watch it cuz it has that one actor... uh... Kidneystone Pumpkinpatch?"
"__MOVIES__ Been a Duck Cucumberbatch?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the guy that played in Sherlock."
"__MOVIES__ Well he actually did a good job. You need to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good, man."
