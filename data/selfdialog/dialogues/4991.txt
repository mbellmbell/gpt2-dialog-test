"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Are there any rumors yet about 'Fast 9?'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There are a few details.  For instance, Vin Diesel and The Rock are set to reprise their roles."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's cool, but I'm actually surprised."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How so?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Didn't they not get along during the shooting of the movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I did hear something like that.  Apparently they had a feud but were cordial to each other on set."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I suppose as long as you can work with the person, it's fine.  What was the feud even about?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There was a rumor that it was about who would have the bigger role.  The Rock apparently conceded."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So there was a chance that 'Fate of the Furious' could have been about Hobbs, The Rock's character, going bad instead."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That would have been just as fun to watch.  And as a former cop, Hobbs would have been more interesting."
