"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite team in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have loved the Green Bay Packers since I was a kid, what about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's awesome! I'm a huge Detroit Lions fan, so it looks like we are rivals!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being a Lions fan is rough, so I commend you on your loyalty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's a been a tough go of it, but I think we are getting better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too, although your head coach needs to be fired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most fans agree with you and I think Caldwell will be fired if we don't win a playoff game next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's been forever since you've won one, so it might be a longshot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We haven't won since we have been in the NFC North, so that tells you how long it's been."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you guys are tough opponents and I always looking forward to our games twice a year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be nice to see you at least three times, right? How great would a Lions/Packers playoff be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh it would be awesome, especially since I think we are the top two teams of the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not much competition there, have you seen the Bears lately?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Vikings didn't do much better this season, but really both our teams are one injury away from looking like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! I couldn't believe that Teddy Bridgewater injury at training camp, he is so young and talented!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope for the sake of their franchise and our division he returns healthy, because I'm tired of Sam Bradford."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe that Vikings fans think he is so talented! He is so overrated!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he is! He is nothing more than a systems quarterback with no pocket presence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Beyond that, he never seems like much of a leader in the huddle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if that was because he was new, or if he has a hard time gaining the offense's respect?"
