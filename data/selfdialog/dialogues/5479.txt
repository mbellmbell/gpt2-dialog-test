"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, what do you think about Jar Jar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ As little as possible! I don't think he was quite as bad as people say, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, did you like him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really, I just think some people took their dislike a little too seriously. They overthought it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't you feel that he was over the top?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but he also fit the youthful theme on the first prequel. I think each movie had it's own feel."
"__STAR_WARS__ How So?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Episode one was childhood, Episode two was our teen years. Episode 3 was becoming an adult."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, now you are overthinking things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe so, but if you evaluate them individually, they work a lot better than if you compare them to the original trilogy."
