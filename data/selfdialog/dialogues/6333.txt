"__STAR_WARS__ So there is a debate over the relationship between Wookies and Ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, some say they ae related like distant cousins."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's what i originally thought. But then i came up with a different theory."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, like on Earth there are Humans and Apes, i was thinking that Wookies and Ewoks were similar."
"__STAR_WARS__ So Wookies would be the advanced of the two."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and the Ewoks were the lesser of the two species."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting. They do look similar except for the height issue."
"__STAR_WARS__ And they are a jungle species. However we've only seen Chewbacca, no other wookies."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is true too."
