"__DISNEY__ I just saw Elle Fanning in a preview for an upcoming movie. She's grown up since I saw her in Maleficent."
"__DISNEY__ DIdn't you just love that movie, Maleficent? I sure did."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I wish they would do another one."
"__DISNEY__ They could have Elle's character, Princess Aurora, all grown up now."
"__DISNEY__ That would be cool, and that bird guy that helps Maleficent could be in it still."
"__DISNEY__ Well sure. They should have all the original characters, including Sleeping Beauty's father."
"__DISNEY__ Did he live at the end? I can't remember."
"__DISNEY__ You mean King Stefan? No he died at the end. But...hmmm..."
"__DISNEY__ I know! He could have a twin brother who shows up to claim he owns the kingdom or somthing..."
"__DISNEY__ Yes that might work. As long as they keep Angelina Jolie at Maleficent. She's great!"
