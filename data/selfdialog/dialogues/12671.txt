"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know who I miss and what's missing from football these days?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um...what about actual play without all the mamby-pamby rules?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, that's not what I mean. I miss the immediate sense of the game and the innovation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, that's why I watch college football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, remember when Tebow was playing in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember he was bad at it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not at all! Well, yes he was, but a Tebow football game was exciting!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll give you that, but it was all the team around him making up for bad play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's always the team dude, Peyton Manning in his last superbowl had a rating of 27, it was the team then too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose i can give you that, but why Tebow?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always compared Tebow and Manning, Tebow was organic and exciting, Manning was cool and collected."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It you're gonna say Tebow was better than Manning....I'm out of here"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ THat's not it at all, I'm saying Tebow was more exciting to watch even though Manning is a better QB"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, like in that playoff game against the Steelers, Tebow was unpredictable, he could move as an RB and still had a QB threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So could a lot of run-option Qbs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but they have to skitter to the side, his build meant he might go up the middle, that you needed to blitz to take him down, and he was fast and slippery"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did like to see the QB play the game with the rest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I'm just saying, Tebow was exciting and I miss that in a lot of games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get what you're saying."
