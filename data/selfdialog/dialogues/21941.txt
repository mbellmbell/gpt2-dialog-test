"__DISNEY__ Why did they auto-tune Belle so much in the last movie?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm talking about how they destroyed Emma Watson's voice"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe she wasn't a good singer to begin with."
"__DISNEY__ Well, destroyed isn't the right word.  Just made it sound too fake."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, because she's not a good singer."
"__DISNEY__ She obviously had to be able to sing to some degree to get the role."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not saying she's horrible, but she doesn't have the pipes."
"__DISNEY__ Other than that, she was okay though."
"__DISNEY__ Her performance was pretty good.  Helps that she's so pretty."
