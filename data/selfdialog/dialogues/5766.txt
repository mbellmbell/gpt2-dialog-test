"__STAR_WARS__ So I heard a rumor the other day that I don't think is true."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay.  What's the rumor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently, Yoda was going to be played by a monkey originally."
"__STAR_WARS__ A monkey?  That can't be real."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, it's completely true.  A monkey was going to be Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, what made them change their mind?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess they thought the monkey might not pay attention on site."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he is a monkey so I could see that happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would have been crazy to see a monkey playing Yoda.  Just can't picture it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Neither can I.  Glad they made the right choice."
