"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! Who's your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I've been a big Seahawks fan ever since Russel Wilson joined."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he's a great player and he's one of those guys that is super likable. Have you seen his charity work with sick kids?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hell yeah. I follow him on Instagram. He's such a good guy. Which team do you support?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I'm from Cleveland so I feel obligated to support the Browns. I sometimes like the Cowboys though because it's nice to see a team win occasionally."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah I feel it. Browns fans are very loyal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's how we do it in Cleveland. It becomes sort of a rite of passage in Cleveland to go to a snowy game where the Browns get shut out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think of Johnny Football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Cleveland is kind of cursed anyway. But he was just an irresponsible kid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you like the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ezekiel Eliot! I'm a big Ohio State fan and I like to keep up with where my Buckeyes go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah that makes sense. He's great. Did you see his ESPN photo shoot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. He's looking good. And his career is looking good too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it is. The Cowboys are lucky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been to a game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only once but it was great. I'd like to go again but I have to save up the money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which game did you go to?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seahawks 49ers game in Seattle. That stadium is loud!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah Centurylink Field is always on the news for being loud."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that's true. It's even rumored to give the Seahawks an advantage because the other team can't hear."
