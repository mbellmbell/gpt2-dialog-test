"__MOVIES__ What is Denzel Washington's greatest movie role, would you say?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man. So many great ones."
"__MOVIES__ He's definitely one of the better actors of the past 30 years or so. But what's #1 for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Right off the top of my head, gotta say Malcolm X."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that was an epic performance."
"__MOVIES__ But amazingly that's not a movie he won an Oscar for."
"__MOVIES__ Which goes to show that the Academy gets it wrong sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ His performance in Glory was amazing too. Also, his performance in The Hurricane."
"__MOVIES__ He was great in Glory, but I don't remember seeing The Hurricane."
"__MOVIES__ You missed out! He plays a former boxer who is unjustly sentenced to prison for murder."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds gritty!"
"__MOVIES__ It's a very soulful, raw performance."
"__MOVIES__ He won the Oscar for his role in Training Day."
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, I feel like he's been better in other movies."
"__MOVIES__ Then why do you think he won there."
"__MOVIES__ I think to some extent it was a make up award."
"__MOVIES__ Like paying him back for times when he should have won but didn't?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if there's an actor that deserved a make up award, it's Denzel."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, he's top tier!"
