"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been keeping up with the NFL in the off season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! What do you think about the Cowboys' new offensive tackle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The kid from Arkansas? Skipper?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! He is like 6′ 10″ I think? He is really going to help out our offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too. I also like Taco Charlton from Michigan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was he our first draft pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I think so. He is a defensive end I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We need him on defense for sure...we need something!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True! But, I think with Prescott at quarterback and the new picks, we will be a contender this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. We still are pretty young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but look at what Prescott did last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I still think the Falcons or the Steelers are going to take it this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Roethlisberger is getting some age on him though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got Dobbs from Tennessee."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is so young though, and I really don't see him making an impact for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I just don't know if Roethlisberger has another championship left in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at Brady though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but that is Tom Brady though. He is a freak of nature."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but I still think the Steelers will take it this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will see."
