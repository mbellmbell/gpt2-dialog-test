"__STAR_WARS__ Do you remember the Rancor from Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. That creature was terrifying. Where do you suppose Jabba got it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that guard who was sad that it was killed raised it from a baby."
"__STAR_WARS__ How did that guy get a baby Rancor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe he found it in a nest?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Do Rancors have nests?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure. How else would a mama Rancor raise its offspring?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Just have it follow her around, maybe?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what Rancor meat tastes like."
"__STAR_WARS__ Chicken, probably."
