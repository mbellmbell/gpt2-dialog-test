"__DISNEY__ So what was your favorite Disney movie when you were a kid?"
"__DISNEY__ It's kind of hard to pick just one, for me. I had a friend who loved Beauty and the Beast and my mom loved Mulan."
"__DISNEY__ Those were good ones. I kind of liked Great Mouse Detective."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, and The Recsuers Down Under! Those smaller movies that weren't all about singing princesses really stood out, sometimes."
"__DISNEY__ The Jungle Book, Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh..."
"__DISNEY__ Peter Pan, too."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't they do Robin Hood?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, with the main characters as foxes! And they reused some of the animations for the dancing in The Aristocats!"
"__DISNEY__ Ooh, I almost forgot that one! It's been so long."
"__DISNEY__ Too long."
