"__ACTION__ I just saw Ghost in the Shell last weekend."
"__ACTION__ Oh yea, how was it?"
"__ACTION__ It was better than I thought it was going to be actually."
"__ACTION__ How was Scarlett Johanssen at playing that character? I know a lot of people were upset that they didn't cast a Japanese actress for that part."
"__ACTION__ I thought she did a really good job. The role fit her well."
"__ACTION__ Yea, she's always good in action type of movies."
"__ACTION__ I can see why they cast her as that part instead of a Japanese actress. I mean she's well known, she's good in those roles and if they want the hype surrounding the movie, then they have to cast someone well known."
"__ACTION__ Yea, it makes sense. If they cast a lesser known Japanese actress then maybe not so many people would have gone to see it."
"__ACTION__ It would only be the people who were fans of the original anime and knew the storyline well. By casting Scarlett they kind of open the door for people who didn't necessarily watch the original anime (like me) to be interested in seeing the movie."
"__ACTION__ Yea it was a smart move."
