"__STAR_WARS__ The soundtrack in The Force Awakens was kind of weak."
"__STAR_WARS__ John Williams composed it, just like he did in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ But the soundtrack was so prominent in those films. In The Force Awakens, it kind of disappeared."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess so. I can't really remember any tracks as memorable as the Imperial March or the Star Wars theme."
"__STAR_WARS__ The effects in The Force Awakens was top-notch, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. They really invested in practical effects, and it shows."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was J J Abrams' work. He really likes practical effects."
"__STAR_WARS__ It shows. In The Phantom Menace for instance, they did it all in CGI."
"__STAR_WARS__ The green screening really hurt the prequel trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ In those movies, the CGI looks badly dated now."
