"__MUSIC__ You know what I adore? The music of Vivaldi."
"__MUSIC__ Who? Is that a classical composer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Vivaldi was classical, but his work is really described as 'chamber music'."
"__MUSIC__ What's chamber music? Music played in a chamber?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, yes. it refers to a very small group of musicians. Vivaldi preferred a violin or two, a viola, and a cello."
"__MUSIC__ So what tunes have I heard? I seem to remember some pieces that I think I saw Itzak Perlman and Pinchas Zuckerman playing."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that - they played The Four Seasons on PBS, and that was really amazing."
"__MUSIC__ but - tell me why so few instruments are involved. What is chamber music, really?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, Antonio Vivaldi really championed it. Rather than having such a huge orchestra, a chamber group can play in a very intimate setting, where people can get much closer to the musicians."
"__MUSIC__ So it was made for smaller venues. I get it!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, apparently Joseph Haydn is considered the father of chamber music. He organized the pieces into parts: the sonata, the lyrical movement, the minuet or schertzo, and the finale."
"__MUSIC__ So it opened, then there was a middle, as sort of humorous part, and then a big ending."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's right! The thing about chamber music is that it was more personal and social."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard there used to be singers fronting those groups in the middle ages. That's cool, like having your own band in your house!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's really what chamber music was for. Imagine being a king, or a prince, and you want to party, who better to invite over and jam with than a few of your favorite musicians?"
"__MUSIC__ That's wild, thinking of medievalist and romantics, partying in their homes like we do today!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you know when you study history, you learn that people were not that much different from people today. They all loved entertainment, especially music."
"__MUSIC__ And a chamber group was the equivalent of having your own karaoke band in your own home!"
"__MUSIC__ Can you imagine what it must have been like, having Joseph Haydn or Vivaldi, or even Mozart visit your house?"
"__MUSIC__ Mozart did chamber music? Oh, yeah, I saw that in the movie, 'Amadeus'!"
