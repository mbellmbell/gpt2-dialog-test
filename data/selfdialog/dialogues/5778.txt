"__STAR_WARS__ Cautiously excited."
"__STAR_WARS__ Only cautiously?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm worried because both directors left."
"__STAR_WARS__ They did? I didn't hear about that."

"__STAR_WARS__ That's not good."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, it sounds worrying."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh well. At least we have the rest of them!"
"__STAR_WARS__ This is true!"
