"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude you think Ezekiel Elliot is going to run for 2000 yards this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ no not really."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not that dude is so good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No he's not, the Cowboys line is so good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok either way, Zeke was the rookie of the year, that means he's really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it just means that the NFL wants to reward it's position players in big markets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're such a conspiracy theorist."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No man, People are just gravitated towards numbers, and since lineman can't really put up numbers, we all just want to talk about how good the position players are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but look at some of his highlights."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any professional running back in the league could do many of those same things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Zeke is getting to run through 6 foot holes, anybody would look good with those holes to run through."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who is a good running back then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, I don't really care to label any running back as good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you talking about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every runningback is only as good as the line he runs behind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at Emmitt Smith.  He's the career rushing leader, but he had the best line ever, and just happened to never get hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bro, you're ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You just hate me because I'm right."
