"__ROCK__ What kind of music do you listen to?"
"__ROCK__ I love rock. Classical is okay, but I don't like country or rap."
"__ROCK__ I like rock too. I was a big fan of alternative rock in the 90s."
"__ROCK__ So I bet you liked Nirvana then."
"__ROCK__ Oh, I LOVED Nirvana. I liked Hole too, with his wife Courtney Love."
"__ROCK__ That's surprising. I know a lot of fans blamed her for his death."
"__ROCK__ I try to separate the art from the artist. Especially with bands."
"__ROCK__ That's probably a good idea, since a lot of rock stars are troubled people."
"__ROCK__ I wonder if being a troubled person caused the great music, or being a rock star caused the troubled person."
"__ROCK__ That's a really interesting question. Probably both."
