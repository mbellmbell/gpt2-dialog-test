"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen the movie Fast Five?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, I haven't. Is it in the Fast and Furious series?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, it is. It came out two years after the first one with Paul Walker."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, what is this one about?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's characters have to team up again to escape from the authorities."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That sounds similar to the first one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It is similar, but this time they're the bad guys instead of the good guys."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, okay. Who else is in the movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Dwayne Johnson plays a federal agent."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's cool, I really like him."
