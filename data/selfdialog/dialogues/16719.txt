"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Mine has to be The Fountain."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, what's that? I've never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie by Darren Aronofsky. I can't really explain what genre it is."
"__MOVIES__ Is it realistic, or is it more of a fantasy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's more fantasy, but in a way that is about real life. Like, it talks about a real life situation, which is that this woman is dying of cancer."
"__MOVIES__ But it uses the fantasy to get at the difficult parts of that situation?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It's basically about how hard it is to say goodbye. I love it, but it makes me cry every time."
"__MOVIES__ That's fair, I usually don't like sad movies very much. My favorite movie is Jupiter Ascending."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that the one directed by the Watchowski sisters?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is. I find everything that they do so much fun."
"__MOVIES__ They put a lot of effort into design, too. The Matrix looked really cool and I've heard that Jupiter Ascending does too."
"__MOVIES__ The costumes alone are so stunning! The plot goes a little off the rails, though."
"__MOVIES__ That's okay, I don't mind that. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum are the main characters."
"__MOVIES__ Anyone else I might know?"
"__MOVIES__ Eddie Redmayne is in it too. His performance is really dramatic and hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great. I really like Eddie Redmayne, because he's handsome and a good actor."
"__MOVIES__ Hahaha, well, he's in a lot of this movie, so you might like it."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great! Thanks for telling me about it!"
