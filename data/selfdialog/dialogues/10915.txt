"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Patriots will win another Super With Brady and Bill Belichick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I almost thing I would be surprised if they didn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, them seem to be unstopable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For real. And what's amazing is that they really don't have a team full of superstars."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, just a bunch of role players to surround Tom and Bill."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know people love to hate on them all the time. But I don't see how people can get that upset that they can keep winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think people are convinced that they are cheaters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah! Deflate-gate add what was that other issue they had?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There was the thing a few years ago where they were accused of spying on other teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, that was it. I could not remember what it was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they were quilty?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they were, which I don't think the were, then they were only quilty of doing what all the teams do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it kind of seems like the media is out to get them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is kind of how I feel. No one wants to give them credit so they just vilify them and everyone buys into it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's too bad because they really are a great team. And that's what I think matters, great teams competing against each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt! And I think the league is full of some really great teams now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. And there were a lot of key player pick ups in the league with the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It wil be interesting to see which rookies really come out and make a huge difference for their teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure will, but you can count on this. Whoever are playing for the Patriots will have a great show at a championship with Tom and Bill at the helm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is for sure!"
