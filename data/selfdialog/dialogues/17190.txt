"__MOVIES__ Have you seen anything lately that you recommend watching?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ I have not."
"__MOVIES__ I would definitely recommend Logan. You don’t even have to be an x-men fan to watch it, although it helps."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did see the trailer in the movies, it did look good and I do like the x-men."
"__MOVIES__ This one only has professor x, I’m not going to give anything away but it will make sense why when you watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. I just watched x-men Apocolypse at last."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually really enjoyed it, although I do like all of the newer x-men movies."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I really enjoyed days of futures past. The plot is a little wacky but I didn’t care and it had wolverine in it which was cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he is my favorite character. If you enjoyed them, then I think you will like Logan. It’s a different spin on the same character."
"__MOVIES__ I think the marvel franchise is doing amazing work right now."
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree. Ant-man was probabally one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Brilliant movie. I was suprised when I heard Paul Rudd was taking the role, but he really impressed me."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I couldn’t imagine anyone else playing the part better, he was surprisingly perfect for the role."
"__MOVIES__ I had the same feeling with Dr Strange, I wasent expecting to enjoy it as much as I did."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I wasent really looking forward to it but it blew my mind when I saw it at the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it had that inception vibe to it, it worked really well."
"__MOVIES__ Benedict cumberbatch suited the character perfectly, I did not see that coming."
"__MOVIES__ I know, who would have throught that Sherlock Holmes could make such a good Superhero."
