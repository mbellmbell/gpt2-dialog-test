"__HORROR__ Do you like zombie movies?"
"__HORROR__ Sort of I guess?"
"__HORROR__ Why only sort of?  I love them!"
"__HORROR__ They all are pretty cliche."
"__HORROR__ Oh, I get what you mean.  Is there anyone you actually like?"
"__HORROR__ I guess Resident Evil movies are okay."
"__HORROR__ What do you like the best about those?"
"__HORROR__ I guess I like that they are faster than regular zombies."
"__HORROR__ See, they aren't all cliche!"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I guess.  I still don't like them though."
