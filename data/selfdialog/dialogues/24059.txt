"__SUPERHERO__ Did you like Iron Man 3?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I did, but I didn't."
"__SUPERHERO__ How is that?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, I love the Marvel Movies, but this had some unnecessary stuff in it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Like what?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I love hot women, I really do."
"__SUPERHERO__ Trust me, I know."
"__SUPERHERO__ I hated that when Pepper Pots was being held captive and Iron Man came to her rescue, she was shirtless."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, that was kind of revolting."
"__SUPERHERO__ It was for eye candy for sure, but that means they actually took her shirt off when they tied her up. And that's entertainment?"
