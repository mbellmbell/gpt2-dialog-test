"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think NFL should have a celebration penalty?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure. I have over celebration though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it can be nerve racking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I almost think it is too subjective to penalize though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could understand that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean if they are going to penalize any, then they should just elimnate it all together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think that would ever happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either, but it would be the only way it is fair."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a lot of calls are subjective."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Some are just ridiculious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why they made the challenges available."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But those don't work on flags and such."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it helps with some things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It also hurts sometimes. I mean think about the give and take of the bad calls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it works both ways."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just liked things back before evyer thing was reviewed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Things did move quicker, but so much was overlooked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean like bad calls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the modern changes help make things more fair."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but I liked it when is was more of a game than just fair."
