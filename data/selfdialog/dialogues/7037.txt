"__ICEHOCKEY__ What do you think the Bruins should do with Zdeno Chara as he enters the twilight of his career?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, he can't be on the ice against top forwards for first pairing minutes anymore. He's lost a step and it shows in his game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think they take the captain title away from him and give it to Patrice Bergeron. He's really been the heart of the team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They wouldn't do that because part of the reason Z signed in Boston is because they offered him the C on his jersey!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Now that Claude is gone and Cassidy is opening up the offense with the younger players, they need a defense that can move the puck in transition..."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree with you there, but the answer isn't to dump Chara. He can be a shutdown defenseman on a second pairing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who are they going to put on the first pair? I don't think any of their young guys are ready.. Maybe McAvoy."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, he showed flashes in the playoffs last year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Put him with Brandon Carlo on a top pairing, that's your future right there."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Then you have Chara and Miller on the second pairing. Don Sweeney has some good depth with the draft picks and prospects!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think a good target for the team next year would be 95 points and a second round appearance in the playoffs. But they won't get there unless they trade Rask!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're out of your mind... Rask is a top 5 goaltender in the league..."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He chokes in the playoffs! He's the only goalie to blow a 3 game lead in Bruins' history."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The team collapsed in front of him that year against the Fliers. They wouldn't have made the playoffs last season without Rask."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They could have kept Martin Jones and sent Tuuka to the Sharks. He makes like half the salary for the same performance.."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't think anybody saw Jones coming, but he's either going to fizzle out or eventually want to be paid like a top-end goalie. Then you're back at square one."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Tuuka is trash..."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He has one of the highest save percentages in the league and leads the NHL in shutouts like every year!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I still hate Montreal though..."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Okay, that I can agree with you on."
