"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's just a matter of time the NFL will have women coaching their teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think it could happen any day now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that? You heard something I haven't?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No but they're allowing women reporters in the locker rooms so its-"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the reporters in the locker room thing is about marketing more than its about NFL football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are many more women sports newscasters than ever so its just a matter-"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, I don't think the NFL-"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there are women coaches in the NBA right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the WNBA don't you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If women can coach NBA or WNBA then they coach NFL teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe its gonna happen but first you'll hear about a women's investment group owning a NFL team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it won't be about NFL football? It'll be about money and investments?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be about women participating in NFL's business decisions and that will bring about remale coaching change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder why it has not happen yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL is an old boy's club and traditions are hard to break."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why I know it'll happen soon the NF-"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is still dominated by men who resist change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know if more male coaches in the NFL would open themselves up to change-"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ women would takeover the one place men can go and still bond."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You, like the NFl need much helpt and much prayer."
