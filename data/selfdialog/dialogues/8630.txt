"__BEATLES__ I know you said you were into rock, but does that include the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, definitely. I don't know all the ins and outs of the band, but I love the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Oh okay, cool. I like them a lot too."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, they're such a talented band. They were like an all star band."
"__BEATLES__ I vaguely remember one of my friends saying that Mick Jagger once said something to the effect of 'We have one lead singer, they have four,' when referring to the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Wow, that's impressive! They're all geniuses, but some of their songs are kind of out there."
"__BEATLES__ For sure, the Beatles went through a huge artistic and style change over there short time as a band. Initially they were all in suits playing pop songs and they became a pretty trippy band wearing lots of flamboyant and colorful outfits."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, like the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They had awesome outfits in that vinyl art and they looked really stoned, haha."
"__BEATLES__ Haha, yeah. Oh, another interesting tidbit is I think Yesterday is the most covered song of all time, but I could be wrong about that though."
"__BEATLES__ I love that song. I wouldn't be surprised."
