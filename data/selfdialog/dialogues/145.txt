"__MUSIC__ There are some songs and albums so beautifully recorded, I can't think of any way they could be improved."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, like 'Riders On The Storm' by the Doors. The sound levels and rain effects are just perfect, nothing to tweek."
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles and lots of other people thought 'Pet Sounds' by the Beach Boys was amazing, perfect."
"__MUSIC__ My sister loves the way Phoebe Snow's albums sound."
"__MUSIC__ Like on 'Two-Fisted Love', 'Poetry Man', and 'Solid Ground'. Those were very well done."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, and Jethro Tull's 'Living In The Past'. The violins in the back."
"__MUSIC__ I noticed that the sound levels on Jethro Tull's stuff is exactly the same volume as classical music."
"__MUSIC__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I noticed it years ago, when I was running a Jethro Tull CD through a graphics equalizer."
"__MUSIC__ You weren't making a bootleg tape, were you?"
"__MUSIC__ No, just recording it to a cassette for my own use, in the car."
"__MUSIC__ So the sound waves, the recording levels, were similar to classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Extremely quiet, very low, even for the 'louder' songs, like 'Aqualung'. I had to turn up the sound quite a bit."
"__MUSIC__ I remember Jethro Tull had some of the earliest CDs, with all kinds of defective quality, mis-printings."
"__MUSIC__ Wrong labels, and tracks running together, I think I remember."
"__MUSIC__ I recall buying a Steve Miller CD in 1990, and it was actually some kind of Japanese rap or something in the package."
"__MUSIC__ All of the B52 albums I own have very, very loud sound levels!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's right. I remember trying to copy 'Revolution Earth', and the sound level indicators going up into the red."
"__MUSIC__ Probably a lot less tape hiss if you start with a really, really loud original signal!"
