"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the Sunday afternoon games on Fox, but there's on massive issue for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So nice of you to say hello before you spoke"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sorry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, go ahead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love The Simpsons"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But so much Sunday TV, especially that show, are delayed week after week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Runover. Once a game starts, they're contractually obligated to show the complete game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aren't they at 4pm?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So they should be over by 7, 7:30 at the latest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're forgetting about an extra half hour."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The post-game coverage. They for some reason HAVE to examine the game on TV after it airs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I hate that too, I just don't watch Sunday TV outside of non-sports channels so I haven't considered it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does the same post-game happen on CBS and NBC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what, I'm not sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't watch those networks at night?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, at least not on Sunday."
