"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more ready for NFL than any of the college teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just prefer people who play professionally. They seem to have their ducks in a row."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. I really do think that they will need to have a team rebuild here pretty soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Ben Roethlisberger seems to be getting old along with a lot of the defensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you are right, the key players are about to retire soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have a few new guys like Antonio Brown who actually do a decent job though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will do better than what they did last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they went 11-5 which isn't bad but they could always improve."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were first in their conference, weren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were, yes, but their other competitors kept them from going to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have won six of them already though, you cannot say that they don't have the potential."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would never doubt my team. This year should be vastly different for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope you are right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A saying that I have kept to me since I have been to Pittsburgh, 'Stairway to Seven'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope the seventh comes this season."
