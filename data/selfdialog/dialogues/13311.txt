"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team do you think is going to be the surprise team this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a lot to choose from but I would have to say Tampa Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have a lot of good young players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think Winston is going to be hitting his prime this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has Evans to throw to as well, plus didn't they add a new receiver?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they got DeSean Jackson this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That should help Evens get open more for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus they drafted OJ Howard, he should be a big target."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to find a better running back though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They still have Doug Martin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's suspended for the first four games though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but maybe he'll come back rested and ready to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think Houston is going to be a lot better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they get good play out of Savage maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have that great defense and a few big pieces on offense as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ JJ Watt being back should make that defense even more scary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah if they can score 20 or more points a game they should be ok."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are probably going to give the Colts a run for their money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't count out Andrew Luck though, he's been pretty good ever since he got into the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's good for sure but it might not matter if he's being sacked four times a game."
