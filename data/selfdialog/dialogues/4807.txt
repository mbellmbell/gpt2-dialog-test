"__MUSIC__ Shostakovich is intense, man."
"__MUSIC__ Is it? I don't know much about this stuff."
"__MUSIC__ You got to check out his string quartets. They'll bite your nose off."
"__MUSIC__ Can't miss that, can I. Why do they do such a thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you know how all important art comes out of adversity. There was a ton of adversity here."
"__MUSIC__ I thought that starving artist stereotype was largely disproven, all things considered."
"__MUSIC__ That's not really what I mean, though. I mean, the people with the most to say tend to be saying it for a purpose -- in response to something intense in their lives that can't go uncommented upon."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so what was going on in this guy's life?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he was a Jewish academic in the top tiers of society in the middle of Stalin-era Soviet Russia. His friends kept quietly disappearing, one after another."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. Yes, that would tend to bother a person."
"__MUSIC__ He was freaked out. For years, every moment of every day it was, are they going to bang on the door?"
"__MUSIC__ So that's all in his music?"
"__MUSIC__ Basically, yeah. He created a motif that represented him, using his initials in the German style of notation, and put it through hell."
"__MUSIC__ So he's like the Trent Reznor of classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well... I don't know about that, but it was some virtuosic stuff. At least, on a compositional level."
"__MUSIC__ So he didn't tour around and play the stuff himself?"
"__MUSIC__ Not so far as I know. He just dabbled with his piano, in his study, with his head in one hand, trying not to tremble too badly."
"__MUSIC__ I think you're selling me. What did you say to look for, a... string quartet?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know -- but it's more interesting than you think, seriously. At least, if it's played well -- like by the Kronos Quartet."
"__MUSIC__ And if it's played poorly, what happens? Does the KGB catch up with him at last?"
