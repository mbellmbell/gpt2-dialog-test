"__DISNEY__ I think Lilo and Stitch was a severely underrated Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ I can't remember if I've seen that one--is it the one with the blue guy?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he's an alien that lands in Hawaii."
"__DISNEY__ I never saw that one; I guess it just wasn't marketed as much."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, you should totally watch it, I cry every time."
"__DISNEY__ You cry over a movie about a blue alien?"
"__DISNEY__ You probably cried about ET didn't you!"
"__DISNEY__ ...Touche."
"__DISNEY__ It's very sweet and it deals with some real issues--like, Lilo's parents are dead and it deals with adoption and family and stuff."
"__DISNEY__ That is kinda deep. I'll have to check it out."
