"__DISNEY__ Do you enjoy Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, I do for sure. My favorite is The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. The Lion King has to be one of my all time favorites too."
"__DISNEY__ The movie sends such powerful messages to the audience, and it's followed my a fantastic soundtrack too."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the songs are what really did it for me. 'Can you feel the love tonight' gives me shivers every time I hear it."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite was 'Circle Of Life'. The scene so beautifully portrays a new dawn and the beginning of a new life."
"__DISNEY__ I loved that scene too. One of the most powerful ones in the movie for sure."
"__DISNEY__ It is. It shows us how everything in nature and in life is so well connected."
"__DISNEY__ It's a sad movie too though. It's one of the rare movies that drives me to tears."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. No matter how many times I see it, I still cry at the scene of Mufasa's death."
