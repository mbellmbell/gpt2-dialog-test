"__MOVIES__ Is it just me, or is there a surplus of Teen post-apocalypse movies?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not just you, it's everywhere."
"__MOVIES__ Like, Hunger Games and Maze Runner."
"__MOVIES__ That Divergent Series."
"__MOVIES__ Did we ever have things like that when we were young?"
"__MOVIES__ I think for us, it was Harry Potter."
"__MOVIES__ That's right.  And keep in mind that craze went for a long time because of the 7 books and movies for each."
"__MOVIES__ Those were great movies.  Not like those teen apocalypse movies"
"__MOVIES__ I don't like them either, but I guess they have their own appeal and target demographic."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder why though, because they're so tragic and depressing."
"__MOVIES__ I think it has to do with the fact that movies like 'The Hunger Games' put young adults at the forefront of the action."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it can be empowering for young kids and teens to feel like they can be the hero and make a difference."
"__MOVIES__ I did actually see 'Maze Runner.'  It had an interesting concept."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Dylan O'Brien, that actor from the 'Teen Wolf' series I think.  And Ki-Hong Lee from 'Kimmy Schmidt.'"
"__MOVIES__ Are they good?"
"__MOVIES__ They're both very talented actors.  I can see them being in a lot more movies in the future."
"__MOVIES__ I noticed that regardless of the quality of a movie, these days, all the actors are so talented."
"__MOVIES__ I think there is definitely a shift from the past, where movies cast actors based on looks, whereas now they also focus very much on talent."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's for the better.  It makes movies that much more better to watch."
