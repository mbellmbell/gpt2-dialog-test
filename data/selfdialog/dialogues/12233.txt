"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am sure, I'm excited for what is coming up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will get to the super bowl this year, besides the obvious in the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't be so sure about them. I think the Raiders may have a chance"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that debacle near the end of last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's unfortunate we didn't get to see what Carr could do in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's really turning into an amazing quarterback at such a young age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders definitely struck gold on that kid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Struck gold and are paying him in diamonds based on that contract they recently gave him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a hefty one, but definitely worth it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Given their history of bad quarterbacks since Gannon they definitely don't want to let him ever go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's definitely a raider for life as long as he stays healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think they could be a contender. That defense looks like it could compliment that offense finally."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely have improved on the defensive side."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It won't be easy to overthrow the Patriots though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It never really is. They continue to be the number one team and it isn't even close."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It boggles my mind how they managed to become even better than their superbowl roster had."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's scary how obnoxiously good the staff is from top to bottom. They always pick the right guys it seems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It bothers me even more, because Brady looks like he is getting better with age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he was joking when he said he wants to play until he's 50, but honestly he's making me a believer year by year."
