"__DISNEY__ Whenever I watch 101 Dalmatians, I end up wanting to get another dog."
"__DISNEY__ I know! Me too!"
"__DISNEY__ And I get so angry at CruElla. Who could be that mean to animals?"
"__DISNEY__ She's a classic Disney villain, isn't she?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she has to be one of the worst with her stupid fur coat."
"__DISNEY__ She's a terrible person with even worse fashion sense."
"__DISNEY__ Could you imagine having that many dogs though?"
"__DISNEY__ Imagine the dog hair getting on everything!"
"__DISNEY__ I think owning over a hundred of any animal is a bit crazy."
"__DISNEY__ You've got that right."
