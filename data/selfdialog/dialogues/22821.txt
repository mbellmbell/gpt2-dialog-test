"__DISNEY__ Do you think Cruella D'Ville was a 'good' villain?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not too sure about that. Who wants to ever make a coat out of a dog's skin?"
"__DISNEY__ I am not sure but I lived the fact that her hair was perfectly split between black and white."
"__DISNEY__ I like the way she drove like a maniac."
"__DISNEY__ The style of car was very befitting as well."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I could not picture her having the same effect if she had driven a VW bug or a side panelled station wagon."
"__DISNEY__ What about how thin she is with her pointy cheek bones and long skeletal fingers?"
"__DISNEY__ I know it makes her look like a ghostly nightmare lady."
"__DISNEY__ I like her aristocratic nature."
"__DISNEY__ I think she does make a good villain."
