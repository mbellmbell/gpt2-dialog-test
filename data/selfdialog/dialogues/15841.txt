"__ROCK__ What style of rock music is your favorite?"
"__ROCK__ That's a tough question. There I days when I most want to listen to 90s alternative rock and days when I prefer softer, more current rock."
"__ROCK__ I can understand that. Different days you have different moods and might want to listen to something different."
"__ROCK__ Exactly. Lately I have been listening to a good amount of Goo Goo Dolls."
"__ROCK__ Oh, really? They are one of my favorites. I listened to their album Dizzy Up the Girl so many times through."
"__ROCK__ That's a good album. Do you also like Counting Crows?"
"__ROCK__ Absolutely. Mr. Jones is a song I grew up with."
"__ROCK__ Me too. My parents let me pick the music that I listened to so I heard a lot of Goo Goo Dolls, Matchbox 20, Counting Crows and that style growing up."
"__ROCK__ Oh, I saw Matchbox 20 last year in concert. They played several songs from the album Yourself or Something Like You."
"__ROCK__ Awesome, I'm sure that was a great show."
