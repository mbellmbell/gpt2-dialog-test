"__MOVIES__ I loved the movie Fargo. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I still haven't figured out all the symbols."
"__MOVIES__ Well, there was the giant lumberjack statue. Paul Bunyan in the snow."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. The good giant towering over the scene of murder and mayhem."
"__MOVIES__ Then there was the stamp that the detective's husband got to design. Was it a three cent stamp?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. Wow! I just thought about the 2 cent stamp in the current Fargo TV season."
"__MOVIES__ There you go! There's no end to the resonance with the Coen brothers."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Barton Fink for that. How the guy, the traveling salesman couldn't hear...but neither could Barton."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Barton missed the whole truth about the traveling salesman, when it was right under his nose."
"__MOVIES__ That last scene...the fire in the lobby of the hotel. What a scene!"
"__MOVIES__ John Goodman thundering down the hallway surrounded by flames shouting 'I'll show you the life of the mind.'"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder how they did that? With the flames I mean."
"__MOVIES__ How come they didn't actually get burned?"
"__MOVIES__ That was filmed in Chateau Marmont . Have you ever been there?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but what a great setting for that film."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, the Coen brothers are real artists. There's no doubt about it."
"__MOVIES__ I also loved Raising Arizona. I can't think of a funnier scene than the one where he robs the convenience store and has a diaper on his head."
"__MOVIES__ The sets were so authentic. Remember the trailer where they lived?The afghan with the orange and avacado squares."
"__MOVIES__ Excellent! And there was real heartbreak in it too. The bunny in the road. The same road with the motorcycles."
"__MOVIES__ In spite of it all, with them, I always feel better about life."
