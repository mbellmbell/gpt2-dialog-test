"__DISNEY__ I have loved Disney movies all my life.  I think my favorite is Tangled."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you like that on, in particular?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know for sure.  It makes me laugh, and the songs are awesome."
"__DISNEY__ That's true.  Isn't the mother who keeps Rapunzel in the tower absolutely awesome?"
"__DISNEY__ She really is.  She had me scared even though she was animated."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite part is when Rapunzel is singing in the bar.  All those bar guys are hilarious!"
"__DISNEY__ I like that part too, but I especially love the ending when she founds out who she really is."
"__DISNEY__ That is really neat.  What about the part with all those lanterns?"
"__DISNEY__ I totally forgot about those.  They are magical and perfectly Disney."
"__DISNEY__ Disney really has a way of getting to my heart."
