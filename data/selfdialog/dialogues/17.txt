"__MUSIC__ Hey you know that song by Jeff Buckley?"
"__MUSIC__ Jeff Buckley? Whose that?"
"__MUSIC__ You know Jeff Buckley, died in Memphis....one of the great voices....90's"
"__MUSIC__ Oh the Hallelujah guy. I know that song. I thought Lenard Cohen sang it."
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't Jeff Buckley?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, no Leonard Cohen wrote and sang it first. Jeff Buckley just covered and made it famous."
"__MUSIC__ So many people have covered that song."
"__MUSIC__ Really like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Pentatonix, Damien Rice, Tori Kelly, Rufus Wainwright, Katie Lang, Jone Cale, John Bon Jovi."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a lot of people. I guess they are trying to show how good they are by singing that song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, even Justin Timberlake and Willie Nelson covered it. Talk about overkill."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I think the Jeff Buckley version is still my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is one of the best versions. I don't think Leonard Cohen was going to originally release it."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That would have been a lost."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can't remember the story but he was convinced by someone to release the song and it didn't become famous until Jeff Buckley covered it."
"__MUSIC__ It's weird because I don't think the song is about religion."
"__MUSIC__ Well, listening to lyrics, I thought it was about sex."
"__MUSIC__ That's probably why it's so popular and everyone wants to cover it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that makes it even cooler. It's still a great song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah as long someone like Brittany Spears doesn't cover it."
