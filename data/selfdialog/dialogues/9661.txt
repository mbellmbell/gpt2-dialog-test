"__COMEDY__ Do you like Judd Apatow movies?"
"__COMEDY__ I do, actually, even though they're very silly and kind of crude, but also very much like real life."
"__COMEDY__ I like Knocked Up. Even though it had some immature humor, it had some very sweet parts, too."
"__COMEDY__ I agree. I think all of his movies are like that."
"__COMEDY__ Yes, like Trainwreck, which I thought was really funny."
"__COMEDY__ Amy Schumer was great in that. Apatow and Schumer make a great team."
"__COMEDY__ And let's not forget 40-year-old Virgin!"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, that's a classic! I laughed so hard at that movie!"
"__COMEDY__ Steve Carell was perfect in that movie. He can make anything funny."
"__COMEDY__ I also liked 'This is 40.' There must be something funny about being 40 years old to Judd."
