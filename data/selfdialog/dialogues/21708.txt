"__DISNEY__ Did they not say that they were coming out with a part two to 'The Incredibles' movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes it's due to come out in 2018 and I can't wait. It was and still is my absolute favorite movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes indeed I concur. I don't know what took them so long to come out with a second part. I even thought at one point that they were going to make a series out of it."
"__DISNEY__ Me too!!! Oh my God, what do you think about Edna. She is a hoot. Do you know who Edna reminds me of. She totally looks like the actress Linda Hunt."
"__DISNEY__ (Laughs) You know what coming to think of it she does. Frozone was the man! Samuel L. Jackson did a splendid job. Frozone totally had his persona."
"__DISNEY__ Dash was my dude. So cute. I liked his character, curious, persistent, optimistic and courageous."
"__DISNEY__ Who played Dash, I cannot seem to remember."
"__DISNEY__ Spencer Fox did, and he did a phenomenal job. Kudos to him."
"__DISNEY__ You know what I enjoyed the most? Whilst being entertaining it had a very strong message of being resilient and not trying to hide who you truly are and who you were born to be. Society can put many restrictions on you to prevent you from truly being who you are, but one must strive to be who they were meant to be regardless of the consequences because it is something beautiful. There will be resistance but one must persevere and emerge."
"__DISNEY__ Hmmmm that is a good thought. I saw that in their daughter too Violet. She went from hiding her face until she truly discovered and embraced who she was, then she moved the hair from hiding her face, so I guess according to your lingo she 'emerged.' Good movie!"
