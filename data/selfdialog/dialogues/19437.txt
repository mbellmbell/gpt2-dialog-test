"__MOVIES__ What do you think was the best movie of 2014?"
"__MOVIES__ I really loved The Fault in Our Stars"
"__MOVIES__ What? Are you kidding me? That movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was such a teenybopper film! There were so many other films worth seeing then!"
"__MOVIES__ oh yeah? Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well for starters, there was a planet of the apes movies that came out around the same time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh did it? Was that Rise of the Planet of the apes?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it was Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I did see that one now that I look back"
"__MOVIES__ And? Wasn't it better than the faults in our stars?"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, i found it to be quite boring actually"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean boring?"
"__MOVIES__ I felt the story went on to long."
"__MOVIES__ At least the effects were good!"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, the effects sucked too. The monkeys look really fake to be honest with you"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe your taste in movies is just bad"
"__MOVIES__ have you ever seen the fault in our stars?"
"__MOVIES__ No actually"
"__MOVIES__ Try it out. It has some heavy dramatic acting, and it was a lot better than I expected it to be"
