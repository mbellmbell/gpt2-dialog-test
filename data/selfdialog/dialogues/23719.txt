"__DISNEY__ Hey, I just read an article in a magazine about a Disney movie that's coming out."
"__DISNEY__ Cool, what's it called."
"__DISNEY__ It's called Gigantic, and you will never guess what it is about."
"__DISNEY__ I think it will be about something really big."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it is the Disney story version of Jack and the Beanstalk."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, what a cool idea. When is it coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ Well as usual that is a bit fuzzy, the article said next year, but I Googled it and Google says 2020. So who knows."
"__DISNEY__ I hate when they do that. Get us excited and then delay, delay, delay."
"__DISNEY__ Well I looked it up on Wikipedia and it seems it was scheduled for 2018, but they have already pushed it back to 2020."
"__DISNEY__ So we have a gigantic wait for Gigantic then!"
