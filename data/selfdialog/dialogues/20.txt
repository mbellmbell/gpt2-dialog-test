"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite song from the 2000s?"
"__MUSIC__ That's easy, Crazy in Love by Beyonc√© featuring Jay Z."
"__MUSIC__ With all due respect, that's such a conventional choice."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry, but the includes the best singer and the best rapper of that decade. Also, it's my go to karaoke song."
"__MUSIC__ I just think that it's not even their best song together. I much prefer Deja Vu or even '03 Bonnie & Clyde."
"__MUSIC__ Both of those are also great songs. What is your favorite song of the 2000s?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah by Usher. It is the best dance song ever released in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to argue with that. I am a huge fan of Lil Jon and find him to be one of the most talented hip hop producers of that period."
"__MUSIC__ His music could be very dirty, but no one had a better understanding of music that could play in the club than him."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. I will always associate the song Get Low with that period of time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the 2000s had some amazing dance music. Do you remember Missy Elliot?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! Work It felt like the biggest song in the world when it came out."
"__MUSIC__ I especially liked her work with Ciara. You know, songs like 1, 2 Step and Lose Control."
"__MUSIC__ I remember those songs well. Missy Elliot was the Nicki Minaj of her day."
"__MUSIC__ Don't make me pick between the two! While I think Nicki Minaj is probably the better rapper, Missy Elliot was way better at making dance music."
"__MUSIC__ That assessment seems fair. However, Missy Elliot was able to make such good dance music because she had Timbaland as her producer."
"__MUSIC__ I totally forgot about that guy. That guy was in just about every Justin Timberlake song during the 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't mind that at all. The played a pivotal role in making FutureSex/LoveSounds, which is my favorite pop album of the decade."
"__MUSIC__ That was a great album, but I still prefer Gwen Stefani's album Love. Angel. Music. Baby."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good album, but I heard Hollaback Girl way too much to ever want to listen to it again."
