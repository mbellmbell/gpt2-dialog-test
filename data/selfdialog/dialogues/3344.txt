"__MUSIC__ What's the best kind of music to dance to?"
"__MUSIC__ For me, it would be R&B."
"__MUSIC__ I like something a little more up-tempo."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. When it comes to dancing music, I think R. Kelly is top of the heap."
"__MUSIC__ And I'd rather listen to something like Katy Perry or Kesha."
"__MUSIC__ We have very different tastes in music, to put it mildly!"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people put down Kesha, but her music is really dance-able."
"__MUSIC__ I am not her biggest fan, but maybe you're right. I just like something smoother."
"__MUSIC__ R&B is definitely smoother, but there's not as much energy in it."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's energetic, just a different type of energy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, i guess maybe 'energy' is the wrong word. Maybe excitement?"
"__MUSIC__ Again, I'd say it's excitement of a different kind."
"__MUSIC__ The bottom line is that I'd rather listen to 'Roar' or 'Warrior' than any of R. Kelly's songs if I'm in a dancing mood."
"__MUSIC__ And for me, songs like 'Ignition' and 'Imma Flirt' are sure to get you moving on the dance floor."
"__MUSIC__ I do like 'I Believe I Can Fly' by R. Kelly, but that's not much of a dancing song."
"__MUSIC__ No, I agree. R. Kelly does songs that are more inspirational than dance-able too."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I mostly enjoy the inspirational ones."
"__MUSIC__ Whereas I think the inspirational songs get a litle bit corny at times."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, next time we're driving somewhere, I'm controlling the radio dial!"
"__MUSIC__ We'll see about that!"
