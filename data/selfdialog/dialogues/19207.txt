"__MOVIES__ Do you want to go out to a movie? Wonder Woman looks good."
"__MOVIES__ No, too busy and too expensive. Beside, i always get stuck behind someone with a beehive hairdo."
"__MOVIES__ Well, let's rent something. There's a Redbox rental by the Pizza Hut. I think they have the new Mummy movie with Tom Cruise."
"__MOVIES__ Redbox? You mean physically rent a DVD?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, man. What's wrong with that?"
"__MOVIES__ Dude, I've not had a DVD player for five years. What am I? A savage?"
"__MOVIES__ Can you stream anything thing?"
"__MOVIES__ Can I stream? This is my domain. I've got Netflix, the Apple Store, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, Showtime---"
"__MOVIES__ Crackle? Do you have Crackle?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't have Crackle. What movie is on Crackle that you want to see?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I feel like a classic. Something I don't have to use my brain."
"__MOVIES__ Classic it is.  What's a movie that when it's on TV, you can't scroll past? You're stuck on it once you've seen five seconds of it?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's see . . . Shawshank Redemption. Pulp Fiction. Uhh, the one with the guy . . . ."
"__MOVIES__ The 'one with the guy'? That's only every movie. How about really old. Like Film Noir."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, a black and white classic.  Maybe a murder mystery. You know, the darker side of Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ How about 'Crime, Inc.' with Tom Neal?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Crime, Inc.'? Is it a murder mystery?"
"__MOVIES__ 1945, crime, noir, Hollywood . . . my bet is there's some murder going on."
"__MOVIES__ The description says it's about a reporter uses his friendship with a mobster to expose the crime in his city."
"__MOVIES__ Ohh, a reporter. After this, we need to watch The Night Stalker with Darren McGavin.  The ultimate dark, creepy, scary reporter show."
