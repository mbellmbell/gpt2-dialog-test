"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Rey in the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought she was great.  I can't wait to see her training with Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that will be cool.  Do you think she's his daughter?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but that seems like the easy answer."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I think you're right about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard possibly her last name was Kenobi and might be his granddaughter."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be great as she heard his voice when she first grabbed Luke's old light saber."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a crazy scene too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Speaking of crazy, her fight against Kilo Ren was cool"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, her Force powers must be off the scale to over power him like that."
