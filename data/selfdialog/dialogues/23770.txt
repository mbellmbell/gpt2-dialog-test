"__SUPERHERO__ You have seen Logan correct?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes , I have see all the x men and wolverine movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Can we discuss Dafne Keen, was she not excellent?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Is that the actress playing laura the little girl?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yep that is her, at first I thought she may have been the girl from stranger things who plays eleven."
"__SUPERHERO__ Funny I wondered the same thing at first. They are both such strong little girls and big talents."
"__SUPERHERO__ I especially like Dafne. I know she did not say too much but that is one sign of a good actor."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree not much dialogue wise for her but she pulled her weight and was able to emote so well no words were needed to feel her emotions."
"__SUPERHERO__ Exactly and to have that skill and power at such a young age is so impressive to me."
"__SUPERHERO__ i bet she has a high IQ a lot of child stars do. I think at least you have to have a certain understanding to grasp the scenes for what they are or the director is really good."
