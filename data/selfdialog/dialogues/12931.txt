"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Patriots winning the Super Bowl last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought they were the best team coming in and their comeback in the second half was unbelievable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you think they had a chance when they got down against the Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really didn't once it became 28-3. That's a tall hill to climb and they hadn't shown any signs that they would come back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They somehow got it going and made the plays they needed to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the Falcons did make some poor play calls that helped, but the Patriots took advantage of every opportunity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the reputation of the Patriots as cheaters?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they were wrong in recording signals like they did several years ago, but I think the ball inflation/deflation was a big story about nothing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lots of people don't view their championships as being legitimate because of those scandals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The thing is that it can never be proven that another team would have won if the Patriots hadn't done the things they were accused of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that's true, but I think it casts a cloud on them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their championships are legitimate because they did win those on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just makes me wonder because if they were really confident in themselves they wouldn't need to cheat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe but I also think if you look at the results from the past several years they've shown how good they are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they can win again next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes because I don't see Brady slowing down at all and Belichick is a great coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dolphins are going to be better next year, then there's the Steelers and Chiefs to contend with."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the AFC East is a bunch of patsies and the Patriots will walk all over them. They might get a challenge from the Raiders or one of the teams you mentioned though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the Raiders. I think they may take that next step this year, them against the Patriots would be a great game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We did miss out last year when Carr got hurt because a Raiders vs. Patriots match up would be a lot of fun."
