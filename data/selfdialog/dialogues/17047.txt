"__MOVIES__ Have you see the new Harry Potter movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them? Yeah, I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ And? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, I don't see how it had anything to do with the original books other than the magic, but it was okay."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! That's because it's not really a prequel, it happens like fifty years before the books."
"__MOVIES__ That explains why I didn't see any cameos, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not, it's based off of one of the text books in the original series, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Huh. Well it had a lot of character for a textbook!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was just as good as the originals, myself."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't go that far. I thought the originals had better plots."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I just thought the character development was better in this one."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give you that, I liked Newt more than I ever liked Harry."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Newt the best? He's so adorable!"
"__MOVIES__ He's definitely a shy kind of guy, but he seemed friendly enough."
"__MOVIES__ I loved how he was so awkward around humans but great with his animals."
"__MOVIES__ His niffler was cute. Do you think him and the girl will get together?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, I don't know if you want spoilers for the next two movies."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I guess it's in the book?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, in the book they get married. They're super cute."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's not the sort of spoiler I mind. I'll look forward to watching that."
