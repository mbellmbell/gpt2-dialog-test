"__BASEBALL__ Did you see Jose Batista get hit while up to bat last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ No.  And I thought that is only a controversy when he's playing the Baltimore Orioles."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes!  It usually is.  In fact he is playing them tonight; we should watch the game."
"__BASEBALL__ I wonder if there is anything brewing between those two teams this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah.  There always is.  I wouldn't be surprised if he gets hit between the letters first pitch!"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, you have to remember they will be more focused on winning then anything."
"__BASEBALL__ You never know.  People are people and when they hold grudges, I think that might trump the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Not when millions of dollars are on the line!"
"__BASEBALL__ That's true.  Who is favored anyway?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Orioles have a better record, but have been in a bit of a slide lately."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that's what I heard."
"__BASEBALL__ I wouldn't be surprised if Toronto took it to them tonight."
"__BASEBALL__ Me either.  What time is the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think first pitch is at 7:05pm."
"__BASEBALL__ Who is pitching for the Orioles?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not sure, possibly Dillon Bundy?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's a pretty decent pitcher."
"__BASEBALL__ He more the decent.  He is the ace of their staff right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Sorry, I forgot Tillman is still down."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, until he gets his body and mind right again, Bundy is the ace."
