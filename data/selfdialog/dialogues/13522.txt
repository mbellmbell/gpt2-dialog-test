"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey what is your favorite football team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants!  How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The colts!  How do you think Eli will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will maybe win 8 or 9 games but won't go to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The colts will definitely win the division this year don't you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, he has been struggling in recent years.  Bring back Payton!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Eli is better than Payton?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The rings make them both equal, though Eli won his with one team.  I think Payton was overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He certainly was successful with the Colts as far as winning divisions, but it only translated into one Super Bowl win.  What year did Eli win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 2007, right after Payton won his.  Have you ever been to a game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw the Colts play the Patriots in Foxboro in 2010.  The Colts got plastered by like 30.  Have you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've never seen an NFL game.  Isn't it expensive?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got my ticket through my work, and it cost me $300 for bus, tickets and food."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can afford that!  How was the food?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was great tailgating food.  I ate so much.  We had to bring our own alcohol though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course.  Is your job running any more trips?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not for the colts or the Giants.  Have you always been a Giants fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My whole life.  How long have you liked the Colts?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ E"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ {}"
