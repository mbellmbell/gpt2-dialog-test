"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you know what the video of Lady Gaga singing in the car with a british guy is called?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Of course! Thats a segment called 'Carpool Karaoke' from 'The Late Late Show With James Corden'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, thats it! Have you seen it?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Only 15 times haha. I love all the 'Carpool Karaoke' videos, but the Lady Gaga one is a top favorite of mine."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I couldn't believe how amazing Lady Gaga's voice sounded completely natural in that car!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's incredible, pure raw talent. Her voice has so much emotion in it, I can feel her words."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I liked seeing her personality shine through once she relaxed. James Corden is hilarious too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ If you like that one, then you have to watch some of his other videos. My favorite part was when she explained part of the lyrics to Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes! When she said that 'Ra-ra-ro-ma-ma is like saying romance' it finally made total sense to me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me too. I had never thought of it that way before, but now I wonder how I ever missed that; its so simple!"
