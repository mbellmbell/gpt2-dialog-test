"__MOVIES__ Hey, you know those movie where a cop is investigating something, and in the end it turns out to be paranormal or supernatural?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, what about them?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, is there a name for that type of movie? Is that a genre?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe conspiracy thriller?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think so. Conspiracy thrillers usually have corporations or governments behind things."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it could turn out that the government is being run by demons or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, but that's not really what I mean."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe there's not a name for it? It's just a mashup of genres?"
"__MOVIES__ You'd think there would be. Like take The Devil's Advocate for example."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's supernatural, kind of a drama."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it's also a thriller, because the characters don't realize that Al Pacino is the devil, and that Keanu Reeves is his son."
"__MOVIES__ So you're looking for movies like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, not exactly. Take the other Keanu Reeves move Constantine, though."
"__MOVIES__ He's been in a lot of supernatural thrillers, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but you're missing the point."
"__MOVIES__ Which is that the two movies are similar, or they aren't?"
"__MOVIES__ They sort of are. It's more of a supernatural, action movie though."
"__MOVIES__ Wait! I think that's an occult detective story!"
"__MOVIES__ I think you're right. That's the genre I was thinking of."
"__MOVIES__ It must be! Those stories always start out normal, but then they end up involving ghosts or monsters or something."
