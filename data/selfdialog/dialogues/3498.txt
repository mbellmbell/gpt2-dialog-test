"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite rapper of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ That's tough. Do you mean my personal favorite, or who I think is the most skilled?"
"__MUSIC__ How about both?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's hard to discount Jay-Z as perhaps the best overall rapper."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ He has a great combination of lyrical prowess, technical ability, and mainstream appeal."
"__MUSIC__ I get that."
"__MUSIC__ He also has paid his dues. He's been in the game for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Jay-Z album?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of fans will will Reasonable Doubt or The Blueprint, but I think The Black Album is his magnum opus."
"__MUSIC__ All three of those are great."
"__MUSIC__ In terms of how I personally favor, though, I've got to go with Andre 3000 from OutKast."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think anyone is going to disagree with you there."
"__MUSIC__ There are few groups with such consistently great records. You can't even say that about Jay-Z."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite OutKast album?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Aquemeni, however I think the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I like Andre, but I think his partner Big Boi is often overlooked."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! Speakerboxxx was a great solo effort and proved that Big Boi could hold his own."
"__MUSIC__ I think Idlewild is probably their weakest album."
"__MUSIC__ I think so too, but it's still great, which goes to show how good OutKast is."
