"__MOVIES__ Apparently, they're doing a new Blade Runner movie."
"__MOVIES__ Man, I'm so sick of all these reboots!"
"__MOVIES__ I hear you, but this isn't actually a reboot."
"__MOVIES__ So it's a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Basically, yeah. It's still got Harrison Ford, but he's not the main guy this time around."
"__MOVIES__ Who is?"
"__MOVIES__ I think maybe Ryan Gosling? But I can't confirm."
"__MOVIES__ Gosling is a pretty good actor, so I'm fine with that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he has impressed me with some of his recent movies."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I know how to feel about a Blade Runner sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm similarly ambivalent."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of the all time great movies, no doubt."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, it's a sci fi classic."
"__MOVIES__ But I just know these days Hollywood is trying to build all these 'cinematic universes'."
"__MOVIES__ Because they're a cash cow. Marvel, DC, Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, and I can see them thinking they can do that with Blade Runner."
"__MOVIES__ Which would be a mistake, I'd say."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Blade Runner was always more about mood, atmosphere and the like than about the world."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. If they lose the mood and stuff the sequel with a bunch of labored world building, it will be a shame."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to need to see what critics say about it before going to watch it."
