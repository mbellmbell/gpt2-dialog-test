"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like The Strokes. They have brought Rock into the Modern Era."

"__MUSIC__ There are a lot of great ones. My favorite has to be 'Is This It?' since it is the one that really got the band going."
"__MUSIC__ That is a great song! I like that one almost as much as Ciggarette Daydreams by Cage The Elephant."
"__MUSIC__ I also like that band and song! What is another song you like by Cage The Elephant?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Cold, Cold, Cold' is an excellent song by them with a great chorus."
"__MUSIC__ Yes that is a wonderful song. I also like Shake Me Down but that song is really sad."
"__MUSIC__ It is a great song but one of the reasons I don't like it is because it is sad! I don't think artists should write sad music."
"__MUSIC__ I have to disagree. It is important to address all emotions even the ones we are uncomfortable with."
"__MUSIC__ You might be right. I can see how sad music can help people get through tough times."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly now you see what I am talking about."
"__MUSIC__ Other then the two bands we have mentioned, are there any other songs you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Ain't No Rest For The Wicked is another great song by Cage The Elephant."
"__MUSIC__ I agree that is a good song."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for agreeing. Maybe we should throw a music party sometime and play songs from these two bands."
"__MUSIC__ Your welcome and that is a great idea! I'm sure there are a few other great bands we could fit into the playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely and we should come up with at least 2 other bands."
"__MUSIC__ Yes some possiblities are: Portugal The Man and Two Door Cinema Club."
