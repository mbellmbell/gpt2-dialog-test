"__MUSIC__ What was the most recent concert you went to?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to see Metallica at Stadium Negara when I was in Malaysia."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, what was it like seeing them in a foreign country?"
"__MUSIC__ The excitement of the crowd was infectious and emotional. It was the first time Metallica had played in south east asia in thirty years!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, so everyone must have been so excited!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes they really were! There were the older fans who grew up on Metallica and were so excited to see their favorite band for the first time."
"__MUSIC__ And young fans going to their first concert, I bet."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! Although it was odd, there were a lot of businessmen there who took beautiful women to the concert, wearing sexy dresses and high heels."
"__MUSIC__ That is weird. Not exactly what you'd expect to see at a Metallica concert."
"__MUSIC__ Well I guess it was a monumental social event. People of all kinds came out."
"__MUSIC__ Did they play a lot of old songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! That was the great thing about it. They played almost exclusively old songs, and two newer songs off the awful Lulu album."
"__MUSIC__ That's great! I can see how it would be really emotional then, playing the songs everyone has loved since they were kids first discovering metal music."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! It was so great, I knew every word to every song except for the two off Lulu, and so did the rest of the crowd. We all sang along as one."
"__MUSIC__ I've actually never seen Metallica live. How is their performance?"
"__MUSIC__ A little bit awkward, to be honest. James Hetfield kept asking the crowd if they were still alive. He said it at least twenty times, like he couldn't think of anything else to say."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny. I heard he says that a lot at every concert."
"__MUSIC__ Does he? Maybe it's part of the show then. It really did come off as awkward to me though."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite song that they played?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Nothing Else Matters', of course. That was my wedding song."
