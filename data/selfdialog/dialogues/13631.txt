"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ who do you think the greatest quarterback ever was?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my opinion it was Peyton Manning. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I knew you were going to say that! for me, it is probably Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I respect your opinion, but I don't agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't have to agree, his rings speak for themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish Peyton had a better team a lot of the time he was playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't blame his shortcomings on not having a good team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not, I'm just saying if he had a better offensive line, he probably wouldn't have ever gotten hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And what does that have to do with this conversation?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he didn't ever get hurt, and he had a good offensive line, he would have won more rings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only person worth anything on the line was the center Jeff Saturday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This has turned into a pity party for you and Peyton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I'm just saying."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just saying what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It requires help. A quarterback can't do it all by himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess that's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And tom has had a lot of help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't argue with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good, so don't even try."
