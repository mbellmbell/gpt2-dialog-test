"__BEATLES__ They are my absolute favorite. What's your favorite song?"
"__BEATLES__ Hmm, that's a hard choice but I think In My Life. You?"
"__BEATLES__ Ooohh, nice choice.  I think mine is Eleanor Rigsby.  What era of their music do you like the most?"
"__BEATLES__ Probably what they were putting out in the 70s. I like that they were getting more experimental."
