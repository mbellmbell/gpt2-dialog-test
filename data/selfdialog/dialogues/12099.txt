"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for the football season to start! How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm probably not the person to ask; I don't follow sports at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I can't imagine that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The closest I ever get is when a team from an area I have a connection with is playing. I'm from Seattle, so  go, Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bet they're gonna miss Marshawn Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding! But they have some other standout players, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any other reasons you watch besides hometown team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do like some of the videos Seahawks  have online, throwing a football into a tire from the stands was impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that does show off some of the special skills the players have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it helps attract fans who maybe aren't that fond of football, but do grow to like the players as people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I never thought of it that way; I bet that's right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Another way to draw in fans, and business, of course."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they make a lot of money on all the shirts, hats, etcetera."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read that Russell Wilson brought in between $15-20 million last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, it's amazing, isn't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess people want a piece of the action, one shirt at a time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't even imagine the salaries they make besides."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does eem pretty high, but being paid well to risk injury, and most aren't in the game for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more into the games themselves and the action and how well the game is played."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've read that when you are really involved in sports and other activities, it's almost as if you were really playing."
