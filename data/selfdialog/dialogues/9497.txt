"__BASEBALL__ MLB needs to shorten these games."
"__BASEBALL__ I watched a game the other night have 10 runs scored total and it went 4 hours."
"__BASEBALL__ How do you suggest they do so."
"__BASEBALL__ Making relief pitchers at least throw to 3 batters."
"__BASEBALL__ I dont think you should do that."
"__BASEBALL__ Well it stops the pitchers from going out and going to commercial."
"__BASEBALL__ I think once they come in, they have to start throwing right away."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they practice in the back and then come in and throw more pitches."
"__BASEBALL__ Thatll save 30 seconds per reliever."
"__BASEBALL__ What about the amount of time between pitches?"
"__BASEBALL__ That too, make the batter not leave the box or its a strike."
"__BASEBALL__ See now we are getting somewhere."
"__BASEBALL__ I would also stop with the commercial breaks between innings."
"__BASEBALL__ Teams need that for ad revenue."
"__BASEBALL__ OK but you could do it during the inning during downtime."
"__BASEBALL__ If you are eliminating time between pitches there wont be."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure theres foul balls and the such."
"__BASEBALL__ I just dont think its feasible"
"__BASEBALL__ Fans going to the park wont mind these rule changes"
"__BASEBALL__ It translates more to TV In my opinion"
