"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest Marvel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2? You know it!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh! That's already in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it came out on the 5th. I saw it opening night."
"__MOVIES__ I'll definitely check it out this weekend then. I actually meant Dr. Strange though."
"__MOVIES__ Normally I'll see a Marvel movie right away, but I hate to say I just got around to seeing it last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Don't feel too bad. I've only seen it recently myself."
"__MOVIES__ What'd you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thoroughly enjoyed it, but honestly it wasn't my favorite. FAR from the worst though."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. I probably would have liked it better had I not seen Civil War fairly recently also."
"__MOVIES__ Ah yeah. That one is going to be hard to beat for certain."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but Spider-Man homecoming is coming up and Infinity War sounds extremely promising."
"__MOVIES__ I LOVE Spider-Man, but I'm not too nearly as excited for Homecoming as I am Gaurdians of the Galaxy vol 2 to be honest. Would have much preferred an older Spidey, and Garfield was the perfect actor in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I have mixed feelings. Homecoming feels true to the Ultimate comics universe, but Andrew Garfield really was the perfect adult Spider-Man so far anyways."
"__MOVIES__ New kid didn't do too bad in Civil War though so there's definitely potential. He captured Peter's smart mouth nicely."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and I'm really excited to see more of his interaction with Tony Stark."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of, that was a perfect casting for Iron Man."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's going to be hard to replace Robert Downey Jr. Think Infinity War is his last movie as Tony Stark."
"__MOVIES__ That's a shame. Wonder who they'll cast to replace him in Iron Man 4?"
"__MOVIES__ Same, but as long as it isn't Ben Affleck I think we'll be good. Marvel seems to know what they're doing so I trust their judgement completely."
