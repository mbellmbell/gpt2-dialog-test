"__BEATLES__ Are you familiar with the song 'Hey Jude'?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it's a Beatles song, right?"
"__BEATLES__ Right. I was just reading the other day that John Lennon wrote that song for his oldest son, Julian."
"__BEATLES__ Really? I didn't know that!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, he seemed to enjoy writing songs about his family."
"__BEATLES__ That's really cool. Can you name any others?"
"__BEATLES__ 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' is about a picture that Julian drew for him at school."
"__BEATLES__ Wow, Julian inspired some great music, didn't he?"
"__BEATLES__ He sure did."
"__BEATLES__ Maybe I should try listening to those songs again now that I know what they're about."
