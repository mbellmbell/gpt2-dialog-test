"__DISNEY__ Have you heard about some of the theories on Frozen and how other disney characters make appearances in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I have heard that Flynn and Rapunzel are in one of the scenes preceeding the coronation."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, there is also a theory about connection to other movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Is that the part where they say Ariel used to play in the shipwreck from Ana and Elsa's parents?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but also that perhaps her parents were not dead, and were on a stranded Island."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that one too, that they were like Jane and Tarzan?"
"__DISNEY__ I am not sure about that, but I heard that the reason Rapunzel was there was because Elsa's parents were traveling to her wedding when they died."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that one too, very interesting fan theories!"
"__DISNEY__ Also I heard that the Let it Go song was added after they nearly finished the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I do not think that is true, but if it is, that is cool."
