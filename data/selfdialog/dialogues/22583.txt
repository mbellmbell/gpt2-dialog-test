"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie? Mine is The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ I love The Lion King, but I cry every time Simba's dad dies!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it is literally the most heartbreaking scene in a movie."
"__DISNEY__ It's worse than when Bambi's mom dies."
"__DISNEY__ The music is great, though, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh definitely - who doesn't sing along with Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa?"
"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite song from the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably, 'I Just Can't Wait to be King!'"
"__DISNEY__ Did you like the sequel at all?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I thought The Lion King II: Simba's Pride was totally unnecessary."
