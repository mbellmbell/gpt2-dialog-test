"__STAR_WARS__ What would change about the star wars movies of you could?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have put them out in chronological order."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? That would have ruined the reveal of darth vader as luke's father."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes that is a draw back but seems confusing to me them being made they were. what would you change?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish I could have been there to stop lucas from using CGi too much in the newer episode 1, 2,3,."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya, it was not as believable as the costumes for the storm troopers."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was my major complaint of that series overall. he got too carried away with the cgi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed, so glad the newest ones seem to have realized his errors and improved on them,"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya, the cgi they use now is tasteful and really amazing, for example carrie fischer young again at the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was so believable, don't think they could have done that any better!"
