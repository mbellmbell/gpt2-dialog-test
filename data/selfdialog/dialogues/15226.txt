"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen all Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I did, and I didn't really like them?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why not?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well after the reading the books the movies left a lot to be desired."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree, I think the movies almost made it into a kid genre when it wasn't like that before."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think could've changed that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think if they incorporated some more 'adult' type themes it could've been better?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Adult themes like what?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just more gore and maybe some swearing."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yea, when I was a teenager I was cursing up a storm."
