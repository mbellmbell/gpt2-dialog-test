"__STAR_WARS__ Remember when Luke trained with Yoda?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a weird planet"
"__STAR_WARS__ Dagoba system. Very remote location."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and full of all kinds of weird creatures."
"__STAR_WARS__ And then there was that one scene where Luke encounters Darth Vader"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah and he chops off his head."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, and then it shows his face as Darth Vader"
"__STAR_WARS__ I never understood that scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it was a foreshadowing of things to come?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Perhaps, I guess Yoda was just screwing with him."
