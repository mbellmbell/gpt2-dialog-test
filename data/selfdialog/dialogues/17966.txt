"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite 'Lord of the Rings' movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a really tough question.  I love them all."
"__MOVIES__ I think mine is 'The Fellowship of the Ring.'"
"__MOVIES__ I guess if I have to pick, I'd go with 'Two Towers.'"
"__MOVIES__ It's tough because they're all masterpieces."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I think I leaned away from picking the third one because it took forever to end."
"__MOVIES__ True, those 5 or 6 endings went way too long."
"__MOVIES__ It really was the perfect fantasy trilogy.  They covered everything they needed it."
"__MOVIES__ It really did hit all the marks.  An amazing plot, journey, characters, drama, action, tension...everything."
"__MOVIES__ No other hero's journey is as epic as Frodo's."
"__MOVIES__ Frodo was obviously important, but Sam was my favorite.  Frodo never would have gotten to Mordor without Sam."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, though my favorite was Gandalf."
"__MOVIES__ That scene when Gandalf reappears to the Fellowship in the 2nd movie was epic."
"__MOVIES__ That was such a cool scene."
"__MOVIES__ Can't believe the first movie came out in 2001."
"__MOVIES__ It's been that long already?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, it's hard to believe.  And the effects and scale of that movie were so advanced for the time."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you really felt like you entered Middle Earth while watching."
"__MOVIES__ The Hobbit trilogy was fun too but..."
"__MOVIES__ But it can't compare to Lord of the Rings."
