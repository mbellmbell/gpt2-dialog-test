"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the new sith, Kylo Ren; in the new Star War's episode?"
"__STAR_WARS__ This is the one who is taking Darth Vader's place?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, apparently Darth Vader, who ended up being Luke Skywalker's father has a following."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right I heard that Kylo Ren is Darth Vader's grandson in the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he is the son of Han Solo, and Leia Organa."
"__STAR_WARS__ So do you think Kylo Ren will eventually turn to the light side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am not to sure, the movie get's pretty dark near the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ Does it get as dark as Episode 3 when the young jedi's are killed?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, there is always something that keeps the sith going down the dark path."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am glad that they have a new jedi to battle him, hopefully Luke take care of the sith for good."
