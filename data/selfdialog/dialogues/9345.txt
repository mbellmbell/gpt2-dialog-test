"__BASEBALL__ I miss the good old days for my Atlanta Braves"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it's been a long time since they have been competitive."
"__BASEBALL__ I mean they do have the best hitter in baseball, Freddie Freeman!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but Freeman just got hurt. He broke his wrist!"
"__BASEBALL__ Are you serious! How long is he scheduled to be out?"
"__BASEBALL__ They are saying 8 to 12 weeks."
"__BASEBALL__ Jeez, that's a long time. Well that sucks but it wasn't like the Braves were going anywhere this year."
"__BASEBALL__ I know but at least you could watch Freeman swing a bat, now there's no reason to watch this team."
"__BASEBALL__ I just keep waiting for this team to turn a corner and become elite again."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah me too, but they have so many holes on this roster, I still think they are a long way away."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it's really sad to see how far they have fallen"
"__BASEBALL__ As a kid, I used to watch this team play all of the time on the superstation."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah me too, that's how I became a fan of this team."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but we are a long ways away from Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah those guys are not walking out of the bullpen any time soon."
"__BASEBALL__ Nope. They just built that new stadium, so maybe that will give the fans something to be excited about."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe, but when my team isn't winning it doesn't matter where they are playing"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah being in constant rebuild mode is not a lot of fun"
"__BASEBALL__ I miss the good old days of tomahawk chopping our way to another division title and World Series Appearance"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, well don't hold your breath it could be a while"
