"__COMEDY__ Have you ever seen Hear No Evil, See No Evil?"
"__COMEDY__ No, but I think I've heard of it. What's it about."
"__COMEDY__ It stars Gene WIlder and Richard Pyror, as a deaf man and a blind man respectiviely. They get involved in a murder case and are the prime suspects."
"__COMEDY__ Okay, now I get the name, who else is in it?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, Kevin Spacey plays a porfessional killer and one of the real murderer's, along with actress Joan Severance."
"__COMEDY__ This sounds interesting, could I get more detail on the plot?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, the murder is off Richard Pyror's character's bookie, who was smuggling a valuble rare gold coin for the killer's and tried to keep it for himself."
"__COMEDY__ Okay, this makes a bit more sense to me as why the guys are accused of the murder."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, it was hilraious seeing them have to cooperate to escape custody and elude the killers, as RIchard can do things due to his hearing that Gene can't and vice versa."
"__COMEDY__ This sounds like it could be a funny movie, I'll have to look for it."
