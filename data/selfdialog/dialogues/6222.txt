"__STAR_WARS__ Do you agree with what some people are saying? That The Force Awakens was nothing more than rehashing of A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean clearly there are a lot of similar themes there. But overall, I think that that's exactly what fans needed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh really? How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ well we needed to wash the bad taste of the prequels out of our mouths. We needed to see some of our old favorite characters, we needed familiarity to get back on board."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see your point there. So you don't think they should have done anything different?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think I would have changed a thing honestly. A lot of people didn't like The Force Awakens, but I thought it was great."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see your point on the nostalgia front. I would have tried to change the storyline though, make it different."
"__STAR_WARS__ Have you heard how people are ragging on Kylo Ren for losing to Rey in that fight? I think people are being silly about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think that? I think he acted like a wimp."
"__STAR_WARS__ Consider these facts; He took a Chewbacca blaster bolt (which we'd already seen decimate two stormtroopers earlier), survived the destruction of that temple thing, got damaged in the shoulder by Finn, engaged in two prolonged battles and still barely lost to Rey. I think that was impressive."
