"__BEATLES__ Do you think the beatles are the greatest band of all time?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know about that, they have some great hits but the best band ever is a hard title to win!"
"__BEATLES__ Come on, who else could have had EVERYONE at the superbowl singing one song like McCartney did with Hey Jude?"
"__BEATLES__ That's true! But for every song like Hey Jude that the Beatles had they also had songs like Taxman which were kind of mediocre."
"__BEATLES__ Fair point, however the number of good songs of theirs far outweigh the number of bad."
"__BEATLES__ Don't get me wrong I love the Beatles! I always put on the Revolver album when I need a pump up in the car."
"__BEATLES__ That's a great call, for me I put on the 1's Album and just go back to their hits. Its refreshing and brings me back to a simpler time."
"__BEATLES__ A simpler time? The Beatles wrote about some heavy content. Lady Madonna might sound like a nice and light song but its very deep and emotional."
"__BEATLES__ True but for some reason their voices just relax me. I mean three of the greatest musicians of all time in one band? We'll never see anything like that again."
"__BEATLES__ You mean John, Paul, and George? Thats fair. I guess the Beatles could be considered the best band ever."
