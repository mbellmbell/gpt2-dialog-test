"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Rough Night?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one where the women kill someone during a party?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is the one."
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen that one.  Is it any good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was really funny."
"__MOVIES__ So who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Scarlett Johansson is the big star, but it has a bunch of other people you would recognize."
"__MOVIES__ So they have a party and someone ends up getting killed?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  Scarlett Johansson is getting married, so some old college friends throw her a bachelorette party in Miami."
"__MOVIES__ And things end up going too far?"
"__MOVIES__ The end up killing someone and spend the rest of the movie trying to figure out what to do about it."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't really sound like that original an idea."
"__MOVIES__ No, the concept has been done before, but they pull it off pretty well."
"__MOVIES__ Is this something that I could take my kid to see?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably not, it has an R rating, and it earned it."
"__MOVIES__ Would it make a good date night movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You both have a bit of a dark sense of humor, so it would probably work out pretty well."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, we will go see it next week."
"__MOVIES__ I hope you enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ Thank you."
