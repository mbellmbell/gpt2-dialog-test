"__BASKETBALL__ Do you remember the last time the Sixers made the finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, they've always been irrelevant."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sort of--they mostly are, but during the AI years they were decent."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay. And?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Remember when they were in the finals against the Lakers?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That was way back in the mid 90's?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, 2001."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, feels forever. Hahaha"
"__BASKETBALL__ Very funny. Anyway..."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you have a point?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I saw AI on TV and was just remembering the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ What was so interesting about them?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, when the Sixers won, it was by just a couple of points. But their losses were blowouts."
"__BASKETBALL__ Seriously?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, AI scored almost 50 and the Sixers won in overtime by 6."
"__BASKETBALL__ What about the other 4 games?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They lost 98-89, 96-91, 100-86, and 108-98."
"__BASKETBALL__ Those aren't blowouts."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess they just seemed like it at the time."
"__BASKETBALL__ Might just be size: tiny AI vs huge Kobe and Shaq."
