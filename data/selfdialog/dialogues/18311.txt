"__MOVIES__ My husband and I watched a great movie last night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?  What was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called No Country for Old Men.  It won an Emmy or something."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I heard of that!  It has Tommy Lee Jones, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  I love Tommy Lee Jones."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  He's a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, totally.  This was a great movie, although definitely a bit strange."
"__MOVIES__ What was strange about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it wasn't your typical pace.  It moved very slow, although the suspense was ongoing."
"__MOVIES__ Was it boring?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I wouldn't say boring.  But it was just different and unique in how it was presented."
"__MOVIES__ It was kinda long if I remember correctly, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think almost two hours.  It did drag at some parts."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, do you think I should watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well overall it's worth seeing.  The cinematography is beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I heard."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and just the general quirkiness of it is interesting.  There's this really strange character."
"__MOVIES__ Tommy Lee Jones' character?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's the villain he's chasing.  He's very strange."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I will watch it tonight and see what I think!"
