"__ROCK__ Were you able to watch that new documentary about The Eagles?"
"__ROCK__ Sure did! My dad and I watched the entire thing a few nights ago."
"__ROCK__ No way! I watched it with my dad also, he's a huge Eagles fan."
"__ROCK__ I think any man born in the 1960's is an Eagles fan. Their music is still amazing today. What's your favorite song?"
"__ROCK__ Hard choice but I really enjoy listening to Life in the Fast Lane. It gets me pumped when I'm riding my motorcycle."
"__ROCK__ I love that song too but Hotel California is still my all time favorite."
"__ROCK__ I think both songs were released on the same album."
"__ROCK__ Indeed they were. The album is called Hotel California. It was released in 1976."
"__ROCK__ If I'm not mistaken, that album is one of the greatest selling albums of all time."
"__ROCK__ With 32 million copies sold world wide, I'd say you are correct my friend."
