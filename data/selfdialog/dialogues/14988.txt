"__ACTION__ Hey, do you like the marvel movies?"
"__ACTION__ Those are great action movies! Can't wait for the new Thor one."
"__ACTION__ Black Panther is going to be great too, I hope that one does really well."
"__ACTION__ I hope it does as least as great as Wonderwoman, you know. Really break some records out there."
"__ACTION__ Wonderwoman was amazing! It really was directed well with plenty of great action near the end."
"__ACTION__ Reminds me of the feeling of Guardians of the Galaxy, really. That sense of loss then pulling out the win at the end."
"__ACTION__ Both did have that punch moment, true. It has the whole drawing you in and making you really feel."
"__ACTION__ Speaking of action movies, Pacific Rim was another great one."
"__ACTION__ I didn't like that one as much, but the concept was truly unique."
"__ACTION__ Come on, giant robots? What's not to like?"
