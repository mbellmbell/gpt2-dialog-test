"__MOVIES__ Did you see Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I have heard it is good."
"__MOVIES__ I hear it is the best of all the DC comics movies so far."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I heard too. Of course, the recent ones have not been that strong."
"__MOVIES__ True, Batman vs Superman was terrible and Suicide Squad was disjointed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but is Wonder Woman better than the Dark Knight Batman trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that those were overrated, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Really? You didn't like them?"
"__MOVIES__ I did like them, but the first one with Scarecrow was kind of forgettable."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, what about the Dark Knight with Heath Ledger."
"__MOVIES__ That one is the most overrated of all. Heath's performance was great but the movie was choppy and disjointed."
"__MOVIES__ What! That is harsh."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. I think that it clearly showed signs of being trimmed for time before it was released. Lot's of scenes seemed half explained."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, What about the The Dark Knight Rises?"
"__MOVIES__ The best of the three, but still not my favorite comic book film."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, then what is?"
"__MOVIES__ From DC it would still be Super-Man with Christopher Reeve and from Marvel it is Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__MOVIES__ Those are both good."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, I do want to see Wonder Woman while it is still in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
