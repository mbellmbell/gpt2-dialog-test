"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Inside Out?"
"__DISNEY__ I absolutely love that movie! It's from both Disney and Pixar."
"__DISNEY__ Yes and when I went to see it with my kids I cried in the middle of the theater."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, I was blubbering like a baby when Bing Bong died."
"__DISNEY__ It did such a good job of delving into the mind of a young girl and what she was going through."
"__DISNEY__ I heard they employed psychologists to help with the script."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that too, and you can definitely tell."
"__DISNEY__ The animation is good, the comedy is on point, it has the heartfelt element."
"__DISNEY__ And it's very original. The only thing you can compare it to is that old show Herman's Head."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I used to watch that. But I think Inside Out is definitely more interesting and colorful than that ever was."
