"__DISNEY__ Do you like the traditional Disney Princess movies or the more current ones?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you referring to 'Snow White' and 'Cinderella' when you say traditional?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I think the 'Snow White' movie from 1937 would qualify as traditional."
"__DISNEY__ I did not know how old that movie was."
"__DISNEY__ I like the updated versions of some of the Disney Princess movies, like the second part to 'Cinderella'."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. The sequel versions reflect more of today's values for female characters."
"__DISNEY__ I like how the princesses involve many different girls from different places."
"__DISNEY__ I think that is what helps to sell so many tickets to these movies."
"__DISNEY__ I would like to see a 'super-hero' princess for Disney's next princess movie."
"__DISNEY__ I do not think 'princess' and 'super-hero' go together."
