"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the new Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean The Force Awakens and Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I thought they were great, did you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did but truthfully I saw those before I watched the first six episodes. I had to go back and watch them."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite of the original episodes?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to say A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's mine too. You know, I didn't even know Darth Vader was a cyborg."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me neither! I just learned that. He's my favorite character though."
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite is Princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it was a shock to find out she was Darth Vader's daughter."
