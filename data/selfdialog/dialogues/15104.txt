"__ACTION__ What was the weakest Action movies of all time?"
"__ACTION__ Weakest?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah. The most lame action movie."
"__ACTION__ That's hard to say because if the action is weak, then it is no longer considered an action movie."
"__ACTION__ Good point."
"__ACTION__ However, if I had to choose just one, I would choose 'The Last Action Hero'"
"__ACTION__ Was that the one with Arnold?"
"__ACTION__ Yah. Pump me up."
"__ACTION__ Why that movie?"
"__ACTION__ It had seriously lame action scenes, totally unbelievable villians, and yet it still had the guts to put the word 'Action' in the title!"
