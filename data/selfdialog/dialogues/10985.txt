"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am bored, do you want to do something?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like what? I am actually kind of bored myself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a few sports trivia games if you would like to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are there any NFL questions involved?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have not played in a while, but I think there are some."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL is my favorite sport by far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine to! I love watching the NFL more than anything else on television!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool, what a coincidence!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me and my dad have always argued about who the best quarterback of all time is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my personal opinion that would be Peyton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! The best quarterback of all time is Dan Marino."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, who does your dad think it is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He says Joe Montana, but he is a big San Francisco 49ers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then he might be a little bit biased in his opinion then!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is what I always say to him as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like Peyton Manning controlled games like no other quarterback in NFL history has ever done before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was great in terms of making adjustments at the line of scrimmage, but his performances in the playoffs hold him back in this argument."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, however, I would take John Elway before Marino. He has two rings to prove my point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do not think rings should matter when talking about the best Quarterback of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like they separate the true great ones from the pretenders."
