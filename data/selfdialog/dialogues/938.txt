"__MUSIC__ Do you like to listen to music?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I do! Don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, yes I do. I especially like the new top 40 hits I've been hearing lately."
"__MUSIC__ I like top 40 too. Especially Justin Timberlake!"
"__MUSIC__ He's awesome. And his music is uplifting."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly my thoughts. I wish I could listen to music everywhere I go."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that would be cool. I suppose you can though."
"__MUSIC__ How could I? I work in an office with a lot of stuffy people."
"__MUSIC__ I can just picture you walking around with your headphones on, jamming to top 40 hits."
"__MUSIC__ That would be funny, but it would probably get me fired."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I get it. Well, music soothes the soul."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it does. I think it's great therapy when I'm down."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that. I suppose they should come up with such a concept."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ You know, music therapy! I wonder if that's a thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Well if it is, sign me up! And if it isn't, maybe you're on to something!"
"__MUSIC__ I guess so! I'm going to look into that."
"__MUSIC__ I know I would sign up for it."
"__MUSIC__ Can you imagine how much fun it would be to operate a music therapy session?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, I can. I think I'm going to go do some research. Music is my life!"
