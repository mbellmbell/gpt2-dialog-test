"__MOVIES__ Did you hear that they are making a new Despicable Me movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes Despicable Me 3.  The kids want to see it.  When does it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ End of June.  It looks really funny.  The villian is some 80s guy who wears shoulder pads and has dance offs."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I saw the trailer and he looks pretty funny but my fav villian in the series is Scarlet Overkill from The Minion Movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I love that Scarlett Overkill was such a badass girl villian. Sandra Bullock was so good in the part."
"__MOVIES__ My kids love that young Gru is in The Minion movie.  He can be seen at Villian Con and then at the end of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that reminds me the new movie Gru is going to have a twin brother."
"__MOVIES__ That's weird since they never mentioned him having a brother.  Do they look alike?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Gru's twin has hair and dresses in white so he is the total opposite of Gru."
"__MOVIES__ Ha that's pretty funny.  Does Steve Carrell voice both characters?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so.  Speaking of Steve Carell I recently watched a movie where he plays a jerk stepdad."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I've seen the movie The Way Way Back.  It's a total departure for Steve Carell but I've noticed he is doing more interesting movies."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen him in Crazy Stupid Love?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Ryan Gosling?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and Emma Stone.  I thought they were so cute together."
"__MOVIES__ They must have had some chemistry because they did LaLa Land together too!"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that yet.  Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was entertaining but their were other Oscar Worthy films I liked better."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Manchester by the Sea was a great movie."
