"__MUSIC__ What drives me nuts is when sound engineers don't know what they're doing."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ There are just hundreds of songs where the cymbals or the bass is recorded all wrong."
"__MUSIC__ Well, cymbals are high-pitched 'Treble' sounds, short waves, and the bass is deep, low-pitched, like long-wave radio."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Like the long-wave radios they use on submarines, that can send a signal all the way around the globe."
"__MUSIC__ And it's how Elephants and Whales communicate with each other. They hate those submarines."
"__MUSIC__ And it's why you can hear your neighbor's stereo booming through YOUR walls. It's that bass wave."
"__MUSIC__ They've got to record the bass fiddle with the microphone AWAY from the strings, not right next to it."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely, otherwise you can't really hear it in the recording, but you can FEEL it shaking the walls or the inside of your car."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. I heard an old instrumental from 'The Wailers', from the 50's today, where the cymbals took over the whole recording."
"__MUSIC__ It can drive you nuts. It sounds just like a continuous, old-fashioned tape hiss."
"__MUSIC__ Dave Brubeck Quartet did a great job recording the string fiddle. I had their 25th anniversary album."
"__MUSIC__ 'Take 5' and 'Blue Rondo a la Turk', long versions, recorded live."
"__MUSIC__ It was amazing, with Paul Desmond on sax. He wrote the song."
"__MUSIC__ I remember how sad it was when he lost his eyesight."
"__MUSIC__ He did?"
"__MUSIC__ The Dave Brubeck Quartet was playing on stage somewhere, when Paul Desmond asked, 'Hey, are the spotlights changing colors?'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, no. What was wrong?"
"__MUSIC__ He had two detached retinas occur."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, man. And I thought for years that Ray Orbison was blind, with those sunglasses. And Joe Cocker had some nerve disease, which he didn't."
