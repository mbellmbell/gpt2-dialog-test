"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Less than one month until some sort of football begins"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's about time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will get over the hump to the Superbowl this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a feeling that the Cowboys are going to finally reach the big game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably should have made it there last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That pass rush they had wasn't god enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was exposed mightily during the Green Bay game in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was honestly the best game of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought it was over when the Packers were blowing them out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did I. Then the Cowboys kept scoring and it was suddenly a close game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't looked at the draft too closely, so I don't know if they drafted on the defensive end last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither did I. I don't have time to watch a three day event every April."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably will have a better defense than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's all they really need. Everything else can remain the same"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Elliott, Dak and an unstoppable O-line equals success every time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That offensive Jerry Jones built is insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aren't all five of the starters first round picks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are and their backups are even pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't Doug Free a backup yet he is actually pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he retired this year, so that depth isn't there anymore."
