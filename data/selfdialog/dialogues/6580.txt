"__STAR_WARS__ Which Star Wars movie do you think had the best protagonist?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Isn't Anakin really the protagonist of all of them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I think he's only really the protagonist for episodes two and three."
"__STAR_WARS__ So who's the protagonist for episode 1 then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Qui-gon? Or else Obi-wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay. And then Luke for four, five, and six?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think so. You can make an argument for Han in Empire though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han would be my favorite then."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Luke is the most interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess we'll have to agree to disagree."
