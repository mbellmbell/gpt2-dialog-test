"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that was awesome.  That blind guy was the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked him a lot.  He was funny, and so was that android."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and the speical effects for Peter Cushing's face were amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Tell me about it.  I also like how it basically ended at the first scene of A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was awesome.  And I was glad to see Darth Vader in it, even if only for a little bit."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, when that guy came to Vader's home and he choked him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Good one liner."
"__STAR_WARS__ But nothing was as cool as the Vader fight scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, he just plowed through them one after another like nothing."
