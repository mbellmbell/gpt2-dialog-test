"__MUSIC__ I miss old R&B."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ Old stuff that was back in the 90s or even the 80s and 70s."
"__MUSIC__ What's different about R&B now?"
"__MUSIC__ Right now it has no substance save a few people like Bruno Mars."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of things did you want to hear in the music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think before it had a message and wasn't all about the beat and nonsensical words."
"__MUSIC__ I see what you mean. A lot of music is kind of dumbed down for just being catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! That's what I mean entirely. The temptations and others actually had something to talk about."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow so you're going back that far in time I see. I liked Teddy Pendergass too."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! He was amazing and a lot of the music was about relationships back then."
"__MUSIC__ I think some of that music was pretty powerful in a lot of was but sometimes sort of repetitive."
"__MUSIC__ Repetitive? Compared to now?"
"__MUSIC__ Well if you compare it to now I suppose you have a point, but it was mostly relationships in the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ That is true, but there was a ton of variety and there were more than single word lyrics per sentence."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I see what you mean there, but I do find some modern artists still do well"
"__MUSIC__ I think they do, but you have people like Beyonce who has good music but several writers."
"__MUSIC__ Having a lot of writers is just a common thing now, but atleast the music is decent"
"__MUSIC__ Well I suppose thats true. Maybe one day creativity will take the front seat again."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I hope so too."
