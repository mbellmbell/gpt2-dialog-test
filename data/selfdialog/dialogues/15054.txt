"__ACTION__ Why does every action movie have to have some boring female character?"

"__ACTION__ I don't think women want to go see action movies."
"__ACTION__ They might. That's why they have a female character."
"__ACTION__ Predator didn't have a female character and it was awesome."
"__ACTION__ Wasn't the Predator a girl?"
"__ACTION__ I don't think it was."
"__ACTION__ I thought it was pregnant or something."
"__ACTION__ Well, if they want to make the Predator the female lead in all action movies I could live with that."
