"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the greatest team in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's easy, the '72 Miami Dolphins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh come on, really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, a perfect season warrants that I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was so long ago and its almost happened a few times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Almost doesn't count, ask Tom Brady if 18-1 is the same as 19-0."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The '72 Dolphins didn't win 18 games, they won 17."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but they went perfect through the regular season and the post season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think that makes them the best team ever though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not, who else was better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the 18-1 Patriots for one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously not, they couldn't win the big one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think they had a better team, maybe not a better season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Doesn't that translate directly into team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not necessarily, do you think the Dan Marino led Dolphins were a good team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I do, Dan the man baby!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they never won a superbowl did they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No they did not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My point exactly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see what you did there."
