"__MOVIES__ Its supposed to rain tomorrow afternoon.  Do you wanna go to the movies with the kids instead of the beach?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, what looks appropriate for them?"
"__MOVIES__ We could go see gaurdians of the galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds good.  We saw the first one last year right?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it came out in 2014, but we did see it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and the kids liked it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, they really liked Baby Groot and Rocket Raccoon."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Vin Diesel in it."
"__MOVIES__ Kinda, he's the voice of Baby Groot."
"__MOVIES__ Really, who's the big tough guy in it then?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you talking about Drax?"
"__MOVIES__ Who's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Drax the destroyer.  He's the big raging guy with all the red tattoo lines and the blades."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, thats him.  Who plays him?"
"__MOVIES__ Dave Bautista."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I liked him and the character played by the guy who's in Parks and Rec."
"__MOVIES__ Peter Quill, yeah he's played by Chris Pratt.  He does a great job in the role."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the whole cast is so good."
"__MOVIES__ So should I get tickets for us all."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, lets get the tickets and go even if it doesn't rain."
