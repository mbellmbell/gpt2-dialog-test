"__STAR_WARS__ What did think about Han Solo's death in the The force awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ To be honest I freaked out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why didn't you like it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course I didn't like it Han is my favorite scoundrel smuggler!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah dumb question I guess. Though I feel really sad that they killed him off."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do as well, but Harrison Ford stated that he wanted his character to die in Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I wonder why."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not sure but I have to say I was so happy to see him and Chewy together again."
"__STAR_WARS__ Totally! And the millennium falcon flying around again gave me goose bumps!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, yes that scene gave me some goose bumps as well."
