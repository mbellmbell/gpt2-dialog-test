"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of old movies?"
"__MOVIES__ You betcha. One of my favorite cable channels is TCM."
"__MOVIES__ Don't you just love it when they do a whole day of movies with a certain star in them?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. I also like the days when they feature one director."
"__MOVIES__ Let me tell you my favorite. I like the Hitchcock marathons."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! Me, too. What's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, his older films are better. It starts with Strangers on a Train, I think."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and then the ones with James Stewart as the leading man. Not many of them, but all great."
"__MOVIES__ You said it, Vertigo, Rear Window..."
"__MOVIES__ Were there any others?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't remember right at this moment. Too bad Hitch's later movies kinda declined in quality."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know, like Family Plot, one of his last, if not his last, it was awful."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but just before that he made a couple with his muse, Tippi Hedren, in them that we quite good."
"__MOVIES__ Right! The Birds and Marnie."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Sean Connery cool in Marnie?"
"__MOVIES__ Now, that's another topic. Sean Connery the movie star, what a hunk!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, too bad he retired."
"__MOVIES__ Well, like I say, there's always Turner Classic Movies and we can keep watching and watching."
"__MOVIES__ I can see so many of these 'old' movies over and over again, and they never get 'old'! Isn't that great!"
