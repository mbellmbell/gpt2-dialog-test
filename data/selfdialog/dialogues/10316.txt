"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So what is your favorite Tupac song of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, that's a tough one to answer!  He had so many great songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know!  It'd be easier to make a top ten list than to pick one."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, for sure.  But I guess if I had to pick one I'd pick Until the End of Time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yeah, I love that one.  I'd say California Love, though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, that's definitely on my top ten list."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wish he had kept making music.  He was unbelievable."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, he was truly a legend.  There will never be another artist like him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, definitely not.  It's a tragedy."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ At least we still have his music to preserve his legacy."
