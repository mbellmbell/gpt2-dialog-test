"__BASEBALL__ Hey did you see the baseball game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ What baseball game?"
"__BASEBALL__ The home game between the Bears and the Wings!"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I didn't even know they were playing.  When did the season start?"
"__BASEBALL__ This was the opening game."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh wow, I hadn't even heard about it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the stands were packed."
"__BASEBALL__ Where was it?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was at Armfield Park, the old ball field, remember?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I thought they were building a new stadium downtown."
"__BASEBALL__ They are but it's not ready yet."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh wow.  So who won the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ The bears did."
"__BASEBALL__ Really?  I thought the Wings would win for sure."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah so did I, they had a much better team last year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that's what I thought"
"__BASEBALL__ but that new coach they got apparently is no good."
"__BASEBALL__ really?  That Daniels guy?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, the new one from Florida."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I had heard he was supposed to be great.  Hmm, that's really disappointing."
