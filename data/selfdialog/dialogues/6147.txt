"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that Darth Plagueis The Wise was actually still alive during the Phantom Menace era?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No I actually did not know that. I know that he was the one who trained Sidious."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, actually he did discover Sidious back on Naboo, and had been lurking in the shadows ever since. His original plan was to co-rule from the shadows with Palpatine as Chancellor."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess we know how that turned out!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the Sith's plans never seem to actually go as planned. Sidious ended up killing him in his sleep."
"__STAR_WARS__ Speaking of, I was really sad that Darth Maul got killed off in The Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ He really was the best bad guy of that whole series of movies. It's depressing that he went out like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have preferred him over General Grievous any day. Talk about a way better villian!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't like how they kept introducing villains and then just killing them off in the same movie. Have some continuity."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. These one off bad guys are lame. I need consistency in my villains!"
