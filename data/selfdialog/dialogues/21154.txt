"__THRILLER__ Did you see the Book of Henry after all, like you wanted to?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I saw it a couple of weeks ago."
"__THRILLER__ Was it as suspenseful as the trailers made it out to be?"
"__THRILLER__ No, not at all. It was a kind of confusing movie."
"__THRILLER__ What do you mean?"
"__THRILLER__ It wasn't like a straight up thriller like I thought."
"__THRILLER__ What was it then?"
"__THRILLER__ Kind of a mix of black comedy, emotional, and a thriller."
"__THRILLER__ Well that sounds weird!"
"__THRILLER__ That pretty much sums up the movie. Weird!"
