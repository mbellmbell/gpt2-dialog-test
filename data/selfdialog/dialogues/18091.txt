"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the movie Dazed and Confused."
"__MOVIES__ That was the one that really put Mathew Mchoney on the map right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, he had some good one liners in that one."
"__MOVIES__ He has the sort of obsession with high school girls."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but you know I noticed something about that movie."
"__MOVIES__ What? That it is not that funny?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that nothing really happens."
"__MOVIES__ There is no real story I mean, just sort of people."
"__MOVIES__ I noticed there are a few other films like too."
"__MOVIES__ Where nothing really happens?"
"__MOVIES__ Like the Breakfast club."
"__MOVIES__ Stuff happens, they go to detention and then leave detention."
"__MOVIES__ A few things happen, but really nothing worth noting."
"__MOVIES__ I had never thought of it like that."
"__MOVIES__ There is a bit of character growth. But, no real arc to the plot."
"__MOVIES__ I had never even noticed. The events could happen in any order and still make sense."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, like a slacker film."
"__MOVIES__ I think the Clerks movies are kind of like that."
"__MOVIES__ But, they are meant to be sort of slacker funny."
"__MOVIES__ An on purpose movie of nothing."
