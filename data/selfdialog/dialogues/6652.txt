"__STAR_WARS__ The only one of the prequel Star Wars movies I really like is Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is that the third one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. It's the climax of the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you like that one? I never even got around to seeing it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I can understand that. The second one is very bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's just so slow, and the twists come out of nowhere."
"__STAR_WARS__ The first one, too, felt a bit unnecessary. And the explanation for what the force is doesn't help."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was rough. It made it feel less mystical."
"__STAR_WARS__ The third one, though, it helps you understand who Anakin is. And he's really the protagonist of the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've never thought of it that way."
