"__MUSIC__ Hey there what kind of music genre do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Anything really, easy listening, jazz, maybe a bit of pop rock."
"__MUSIC__ Oh what kind of Jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, all kinds really but I do like the old standard ones."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too..like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Keith Jarret."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah the Dukes for sure and anything trio like a piano, standing bass and drums..just something really simple and soothing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too. I prefer a jazz trio rather than an orchestra."
"__MUSIC__ Except Glenn Miller. He's good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he is one of the masters of orchestra."
"__MUSIC__ I like Natalie Cole also."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I like her album compilation, the one which she did the Unforgetable duet with her dad."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah Natalie and Nat King Cole duet that's pretty awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I like old standard mainstream jazz. It's relaxing and it has substance."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah unlike the pop music nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to say though for jazz, I like it except when listening to trumpet."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, why?"
"__MUSIC__ The trumpet usually gets noisy after a while especially when the soloist starts to improvise a lot. It's noisy."
"__MUSIC__ Ah yeah true, I prefer just a simple piano myself."
"__MUSIC__ I can listen to piano jazz for hours."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Piano jazz instrumental especially."
