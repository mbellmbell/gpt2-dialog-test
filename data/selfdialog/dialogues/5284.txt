"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like Bobba Fett from Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he was a great character, but when he was introduced in the Empire Strikes Back he did not have that many scenes."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. I wish they gave him more screen time. Even in Return of the Jedi, he did not as much time on screen as he should have."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was really upset when he fell into the Sarlacc pit in The Return of The Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought that was terrible, also. Jango Fett, who was Bobba's father in Star Wars: Attack of The Clones, had a really cool look to his armor because it was nice and shiney."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but Bobba, I felt, had a better looking armor because it was more worn, like he had seen a lot of battles."
"__STAR_WARS__ They both looked completely the same because Bobba was a clone of his father."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true because Bobba Fett and the Clone Troopers were clones of Jango."
"__STAR_WARS__ Bobba Fett was closest to Jango because Jango didn't want him altered like the Clone Troopers were."
"__STAR_WARS__ yep because Jango wanted a son and someone who was just like he was. Bobba and Jango were great characters and I wish they would have lasted throughout the entire second trilogy and they would have shown Bobba become a bounty hunter."
