"__MOVIES__ I just saw 'Roman Holiday' again. I adore that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Gregory Peck, and Audrey Hepburn! haven;t you ever seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's an old movie in back and white, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it's timeless! I don't even notice that it's in black and white after a while."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I'd like it. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Gregory Peck plays a reporter who is looking for a great story, and Audrey Hepburn plays a princess who gets lost in Rome after she runs away from the palace."
"__MOVIES__ Why does she run away? How does she meet Gregory Peck's character?"
"__MOVIES__ She runs away from her obligations, like having to preside over awards and committees, but it's an accident. She was tranquilized when she got too rambunctious."
"__MOVIES__ So then what happens? Just don't tell me the ending...then I won't need to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ The princess wanders and falls asleep near a park, and Gregory Peck's character finds her and takes her to his apartment because he doesn't want her to get in trouble."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't he know she's the princess?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not until later, Then he decides to try and write a story about her adventures, and gets a friend who is a photographer to take pictures all the while."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't she know he's a reporter? Wouldn't she stop the photographer?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he doesn't tell her, and the photographer has hidden cameras."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it sounds kind of interesting. What really makes the likable movie for you?"
"__MOVIES__ I just can't keep my eyes off of Gregory Peck! He was so young and handsome, and Audrey Hepburn was so beautiful..."
"__MOVIES__ I might try it. Peck was pretty impressive in 'To Kill a Mockingbird'."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, wasn't he? I love the sound of his voice, too."
"__MOVIES__ You've convinced me. I'll check it out tonight, with a glass of wine and some chocolates!"
