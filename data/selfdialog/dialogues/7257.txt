"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you listen to Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, I only have heard some of her hits."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's a legend and a true artist."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Is she though? She seems like a cookie cutter pop star to me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you mean? What other pop star has worn raw meat on their body as a dress?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wasn't Art Pop her last album? It's only for shock value so tabloids will print her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's a talented singer. What's not to like?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, she does sing better than some pop stars, but all her songs sound like everything else."
"__LADY_GAGA__ 'Pokerface' was a masterpiece! She even does tributes to classic rock legends. I think she performs jazz too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's great, but her talent and art image hasn't really kept her relevant. Her career seems to be on the decline."
