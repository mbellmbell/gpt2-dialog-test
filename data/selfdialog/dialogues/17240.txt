"__MOVIES__ I watched a great movie last night!"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  What was it."
"__MOVIES__ It was a documentary I found on Netflix"
"__MOVIES__ Cool.  What is the name of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called TalHotBlond."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I should say much about it.  It might ruin it for you."
"__MOVIES__ Can you give me the gist of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a man who murders someone over an online love triangle."
"__MOVIES__ Wow!  That sounds so scandalous!"
"__MOVIES__ It is definitely scandalous, but not in the way you would assume."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ I won't tell you any details, but you won't guess what happens."
"__MOVIES__ It's that crazy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  My mouth was on the floor at the end."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds so exciting!  I will watch it tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you definitely should.  I couldn't believe it was real.  I looked it up after the movie and it was!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think my husband will like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he'll like it.  It's not boring at all.  It is so weird you just can't stop watching."
"__MOVIES__ Nice!  Ok I'll watch it tonight with my husband if there isn't sports on."
