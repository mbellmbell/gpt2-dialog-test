"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Mine is definitely Beauty and the Beast!  I love that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, that's a great one.  It has a great soundtrack, too."
"__DISNEY__ I know, and all the characters are amazing.  They did a re-make recently but it was nothing like the original."
"__DISNEY__ They never are.  That movie made me cry!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's a tearjerker.  I love Mrs. Pots and the little teacup Chip, too."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, they are precious.  And the candlestick is hilarious."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, all the characters are truly great in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ I wish Disney was still producing movies like the old classics."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, me too.  It seems like they don't make them as good as they used to."
