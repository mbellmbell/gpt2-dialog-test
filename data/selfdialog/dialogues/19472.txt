"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the trailer for the new movie 'Beauty and the Beast'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it looks like it is going to be pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the first one Disney made in 1991?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, my daughter loved Belle."
"__MOVIES__ It was a really cute movie and it has a good life lesson in it."
"__MOVIES__ I know you really should not judge someone by the way they look."
"__MOVIES__ In the trailer the beast sort of has an attractive appeal. He does not seem so frightening."
"__MOVIES__ Emma Watson sure has turned into a beautiful young lady."
"__MOVIES__ She sure has but she was just the cutest little girl. I could tell she would be pretty when she got older."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know who the actor is that is playing the beast?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it is Dan Stevens."
"__MOVIES__ What other movies has he been in?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in The Guest and Downton Abbey, he is a pretty good-looking man."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I never saw those movies, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I do want to see Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Have they release it yet for the theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was released back in March."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well then it will be on DVDs really soon now. You might as well wait and watch it at home."
"__MOVIES__ But the movie theater seems to make a movie come to life."
"__MOVIES__ That's true and when you go to the theater you always remember who you was with."
