"__STAR_WARS__ It's funny how they use working titles when making films."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not sure what you mean."
"__STAR_WARS__ For instance, instead of calling it Star Wars, they'll call it something different like Blue Harvest."
"__STAR_WARS__ Guess what the working title of the second prequel was?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Search for More Money?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was actually Jar Jar's Big Adventure."

"__STAR_WARS__ It may not have been worse than Attack of the Clones anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ Very true!"
