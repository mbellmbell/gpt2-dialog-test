"__BASKETBALL__ So it looks like we will all finally get to see the Warriors vs. Cavaliers in the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, Seems as though we have been waiting forever!"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's obvious those were to two best teams in the league this year hands down."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I've been quite disappointed with the rest of the playoffs up to this point, blow out after blow out!"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true, but at least we have an amazing NBA finals to look forward to."
"__BASKETBALL__ No doubt about it, who do you have eventually coming out on top?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am really torn on this one; both teams have been dominant this post season."
"__BASKETBALL__ To me, the Cavaliers have been by far the most impressive team in the entire NBA playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's hard to argue especially since it is looking as though they will go into the finals undefeated."
"__BASKETBALL__ Actually, it is looking more and more like we will have two undefeated teams for the first time ever in NBA history."
"__BASKETBALL__ I am excited to see how LeBron handles the Big Four from Golden State."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea me to, but Kyrie Irving will play a major factor if the Cavs are to come out on top."
"__BASKETBALL__ Even though this is LeBron's seventh straight finals, I feel this will be his most challenging one yet."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm with you there, the Warriors might just have too much fire power."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kevin Durant went down once to Lebron in the finals, I have a feeling he is going to play very well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but that time he did not have the Splash Brothers to help him out."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, Curry and Thompson will make things a lot easier for Durant this time around."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, the will for sure and we have yet to factor in Draymond Green."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ultimately, I am inclined to believe that the Warriors will get their second championship in the past three years."
"__BASKETBALL__ I disagree, the Cavs are just too dominant right now, I think LeBron goes back to back."
