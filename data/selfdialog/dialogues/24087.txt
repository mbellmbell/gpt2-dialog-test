"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen Doctor Strange yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, I haven't."
"__SUPERHERO__ Cumberbatch gives an amazing performance!"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'd heard he did a really good job in that and really portrayed the Doctor well."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, he did and was able to maximize the hilarity in some of the more awkward moments."
"__SUPERHERO__ Hmm, I'd really not considered that there might be funny moments.."
"__SUPERHERO__ What? You act like you've never seen a Marvel movie before!"
"__SUPERHERO__ True, true. I should have considered that they always have those tongue-in-cheek or nerdy moments."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes you should have, you filthy casual."
"__SUPERHERO__ Haha! Don't worry, I will redeem myself by watching Doctor Strange tonight."
