"__POP__ Do you listen to Justin Timberlake a lot?"
"__POP__ Not a lot, but when he puts something out I do."
"__POP__ Yeah, it sucks that he never puts out music anymore."
"__POP__ I think the last full length thing he put out was the 20/20 experience."
"__POP__ He must be a perfectionist.  He takes forever, but it's all so perfect."
"__POP__ Well, I don't love everything he does right when he does it.  But later I go back and listen and it's awesome."
"__POP__ Yeah, it's like he's a few years ahead of his time."
"__POP__ At least he drops a few singles every now and then."
"__POP__ Yeah, like that song from Trolls."
"__POP__ Right.  Who else could make a kids' song so cool?"
