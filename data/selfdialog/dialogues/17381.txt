"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Long Survivor?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have, at least twice I think."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a really good movie. It was cool that they had real Navy Seals consulting very closely on the movie in order to make it very realistic."
"__MOVIES__ Were main actors real Navy Seals?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the four primary roles were played by actors, but the real 'Lone Survivor' played a support role in the movie, and you can imagine that he spoke up if something wasn't realistic."
"__MOVIES__ What role did the real 'Lone Survivor' play?"
"__MOVIES__ He (I forget his name) played a Seal that was part of the 4-person squad's larger unit, but was not deployed on the mission."
"__MOVIES__ What was the mission?"
"__MOVIES__ Four Navy Seals were sent up into the Afghan mountains, or Afghan 'Kush,' and tasked with asassinating a Taliban leader."
"__MOVIES__ Why the title 'Lone Survivor'?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the four-man unit of Seals came under attack, and ultimately only one survived. He later wrote a book about the experience entitled 'Lone Survivor.'"
"__MOVIES__ So the movie was based on the book? Were there any hollywood-type liberties taken with the actualy story?"
"__MOVIES__ Well yes. In interviews that you can watch on Youtube, the Lone Survivor said the battle was altered in order to fit it into a reasonable length film."
"__MOVIES__ Was that the only difference between the movie and the actual mission?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the Long Survivor also said that the injuries suffered by the deceased Seals were more gory than depicted in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who played the staring role in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It was some famous actor - I forget his name but early in his career he was a white rapper who went by 'Marky Mark.' Mark Whalberg is his name."
"__MOVIES__ Would you say that is your favorite war movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there are several war movies that I like, so it would be difficult to pick a favorite. But Lone Survivor would definitely be among the best."
