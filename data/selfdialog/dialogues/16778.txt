"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Heartbreak Ridge?"
"__MOVIES__ With Gunnery Sargent Thomas Highway, played by the Majorly awesome Clint Eastwood?"
"__MOVIES__ So I'll take that as a yes then."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely yes, I watched it with my dad all the time. He's a Marine too around that time period."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa that's pretty cool to have a connection like that to a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well it's an amazing movie even without a connection like that."
"__MOVIES__ I loved it when he would just pop up out of nowhere with an AK-47."
"__MOVIES__ 'an Ak-47, the preferred weapon of our enemy, it makes a very distinctive sound when fired; remember it.'"
"__MOVIES__ Wow I thought I was the only one that remembered that."
"__MOVIES__ Heck no, when Gunny tells you to remember something, you better."
"__MOVIES__ Who was the guy that robbed him in the beginning?"
"__MOVIES__ You're talking about the Earl of Funk, the Duke of Cool, Ayatollah of rock'n'rolla; Mr. Stitch Jones."
"__MOVIES__ You weren't kidding when you said you've seen it before."
"__MOVIES__ Only 3 times a year since I was 5, so about 70-80."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is just way too many."
"__MOVIES__ Like I said I really like the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well anyway, I laughed so hard when Stitch tried to get Gunny beat up by Swede."
"__MOVIES__ I can't help but chant with them every time, even though I know what's about to happen."
"__MOVIES__ I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that you can pretty much quote that whole movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you want them alphabetically by character's name or actor's? Or just talk straight through the script?"
