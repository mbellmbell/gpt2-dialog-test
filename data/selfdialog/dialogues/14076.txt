"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been watching the basketball playoffs at all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah! The Cavaliers swept the Raptors."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavaliers will probably end up playing Boston."
"__BASKETBALL__ You think so?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. I don't think the Wizards can beat Boston."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they can, the series is still pretty close."
"__BASKETBALL__ The problem is, all Boston has to do is win one more game and then they advance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that is true, do you think it will go to game 7?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably not. I think the Wizards will lose to Boston in game 6."
"__BASKETBALL__ That sucks man, I know that the Wizards are your team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but I think the Cavaliers will definitley beat Boston."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think so, too. I think Boston is overrated."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think will win the whole thing?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am almost positive Golden State will."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I think so too. They are just too good."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wonder how long they will be this good?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am not sure. I mean if Curry continues to play for them they could be the Patriots of the NBA."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I agree. We'll have to see."
"__BASKETBALL__ We should watch the finals together. I'll text you later about it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, sounds good. Talk to you later!"
