"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This should be an exciting NFL season, shouldn't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh the Dallas Cowboys for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should be excited, the Cowboys have gotten better and have an exciting young quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I love Dak Prescott, and the offensive line is one of the best in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe this is the Cowboys year to go all the way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much!  Who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For me it's the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you've had a lot to cheer about the last 15 years or so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we've been spoiled.  Tom Brady has been probably the best quarterback ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not to mention Bill Belichick may be the best coach ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt, without him none of this would have happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Brady will play a lot longer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has said he wants to play at least 5 more years, I wouldn't put it past him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would put him close to his mid 40s, has that ever happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think anyone has played at a high level at that age."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, either way I think Garoppolo will be ready, they've been grooming him for years now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so because Brady won't be playing forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure the Patriots will be fine either way.  Good luck to you and the Patriots this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same to you and the Cowboys!"
