"__DISNEY__ Hey, did you watch Disney movies as a kid?"
"__DISNEY__ Actually, I didn't watch that many. Why, do you want to watch one?"
"__DISNEY__ I was definitely one of those kids that was super into Disney. My favorite was the Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, now that I'm Googling it it turns out a lot of movies I watched were Disney! Just mostly live-action movies."
"__DISNEY__ Oh! Did you ever see 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes-that one was my favorite! It made me want to be a marine biologist. I also loved Treasure Planet."
"__DISNEY__ That one is animated though, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep! I didn't say every single one I'd seen was live-action, though."
"__DISNEY__ Well if you haven't seen the Lion King yet, you better!"
"__DISNEY__ That's what everyone says. I guess I'm just stubborn!"
