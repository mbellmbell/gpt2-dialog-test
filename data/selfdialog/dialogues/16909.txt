"__MOVIES__ So are you looking forward to the new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not really a DC fan, but after seeing the trailer I was kinda intrigued!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, right? It looks like it might actually be good!"
"__MOVIES__ Which is impressive, considering how bad Batman vs. Superman was."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think Batman v. Superman was that bad, some of the character moments were nice."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the problem is that word 'moments.' A movie should have more than a few of those."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right. Still, I have high hopes for Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought I'd say that about a Wonder Woman movie, but I agree."
"__MOVIES__ She certainly hasn't had much luck in film in the past."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it won't take much for this to be the best Wonder Woman movie."
"__MOVIES__ I like the humor I've seen in the trailers."
"__MOVIES__ I actually laughed out loud at a couple parts, so hopefully they've gotten away from that dark and gritty feel they thought Superman had to have."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, trying to make Superman dark was just completely the wrong call."
"__MOVIES__ After The Dark Knight's success, they kinda thought everything had to go that route."
"__MOVIES__ Which is totally not true, let super heroes have their own personalities!"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. It doesn't help either, I think, that Zach Snyder's direction is so... bleh."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ He's great at creating a moment, like you said, but he tries to make every shot too serious and important sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ He does use slo mo a lot, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, especially in his battle scenes. Hopefully Wonder Woman won't have that as much."
