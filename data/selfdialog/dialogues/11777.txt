"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright my man, let's talk about the NFC North."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, but first we need to acknowledge a mistake we made. When we talked about the NFC South,  we left off Tampa Bay and included the Rams!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man ! What a mistake! Ivery get to revise my picks!  Winston is good enoughere to get them in the playoffs this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agrees!  Revised standings for the South NO, TB in a wildcard, ATL then CAR in last."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, on to the North. We already know the Bears aint going to do nothing,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah 3-13 if they are lucky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ GB is the standard bearer there. Aaron Rodgers can not be stopped."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that's right! GB will be the number one seed for the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So we got #1and #4 figured out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So where do we put Detroit and Minnesota?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man. Who is going to start at QB for the Vikings?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's tough! Bridgewater or Bradford? Two qbs equals no qbs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And AP gone to New Orleans!  I can't see them co.peting this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dont know you might be right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Detroit is still a threat as long as they have Matthew Stafford."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. I dont care who they play. I'm always happy to watch them on Thanksgiving Day"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its a tradition for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I'm going GB, DET, MIN, and CHI way back"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Way back indeed! Cutler gone and they don't know if Glennon or Trubisky  will start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't matter! They are still the Bears!! Hahaha."
