"__MUSIC__ I was really shocked when David Bowie died."
"__MUSIC__ Me, too. I didn't even know he was so ill. Did you?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I had no idea. I read somewhere that he tried to keep it quiet on purpose. Just wanted to be private."
"__MUSIC__ I don't blame him. I would probably do the same thing if I was famous."
"__MUSIC__ Boy, he had some amazing moments in his career. The whole Ziggy Stardust thing was so groundbreaking."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he was ahead of his time."
"__MUSIC__ And some of his songs are so memorable. Major Tom, or whatever it was called."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Changes is one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ I loved the later stuff, too. China Girl. Let's Dance."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he was so talented. That was a surprising and sad loss."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Any other one hit you as hard?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it wasn't quite as shocking, but when Kurt Cobain died, I was really sad. It felt like we had lost so much."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he was a ground breaker, too. Paved the way for a whole new genre of music."
"__MUSIC__ Yup. And who knows what he'd be doing now? Probably something cool and experimental."
"__MUSIC__ You know, listening to his music is weird, because it's so powerful and raw and evocative and then the output just ... stops."
"__MUSIC__ Very premature, I think. It definitely feels like a career cut short."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's where he and Bowie differ a lot. Bowie did it all. Kurt seems like he could have, but didn't get the chance..."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good way of putting it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they're both missed. Both one of a kind and both missed."
"__MUSIC__ Let's go listen to some of their music, okay? You've got me in the mood."
