"__MOVIES__ Man, I hate this weather! It just won't stop raining."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I wish we could find something to do to pass the time."
"__MOVIES__ Hey I have an idea! We should watch some movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that sounds like a good idea. What kind of movie do you have in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, since it is so rainy and dreary out why not watch something funny to brighten our moods?"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a good idea. Do you have any movies in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ How about something with Will Ferrell? He is always funny."
"__MOVIES__ Well we could always watch Anchorman or Anchorman 2."
"__MOVIES__ Those are good. I have seen them so many times."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Which one do you think is the best?"
"__MOVIES__ I have to say that I prefer the first one. It was totally hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty awesome but I think the second one was the best."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they would come out with a part three to those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh, that would be awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Out of Will Ferrell movies do you prefer the Anchorman movies or Step Brothers?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's a tough one. They are all so good."
"__MOVIES__ I love the Anchorman movies but the dynamic between Ferrell and John C. Reilly is impeccable."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they certainly do make a good pair."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we should watch them all again and see if we can rank them."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great. You can't go wrong with any of them though."
