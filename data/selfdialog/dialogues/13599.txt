"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, you got your Seahawks going to the big game again this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, after what happened in 2015, I was pretty let down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've had a good run lately though! I think Russell Wilson's still got it in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I also feel a bit bad about CTE and the brain injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, the evidence strongly suggests that playing football in the modern way leads to chronic and irreparable brain damage. Is that ethical to watch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, I don't hear many of the players complaining about the risks. They make good money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if you can pay someone enough money to make it acceptable to give them a brain injury. It makes it more of a blood sport than I want to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd trade jobs with any of the players in a heartbeat, brain injury or no brain injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they're adults. They can do what they want."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it still bothers you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I just don't want to contribute by watching, you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you're going to be missing out on some good stuff if you skip SuperBowl LI."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Superbowl LI? I thought they'd given up on roman numerals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, I bet they just thought L looked strange all by itself. They'll probably go back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever. Guess we'll find out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, if it bothers you we don't have to talk about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks, I appreciate you saying that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I take it you're out for fantasy this year too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah man, I think that's for the best."
