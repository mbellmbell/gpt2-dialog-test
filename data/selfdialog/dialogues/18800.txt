"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen any of the X-Men films?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen them all! X2 is still my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ I can't disagree with that. That was easily the first really good superhero team movie."
"__MOVIES__ True that. And all the characters had such great personalities that made them unique."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like Days of Future past is a close contender."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. Everything about that movie was outstanding. The extended version is even better!"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one with all the deleted Rogue scenes, right."
"__MOVIES__ That's the one! It really adds a whole new, interesting layer to the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool. I've only ever seen the theatrical cut, so I'll definitely have to check that out."
"__MOVIES__ How about the Wolverine movies? What do you think of those?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like Origins all that much. I thought it was pretty lackluster."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. What about the other 2."
"__MOVIES__ The Wolverine was great. Logan was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ One-hundred percent agreed on Logan. That might just be one of the best superhero movies of the last decade."
"__MOVIES__ You know what? I'd be willing to push X2 out of the way for Logan."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if that's the case for me. I like them both too much."
"__MOVIES__ It's all up to you."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. I'll keep them both tied for first place!"
"__MOVIES__ Good call!"
"__MOVIES__ Thank you!"
