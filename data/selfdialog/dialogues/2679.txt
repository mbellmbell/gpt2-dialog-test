"__MUSIC__ Are you still going to the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean Americanarama? Yeah, I want to see Dylan again, haven't seen him for years."
"__MUSIC__ But aren't you worried about terrorism?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I am, a little. But that won't stop me, it's Dylan."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'll worry about you."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks. But maybe there'll be shorter lines for food and drink."
"__MUSIC__ That's the attitude. Maybe there'll be discounts on tee shirts."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe there'll be all-access passes for everyone. But I doubt it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Security is likely to be tight."
"__MUSIC__ I've never been searched, maybe its my gender. But this time, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They better search everyone."
"__MUSIC__ I hope they do. I think they will, too."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, that's no guarantee."
"__MUSIC__ It's not. They got those kids in Manchester outside the venue."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the powers that be can't keep us safe. Not really."
"__MUSIC__ I know. But my music is my freedom to me, and I'm not giving it up."
"__MUSIC__ I'll be thinking of you."
"__MUSIC__ I'll be lying on the grass. Or dancing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's a good venue. I wish I dared."
"__MUSIC__ It's not daring. It's a little bit of defiance."
