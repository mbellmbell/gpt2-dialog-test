"__STAR_WARS__ How can you not have seen the start wars prequels? How is that even possible?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not a fan of sci fi."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, but these are not sci fi movies. They're an integral part of the Americana."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm every bit American as you, and I haven't seen it"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's what I'm asking. How is that possible?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, Fine I'll bite. What ar they like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What are they like? They're only the greatest movie trilogies ever made. We didn't even have the term prequel befoer this series"

"__STAR_WARS__ Now that's just semantics, and neoligsm is a common thing in arts."
"__STAR_WARS__ But stupid neologism is stupid."
