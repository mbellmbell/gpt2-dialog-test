"__MOVIES__ So, what mainstream movie did you like, that almost no one else did?"
"__MOVIES__ The Grey, definitely."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I saw that--The revenge of the wolves. Hated it."
"__MOVIES__ But it's great work. Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you'll admit it's not exactly cheerful."
"__MOVIES__ It's not. But I know you liked All is Lost, and that's pretty grim."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but there's just one guy in danger. It's not a group dying one-by-one, gruesomely."
"__MOVIES__ Dreadfully, you're right about that."
"__MOVIES__ And you just about know it's hopeless, all along."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't. They kept me hoping to the end."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Did you see that film where the couple gets left behind by hte diving boat, and they finally die? Did you like that?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't. It was gimmicky, The Grey is not."
"__MOVIES__ But it's the same idea. Death is gonna get you,  no matter what you do."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, but the Grey is better written, better made, better in general. That other thing was merely sensationalist."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you're right. I can't even remember the name of the other one."
"__MOVIES__ And Liam Neeson actually acts. Not that he ever has to, people love him anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he's sort of a generic outdoorsman in this, really."
"__MOVIES__ That's not generic, that's everyman. Like Tom Hanks, like James Stewart."
"__MOVIES__ You're kidding. Everyman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. He's showing us how to die right."
