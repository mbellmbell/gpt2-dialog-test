"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think they'll use Mace Windu in Rebels.  It just seems like a waste.  They'll have to save him for the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Samuel L. Jackson might be too busy being Nick Fury."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think that would stop Disney.  They can just delay a MCU movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be reckless, though.  They like money more than they like cool things."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point.  But they should at least give him a comic."
"__STAR_WARS__ The comics have even fewer readers than Rebels has viewers."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's why they can do it.  It won't have as big an impact, but it won't be disruptive, either."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, people can always dismiss the comics."
"__STAR_WARS__ And a Mace Windu comic would be good for testing the waters if they want to use him in Rebels."
"__STAR_WARS__ I still think it's a bad idea, though. He had a cool death."
