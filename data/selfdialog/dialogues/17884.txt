"__MOVIES__ So Tom Holland is going to play Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie."
"__MOVIES__ Wait but he's a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's going to be an origin story about young Nate."
"__MOVIES__ That can work on some level but are they planning to make it a franchise then?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean that I think just one movie about the origins of Nathan Drake won't be good on its own."
"__MOVIES__ You don't think that's a good enough standalone story?"
"__MOVIES__ Well when I think of an Uncharted movie I think of charming explosive action."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I guess we don't really get that with Tom Holland."
"__MOVIES__ We don't really get that with anybody really."
"__MOVIES__ Video game movies don't tend to turn out so well so I'm not too full of hope."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, look at Assassin's Creed."
"__MOVIES__ Bombed so hard, even with really big names attached to the project."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you see Michael Fassbender and think that whoa this might be good."
"__MOVIES__ I actually thought Warcraft was pretty good but only if you're a Warcraft fan."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was full of fan service for those who like the games."
"__MOVIES__ Duncan Jones made sure of that I think, he had the fans in mind."
"__MOVIES__ It's a shame it might not get a sequel, lots of potential in other stories."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the story of the first movie was kind of hard to follow."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah especially if you haven't played the games."
