"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of The Outer Vibe?"
"__MUSIC__ No, as I am not a hipster. What is The Outer Vibe?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a small rock band that tours and does a lot of small shows."
"__MUSIC__ Like I said, I'm not a hipster."
"__MUSIC__ But, they're different."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they put all of their money back into the band, and are pretty well-off."
"__MUSIC__ Are their shows sell-outs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, even though they're small venues. They performed during finals week here last year, remember?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, those guys."
"__MUSIC__ The thing I like about them most is their musicality."
"__MUSIC__ They better have musicality if they're a music group."
"__MUSIC__ Duh. Well, the reason why is because one of the song writers has a Masters degree in Music Theory."
"__MUSIC__ How is that a good thing?"
"__MUSIC__ She is able to make the song a lot more harmonically adventurous, setting it apart from other groups."
"__MUSIC__ So more than just the power chords of VII-III-VI-V?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, lots of secondary dominants and augmented chords."
"__MUSIC__ Any hits that I'd know?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they just have a really good following. Nothing has been on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ So, hipsters? Told you."
