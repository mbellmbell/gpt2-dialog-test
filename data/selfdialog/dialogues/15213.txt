"__HARRY_POTTER__ Did you know the entire Harry Potter cast was British?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well not all all. You know Verne Troyer who played Griphook, is an American."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay well all the major characters."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I heard the Duke Humphreys library where the library scenes were filmed, strictly forbids flames in the library and made an exception for the movie! First time in hundreds of years!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, well they probably got enough cash to store a whole section of old out of print books!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It would have been pretty cool to work on the set. Of course, castles are plentiful in Britain."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, the locations were amazing. I love seeing the inside of Hogwarts. It was much more vivid after seeing the movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, they were pretty close to what I imagined in my head."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too. It's still hard to believe the first movie was done in 2001!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know right! That was 16 years ago!"
