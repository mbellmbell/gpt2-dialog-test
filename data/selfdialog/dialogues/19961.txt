"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely 'The Blues Brothers' with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd."
"__MOVIES__ John Belushi was a really funny guy. I loved his Saturday Night Live skits."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. That era of Saturday Night Live was the best with those players."
"__MOVIES__ It's clear because so many of them went on to have such great movie careers."
"__MOVIES__ Dan Aykroyd had a successful time with Ghostbusters with Bill Murray."
"__MOVIES__ Bill Murray did well in lots of movies, and of course Chevy Chase had great success with the Vacation movies."
"__MOVIES__ It's a shame John Belushi died so young, because he had such potential that we never got to see."
"__MOVIES__ What makes The Blues Brothers your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ John's dialogue, and the way he says things. Dan is pretty much just his foil for his antics."
"__MOVIES__ There were so many different funny parts to that movie, just one after another. But I really laughed when John was holding Carrie Fisher and kissing her, and then he let go and dumped her in the mud."
"__MOVIES__ I liked when he was down on his knees begging her for forgiveness, and he took off his sunglasses, and then wiggled his eyebrow at her, and she suddenly forgave him. It showed how well he could communicate with just one look."
"__MOVIES__ He did have a charisma about him that was amazing, considering he wasn't what people would consider Hollywood Handsome."
"__MOVIES__ I often wonder if people who are overweight become comedians because they figure instead of letting people laugh at them behind their back, they will make them laugh and then be appreciated."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably true. A lot of great comedians have been overweight."
"__MOVIES__ I always thought John Belushi was cute because he had such expressive eyes. He was like a bad little boy you just wanted to cuddle and make him behave."
"__MOVIES__ It's too bad his wife didn't do that instead of doing drugs."
"__MOVIES__ So many movie and tv stars end up with drug problems."
"__MOVIES__ It's such a sad loss of potential like you said about John. The drugs stop you from seeing all they could have done."
"__MOVIES__ You would think Hollywood would see this and try to do more to help movie stars from going down that path."
