"__MUSIC__ So do you know if Counting Crows are releasing a new album soon?"
"__MUSIC__ I really don't know but I hear that they tour a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the do!  Now that you mention it, I've never seen them live."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't either but it might be fun!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we should go together next time they come around?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely!  What is your favorite album of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ It has to be their first one, August and Everything After."
"__MUSIC__ I have to agree with you on that!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's one of those rare albums where every song is remarkable."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  It has no filler!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite song from it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, probably Perfect Blue Buildings."
"__MUSIC__ That's a beautiful, yet sad, song."
"__MUSIC__ True.  How about Anna Begins?"
"__MUSIC__ Another favorite!  That's such a well crafted song."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, Round Here was a huge hit."
"__MUSIC__ It sure was.  You may as well mention Mr. Jones while you're at it."
"__MUSIC__ Of course.  I still remember the video."
"__MUSIC__ It is sad that the 90's feel like the good old days right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe!  Time moves so fast..."
