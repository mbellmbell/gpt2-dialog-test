"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite animated movie?"
"__MOVIES__ South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of meant kid-friendly animated movie, but that movie was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, in that case, Finding Nemo."
"__MOVIES__ Also a great choice, although I tend to like Shrek more."
"__MOVIES__ Shrek was funny. I think Eddie Murphy as Donkey was my favorite part."
"__MOVIES__ I just liked the Dreamworks animated movies because they didn't take themselves as seriously as the Pixar movies."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think that Finding Nemo took itself too seriously."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, but I was referring more to films like WALL-E and Up."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that WALL-E was one of the best movies of 2008."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I found it incredibly boring and found its various criticisms of excess to be trite."
"__MOVIES__ I completely disagree. Furthermore, I think that the lack of dialogue led to some beautiful moments that a Dreamworks film wold never have."
"__MOVIES__ When I go to an animated film, I'm not looking to see something serious. I'm looking to laugh, which Shrek makes me do."
"__MOVIES__ Agree to disagree. Can we at least agree that Toy Story is a great franchise?"
"__MOVIES__ No disagreements here. I think that Toy Story balances the humor and a deeper message very well."
"__MOVIES__ Also,  I think that Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are excellent voice actors."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably my favorite Tim Allen film. He can be really talented when he is not doing Christmas movies."
"__MOVIES__ What about Wild Hogs? That was a really bad movie."
"__MOVIES__ True, although I really liked John Travolta's performance in that film."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, with the exception of Martin Lawrence, all of the performances in that movie were very forgettable."
