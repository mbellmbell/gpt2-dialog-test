"__MOVIES__ I hate movies where they force people to interact with a clearly CGI character who isn't there."
"__MOVIES__ What's wrong with that?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess nothing when it's done right, but I'm thinking more like those Smurfs movies or the Chipmunks."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you mean those 'cartoons in real life' type genre. The only one that ever did it well was Space Jam."
"__MOVIES__ Which is funny because Space Jam used actual, 2D cartoons and had them interact with people!"
"__MOVIES__ They tried it again in Looney Toons: Back in Action. It's a funnier movie, but I don't think it's as visually impressive."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, come to think of it, the only time humans interacting with CGI characters was back in the early days."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, like when?"
"__MOVIES__ Like Star Wars Episode I and Steward Little. As much as people hated Jar-Jar at the time he looked amazing, like he was really there!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess maybe we're so used to seeing CGI characters now, that we just know it isn't really and somehow it looks more fake even though the CGI is better."
"__MOVIES__ To be fair though, even back then there was some bad CGI characters. Like Scooby Doo in the Scooby Doo movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, actually, speaking of that, did you know originally that movie was going to be rated R?"
"__MOVIES__ What, no way! Impossible!"
"__MOVIES__ Seriously, James Gunn who directed the Guardians of the Galaxy films wrote part of the script way back when, and he confirmed it."
"__MOVIES__ I can't picture it. An R rated Scooby Doo movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it was supposed to be more of a parody of Scooby Doo than a plain Scooby Doo movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what happened to it?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess the executives realized it was a dumb idea, so they cut it down to PG-13. Supposedly there's a fully filmed R-rated cut of the film out there somewhere."
"__MOVIES__ Shoot, I don't care how bad the CGI is in it! I just want to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ I think everyone would. Too bad no one probably ever will."
