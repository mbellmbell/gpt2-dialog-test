"__MOVIES__ Did you ever have to watch a movie for school that you ended up liking?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, last semester we had to watch Apollo 13."
"__MOVIES__ You never saw that before a few months ago?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. I've never been too big into movies."
"__MOVIES__ So you really liked it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was great. I loved Tom Hanks in it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it but forget most of the plot."
"__MOVIES__ It's just about the Apollo 13 space mission and how they all almost died."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know. But the specifics are lost on me."
"__MOVIES__ I'd say like 40% of the movie took place in the shuttle."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, with them trying to figure out what to do."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Come to think of it, it was a bit boring because of that."
"__MOVIES__ I wished it was more suspensful."
"__MOVIES__ It still had some suspense, but not as much as I thought it was going to have."
"__MOVIES__ Looking at the effects in the movie shows how far tech has come."
"__MOVIES__ They were really bad."
"__MOVIES__ They were, which made it enjoyable to me."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Just thinking about how people back then thought those were amazing effects made it cooler for me to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I get it."
