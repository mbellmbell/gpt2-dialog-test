"__MOVIES__ What's the last movie you saw?"

"__MOVIES__ How did you like it? I heard it got bad reviews."
"__MOVIES__ I knew going in about the reviews, but I enjoyed it."

"__MOVIES__ I just like to go to be entertained and don't worry about the other stuff."
"__MOVIES__ It seems as if so far, the summer movie season has been a disappointment."

"__MOVIES__ I am ready to see the new 'Despicable Me' movie with the kids."
"__MOVIES__ I know people who will see that even if they don't have kids."
"__MOVIES__ I just hope it has some fresh material in it and not the same types of 'gags' as the other ones."
"__MOVIES__ It should be good- the minions crack me up."
"__MOVIES__ What other movies are you looking forward to this year."
"__MOVIES__ Star Wars in December is the next big one for me to see in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ There's nothing before then that catches your attention?"
"__MOVIES__ Not off the top of my head. Seems like movies are just running together these days."
"__MOVIES__ Just try not to overthink it- go to be entertained. Too many people now rely on critics and others to tell them about movies."

"__MOVIES__ I love The Rock and Wahlberg. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I like a variety. Kevin Hart, Ferrell, Clooney, and Rogan are some of my favorites."
