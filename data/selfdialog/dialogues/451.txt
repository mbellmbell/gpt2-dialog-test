"__MUSIC__ I need a music recommendation from you."
"__MUSIC__ Go for it, I love recommending music!"
"__MUSIC__ OK. I've got a beach trip coming up, and I'm panning on doing lots of reading, so I'd like some good reading music."
"__MUSIC__ Got it! I like having music on when I read too."
"__MUSIC__ Cool! So what would you reccommend?"
"__MUSIC__ One of my favorite albums for reading is 'Copia' by Eluvium."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of Eluvium."
"__MUSIC__ It's just one guy who is sort of a composer."
"__MUSIC__ So it's like classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of. It's very atmospheric and ambient, but not boring. No percussion or drums and it's not distracting."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll check him out. What else?"
"__MUSIC__ Another favorite is Helios."
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of them either."
"__MUSIC__ Their stuff is mostly really slow and chilled out. It's very peaceful."
"__MUSIC__ Any more bands you'd suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to Com Truise a lot when I read."
"__MUSIC__ I know Com Truise. Good stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. His stuff is good for working, reading, exercising... you name it."
"__MUSIC__ He'll be on my beach playlist for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Good choice; check those others out too!"
