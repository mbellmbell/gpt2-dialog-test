"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one do you mean, The Force Awakens or Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Force awakens. I really liked it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought the storyline was too similar to the original."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It started with searching for a Droid on a desert planet, just like A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but that's really the only similarity."
"__STAR_WARS__ They also destroy a planet like they do in the first movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, there were some big differences. I thought it was cool that they showed you more about storm troopers."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have a hard time believing that someone who worked for Sanitation would also be sent into battle as a storm trooper though."
