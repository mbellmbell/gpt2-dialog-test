"__STAR_WARS__ In Star Wars, episode three, when is Anakin a real Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he starts it as soon as he killed innocents."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, when he killed the younglings?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, before, when he went to see his mom, then slaughtered the sand people, even the young."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, he was a sith, more or less when he made Luke and Leai."
"__STAR_WARS__ More or less, he was on the path to the dark side even then, far in the path."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, maybe his darkness is in their force."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is, Luke gets angry, but dark and light is in all Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ But the Sith give in and the Jedi dont."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, some sith used to be Jedi."
