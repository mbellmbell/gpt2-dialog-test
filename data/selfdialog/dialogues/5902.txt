"__STAR_WARS__ People say Star Wars was all made up as it went, and it kind of was, but a lot of things were actually planned way ahead of time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like what? Darth Vader was always Luke's father?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, that definitely only came about during the writing of Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ But you do have some examples, otherwise you wouldn't bring it up."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course. For example, during the making of the first film, George Lucas had the idea that the stormtroopers were all clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ But they aren't though. I guess not until the prequels anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, at the time, in '70s, it was just impractical to do that. But by the 2000s technology advanced, and he had a bigger budget, so his idea of a clone army came to fruition."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kind of funny then, considering that in canon the clones were replaced by recruits eventually."
"__STAR_WARS__ Another thing, Anakin getting fried on a volcano planet and becoming Darth Vader was something that dates back to around Empire or Jedi, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm sure a lot of it was still made up way later, but I see what you're saying. Some of the ideas that were used are pretty old."
