"__MUSIC__ Have you heard that new song by Ariana Grande?"
"__MUSIC__ No I really don't listen to her."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really why?"
"__MUSIC__ It's something about her voice that I just can't get into."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that but she is really talented."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I know she can really sing her voice just irks me for some reason."
"__MUSIC__ Well if you get a chance to listen to her new song you may think differently."
"__MUSIC__ What is different about it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's less poppy and her voice really has a different sound in the song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh well then I may actually like it!"
"__MUSIC__ I think her sound is changing a bit since she's getting older."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah sometimes the teens, although talented, come off really cheesy in their music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and some never grow out of it."
"__MUSIC__ Like Britney Spears?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. It makes me so sad what happened at that Ariana concert."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was terrible. I didn't like the way Ariana responded to that either so that's another thing that turns me off."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's hard for us to judge celebrities because of the media."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good point. I'm going to find that song and listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Well you will have to let me know what you think!"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely will, thanks for recommending it."
