"__MUSIC__ Do you like punk music?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, but I haven't heard of any good punk bands recently."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of a few, but I really like older punk like the Sex Pistols."
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty much a classic."
"__MUSIC__ I did find this newer punk band called MxPx though."
"__MUSIC__ Are they like the Sex Pistols?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really.  Their sound is quite a bit cleaner and I think they're even religious."
"__MUSIC__ A religious punk band?  That sounds ironic."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really think so.  Anyway, they're a punk band from Washington state."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard a lot of good music comes from that area."
"__MUSIC__ Many artists have come from that area, including Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, and Soundgarden."
"__MUSIC__ I really like all of those bands, maybe I'll like MxPx too."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure you will.  They've even had some mainstream success."
"__MUSIC__ Have I heard of them and not even known it?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, they had a song on the radio called Chick Magnet a few years back."
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't remember that one."
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty good and was written by their bassist who is the lead singer."
"__MUSIC__ A lead singing bassist?  That's not very common."
"__MUSIC__ No, it's not.  Rush is a pretty popular band whose lead singer plays bass."
"__MUSIC__ Rush is one of the best bands ever!"
