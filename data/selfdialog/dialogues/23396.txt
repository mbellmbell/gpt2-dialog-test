"__DISNEY__ Did you know the best Johnny Depp movie is a Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Someone can't 'know' that, it's an opinion."
"__DISNEY__ Sure, but it's a very strongly supported opinion."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, point taken. I have to admit though, I don't know any Disney movies with Johnny Depp."
"__DISNEY__ Pirates of the Caribbean!"
"__DISNEY__ That's so true! The set and costume design for that movie are insane."
"__DISNEY__ So good, right? It's so gritty and real feeling."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's probably the only Disney movie that has ever truly scared me."
"__DISNEY__ Disney movies tend to be a bit more lighthearted."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's a testament to Disney's production that they could produce such a film."
