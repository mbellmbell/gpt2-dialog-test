"__MUSIC__ Are you still listening to The Dead?"
"__MUSIC__ Funny you should ask.  I hadnt for a while but recently started listening a lot again."
"__MUSIC__ I still think they are one of the best bands ever."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, completely.  Its a joy to listen to them."
"__MUSIC__ Even without Jerry?"
"__MUSIC__ I miss Jerry, of course, and most of what Im listening to are shows with him."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but I went to a Dead and Co. show last summer and was really impressed."
"__MUSIC__ By John Mayer?  Lol"
"__MUSIC__ Laugh if you want but he crushed it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm skeptical."
"__MUSIC__ Everyone was skeptical.  You dont usually think John Mayer when it comes to the Grateful Dead."
"__MUSIC__ For good reason."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I'm telling you he was great.  Pretty much everyone was blown away."
"__MUSIC__ You're kidding.  OK, I'll have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ You'll be doing yourself a favor."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we can go to a show together this summer."
"__MUSIC__ We should absolutely do that."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I'll look into getting tickets."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome.  We'll have a great time rocking out to Bobby, Phil, John and the boys."
"__MUSIC__ Indeed."
