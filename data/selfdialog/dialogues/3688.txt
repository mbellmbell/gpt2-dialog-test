"__MUSIC__ Do you know if Mylène Farmer is releasing anything new soon?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she's still working on her movie."
"__MUSIC__ That's disappointing. I really want a new record."
"__MUSIC__ I want her to go on tour again already!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! It's been ages since she's been out on the road."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like Interstellaires?"
"__MUSIC__ I loved it-- I thought it was so much better than Monkey Me."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's definitely her worst album."
"__MUSIC__ It came out around the same time as Celine Dion's album."
"__MUSIC__ I can't really get into Celine Dion."
"__MUSIC__ Really, why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think she's a bit boring."
"__MUSIC__ She doesn't write her own music, so she's at the mercy of her team."
"__MUSIC__ She doesn't choose a lot of material that appeals to me."
"__MUSIC__ Well Mylène is more opaque with her music."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. There's more to figure out."
"__MUSIC__ With Celine, she can be very blunt and to the point."
"__MUSIC__ I think she's a great vocalist, though."
"__MUSIC__ She's one of the best voices of the generation."
"__MUSIC__ I just wish she had better songs!"
