"__HORROR__ Did you ever see The Grudge?"
"__HORROR__ Yes I did and that's one of the scariest movies ever."
"__HORROR__ You're so right about that. Did you ever see the Japanese original movie called Ju-On?"
"__HORROR__ Yes but I relate to the American version better. But it was really good."
"__HORROR__ I agree. I was into Asian horror for a good while there."
"__HORROR__ Me too. There's an Asian horror called Audition which is pretty creepy."
"__HORROR__ I've seen that. What's your favorite Grudge movie?"
"__HORROR__ Part one of course. It was the scariest and really laid out the story."
"__HORROR__ Yeah that creepy voice of hers gave me many nightmares."
"__HORROR__ I played a prank on my uncle over the phone once using that voice. He didn't want to admit he was scared but I know he was."
