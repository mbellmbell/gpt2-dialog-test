"__MOVIES__ Which do you like better: the newer Star Trek movies or the older ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like the older ones because they have good plots and they capture the chemistry of the original cast better."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what about Star Trek 1 or movie 5?"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, no fair, we don't talk about the odd numbered Star Trek movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I will say that I really do like Wrath of Kahn, Search for Spock, and Voyage Home. Those are very personable and they make a good little trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is an awesome line-up. I like that each of these movies is somewhat independant, but also based closely on the previous ones."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about the newer ones, then?"
"__MOVIES__ They're OK. Of course there are better graphics and a lot of action."
"__MOVIES__ True that. The action and tech is their redeeming quality."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't really happy about changing Kirk and blowing up Vulcan in the first movie. Other than that, I thought it was a clever plot."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. I have mixed feelings about 'Into Darkness.'"
"__MOVIES__ It was clever, but it seemed so redundant; J. J. Abrams needs to make new movies, not ones that are just rehashing old plots."
"__MOVIES__ Dude, don't even get me started on 'The Force Awakens.'"
"__MOVIES__ I know! It was basically just parts of Star Wars and Return of the Jedi spliced together!"
"__MOVIES__ So there's a kid who grows up in the desert, and they escae and meet a smuggler, and get involved with a rebellion, and start using the force and blow up a big death star thing-a-ma-jig."
"__MOVIES__ Now, which one are we talking about: Star Wars or The Force Awakens?"
"__MOVIES__ Both! That's what I mean; they're exactly the same movie but with different characters."
"__MOVIES__ And with some of the same characters."
"__MOVIES__ That's right, it was totally lame. So what are we going to do now?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's go watch some Firefly!"
