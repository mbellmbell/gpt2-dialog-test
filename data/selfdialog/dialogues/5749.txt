"__STAR_WARS__ So what is your favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even with all of the new films that have come out since then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, even with all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you like about it so much?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well a lot of different things!"
"__STAR_WARS__ For example?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I definitely think it has the best story out of any of the films. It's pretty dark and there's a lot of conflict and you just don't know what's going to happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's definitely not nearly as bright and cheery as the first movie was."
"__STAR_WARS__ and this might be a weird thing to like, but I like the sets and landscapes of that film the best. Hoth, the asteroid field, Dagobah, Cloud City, the carbonite freezing chamber. They're just the coolest."
