"__DISNEY__ There are so many good Disney animated films, but Mary Poppins is my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, mine too! Julie Andrews is perfect."
"__DISNEY__ So is Dick Van Dyke."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. They make such a cute couple in that film."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know they're making a sequel?"
"__DISNEY__ I had no idea!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it's called Mary Poppins Returns. I think Emily Blunt is staring in it."
"__DISNEY__ Oh wow. She will be amazing, I'm sure."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. But nothing can really compare to the original."
"__DISNEY__ No way."
