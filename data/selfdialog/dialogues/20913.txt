"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen the original Psycho?"
"__THRILLER__ One of the most thrilling and mind bending movies ever!"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, the way Anthony Perkins played Norman Bates was great."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah he had this odd normalness to him that was scary."
"__THRILLER__ Almost too normal though.  There was always something off about him."
"__THRILLER__ Of course, the best part was the show stabbing though."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, so many movies have made a joke of it.  But that snappy camera work, and suspense is unparalleled to this day."
"__THRILLER__ It was.  Today is often all special effects and no true suspense anymore."
"__THRILLER__ I know what you mean.  It's like they don't work hard anymore."
"__THRILLER__ We need another Hitchcock type director in Hollywood."
