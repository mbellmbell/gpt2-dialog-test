"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the prequel trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, and I don't know anyone who did."
"__STAR_WARS__ They really messed up the plotlines in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. Did we really need to see Darth Vader as a whining teenager?"
"__STAR_WARS__ And Padme's character was so flat and uninteresting."
"__STAR_WARS__ She just seemed bored to me, like she didn't want to be there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Palpatine was cool, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he was the only one that seemed to enjoy what he was doing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why were the Jedi so foolish in that movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They were complacent, I guess, but they just came off as blind."
