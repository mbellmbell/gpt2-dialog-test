"__MUSIC__ Hey, how do you feel about punk rock music?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean like Sex Pistols and Hawk Nelson?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, I mean like Reagan Youth, Dead Kennedys and The Dicks."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of those. Are they good?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so."
"__MUSIC__ Why is it a thing for punk bands to be named after presidents?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but they must be on to something. They're both good."
"__MUSIC__ What's Reagan Youth like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they have a younger sound, and a more consistent sound across their albums I think. They actually only put out 2 albums."
"__MUSIC__ And The Dicks?"
"__MUSIC__ They have a more reckless, messy sound. There's actually only one song of there's I really like."
"__MUSIC__ What's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ Hate the Police. Their song Lifetime Problems is pretty good too, if you like evil laughs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh okay, good to know. I'll give them both a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Both songs or both artists?"
"__MUSIC__ I meant both songs, but I'll give both artists a listen too. What was the third artist you mentioned?"
"__MUSIC__ Dead Kennedys?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah!"
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty popular in the Punk crowd. They did my favourite cover of 'I Fought the Law' where they switched up the lyrics a bit to be from the perspective of Dan White."
"__MUSIC__ Very interesting!"
