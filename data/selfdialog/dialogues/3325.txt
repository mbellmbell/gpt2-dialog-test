"__MUSIC__ Hey, how much do musicians charge to play at weddings?"
"__MUSIC__ You're getting married?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, next spring."
"__MUSIC__ What are you looking for?"
"__MUSIC__ We're thinking either a small brass band or a string quartet."
"__MUSIC__ They'll either charge by the hour or by the day."
"__MUSIC__ I was hoping to pay them in exposure."
"__MUSIC__ Don't do that."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It's incredibly insulting to music and those who dedicated their life to it."
"__MUSIC__ How so? It's background music."
"__MUSIC__ You'd pay a DJ. You pay Taylor Swift when you hear her concerts live."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I don't have much money."
"__MUSIC__ Let me tell you something: 'pay by exposure' is crap. No one can survive on that because exposure never did anything to anyone."
"__MUSIC__ Of course it does."
"__MUSIC__ No, it doesn't. It devalues the musician because now people know they'll play for free, and won't pay them either."
"__MUSIC__ Sorry, but I don't have the money to pay for musicians."
"__MUSIC__ Then create a playlist and have someone hook it up to a sound system."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, sorry. Don't be so rude."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you're a chef. If someone said 'Cater my dinner. Pays by exposure' you'd laugh in their face."
