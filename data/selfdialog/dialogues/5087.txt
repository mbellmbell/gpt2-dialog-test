"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I haven't seen all of them.  I guess I should."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, It's hard to beat the original."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree.  I think they got a little carried away with all the sequels."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They did.  Some of them are good.  But I like the ones with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel the best."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah.  Aren't there like six or seven?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yep.  And they are planning more.  Without Paul Walker I just don't think they will be the same."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, he just made the movies what they were."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Vin Diesel can't be replaced either.  If you lose both of those characters, I really don't think you will have much of a fan base."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hopefully he will be included in the new ones.  I'd love to see him have more of a presence."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, I might actually make an effort to watch them then."
