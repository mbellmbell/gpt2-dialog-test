"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What is your favorite all time sub-genre of rap?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I really vibe with the early 90's gangster rap like Snoop Dogg and NWA."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That stuff was great, but did you ever listen to the jazzy hip hop of the early 90's?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not a ton, I was really into the hardcore vibes and rebellious understones of the gangster stuff. Which artists are you referring to?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ A Tribe Called Quest released Midnight Marauders, which I consider one of the most classic hip hop albums of all time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That music was quality but lacked the hard hitting beats that I like."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Artists back then were on a different level lyrically and had such positive messages."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That may be true but the beats didn't bump like the ones produced by Dr. Dre."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Dre was definitely ahead of his time, but I feel like he didn't find his own until he and Eminem delivered 'The Eminem Show' in 2000."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Eminem would have never made it in the industry with the production and direction of Dr. Dre."
