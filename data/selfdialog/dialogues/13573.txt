"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any teams you expect to surprise us this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The LA Rams. They will have a new coach this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa, a new coach? What happened to Jeff Fisher?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was fired, They were 31-45 in his time with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who is his replacement, then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sean McVay, Hes only 30, making him youngest head coach in NFL history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is great. The Rams could benefit from the energy a young guy like him could bring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I'm hoping. Would be nice to see the Rams take their division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They showed flashes of promise last year; hopefully this is the year they can get it all together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd love to see Detroit do well, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As a Packers fan, I disagree, haha!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! Seriously though, they've got a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do, and they've been a threat in that division at times over the years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. So it would be nice to see them pull it off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's such a tough division. Packers, Bears, Vikings, Lions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Vikings are another team I'd love to see go all the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They deserve it. I really thought the first season they had with Favre they would pull it off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a heartbreaking season to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Painful that it ended on a Favre interception. He had been so amazing that year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, funny how one of the best seasons of his career came with the Vikings and not the Packers!"
