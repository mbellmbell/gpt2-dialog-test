"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, who's your favorite football team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I'm a huge fan of the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you one of those recent Patriot fans or a life-long fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been a fan since I was a kid through the ups and downs of the 90's and all the Super Bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I generally don't like patriots fans, especially the ones that have only been fans since they because a dynasty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree.  Bandwagon fans in any sport drive me nuts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are you still a fan even though you live in Texas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have the NFL package so I can see all the games and I read everything about the team online."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But why didn't you become a fan of one of the Texas teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can I give up a life-long allegiance to my team just because I moved somewhere else.  That would be stupid!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think you should be a fan of the team local to where you live."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you be a true fan if you switch your allegiance just because you move somewhere else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you live in a particular place, you should support the local teams and organizations."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, by that logic.  I loved the local seafood when I lived in New England but now I should just stop liking it and make BBQ my favorite food because I live in Texas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I get that.  I would be hard to just abandon all your heroes from growing up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I couldn't just decide that Brady, Grogan and John Hannah aren't my favorite players anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well as long as you have Brady, you'll probably still have the best team in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady is the GOAT!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Montana might have something to say about that but you're probably right, I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go Pats!!!"
