"__MOVIES__ I saw the new Amy Schumer movie last night!"
"__MOVIES__ Snatched? Oh how was it? I'm dying to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ It was hysterical! I can't wait to see it again!"
"__MOVIES__ Was it better than Trainwrecked?"
"__MOVIES__ It didn't have as much gross humor as Trainwrecked - though it did have some! But otherwise it was a lot better."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Trainwrecked got really boring toward the end when she fell in love with the ugly doctor."
"__MOVIES__ I know! Why did they pick him, of all people, to be her love interest?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably because her first love interest in the movie was John Cena, and they needed someone completely unattractive and weak by comparison."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably true. Anyway this movie takes place mostly in Nicaragua!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that sounds interesting. Do they get mixed up with a drug cartel or something?"
"__MOVIES__ No, they get kidnapped and held for ransom. Amy and her mother, who is played by Goldie Hawn."
"__MOVIES__ That must be hilarious! Do they trek through the jungle and stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and they both get filthier and filthier as the movie goes on."
"__MOVIES__ I want to see it more than ever now!"
"__MOVIES__ We should go this weekend and see it, I was planning to watch it again anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, let's go! Are there any handsome guys in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Only one, one of the guys who is involved with the kidnappers is really gorgeous."
"__MOVIES__ Nice! Better than John Cena?"
"__MOVIES__ Much better looking. Not as grossly muscular with long dark hair and eyes."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds lovely."
