"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which part of the country do you think has the best NFL teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the East zone does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're from the East coast so you may be a bit biased."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What zone do you think is better than the East?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The West has some big teams such as the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but notice those teams are only teams in the National Football Conference. The east coast has great teams in both the National Football Conference and the American Football Conference"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go on, I'm waiting to hear you name them"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First of all, we've got one of the biggest rivalries: the New York Jets and the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, both of them are great. Are those in the American Football Conference?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they are. So is the Dolphins who count as an East zone team, not a south team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually assumed they were South."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I've heard people make that mistake."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What teams are on the East National Football Conference?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants, the DC Redskins, the Philly Eagles, and another team people often think are the south - the Dallas Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a lot of star power. Maybe you're right that the East has the best teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In your defense, the west is really catching up. There are many teams all of the country in fact that are far more high quality now than they used to be back in the day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes of course, top teams change over time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just like the players, no team can be on top of their game forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't care who's on top. I am dedicated fan and I will always support the same team I always have since I was a kid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. That's called NFL loyalty!"
