"__MOVIES__ Did you like the movie E.T.?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I hated that movie."
"__MOVIES__ How could you hate E.T.? He's such a lovable character!"
"__MOVIES__ He's scary looking. He's brown and lumpy."
"__MOVIES__ He's lost though and just wants to go back home. I can't help but love him."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not the biggest fan of aliens in general. The movie Signs scared me."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that movie was silly. They aliens looked so fake."
"__MOVIES__ At the time, I thought the aliens looked real in that movie. I was younger when it came out though."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Signs directed by the same guy who directed The Sixth Sense?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. The Sixth Sense was so good."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I ever actually saw that whole movie."
"__MOVIES__ You should watch it. The twist is the best part."
"__MOVIES__ I already know what the twist is in The Sixth Sense, should I still watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think you should."
"__MOVIES__ Is it still good, even in 2017?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. I haven't seen another movie like it in a while."
"__MOVIES__ Bruce Willis is in it, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and he's great. I think it's one of his best movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to watch it then."
"__MOVIES__ You should watch it! Let me know what you think afterwards."
