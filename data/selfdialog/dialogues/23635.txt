"__DISNEY__ Oh my gosh, I just saw the Disney movie Moana!"
"__DISNEY__ What did you think? Wasn't it great?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I loved the intense scenes and colors."
"__DISNEY__ Totally, I really liked that it was a female-led culture."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. It's nice to see Disney moving away from girls being 'little princesses' who need help from 'big princes'"
"__DISNEY__ I completely agree. It used to be that Disney was all about the princesses who needed saving."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, now it seems that, especially with Moana and other movies that have come out recently the girls are in charge of themselves"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's important for the little girls to see strong female leads in Disney movies"
"__DISNEY__ I totally agree. And the songs in Moana were amazing!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah they were! It was definitely a movie I, and my kids enjoyed."
