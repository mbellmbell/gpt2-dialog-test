"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you looking forward to football starting up again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, I've lost interest lately. I just feel like the NFL is corrupt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? There aren't any rivalries you like to follow, or certain games you want to watch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, I'll follow the Raiders' season halfheartedly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe they're leaving Oakland!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's really disappointing. I don't think I can pretend to be a 49ers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't blame you. I'm not an Oakland fan, but I'm sad to see them leaving, since I enjoyed going to a game or two every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm from Cleveland, so I'm a Browns fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch. At least your baseball and basketball teams are doing well!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it would still be nice to have a decent football team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On the bright side, it will be hard to do any worse than last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding. I was prepared to go the whole season without a single win!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would've been rough. The Raiders were looking so good last year...until Carr got injured!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah, yeah. I felt bad for the team and the fans, even though I'm not a Raiders fan. That was hard to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how are the Browns looking going into this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to say. I've learned, as a Cleveland fan, to take it one day at a time! I really hope we can give Joe Thomas a good season for once, though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a great offensive tackle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's one of the best!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, good luck to you and your Browns!"
