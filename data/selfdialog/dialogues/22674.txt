"__DISNEY__ Do you know movie Lady and the Tramp?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes! It was one of my favorites growing up."
"__DISNEY__ I had a mutt that looked like Tramp when I was a kid. We called him Scoundrel, almost the same meaning."
"__DISNEY__ I liked Lady because of her curly haired ears and big eyes. I think she was based off of some kind of spaniel."
"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the cats in that movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Si and Am? They were siamese... if you please! That song was awesome!"
"__DISNEY__ They were horribly sneaky weren't they?"
"__DISNEY__ Aren't most cats?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes but these two gave new meaning to sneaky."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think they ever got the deserved recognition as a Disney villain that they deserved."
