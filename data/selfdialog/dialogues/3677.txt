"__MUSIC__ Do you know Bryan Adams?"
"__MUSIC__ Do I know him? I'm a huge fan!"
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen him live?"
"__MUSIC__ No, just from his in-studio albums."
"__MUSIC__ Does he still tour?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know honestly. I liked his 'Reckless' album."
"__MUSIC__ I enjoyed that as well. Was the cover a black and white portrait?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I believe it was."
"__MUSIC__ I think 'Summer of '69' was on that album."
"__MUSIC__ I do believe it was. What a great song that is, don't you agree?"
"__MUSIC__ I agree one-hundred percent."
"__MUSIC__ What else even was there on that album? No great great hits."
"__MUSIC__ Well it's hard to match 'Summer of '69' with anything."
"__MUSIC__ I guess. I mean 'Ain't Gonna Cry' was great too."
"__MUSIC__ You can't seriously be comparing 'Summer of '69' to 'Ain't Gonna Cry,' are you?"
"__MUSIC__ I most certainly am."
"__MUSIC__ That's insane."
"__MUSIC__ No, 'Ain't Gonna Cry' is just a great song from a great album."
"__MUSIC__ That's one thing we can agree on, that 'Reckless' was a great album."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed."
