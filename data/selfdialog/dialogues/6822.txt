"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Darth Vader was really evil?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. Look at all of the horrible things he did."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. He did do some horrible things. But in the end, he turned good."
"__STAR_WARS__ One good deed does not make up for a years of bad things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but if he was evil, could have really done something so noble?"
"__STAR_WARS__ By that thinking, no evil person can do anything good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why would they?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Self-preservation."
"__STAR_WARS__ Fine. But when he saved Luke, he wasn't protecting himself. He was more endangering himself. If he had had failed, the Emperor would have killed him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader was evil. Period!"
