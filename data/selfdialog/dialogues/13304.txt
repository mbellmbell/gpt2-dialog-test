"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ let's not talk about injuries at QB, due to being hit a ton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Want to see what OB can do with a good QB and decent to good OL play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Watch NE when he was the OC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They still run the same system, pretty much same as ours."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, until the OL protection is good, you can be sure we won't see that type of play"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would martim even be considered as a tackle? We drafted him to play on the interior of the o line, center to be exact... I don't get it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mancz came in because Martin was hurt and did a fantastic job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just my opinion that Martin should be tried out at RT."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm with Malex on this one. I also think Martin will take over the center position......"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mancz will shift to RG."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no clue what we are doing at RT."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah .... no kidding. Seems custom made for a Ramczyk type!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We can't honestly or accurately evaluate any of our QBs, RBs, WRs, or TEs until our offensive line is solidified."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ that may never happen now that we've gone back to building our OL with 4th through 7th rounders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't understand why you call TS mediocre. His problems have been physical, but when on the field, he has been very good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I grew up watching the Cowboys and I like Tom Landry's attitude about players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He said, 'get me athletes and I'll make them football players.' We need a little more of that and less GM wantabes at the HC position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think OB and Smith are not butting heads as much as most on this board think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Giacomini is healthy...then his veteran presence could be valuable at RT."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have him Davenport attached at the hip in all hopes that by the time the team hits the Bye Week, Davenport would be ready for heavy rotational duty."
