"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which of the Harry Potter movies is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's a hard decision. For the earlier movies, I like 'Prisoner of Azkaban' best."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too. How about the later ones?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I like the second installment of 'Deathly Hallows' best. It was great to see Voldemort destroyed."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like that one, but I was sad to lose so many of my favorite characters."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can understand that. Which of the later movies is your favorite then?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Definitely 'Half-Blood Prince'. That's where everything started coming together, and Snape was excellent."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You do love Snape, don't you?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, he's definitely my favorite character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Obviously."
