"__MUSIC__ Do you like 'The Killers'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they're one of my favorite bands."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I just heard them for the first time about six months ago and haven't stopped listening since."
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to them for years. My brother introduced them to me some time in high school."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song by them?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably 'Change your Mind.'"
"__MUSIC__ I really like that one. I feel like most people don't appreciate it."
"__MUSIC__ Is that your favorite song too?"
"__MUSIC__ No my favorite song by The Killers is 'Dustland Fairytale.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I really like that one."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard them live?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't gotten the chance yet. Have you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they're so incredibly good live!"
"__MUSIC__ Really? It's so important for a band to sound just as good live as they do on the album."
"__MUSIC__ They're almost better live than they are on their albums. It's crazy!"
"__MUSIC__ I really need to get to their concert the next time they're in the area."
"__MUSIC__ You definitely should. I can promise you won't regret it!"
"__MUSIC__ I need to remember to look up their tour dates in advance so I don't accidentally make plans."
"__MUSIC__ I'll let you know the next time they release tour dates."
"__MUSIC__ That would be great! Thanks!"
