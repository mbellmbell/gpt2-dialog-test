"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts on Roger Goodell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't care for him much. He has a huge ego."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He certainly has a huge ego. He really pursued that Tom Brady suspension the past few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wasn't going to take no for an answer and really got the courts to finally side with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Crazy how the NFL and players are litigating each other these days. But, that's par for the United States these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is for sure. You disagree with someone, you sue them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What else don't you like about Goodell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely has brought the NFL to a wider audience but I'm really annoyed by the fascination with the London games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with the London stuff. I'm not sure why he's so persistent about the NFL in the UK."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who knows. What I do know is that it takes away a home game for one team a year and puts them at a disadvantage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Usually that is Jacksonville that gets affected."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Jacksonville seems to be there every year. Also, the start times are annoying."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 9 A.M. starts are certainly annoying."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Imagine if you lived on the West Coast. Those games would be starting at 6 A.M."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is crazy. Hope he never puts a team in London permanently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He just might. He keeps pushing this London thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is there anything else you dislike about him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The fact that he's paid an outrageous amount of money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is the commissioner of the largest sports league in North America, so it's not surprising."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not surprising, but the amount he's paid is still outrageous."
