"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite NFL player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a hard choice! I don't really have a favorite player, but I love the Browns."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well we have a couple of players who seem potentially promising."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, who are they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Myles Garrett, Jabrill Peppers, and David Njoku are the ones most people are talking about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, interesting. Who is the quarterback?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, where in Ohio is he from?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He grew up in Toledo and was really good in high school."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh nice, I didn't know that. Where did he play in college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He played at Notre Dame. Hopefully he will bring us victory!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope that he does too! I am more of a Jets fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no! They are also a tough team to be a fan of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, last year was really rough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, wasn't last year really hard for them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very bad, we were 5-11 in 2016. But we were 6-10 is 2015 so I'm not sure what really happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is rough. Who are your best players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Christian Hackenberg and Bryce Petty are the quarterbacks for now. I'm hoping to make it to a game this year."
