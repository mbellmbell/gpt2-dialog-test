"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There seem to be some good young teams out there that could over take both soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, who would you say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure. What do you think of Philly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh, they have a quarterback hopefully, but they still have a ways to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. They have some work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe Tennessee is further along."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they might be. They do have a couple pieces."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! Also Dallas should be ready to take the next step."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. Can't count out Atlanta either. They didn't exactly get worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they didn't they should be really good again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Houston seems to be hanging on as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do not know how they do it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they have an amazing defense, but eventually they have to get some play makers on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, their defense wins games, but they need a little more offense too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, maybe a quarterback that knows how to throw would be nice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. That would be a start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well sometimes those are harder to find than you may think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Hopefully they will find one sooner rather than later though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, hopefully. They sure could use one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So could about ten other teams."
