"__DISNEY__ Hey, do you remember those Not Quite Human movies?"
"__DISNEY__ No. When were those from? The 1980s again?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. They were on the Disney Channel. I think, made-for-TV."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. Well, what about them?"
"__DISNEY__ Well... I liked them. At the time, anyway. There were three of them."
"__DISNEY__ What were they about?"
"__DISNEY__ A scientist creates an android, and tells everyone it's his son. The android tries to figure out how to act like a person."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, so you identified with the android?"
"__DISNEY__ I... well. Maybe."
"__DISNEY__ I bet his name was something clever like 'Chip.'"
