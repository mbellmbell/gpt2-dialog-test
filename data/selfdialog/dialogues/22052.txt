"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the Disney movie Moana yet?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and I absolutely loved it. how about you?"
"__DISNEY__ I took my niece out to see it a week ago. I think I was more into it then her."
"__DISNEY__ Moana was such a breath of fresh air in regards to Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ I loved how they portrayed so much beautiful Polynesian culture and heritage."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. I would top Moana as one of my favorites next to Disney's Brave. And I loved how they used the Rock as one of the voice actors."
"__DISNEY__ Of course, he has a great voice and was well suited for Maui."
"__DISNEY__ I cracked up with scenes with Maui and Moana's chicken. Could never get enough of those two. Do you think they will ever come out with a Moana 2?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, but I can hope. It seems they left a lot of story that could be told in a Moana sequel."
"__DISNEY__ I couldn't agree more."
