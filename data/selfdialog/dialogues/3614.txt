"__MUSIC__ What was the name of Adele's first album?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh... it was her age at the time or something like that, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, she did do that. I think it was 22?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that's Taylor Swift's song. I think it was 21."
"__MUSIC__ 21? That seems like really late to release your first album."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I looked it up and 21 is her second album, and her first was 19."
"__MUSIC__ Has she named all her tracks like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, her third one was 25."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, she's going to regret that when she gets older."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I imagine it'll get boring fast."
"__MUSIC__ Her set of pipes sure aren't, though, so I say she gets away with it."
"__MUSIC__ True enough. Rolling in the Deep was my jam back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ And everyone was all over her single 'Hello.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's from her most recent album, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty sure. It was in election parodies, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! I remember the Thanksgiving one."
"__MUSIC__ That one was so funny; I loved it."
"__MUSIC__ Adele brings people together, man."
"__MUSIC__ What are some other tracks from that album?"
"__MUSIC__ I think 'Send My Love' is another popular one. There were a lot of break up songs on the album."
