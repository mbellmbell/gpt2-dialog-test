"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm really looking forward to these conference final series."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too, i can't wait for them to start."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ When does the next round of games start?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Western series starts friday, the eastern series begins saturday."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh; thanks.   who do you think will win these series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, in the east, i'm pretty confident that pittsburgh will beat ottawa.  in the west, i'm really not sure.  how about you?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree with you about Pittsburgh; they just keep winning big games.  In the west, i have a feeling Nashville will get by Anaheim."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's interesting.  Why do you feel that way?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It just looks like they are on a roll.  They swept Chicago, and then they won all their home games against St. Louis.  That's pretty impressive."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ True, but their lack of experience in the playoffs may hurt them.  This is the furthest this team has ever advanced in the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right, but i'm not really sure if Anaheim is a true Stanley Cup type of team.  I know they're good, but look how close they got to being eliminated by Edmonton; that was really a tough series for them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No doubt about that; Edmonton put up quite a fight."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What's your opinion on the situation with the Capitals? I mean, they are a strange team; always so good in the regular season, only to lose in the playoffs year after year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right.  It will be interesting to see if they trade some of the big name players who simply can't produce when the games are real important."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Although, to be fair, Washington got a real tough break in having to face PIttsburgh so early in the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's an excellent point.  The N.H.L. playoff system is absurd; the Caps and Pens were the top 2 teams in the regular season; for them to play each other in the second round is just plain silly."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know; the league is so interested in division rivalries, that they didn't think this out.  they probably didn't anticipate something like this could happen."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, i'm certainly looking forward to these Conference Final games, and of course there's nothing as exciting as the Cup FInals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know; next to the Super Bowl; i think the Cup Finals is my favorite sports events.  Enjoy the games!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You too; best wishes and let's hope for some real exciting, overtime games!"
