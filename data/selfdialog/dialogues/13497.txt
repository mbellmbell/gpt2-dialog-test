"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, how do you think the Panthers will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gosh, I don't know.  When is their first game?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow, that seems late."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the season starts September 7th I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it a home game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes for the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well how do you think they'll do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  I hope they have a better season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they draft some good players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't know.  I know they got McCaffrey and Samuel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they supposed to be good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll find out!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the 49ers haven't done too well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it should be a close game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully both teams will have a better season this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so for their sake!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe their new players can help turn things around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I still like watching the Panthers play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably just because we're from North Carolina."
