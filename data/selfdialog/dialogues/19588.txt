"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ I just watched a movie called '12 Feet Deep' last night. It was a trhiller about girls trapped in a swimming pool."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that sounds like an interesting movie topic. I don't think I've ever heard of a movie quite like that."
"__MOVIES__ I was more unique than many movies. It still wasn't all that exciting though."
"__MOVIES__ Why not? Was it a run of the mill thriller movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, something like that. The villian in it was kind of pointless and I just couldn't really connect with any of the characters."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I understand. I'm looking forward to the new 'Jumanji' movie I loved the first one when I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I heard about it. Too bad we have to wait until December for it."
"__MOVIES__ It's supposed to be a sequel to the old movie but involving a computer game rather than a board game."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how they're going to be able to connect a board game with a computer game. I hope it doesn't involve some sort of future aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Future aliens would be lame. Though Dwayne Johnson is starring in it and many of his movies have been lame."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I hope this movie turns out decently."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I know I'll wind up seeing it either way."
"__MOVIES__ Have you read the book 'Ready Player One?' That's being turned into a movie as well. It's coming out in March."
"__MOVIES__ I read the book and really enjoyed it. I was wondering if there were any plans on making it into a movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know much at all about this movie just that it's directed by Steven Spielberg and scored by John Williams."
"__MOVIES__ I love those two guys. It sounds like it'll be a good movie no matter what they come up with."
"__MOVIES__ I sure hope so. I want it to be fairly straightforward like the book was. No some sort of meta movie that I can never get into."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I don't like those thinking movies too much."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess only time will tell what they'll come up with. They have more than half a year to perfect it!"
