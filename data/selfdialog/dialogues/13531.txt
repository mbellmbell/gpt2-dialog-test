"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see they released the 2017 NFL Schedule?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did! Looks like there will be some good games!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, it seems like the Draft just happened but Training Camp opens in 3 weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Training Camp is such a tease, I think they need to shorten the pre-season to 2 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do I, 4 games is unnecssary, especially when you have to pay the same price for tickets as you do in the regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those games should be comped, there is more entertainment at the high school level!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The third game isn't bad, at least you get to see the stars a bit longer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of stars, why do you think Colin Kaepernick still isn't signed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to tell - he has such a unique skill set, I think the controversy is kind of drummed up to pass the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I tend to agree, I wasn't a big fan of his play dating back to his time at Nevada."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be interesting to see him get a shot with a team that is just a QB away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps - maybe a team like the Texans could pick him up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not a bad idea, it seems like any one they could sign would be better than they have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they did take a QB high in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True - what was his name?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't remember, maybe that speaks to why they should look into signing someone else!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the Raiders chances with Carr back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have as good of a chance as anyone, especially with Lynch in the fold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be interesting to see, the AFC West is kind of a mixed bag with Denver, San Diego and KC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think KC will be the team to beat in that Division, but I've always pulled for Rivers in San Diego."
