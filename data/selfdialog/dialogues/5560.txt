"__STAR_WARS__ I can't believe the Star Wars movies didn't follow a sequence but went backwards in time."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is kind of weird and interesting at the same time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw the last Star Wars movie and I wasn't disappointed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same here, is it possible that they may even gotten better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ This last Star Wars movie was much better than Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it was.  It was also better than The Clone Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite Star Wars movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to say the first one, the one that surprised me so much and started it all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Does it seem to you that Lucas seems more distant now in the production of Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really, he's there.  He's not going to let anything happen to his crown jewel."
