"__STAR_WARS__ But to include that development story would['ve taken the movie over 3 hours. Who knows, maybe they did have the footages, but decided to cut it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't if that's true, but if they did cut it, they made a mistake."
"__STAR_WARS__ or maybe they didn't have the footages"
"__STAR_WARS__ Then that's just poor planning."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, either way, we agree the character of Darth Maul cold've used more development."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. definitely. And he was such an evil creature, it would've been delightful to see his torture, harsh treatment and how he become evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would've been great"
"__STAR_WARS__ More fulfilling to watch and follow the story"
"__STAR_WARS__ yep. Like how he deevlops his telekinesis would've been a great back story"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah! That was so evil, i wanted to know that too."
