"__MUSIC__ How was the concert last night?"
"__MUSIC__ It was awesome. Journey really did well with their new singer."
"__MUSIC__ New singer? It's not Steve Perry any more?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah.  Hasn't been for a while now. They got a new guy, Arnel Pineda."
"__MUSIC__ How does he sound?"
"__MUSIC__ It's incredible, He sounds exactly like Steve Perry."
"__MUSIC__ That's incredible! Are they doing the Perry songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep.  And it's funny. In an interview, Arnel told the reporters that he had been singing for nearly his entire life, and was pitching his voice to sound like Steve Perry."
"__MUSIC__ That's very cool.  By the way, are you going to see Nightwish? They're coming to town next month."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of them.  What kind of music do they have?"
"__MUSIC__ I think the best description is Symphonic Metal.  They have a soprano as the lead singer, and have had different ones over time."
"__MUSIC__ That's unusual.  It sounds pretty good though."
"__MUSIC__ It is.  The current one, Floor, has a really rich voice, and you can tell that she has been professionally trained."
"__MUSIC__ I may have to go then.  I like unusual combinations in music."
"__MUSIC__ Like the Cellists who perform metal on their cellos?"
"__MUSIC__ Apocalyptica? Yeah, they're pretty fun."
"__MUSIC__ I like their cover of Nothing Else Matters.  It's haunting."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite is Hall of the Mountain King, but you know that I'm a sucker for classical music, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's why I had you check out Bond.  Are you going to get their latest album?"
"__MUSIC__ Already did and it's on endless repeat in my car."
