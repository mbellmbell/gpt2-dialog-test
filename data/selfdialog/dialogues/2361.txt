"__MUSIC__ Did you see Katy Perry in Carpool Karaoke?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I just saw that on YouTube today."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she'd be fun at parties."
"__MUSIC__ She seems fun, but ditsy. But, what about her music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's a reason I said she'd be fun at parties."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't like her?"
"__MUSIC__ She sounded awful. She has no natural singing voice and she was out of tune the entire time."
"__MUSIC__ Ouch."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously, she was bad. Did you hear her try to harmonize?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she actually did it."
"__MUSIC__ But it was boring harmonization. It didn't add anything other than 'look at what I can do'"
"__MUSIC__ I thought she sounded good."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but as we've established, you have awful taste and can't tell when someone is out of tune or not."
"__MUSIC__ Well, sorry for trying to just have fun."
"__MUSIC__ I do have fun. I just want professional musicians work tens of millions to be able to come through in a live performance."
"__MUSIC__ It was in a car for two hours."
"__MUSIC__ So?"
"__MUSIC__ You're impossible."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she and Mariah Carey are the only ones to not be able to do it. Everyone else sounded awesome."
