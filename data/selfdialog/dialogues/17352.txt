"__MOVIES__ Did you see that movie A Monster Calls? Sigourney Weaver and Felicity Jones were in it."
"__MOVIES__ No, I never even heard of it.  Was it in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was for a few weeks.  Unfortunately, they pulled it really early."
"__MOVIES__ So it wasn't good?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I thought it was amazing but I think they marketed it as a kids fantasy type movie."
"__MOVIES__ What type of movie was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was more of a drama and sad movie.  It's about a boy dealing with grief because his mother is sick with cancer."
"__MOVIES__ So, not one you want to take the kids to huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah definitely not.  It was based on a book and the book is really good."
"__MOVIES__ They're making a ton of movies based on books in the past few years aren't they?"
"__MOVIES__ They are.  That new movie Before I Fall is also based on a book.  It's a teen book I think by Lauren Oliver."
"__MOVIES__ When did that come out?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it came out sometimes in March. I saw it at a small independent theater in town."
"__MOVIES__ Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was very good but I looked up reviews later and it looks like it got pretty mixed reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anyone in it that I would know?"
"__MOVIES__ The star is Zoey Deutch. She played in Vampire Academy a few years ago."
"__MOVIES__ That one was based on a book too right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was. Lucy Fry was in that as well. I thought she was quite good in what I've seen her in but she's not really taken off."
"__MOVIES__ She was good in that movie Mr. Church."
