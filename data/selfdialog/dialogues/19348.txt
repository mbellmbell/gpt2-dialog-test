"__MOVIES__ You know what movie I really enjoyed? Chef!"
"__MOVIES__ The Jon Favreau, Scarlett Johansson movie where he's a top chef and leaves it behind to start a food truck with his son?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the movie. I really enjoyed all the shots of food and the meals. It was funny and heart warming too."
"__MOVIES__ I was so hungry when watching that. Remember when he made the grill cheese sandwich? My mouth was drooling."
"__MOVIES__ The way they shot all the cooking scenes with the closeups on what was being cooked definitely made my stomach growl in hunger."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the Robert Downy Jr. cameo in there?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah that's right Robert Downey Jr. was in there. He was the business guy right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was a brief scene but it was so Robert Downey Jr."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not surprised he was in there. Jon and Robert are really good friends."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Jon, Robert's chauffeur driver in the Iron Man series?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! He is, he's in every Iron Man movie suited as the chauffeur."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny. Chef was a really surprisingly good movie. I didn't expect much from it. Sofia Vergara played Jon's wife in the movie right?"
"__MOVIES__ Sofia was his ex-wife I think but yeah she was in the movie. I think they were either separated or divorced and he would have his son half of the time."
"__MOVIES__ The scenes with the food truck set up and John Leguizamo as the trusted friend helping out were really entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Cuban sandwiches! That made me want to try one!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Those sandwiches looked so good."
"__MOVIES__ The son taking pictures of their journey was really cool too."
"__MOVIES__ I felt that was the heart warming part. He kept the project a secret until the end. It was a really good father son relationship movie."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the movie so much. I wish Scarlett was in there more. She basically was just at the restaurant."
"__MOVIES__ I loved those restaurant scenes. I also loved it when Jon blew up at the food critic. Great, fun movie."
