"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Michael Jackson song?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I have just one. Can I give you a few?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, just one."
"__MUSIC__ You're strict."
"__MUSIC__ Mine's 'Thriller'. See, it's not hard."
"__MUSIC__ That's definitely one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, let's narrow it down."
"__MUSIC__ I also have to consider 'Billie Jean,' 'Beat It,' and 'Bad'."
"__MUSIC__ It seems you're into old school Michael."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. I'd say his early solo stuff was his best work."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. He kept working, but could never really capture the level he had in the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I also really like 'Smooth Criminal' even though I still don't really know what it's about."
"__MUSIC__ Right? Who is Annie?"
"__MUSIC__ And why keep asking if she's okay when she's clearly not?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! That song just had a really good beat."
"__MUSIC__ You know what's funny is I used to sing along to 'Billie Jean' as a kid and had no idea what it was about."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! It wasn't until I got older that I was like, ohhhh..."
"__MUSIC__ He probably had to deal with that kind of thing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, anytime someone gets famous the crazies will come out."
"__MUSIC__ At least we got an awesome song out of it."
