"__MUSIC__ Hey, it's great to see you here."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad I saw you too."

"__MUSIC__ I just love country music."
"__MUSIC__ I do too.  It is so much fun to line dance when the right song comes on."
"__MUSIC__ Did you go to any other concerts recently?"
"__MUSIC__ I have been to a couple of local festivals with local bands and artists."
"__MUSIC__ Those are always fun because you can discover new talent."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I sometimes enjoy listening to new songs from new people."
"__MUSIC__ I get sick of listening to the same songs over and over again on the radio."

"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to regular radio?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I also like listening to Pandora, sirius, and spotify on occasion."

"__MUSIC__ It is worth it to be able to listen to music without commercials."
"__MUSIC__ Well, enjoy the concert."
"__MUSIC__ You too!"
