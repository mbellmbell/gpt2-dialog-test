"__MOVIES__ Did you hear about the new Planet of the Apes movie?"
"__MOVIES__ There's another one? Didn't they already make one?"
"__MOVIES__ This one is actually the third modern version of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really? The third? I guess I never saw the first two."
"__MOVIES__ The first one was pretty good, and the second one was okay. The third one looks pretty cool!"
"__MOVIES__ Now, when you say the first one, do you mean the one with Charleton Heston?"
"__MOVIES__ Charleton Heston? I don't even know who that is."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, okay. He was in the original Planet of the Apes from the 60s."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't know that. Is it a good movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not bad. It's a little campy by today's standards, but the twist at the end is pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ Is it the same twist as there is in the remake?"
"__MOVIES__ The twist is that the planet is earth and that apes took it over."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that's the same twist. It was pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty cool in the original movie too. It sounds like the new ones are paying homage to it, at least."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, but they're good action movies."
"__MOVIES__ Do the apes wear suits, or is it all computer animated?"
"__MOVIES__ It's all computer animated, but it's very realistic. I was kind of scared."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they would bring back animatronics and puppets. Computers just can't produce the same effect."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. Still, I'm excited to see the new movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, maybe I'll have to check it out too."
