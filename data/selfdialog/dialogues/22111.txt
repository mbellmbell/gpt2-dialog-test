"__DISNEY__ What do you think about classic Disney films like Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ I like the cartoon style of animation from those old movies."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. There was something magical about them, everything from Neverland in Peter Pan to the castle in the animated Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I can't quite put my finger on it, but they were more colorful than the recent flicks."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and the two dimensional style made them feel less real."
"__DISNEY__ You're on the right track."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know. The modern ones with three dimensional animation lack a fantasy element, even though I loved Finding Nemo."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, Willem Dafoe was awesome as Gill; but the setting was too modern."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, present-day settings and realistic effects hinder escapism."
"__DISNEY__ And that's what Disney once stood for: transcendent movies that brought out the child in all of us."
