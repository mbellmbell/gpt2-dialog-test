"__MOVIES__ I'm beginning to think that movies with both Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are the best for group watching."
"__MOVIES__ What makes you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, first off, the writing is always great."
"__MOVIES__ Tina Fey probably wouldn't be part of them if it wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ Right, and they're geared towards audience participation. So everyone's always laughing and talking."
"__MOVIES__ So, like, you want people to participate when you have a movie night."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. I want everyone to have fun."
"__MOVIES__ We did have fun last time with Mean Girls."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think we should try next week?"
"__MOVIES__ What are the choices?"
"__MOVIES__ I want to do another movie with both of them. So either Baby Mama or Sisters."
"__MOVIES__ Of those I'd prefer Baby Mama, I didn't really like Sisters."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe this is a mistake then. Are there any other movies you think might be good?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, speaking of Tina Fey, I thought she was great in This is Where I Leave You."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie about a funeral, but it's also very funny. Jason Bateman is in it."
"__MOVIES__ That could be interesting then! I love Jason Bateman."
"__MOVIES__ It's a good role for him, too."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we can try that if you want."
"__MOVIES__ Great! I'll bring a copy."
