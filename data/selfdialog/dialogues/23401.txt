"__DISNEY__ My daughter can't stop watching Mary Poppins."
"__DISNEY__ That's pretty cool for an eight year old to like!"
"__DISNEY__ She just loves Mary and her whimsical charms."
"__DISNEY__ I've always preferred Fred myself."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they'll do a remake of that movie."
"__DISNEY__ I hope not.  There's really no reason to."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Disney seems to remake everything these days."
"__DISNEY__ I get that, but some things should be left alone."
"__DISNEY__ Well get ready, the remake is coming next year."
"__DISNEY__ Oh no!  Why, Disney, why?"
