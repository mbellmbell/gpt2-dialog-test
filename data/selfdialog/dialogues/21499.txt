"__DISNEY__ Hey User 2, I'm looking for a movie for my kids to watch this weekend. Any suggestions?"
"__DISNEY__ Are your kids fans of video games?"
"__DISNEY__ Video games? Heck, that's all they do these days."
"__DISNEY__ In that case, I would suggest watching 'Wreck-it Ralph'."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, is that a movie about video games?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, the main character is an arcade game villain, from a game kind of like Donkey Kong."
"__DISNEY__ Donkey Kong? I don't know if my kids will get the reference."
"__DISNEY__ See, that's the great part. The movie has all sorts of references and cameos from video games from the arcade era all the way up to modern games, even some mobile games' characters make an appearance."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, that sounds good. I think my son will like it, but what about my daughter?"
"__DISNEY__ One of the protagonists is a girl named Vanellope von Schweetz, whose backstory models her as an inspiration to girls, especially ones who may have encountered bullying."
