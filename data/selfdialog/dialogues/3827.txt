"__MUSIC__ Not really. Let's just see what's on."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like country, that okay with you?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really care for country."
"__MUSIC__ How about this?"
"__MUSIC__ Is this Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ Katy Perry. I'm guessing this isn't good either."
"__MUSIC__ Sorry, I guess I'm pickier than I thought."
"__MUSIC__ How about this?"
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles? I can get into this for a bit."
"__MUSIC__ I've always loved Paperback Writer."
"__MUSIC__ It's already over though!"
"__MUSIC__ And I don't recognize this."
"__MUSIC__ I don't either. Let's change it up again."
"__MUSIC__ This is getting complicated. Want to just put something on from my phone?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. Hand it over."
"__MUSIC__ Here you go. No promises though."
"__MUSIC__ Ugh, can we just do NPR?"
"__MUSIC__ Whatever you want."
