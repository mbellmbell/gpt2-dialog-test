"__MUSIC__ Some artists really last for a long time, longer than you'd expect them to stay popular."
"__MUSIC__ Like who do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it happens a lot but I'm not thinking about people who stay popular because they died when they were. I'm thinking about people like Elton John."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I'd describe Elton John as popular."
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding? His music is everywhere!"
"__MUSIC__ Come on, everywhere?"
"__MUSIC__ He's on the radio with his older rock stuff, he's in movies, commercials, tv shows, broadway. He's everywhere!"
"__MUSIC__ But isn't that because he changed genres? Rocket Man is a far cry from The Lion King."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's my point though."
"__MUSIC__ What is?"
"__MUSIC__ That sometimes someone can be really good but they fade out really fast because they can't or won't do what he does."
"__MUSIC__ You mean selling out and working for Disney?"
"__MUSIC__ The basic thing of what he does is being a great singer and piano player, right?"
"__MUSIC__ I can go with that."
"__MUSIC__ Why is doing that as a rock star better than writing songs that Disney puts in a movie and everyone knows?"
"__MUSIC__ Because rock and roll is about freedom and Disney is about money and princesses!"
"__MUSIC__ I just don't think you can call someone a sell out for finding ways to keep their music relevant. People move on and grow and change."
"__MUSIC__ All the way to the bank."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but I bet you know those Lion King songs, and he's still got a career long after most of his contemporaries are in quiet retirement."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, you made your point."
