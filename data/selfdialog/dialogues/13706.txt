"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, I have a confession about my sudden basketball interest."
"__BASKETBALL__ What is it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The only reason I have suddenly become intrigued by basktball . . . is because of the manga/anime series Kuroko's Basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Really? Is that the one with the boys with oddly colored hair?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Ha, that description could apply to a lot of anime. But yeah, it's a basketball anime featuring talented basketball athletes with goofy hair."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, what did you enjoy about basketball in the series?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I loved the guy who could always make three pointers and could even perfectly make shots from over half the court if he wasn't blocked."
"__BASKETBALL__ Uh, that doesn't sound realistic -"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, and there was the person who could perfectly copy any other player's move as soon as he saw it."
"__BASKETBALL__ How does that make any sense-"
"__BASKETBALL__ As well as my absolute favorite: the player who no one really notices and who uses misdirection to basically be invisible!"
"__BASKETBALL__ ...I'm really not sure how that works. Does he at least look fairly typical so that kind of make sense?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, he actually has blue hair."
"__BASKETBALL__ How can people not notice someone with blue hair?!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not too sure to be honest. I've been getting the sense that real basketball is not like this show."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that almost sounds like superheros playing basketball as opposed to normal people."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're probably right. I've also been missing the focus on emotional arcs in the real life basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Er, why would that be featured?"
"__BASKETBALL__ There are also so many meaningful speeches in anime!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe you should just stick to watching sports anime instead of actual sports then."
