"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, man, did you catch the NFL draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I caught parts of it, they had some interesting picks here and there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, anyone in particular you thought was a good choice?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, again, only caught part of it, but I think  Solomon Thomas for the 49ers might be a good choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, could be, he seems pretty versatile Only thing I find odd about him as pick is they already got decent defense men."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you can never have too many defensemen as long as you're not neglecting the other areas you'll need."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about you?  What picks did you find interesting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought Joe Williams was a good pick, myself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, missed that part.. where did he get picked up from?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Utah.  He's got a pretty record with speed he's got like 1,407 yards on 210 carries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, not bad!  That'll be good for dodging tackles and whatnot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's what i was thinking.  Did you remember any other picks you got?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, not sure about 'good' but definitely notable...  Reuben Foster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I heard about him.. did he fail a drug test?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's what I meant about concerns, but lot of his teammates support his character so, the result could have been a false positive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's not like there no drugs in the NFL... I mean, if you took out everyone I bet half the teams would have to stay home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's true, but from what I understand, the guy was really sought after, even got a A+ rating from Niner's wire online."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, they're awfully pick about who they get anything above a 'B' to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So I've been told."
