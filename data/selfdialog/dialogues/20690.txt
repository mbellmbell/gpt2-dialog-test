"__THRILLER__ What's your favorite Thriller movie of all time?"
"__THRILLER__ Easy, easy, easy. The Shining, it's such a classic."
"__THRILLER__ Right on. Jack Nicholson is absolutely mad and it's based on a Steven King book."
"__THRILLER__ I remember watching as a kid and having nightmares."
"__THRILLER__ Do you remember what was in the nighmares?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, those twins on the bicycles and of course REDRUM."
"__THRILLER__ I watched it a little later than you I'm guessing, probably 15 or 16, so it was less scary, but my dad told me to watch out for REDRUM."
"__THRILLER__ Did that make it easy for you to understand that it spelled MURDER when you reversed it?"
"__THRILLER__ Ha! No, not at all, he had to make that connection for me."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I can see how one might get fixated on the RUM part."
