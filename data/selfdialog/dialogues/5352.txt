"__STAR_WARS__ So what's happening in the Star Wars universe right now?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the original Star Wars story has already passed with the Skywalkers and Darth Vader, and the next generation is being followed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who are the next generation of jedis?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well funny you say that. There are actually no more jedi's. And the new movies are new jedis."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh! Return of the Jedi!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah exactly. The new heroine is Reya."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a pretty cool name. Is she strong?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, she found out she had Jedi powers in the first movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Does she use her powers for good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know... You'll have to watch the movie!"
