"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best quarterback in the NFL right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say Tom Brady. And that's saying something because there are some other really good ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to agree. The numbers he put up last year even after missing the first four games were amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and he's absolutely ageless it seems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there are others who are really good but fall short."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say Aaron Rodgers is the next best, but he was inconsistent last year before turning it on later in the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Rodgers when he's on comes pretty close to Brady. What other quarterbacks are up there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always liked Ben Roethlisberger, but he gets hurt too much and may be tailing off now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he has the career success that puts him up there. I think Matt Ryan is very good, but needs to do it for longer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ryan had a fantastic year last year, but I think a lot of that had to do with Julio Jones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably true. I think Drew Brees is still really good and Andrew Luck has the talent, he just needs a better line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like Luck may be a little overrated because people were wowed by his talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the next couple of years will tell us a lot about Luck and how good he really is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I would agree with that. Which young quarterbacks do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Mariota, Winston, and Carr are poised to be good for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Matt Stafford is moving up my list with the numbers he's put up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Stafford to me is just empty numbers though, he's never proven himself to be able to elevate his team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know I just think he has had bad teams around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Prescott in Dallas? He had an amazing year last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if a lot of that was due to the players around him. Plus it's only one year, he has a lot more to prove."
