"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bro, you ready for football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck yes! Who you got winning this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got the Minnesota Vikings! No ones going to stop that defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're funny! They'll never make it past Aaron Rodgers! He's the best in that division!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't count Sam Bradford out. He's a poor man's Aaron Rodgers but we have a better defense than those cheeseheads!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, right! Who do you think taking the AFC conference?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either the Raiders or the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me, too. But, that's only if Brady and Carr make it through the whole season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea Carr got hurt last year and Brady's getting old too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but you can never count the G.O.A.T Tom Brady out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, the cheating Patriots never fails."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Call them cheaters all you want but they're the best in history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. You still have the Packers, Steelers, and Niners if you're talking history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After this season, Patriots will be the sure best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, stop living in the past."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget about Atlanta, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny! Go to the Super Bowl to only spoil the lead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was just bad coaching."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Should have killed time instead of throwing it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, the nfl is rigged!"
