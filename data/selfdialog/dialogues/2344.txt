"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you like to listen to parodies of songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I sure do!  Do you have a favorite parody musical artist?"
"__MUSIC__ I sure do!  I have been listening to 'Weird Al' for a while now."
"__MUSIC__ I love Weird Al!  What is your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ It changes from time to time.  It is really hard to say!"
"__MUSIC__ I think my favorite is called One More MInute.  It is not so much a parody as a silly song."
"__MUSIC__ I love silly songs!  That is one of my favorites, along with Amish Paradise!"
"__MUSIC__ I like that one too!  Do you know the artist for Gangsta Paradise said he did not give Al permission to parody that at first?"
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I thought Al always got permission first!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, in fact, Weird Al said he did get permission."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Coolio just did not like this version?"
"__MUSIC__ Who knows?  I really enjoyed it, and I love the video as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he always has some amazing and fun videos!"
"__MUSIC__ He does, and he puts on a great concert, too!"
"__MUSIC__ You have been to a Weird Al concert?  That's awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  We had three generations go to the concert."
"__MUSIC__ And everyone enjoyed it?"
"__MUSIC__ They sure did.  You should go if you get the chance."
"__MUSIC__ I wiil look into it!  Sounds like fun!"
"__MUSIC__ You will love it!  Weird Al is awesome!"
