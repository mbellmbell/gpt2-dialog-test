"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the NFL cares about the safety of the players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they care, but I don't thinks they will make any significant Changes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they better think about it before they lose all of their best players to injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't care about the players enough. There will always be more players to fill in when someone gets hurt"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you think they are worried that kids will stop playing football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No.   There will always be football. It is americas favorite sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the viewers. They might lose viewers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Never.  People will never stop watching football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. You're probably right. With as much as people gamble and play fantasy football, they will always tune in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ While I don't personally like injuries, it is a rough game and injuries happen. Sometimes it adds more excitement to the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what you say until someone on your favorite team gets hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite quarterback never gets hurt so I am not worried."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady. I am a huge fan of his ever since he played for Michigan in college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh.  So you're a Patriots fan then? I can't stand patriots fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Darn right I cheer for the champions. Did you watch last years Super bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I had better things to do than watch the patriots cheat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're just mad that your team will never be as good as the patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe so. But my team doesn't deflate balls and spy on the other team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We are the champions my friend. And we'll keep on fighting till the end."
