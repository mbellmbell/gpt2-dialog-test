"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best player in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady, definitely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I take it you're a New England Patriots fan then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. I'm just stating facts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes Tom Brady so good in your opinion?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a fact. Who was the MVP at the last Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it is true that Tom Brady won the the MVP in this year's Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not just this year. This was the fourth time he's won it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Other players have won it multiple times though, not just him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's won Superbowl MVP more than any other player - four times. Joe Montana won it three times back in the 1980's"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think he's overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think you're being a snob. He has earned his accolades."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you think it's time for him to retire?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To be honest I thought he would retire after he won MVP in Superbowl 2015. Yet he stayed playing, and came back to win MVP again in Superbowl 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's almost 40 years old now though. I think his career is coming to an end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, well it had to someday didn't it. He looks like he may still have some power left in him for another year or two though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he doesn't get injured first, maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes at his age his body can't handle any serious injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I couldn't handle that kind of injury at my age and I'm 22!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thank goodness for all that padding and body protection they wear!"
