"__BEATLES__ Have you listened to many alternate recordings of Beatles songs?"
"__BEATLES__ Nope, can't say I have. I've only listened to regular single and album versions."
"__BEATLES__ Ah, for shame, you're missing out."
"__BEATLES__ Are there a lot of alternate versions out there?"
"__BEATLES__ Yup, there are a ton. I'm listening to an alternate version of 'I'm Looking Through You' which is super delightful."
"__BEATLES__ That's a great song. Is the alternate version much different?"
"__BEATLES__ The melody is the same, but the arrangement is quite different."
"__BEATLES__ That's probably my favorite kind of alternate version."
"__BEATLES__ Me too! Demos and early versions are fun, but I like when the arrangement is totally different."
"__BEATLES__ I see there's an album called Anthology that has a ton of alternates. I'm gonna give it whirl!"
