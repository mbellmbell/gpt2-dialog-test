"__MUSIC__ What kind of music are you in to?"
"__MUSIC__ Classic rock all the way."
"__MUSIC__ How did you get in to that?"
"__MUSIC__ It has been on the radio at work everyday for the last 5 years."
"__MUSIC__ I would think you'd get tired of it after that much."
"__MUSIC__ Well it comes and goes with the days."
"__MUSIC__ Have you tried listening to other stations?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but there is always a customer complaint about whatever station we turn to."
"__MUSIC__ Well don't people complain about the rock station?"
"__MUSIC__ That's the weird part, we've never gotten a complaint about it."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't seem possible."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't think it would be, but we've tested the theory. We tried different stations and within an hour someone comes up to us to change it."
"__MUSIC__ Well what kind of stations are you turning it too?"
"__MUSIC__ We've tried country, classical, even hit-pop; someone always complains immediately."
"__MUSIC__ It's weird that one of the most controversial genres is the most accepted now."
"__MUSIC__ I've developed a theory about that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh and why do you think everyone is ok with it."
"__MUSIC__ Well for too reasons, older customers feel nostalgia hearing music from their youth, Middle aged adults were the marketed group so they grew up on it, and anyone younger thinks it's vintage."
"__MUSIC__ It is scary how much sense that makes."
"__MUSIC__ No the scary part is, whatever store you go into is playing a similar station, and no one has claimed alien intervention or government conspiracy."
