"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how are you doing this evening?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am doing good, just counting down the days until football season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean there, I can not wait!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be the best team in the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a tough call. I would have to say the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will repeat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really do, they are so good year after year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a smoothly ran organization from top to bottom."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really is, and that is why you see the results from them on the field every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a good feeling about the Falcons this year, I think they might get back to the Superbowl for the second straight year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still can not believe they let that huge lead they had over the Patriots get away this past Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, how many points were they up exactly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were actually leading by twenty five points in the third quarter!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that has to be considered the best comeback in NFL history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is the best one that I have ever seen without a doubt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that Matt Ryan will get another shot at it though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually would not mind seeing a Patriot and Falcons rematch for this upcoming Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either, I bet it would be another classic if those two squared off again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that the Falcons will be contenders as long as they have Ryan at quarterback, and Julio Jones at receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Jones is the best receiver in football as far as I am concerned."
