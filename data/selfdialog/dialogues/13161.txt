"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are we talking current players or of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All time is fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd go for John Elway personally."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats a good choice but I think Peyton Manning is better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No disrespect to Manning but I don't think he holds a candel to Elway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He set records and was a trail blazer for future generations."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I get that buy Manning has long since beat Elway's records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but Elway was a fan favorite. Manning is as well but people will tell you Elway had much more charisma."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For me it's down to statistics. I don't rally care too much about character."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel the opposite. I think character means almost everything in terms of being the greatest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We would have two completely different lists then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. It might be more similar than you think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright lets see then. Name two more quarterbacks that you feel are on Elway's level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dan Marino  and Brett Farve."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd agree with both of those actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See I told you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah you win this arguement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always do."
