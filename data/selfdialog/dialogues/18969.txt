"__MOVIES__ Do you like scary movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No way, they're so stressful when they have a lot of suspense. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ They're my favorite, can't get enough. I love to get scared, like when they make you jump out of your seat."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite scary movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think Phantasm would have to be in that number one slot for me. Though I really loved The Exorcist, too."
"__MOVIES__ Phantasm? I don't think I've heard of that one. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ There's this kid, he's a teenager I think, and he discovers that there's something strange going on at the local cemetery."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that doesn't sound very original. Kind of cliche, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Well no, the guy who runs the cemetery, he's called the Tall Man, he steals dead bodies and does 'something' with them, and he has all of these metallic spheres that fly around and go after people."
"__MOVIES__ Metal spheres? I don't get it."
"__MOVIES__ Well they're about the size of a softball, and they're like the Tall Man's security system. If anyone is nosing around his place, they fly over to the intruder and these knife-like protrusions pop out and impale the person in the forehead."
"__MOVIES__ What? That's just weird, not scary."
"__MOVIES__ No, it really is scary, you have to watch it. So anyway, the kid's parents die, and the Tall Man takes them, and then he goes after the kid's older brother."
"__MOVIES__ So he's not just stealing bodies, he's recruiting new dead people too?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, and the brother's friend Reggie teams up with the kid to go after the Tall Man. The big shocker is when they wound the Tall Man and he bleeds bright yellow."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so that's the real thing then. The Tall Man is not human?"
"__MOVIES__ No he's not, and then when they get into the guy's house, they find this room where the dead bodies are sent through this magnetic vortex into what looks like another planet or another dimension."
"__MOVIES__ Okay that's just weird again, not scary."
"__MOVIES__ No, no, you have to see it. It really is scary. The bodies are converted into these compact little weird guys, brought back to life, and made into some kind of slaves."
"__MOVIES__ Again, that doesn't sound very scary, but maybe the next time I'm ready to watch a horror movie I will check it out and see. Thanks for the tip."
