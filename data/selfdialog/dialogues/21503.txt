"__DISNEY__ So, seen any good Disney movies lately?"
"__DISNEY__ Let's see.. I saw Moana not too long ago, it was really neat."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I haven't seen that one yet."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's guys The Rock voicing a character in it, so that's pretty cool."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I've seen previews for it.  I rented Zootopia not too long ago."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, what did yout hink?"
"__DISNEY__ Actually, I could not get through it.  I'd gotten the disc from the library and it keep stopping on me because it was so scratched up."
"__DISNEY__ Really/  That's sucks.  Did you try cleaning it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I did but that didn't fix it.  I dunno if it's true or not, but i read someone that Sony DVDs are REAL sensitive to scratches.  Supposedly if I'd bought a $50 cheap DVD player I wouldn't have that problem."
"__DISNEY__ I assuming you mean '$50' was cheap for when you first bought your player, because you can DVD players for like $25 nowdays."
