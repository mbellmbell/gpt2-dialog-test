"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like Lady Gaga's newer music or her greatest hits?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I haven't heard her newest stuff, so I guess I like her greatest hits best."
"__LADY_GAGA__ So which is your favorite song of hers?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Just Dance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, me too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That was my jam back when we would go out dancing in college."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I remember they would play it like 2 or 3 times a night."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, eventually I got burnt out on it, but now I like hearing it every once in a while."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Does it still make you get up and dance?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, her voice and the driving rhythm still get me up and dancing."
