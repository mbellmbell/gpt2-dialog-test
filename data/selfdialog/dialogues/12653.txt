"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so excited that pre-season football will be starting soon!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What QBs are you most excited about this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady will still be awesome, but I think Aaron Rodgers is the best right now or Matt Ryan- geez he had an amazing run last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but honestly I was surprised by Sam Bradford on the Vikings last year. I thought he was done for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true- his stats were really good, especially with the terrible offensive line he had. But he just gets overshadowed because of all the previous team drama"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but I never thought he would have a season like that after he left Philly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited about some of the newer QBs too- Dak Prescott and Carson Wentz in the NFC East both had amazing years for rookies"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they were amazing. I'm also exited about Mariota and Winston"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea they were hyped a lot, it will be interesting to see what kind of a season they have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And of course you still have Andrew Luck, Eli Manning, Drew Brees, Russell Wilson...all veterans who could have amazing seasons again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea but what about the teams with terrible QBs? Goff was horrible, Hoyer is not good enough to be the starting QB for the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they have a quarterback- who do the Jets have? Or the Browns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true- I don't even know- mayeb McGown for the Jets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would put him in the same boat as Hoyer- an acceptable backup but no way he can lead a team all season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are also some older QBs that may be on their way down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I think this season will be telling for quarterbacks like Ben Rothlesberger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Carson Palmer, and Eli Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But who knows- Peyton Manning won the superbowl his last year when people thought he was done"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but he wasn't playing at his previous elite level when he won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But one of these experienced guys could do the same thing if they have the right players in place around them!"
