"__MOVIES__ Hey girl, how have you been?"
"__MOVIES__ I've been pretty good, how about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Great! I went to the movies last night with a few friends and saw the new Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? What did you think about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was awesome! Emma Watson was amazing as Belle."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, she plays the lead in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! The whole cast was stunning. There was Dan Stevens as the beast and Luke Evans as Gaston."
"__MOVIES__ I heard they sang in that movie, did they really sing or did someone sing for them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they all trained before they started shooting in order to actually sing for their parts."
"__MOVIES__ That's amazing, were they any good?"
"__MOVIES__ You bet! And the visuals were amazing, too. This movie was two hours of an artistic masterpiece."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean the special effects were very high end."
"__MOVIES__ So it looked realistic and the beast didn't look too cheesy?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. They put a lot of effort into planning out their scenes and their character designs."
"__MOVIES__ Was it much like the original cartoon?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. It was almost exactly the same! It starts out the same, with the scenes and music, too."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out then."
"__MOVIES__ You should! I'd give this movie a 10/10."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds awesome, I'm so excited to see it. Thanks!"
