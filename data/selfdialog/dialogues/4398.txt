"__MUSIC__ We went to a great concert the other night, Twenty-One Pilots."
"__MUSIC__ Twenty-One Pilots? I think my daughter listens to them."
"__MUSIC__ She probably does, I found them through  my daughter. But they are pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Won't I be like that annoying mom if I start listening to the same music as her?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but I'm sure she'll forgive you if you buy her a few t-shirts and take her to concerts. Just don't buy yourselves matching shirts."
"__MUSIC__ OMG that would be so funny, she would die of embarassment. But I don't really like newer music."
"__MUSIC__ You just think that because you're comfortable with the old stuff. There is plenty of good stuff coming out."
"__MUSIC__ You think I'm in some kind of bubble?"
"__MUSIC__ What are you listening to right now?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't want to say. Backstreet Boys."
"__MUSIC__ You are so in a bubble. Try to listen to Twenty-One Pilots."
"__MUSIC__ I was just in a weird mood! I usually listen to more alt rock than pop."
"__MUSIC__ Then you will really enjoy Twenty-One Pilots. Heathens is a great song, but if you're in a Backstreet mood I would suggest House of Gold."
"__MUSIC__ How is Backstreet related?"
"__MUSIC__ Because that one Backstreet Boy wrote the song for his mom and always talked about her in interviews. House of Gold is like that, but better."
"__MUSIC__ Can you imagine driving down the street singing this stuff while I drive my daughter to school?"
"__MUSIC__ I did it this morning. You should also listen to Tear in My Heart, it might be my favourite."
"__MUSIC__ You're crazy. Besides I said I don't usually listen to Backstreet. So I probably wouldn't like them anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Twenty-One Pilots is nothing like Backstreet Boys."
"__MUSIC__ But you said, nevermind. I'll listen to them."
