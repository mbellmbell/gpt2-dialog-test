"__MOVIES__ What's the oldest movie you've ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ That would be the awful Birth of a Nation."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know it, what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Not the settling of America or the civil war, as you'd expect."
"__MOVIES__ Weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's basically the history of racism from a KKK-is-good point of view."
"__MOVIES__ Wait...what?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the heroes at one point are the KKK members running in on their horses. Also, blackface."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, people aren't subtle. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Citizen Kane."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a bit boring as I don't follow black-and-white movies."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ If they look old, I'm unintersted."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it at all, though?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it had good drama, but the acting."
"__MOVIES__ What about it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was WAY over-the-top."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. 'Old' acting is awful by today's standards, but I liked it."
