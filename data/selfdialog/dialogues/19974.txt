"__MOVIES__ Are you into scary movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it depends. I don't like cheesy scary movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, have you heard of the movie It Follows?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't."
"__MOVIES__ Are you interested in hearing what it is about?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, go ahead and tell me."
"__MOVIES__ It is basically about a mysterious being that follows a person around and if it gets close enough it kills them."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting, and scary."
"__MOVIES__ It really is, its one of the best scary movies I have seen recently."
"__MOVIES__ So what determines who it follows?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I don't know what started it, but its passed along through sex from person to person."
"__MOVIES__ So it comes after anyone who has sex with the carrier?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it goes down the line one by one whoever was the last person to have it."
"__MOVIES__ So your saying if the person its following gets killed it will go after the person they last had sex with?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, pretty much."
"__MOVIES__ Man that sounds really scary."
"__MOVIES__ It is especially scary because they never really know if its gone for good if they have sex with someone."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, its like they could get killed and it would come back for them."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty much what happens in the movie, but they try to kill it at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that's crazy, I'm gonna have to check it out."
