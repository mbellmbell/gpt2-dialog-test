"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Amy Schumer movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't know she had another one out. What's it called?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called Snatched."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a mother and daughter that take a vacation to South America and have to get out of dangerous situations."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that sounds like it could be funny."
"__MOVIES__ The concept is good, but it was really bad."
"__MOVIES__ That stinks. What made it so bad?"
"__MOVIES__ It just wasn't funny at all.  I don't think I laughed once."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't sound very good. Who else was in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Goldie Hawn played Schumer's mom, so I was hoping it would be better."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I would think Goldie Hawn would make it good."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too, but it was disappointing.  Nothing like Trainwreck."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! That's why I was hoping this one would be as good, but it wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sorry it was so bad. Maybe there will be some better comedies that come out."
"__MOVIES__ I can only hope so. Comedies are my favorite genre and I get so disappointed when they're not good."
"__MOVIES__ I can understand that, especially if you're in the mood to laugh."
"__MOVIES__ I was, but it just wasn't happening."
"__MOVIES__ I'll be sure to not go see it then."
