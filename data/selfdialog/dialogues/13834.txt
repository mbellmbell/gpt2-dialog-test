"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Cavs and Celtics games the other night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I missed it, what happened?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs blew out the Celtics by 40 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that's about what I expected."
"__BASKETBALL__ This just isn't going to be competitive."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wanted to see the Wizards make it, but I know it wouldn't have made a difference."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, this was a Golden State and Cleveland final in the making all along."
"__BASKETBALL__ It looked like the Spurs might have given Golden State a challenge in game one."
"__BASKETBALL__ They were up 25 points!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess Steph Curry might be down but never out."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the Spurs had some bad injury luck too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, nothing you can do about that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think both teams will sweep?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Golden State, probably."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not Cleveland?"
"__BASKETBALL__ LeBron is good, but I think Boston will steal one."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Spurs are good too, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but that injury pretty much killed their shot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think will win it all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Golden State, they're looking for revenge after last year."
