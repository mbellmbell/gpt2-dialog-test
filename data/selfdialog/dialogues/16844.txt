"__MOVIES__ Hey. I'm looking for a movie about food?"
"__MOVIES__ Why about food?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm taking a home-ec course, and I need to write an essay on food."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm I don't know. Supersize me?"
"__MOVIES__ What's that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about Mcdonalds, and specifically a guy who eats it every day for a month."
"__MOVIES__ Jeez. That sounds terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Right? He even threw up on tape."
"__MOVIES__ Eww. That's gross."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Maybe you don't want to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Is it interesting?"
"__MOVIES__ As far as documentaries go, it was pretty alarming"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I bet there's lots of stuff about McDonalds that I don't want to know"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it'll be good if you know"
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. I think I'm going to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, by the way..."
"__MOVIES__ What's up?"
"__MOVIES__ Want to get Mcdonalds?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure."
"__MOVIES__ One last time before I find out what's really in their burgers."
