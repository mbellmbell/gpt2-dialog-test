"__MOVIES__ He definitely added some humor to it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear that they're making a live action?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, but I didn't hear too many details."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they only recently announced it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it'll be good."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Not sure how I feel about a live action remake of a classic Disney animation."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm not sure either."
"__MOVIES__ I just looked it up. They're not planning on having any songs..."
