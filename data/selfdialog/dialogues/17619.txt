"__MOVIES__ What is the scariest horror movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ It's got to be The Exorcist. I still don't want to watch that alone."
"__MOVIES__ I need a young priest and an old priest!"
"__MOVIES__ The power of Christ compels you! The power of Christ compels you!"
"__MOVIES__ When I saw Seth McFarland yelling that in This Is The End, I laughed so hard I thought I was going to die."
"__MOVIES__ That is an awesome movie. It's hilarious. I don't know why it doesn't get more respect."
"__MOVIES__ I can give you two good reasons it doesn't get much respect."
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ First, they show giant Satan, and giant Satan's penis."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was not a pretty scene."
"__MOVIES__ Not a great moment for the history of cinema."
"__MOVIES__ So what's the other reason?"
"__MOVIES__ James Franco."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that's true: nobody seems to like James Franco."
"__MOVIES__ Those are the two indisputable reasons why nobody thinks This Is The End is a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ No, there's one thing that should cancel any criticism out."
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ Three words: Back Street's Back!"
"__MOVIES__ You have got to be kidding."
"__MOVIES__ Yo  know you love that song."
