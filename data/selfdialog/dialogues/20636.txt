"__THRILLER__ Who makes the strangest thrillers?"
"__THRILLER__ I'd probably have to say David Lynch."
"__THRILLER__ David Lynch, what did he do again?"
"__THRILLER__ He did Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, Mulholland Drive. I remember watching that one."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah? What did you think?"
"__THRILLER__ To be honest, I didn't really understand it. Was part of it a dream?"
"__THRILLER__ It took me a second watch to fully get what was going on, but yes, it turns out that most of the movie is a dream."
"__THRILLER__ I remember doing a lot of mental work and being frustrated despite getting really engaged in certain parts of the film."
"__THRILLER__ It's a difficult film, but it rewards the repeat viewer"
