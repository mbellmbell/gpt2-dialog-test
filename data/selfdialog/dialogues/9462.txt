"__BASEBALL__ Would you shorten the regular season?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah probably by about 20 games."
"__BASEBALL__ Why that many?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think you need to end baseball by mid October."
"__BASEBALL__ It does go on far too long"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah start the playoffs around Labor Day."
"__BASEBALL__ That would be significant, you would have to change the trade deadline."
"__BASEBALL__ I just think for the amount of games played and playoff teams, its not needed."
"__BASEBALL__ What about the lost revenues?"
"__BASEBALL__ Teams can change their business model and figure it out."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe expand the playoffs?"
"__BASEBALL__ If you do that then you are really negating the regular season"
"__BASEBALL__ So how do you assume you can make the game better?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well I am not trying to improve the game, just eliminate games we dont need."
"__BASEBALL__ People could argue that final weekend is important."
"__BASEBALL__ It can and could be but you gotta assume that theyd be just important early on."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they should expand benches."
"__BASEBALL__ Just hitters?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, teams should be able to carry 3 catchers."
"__BASEBALL__ Your logic is a bit flawed to be honest."
