"__FASHION__ What do you think is the top fashion trend on 2017?"
"__FASHION__ I think it would be the fact that everyone is wearing knitted and tight fitting clothing."
"__FASHION__ Really? I thought for sure it was all the bright stripes and colors that everyone seems to be wearing."
"__FASHION__ You know, that is a really good one too. I think there are a few new fashion trends this year."
"__FASHION__ A lot of girls are also wearing their bras out now."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, that is true. Though I'm not sure I am a big fan of that trend."
"__FASHION__ Personally, I will always be a big fan of the florals. They always seem to come back."
"__FASHION__ Yes! Florals reminds me of the 80's trend that is slowly coming back."
"__FASHION__ You're right. It seems more and more that people are dressing like they used to in the 80's and 90's."
"__FASHION__ Very true. A lot of times clothes don't even match anymore and everyone still seems to love it."
"__FASHION__ I do see that a lot. They wear colors like orange and purple and everyone thinks that it looks good."
"__FASHION__ I think that mismatched colors can look good, but sometimes people get a little carried away with the combinations."
"__FASHION__ I've noticed that a lot of the stars like to really follow the newest fashion trends."
"__FASHION__ I've noticed that too. They wear this stuff even if it does not look good on them."
"__FASHION__ Then again, sometimes the stars start the fashion trends."
"__FASHION__ Especially like the Kardashians. They seem to always be starting some new trend."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, like the trend with the clear boots."
"__FASHION__ Those things looked so uncomfortable. I dont understand why anyone would want to wear them."
"__FASHION__ I guess we can both agree that a lot of the new fashion trends are a little crazy and uncomfortable."
"__FASHION__ Yes they are, and still people love to wear these things."
