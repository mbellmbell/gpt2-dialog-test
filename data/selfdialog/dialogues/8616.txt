"__BEATLES__ Hey,the song day in the life from the Beatles wasn't played in England until like 1985!"
"__BEATLES__ Really? Why is that."
"__BEATLES__ The line,'I'd love to turn you on' was considered a reference to drugs and that didn't go over to well in England."
"__BEATLES__ Can you imagine? The crap that's allowed on radio now is rediculous compared to that."
"__BEATLES__ I know. Stuffed shirts in England."
"__BEATLES__ Boy isn't that the truth."
"__BEATLES__ In fact,the song took awhile in America to be accepted because it was different and so long."
"__BEATLES__ Yes,I've read that too."
"__BEATLES__ Hard to believe because it's an iconic song now."
"__BEATLES__ It sure is and always will be"
