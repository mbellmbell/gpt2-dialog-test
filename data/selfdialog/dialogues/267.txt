"__MUSIC__ Have you been listening to Country music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes, why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ It just seems to me that Country music today doesn't seem like the Country music of old."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, many of the songs you hear on the radio today almost seem like rock or even rap hybrids."
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean like Brantley Gilbert or Sam Hunt?"
"__MUSIC__ They are two examples.  I like their music, but it does not represent what Country music really is."
"__MUSIC__ You mean like Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks and Alabama?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, some of the good old country music artists."
"__MUSIC__ You're right.  The music definitely is not the same as it used to be."
"__MUSIC__ That really disappoints me, since I really liked Country music how it used to be."
"__MUSIC__ Well why don't you just turn off the radio, and listen to what you want to listen to, from YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ I should really do that.  It's just sad the radio stations buy into the latest fads."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it would be really nice if their were some Classic Country radio stations out there."
"__MUSIC__ We had one in our area, and they took it off the air, replacing it with an Oldies Station."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what they were thinking."
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea, but it was really a bad choice on their part."
"__MUSIC__ You know who I think is one of the greatest Country artists of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't wait to hear what you will say."
"__MUSIC__ Brad Paisely.  He has to be the best guitarist ever!"
