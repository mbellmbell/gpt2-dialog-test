"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader could have kicked Palpatine's butt if he wanted to."
"__STAR_WARS__ Nah.  Force lightning would fry his suit, just like it did in Jedi.  At best, it would be a mutual kill."
"__STAR_WARS__ Vader didn't have his saber then, and was missing one hand.  If he has his saber, he'd have been able to block it, just like Windu."
"__STAR_WARS__ Windu knew Vaapad.  Vader doesn't."
"__STAR_WARS__ He could have mastered Vaapad. And besides, you don't need Vaapad to block lightning, or to absorb it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Vader couldn't have mastered Vaapad. Vaapad requires you to skirt the dark side, Vader jumped all the way in."
"__STAR_WARS__ He could still absorb it."
"__STAR_WARS__ He couldn't absorb it with his hands, because they're mechanical.  They'd be fried."
"__STAR_WARS__ The force doesn't care if it's mechanical or not, he could absorb Han's blaster bolt with his hand."
"__STAR_WARS__ The blaster bolt wasn't electricity, though."
