"__BEATLES__ Tell me a little bit about why you like The Beatles so much. I understand your Mom liked them."
"__BEATLES__ When I was little, my uncle (who lived at my grandma's house) had every single Beatles album. Grandma had a big cabinet record player/radio, and I used to listen to them on it."
"__BEATLES__ So which ones did you like best? Anything in particular?"
"__BEATLES__ I liked The White Album, and songs like 'Rocky Raccoon' and While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. Clapton played on that one."
"__BEATLES__ Why did Harrison have Clapton play on that one? I mean, he's not a Beatle."
"__BEATLES__ Well, of course not! Apparently they tried having the group play it, but Harrison wasn't satisfied with it, and invited Clapton to play the solo, instead."
"__BEATLES__ That was a good choice. So what other albums?"
"__BEATLES__ I liked 'Help', and 'The Beatles'. I remember watching 'Help', the movie - and knowing all the songs"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that movie was like one big video. maybe it was like one of the first movies written around rock songs."
"__BEATLES__ No, now you're just ignoring greats like Elvis, who did lots of musical movies!"
