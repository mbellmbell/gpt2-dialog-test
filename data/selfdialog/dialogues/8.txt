"__MUSIC__ What do you think of music today? Are there any new artist you like"
"__MUSIC__ I think most of it's garbage. The whole auto today or is it just raced a true singers."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you. There are very few artists you actually can really sing."
"__MUSIC__ Adele is somebody that can really sing her ass off."
"__MUSIC__ You can say that again. That woman's got some pipes on her."
"__MUSIC__ That Meghan Trainor girl seems to have a really good voice as well. I like some of her songs because they're fun."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, I had a chance to listen to our whole album and a lot of the songs on there really fun and made you want to dance"
"__MUSIC__ I heard Lady Gaga alive on the Howard Stern show. She sounded great."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard her sing live a couple times on TV and she sounded really good. She's one of the few who doesn't need auto tune."
"__MUSIC__ What about someone like Reanna."
"__MUSIC__ Not a huge fan there. I think she has a decent voice but I deathly think there's a lot of help behind it."
"__MUSIC__ Look at someone like Britney Spears that had a huge career. She can't sing a damn lick."
"__MUSIC__ Don't even get me started on Justin Bieber. In my humble at 10 opinion, he's a war singer than I am."
"__MUSIC__ If he was just somebody that was standing in a crowd and started singing he would be booed beyond believe."
"__MUSIC__ There is the new guys out there that can really saying. Ed Sheeran, John legend, and Sam Smith really have a great voices."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, those guys can really sing. Ed Sharon really has a good set of vocal chords"
"__MUSIC__ I first heard Sam Smith sing on Saturday night live."
"__MUSIC__ I did too. I went out the next day and downloaded his songs."
"__MUSIC__ Besides that, music today at shit."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you my friend.  It isn't like it used to be."
