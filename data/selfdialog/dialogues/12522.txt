"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The season is nearly about to come. I really can't wait any longer"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When's the first game? First Thurs in Sept?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. I forget who is playing. I know the Superbowl winner always plays opening day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I'm not too sure about who they are playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does it matter anyway? They crush everyone and everything regardless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's forget about pointing out the obvious. How do you feel about the other 31 teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Compared to the Patriots? Not too good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well make believe the Pats don't exist. Who would you see contending"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going all in and think the Chiefs may have a chance this season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're crazy. You really think so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Alex Smith is going to play out of his mind now that he is aware his end is near with them"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only way the Chiefs will progress is if they start stretching the field more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah definitely. No more of these seasons where no receivers catch a single touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is still unreal. It feels like you almost have to try and achieve something that difficult."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. especially when your running game was going so well with Charles and West and whatnot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You would think that would open a ton of single coverage for receivers to take advantage of"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think all they really had was Dwayne Bowe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he could just be consistent in catching the ball he would be such a great player. He can block and everything else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everything, but the most important part of his position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but we will see if the Chiefs finally step up to the plate this season."
