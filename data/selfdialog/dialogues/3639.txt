"__MUSIC__ What should I sing for the talent show?"
"__MUSIC__ Not sure but I do know it shouldn't have a vocal track. I think that always sounds terrible."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. You can never hear the singer."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not even sure why the music teacher allows that."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely want a song that works with my range."
"__MUSIC__ That's important. You don't want to be flat or sharp."
"__MUSIC__ If I can choose something will you listen to see if it's good?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. We'll find a karaoke track for you to practice with and to use at the show."
"__MUSIC__ We'll have to burn it to CD for the teacher to use."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Maybe I'll look through Heidi's karaoke CD's."
"__MUSIC__ She has a bunch since she's a karaoke DJ on the weekends. I'll get them for you."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks. I wonder if she has Christina Perry."
"__MUSIC__ I think she at least has that Thousand Years song."
"__MUSIC__ That's the one I wanted."
"__MUSIC__ I actually do think you'd sound good singing that. It is right within your range."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't someone do it last year?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes but it wasn't good because she couldn't hit the higher notes whe she sings 'one step closer.'"
"__MUSIC__ I can do those notes. I do think that's the song I want."
"__MUSIC__ If she doesn't have it on a karaoke CD I'm sure we can find it somewhere."
"__MUSIC__ I hope so because there's no piano player."
