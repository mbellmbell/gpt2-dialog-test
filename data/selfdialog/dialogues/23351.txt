"__DISNEY__ Hey, what's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, that's a really tough question, there are so many good Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's true. For me though, it's easy. My favorite is the Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Why is it your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ It was a huge part of my childhood. I loved the music and the animation."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I see that. I feel the same way about Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah? My sister loved Aladdin. There was a period of time where she'd watch it every day after school."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I did the same. It transported me to a magical place. What do you make of Aladdin?"
"__DISNEY__ I like it enough, but it doesn't compare to the Lion King for me."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I get that. Everyone has a different Disney movie that they love."
