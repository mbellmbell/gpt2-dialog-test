"__COMEDY__ Hey, so what did you do last night?"
"__COMEDY__ Watched The Big Lebowski."
"__COMEDY__ Really? Again? That's like the millionth time you've watched that movie!"
"__COMEDY__ What can I saw? I can't get enough of John Goodman."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, he's pretty awesome, in just about everything he's in."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, plus Jeff Bridges. Mr. Tron himself."
"__COMEDY__ Tron?"
"__COMEDY__ Oh come on, you haven't seen Tron? That's an 80s classic?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, I was thinking Steve Buscemi when you mentioned The Big Lebowski."
"__COMEDY__ Oh man, Buscemi is great!"
