"__STAR_WARS__ I can not believe the number of meme's there are about Star Wars on the internet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it is an insanely popular and influential series."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true.  I saw one the other day it was outside a coffee shop and they had a picture of Admiral Ackbar with his face next to a coffee cup and he's saying, 'It's a frap!'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha... yeah, I've seen several of those 'It's a trap!' related memes on various place on the web.  One I liked shows young Boba holding his father's helmet and it says, 'Take your son to work day.  Not always successful.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that's terrible!  Funny, but terrible!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought so."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, here's a good one, I remember.. what's the inside temperature of a Tantum?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait.. were those the creatures on that ice planet in Empire, right?  I don't know, what is the temperature?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke Warm."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ooooh...booo!  Boo!  Hiss!  That's bad!  HAha."
