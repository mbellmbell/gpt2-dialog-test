"__SUPERHERO__ Do you prefer the original superman movies or the henry cavil ones?"
"__SUPERHERO__ For me the newer Superman films were a little disapointing."
"__SUPERHERO__ Really why? I liked cavil as superman."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think Cavil was great as Clark Kent.. just something in the script itself. Lacking somehow."
"__SUPERHERO__ Wow I am surprised I feel almost the opposite, like the original movies were lacking."
"__SUPERHERO__ In terms of storyline?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I found the newer ones more intriuging and realistic."
"__SUPERHERO__ I suppose the christopher reeve versions are a little dated and cheesy. But isn't that what a comic is?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe back in the day, but now they seem much darker than originals."
"__SUPERHERO__ Both have a place in my heart. Reeves will always be in the front of my mind as the original superman."
