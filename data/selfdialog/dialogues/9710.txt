"__COMEDY__ Did you ever see The Jerk?"
"__COMEDY__ Who was in that?"
"__COMEDY__ It was with Steve Martin."
"__COMEDY__ So it's an older movie?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, it was from the 80's."
"__COMEDY__ I never heard of it.  What's it about?"
"__COMEDY__ Steve Martin is adopted by this black family and grows up thinking he is black.  Then he goes off on his own into the city."
"__COMEDY__ I don't see how that would make a good movie."
"__COMEDY__ Well, he led a sheltered life and has a good heart, so he trusts everyone.  And he has a skewed view of the real world."
"__COMEDY__ It sound kind of interesting."
