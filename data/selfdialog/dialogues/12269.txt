"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it's that time of year again. FOOTBALL!!!!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am ready. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't even have to ask. I called up the other guys. Everybody is coming over to my place this Saturday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is the year I win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HAHAHA yeah right. You know in Fantasy football you don't have to be loyal to your favorite team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 49ers are doing it this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are putting too much faith in Shanahan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I see a path with Shan and Hoyer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well there is always a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All the pieces are there and this is the year they come together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like I said anything is possible. But in Fantasy football you should be playing the stats at least to some degree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am all in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah....and how has that worked out for you? I've won the two of the last four years and my favorite team is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Rams. Don't know why you like them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't matter as far as fantasy football is concerned. And that is why I win and you don't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the NIners this year..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your only chance with the Niners was 2012. Since then there hasn't been anybody on the team that I would pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that may be but I am a fan. And I will win or lose with them until the end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HAHAHA that is fine with me. I don't mind taking your money. And you're okay to have around too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah yeah. I'll see you Saturday."
