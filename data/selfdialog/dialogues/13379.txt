"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the worst a player could perform and still be seen as worthy of the number one overall draft pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli could be an answer, if were talking NFL performance"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What player from the past do you feel is under appreciated?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Herman Moore, Led league in receptions twice in 3 years, 42 TDs in 4-year peak. Made 3 straight 1st team All Pro and nobody ever mentions him as even a top 10 WR of his era"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though they routinely faced 8 in the box to try and stuff Barry Sanders, Herman Moore and Brett Perriman were legit one of the top 5 duos at WR for a few seasons with fucking Scott Mitchell heaving the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey Scott Mitchell was loved by almost every team in the NFC Central, except the Lions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How dare you disrespect Dave Krieg and Rodney Peete"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, he snagged Holly Robinson. Ain't no one disrespecting that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hated the days of playing against Preist Holmes in two games a year. Then going and playing against LT twice a year. Then of coarse the string of luck with the Chiefs backs after him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's nice but I'd rather have that luck with qb or something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Priest Holmes was the first jersey I ever asked for when I was a kid. The dude pretty much single handed my got me interested in football beyond it being a passing interest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides being an amazing back, wasn't he the guy who would give overly-precise estimates of how much he'd recovered from injuries? 'Hey, Priest, how's the leg?' 'Oh, about 83 percent. I should be back next week.' Was that him or am I getting my wires crossed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Zach Thomas. He was in the shadow of Brooks/Urlacher/Lewis during his era of linebackers. But man he was less athletic and smaller/slower than all those guys but produced insane numbers. He's criminally underrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I very much agree with this. His era really hurt him, but I was a big Zach Thomas fan when he played. Probably an underrated pass coverage linebacker, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is a good ERA for a LB?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really know, but a league where you have to get comparisons to Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher is definitely not it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ London Fletcher fits this description as well. He was one of the hardest LBs in the game for many years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously, didn't he even have marginally better stats than Lewis too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you don't like him as a person that's fine, but if you think London Fletcher was a better LB than Ray you're high"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah for real. Lewis has a legit argument as GOAT MLB and Fletcher just doesn't"
