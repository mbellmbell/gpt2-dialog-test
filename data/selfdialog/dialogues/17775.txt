"__MOVIES__ Do you think it's safe to say Edgar Wright is one of the best directors of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ I think you can make a case for that sure."
"__MOVIES__ It's just I feel like a lot of people look at most of his work as comedies and don't take them seriously."
"__MOVIES__ That's on them, Hot Fuzz is a masterpiece."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention the visual treat that Scott Pilgrim ended up being."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Edgar Wright did those comics justice on the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ Although I could have done without Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah a bit of a weird casting but it worked for me."
"__MOVIES__ I'm really excited to see Baby Driver."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah looks to be another Edgar Wright hit."
"__MOVIES__ There's something about his style, you can just tell it's him."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's like even with him off of Ant-Man you still kind of got his vibes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was still his screenplay I believe, or at least some of it."
"__MOVIES__ Definitley noticeable, wish he was allowed to stay on the project."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but you know how it goes with Marvel, their way or the highway."
"__MOVIES__ Which I think is fine as its their cinematic universe, but a totally Wright helmed Ant-Man, oh boy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it'd be nice to see him get on that level of Marvel blockbuster."
"__MOVIES__ Worked for Joss Whedon."
"__MOVIES__ Sort of, he ended up not really enjoying doing Avengers if I recall."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but he made one of the best super hero movies of all time."
