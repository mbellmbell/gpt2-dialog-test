"__MOVIES__ So what kind of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I love spy and espionage themed movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean like James Bond?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I have seen all of them but it goes deeper than that!"
"__MOVIES__ Like what?  Bourne Identity?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I actually really did enjoy those.   I thought the fight scenes were well choreographed."
"__MOVIES__ Now that you mention it, they really were!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and I thought Matt Damon did an excellent job in the lead role."
"__MOVIES__ So which actor was your favorite Bond?"
"__MOVIES__ Mine would be Roger Moore."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting...why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Partly because I grew up in the 80's.  I also didn't really like any of the later ones."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Timothy Dalton was underrated."
"__MOVIES__ To a certain extent, maybe.  Daniel Craig was the worst!"
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ I just didn't buy all his brooding looks.  He's also a strange looking man who thinks he's attractive."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, you have a point there.  What about Sean Connery?"
"__MOVIES__ He was the original, I think, so I could see why people would say he was the best."
"__MOVIES__ He's definitely my favorite.  Is he even still acting?"
"__MOVIES__ I really don't think so but I'm not sure..."
