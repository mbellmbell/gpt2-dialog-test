"__MOVIES__ What was the best movie you've ever seen in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ That's an odd question, I'm not sure."
"__MOVIES__ Well. me and my husband were talking about it, so I figured you'd be a good person to ask."
"__MOVIES__ Oh haha, yeah I do love movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, so what was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say Titanic, everything about it was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ The emotions of Jack and Rose, seeing the ship sink on the huge screen, the sound in the theater, everything."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought about it that, I guess it was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't think I've ever been so invested in a film."
"__MOVIES__ I just told my husband about it, and he said that's the only movie he ever cried in."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he said he went with his mom and when Jack died he started to tear up."
"__MOVIES__ That's so funny.  I can see why he would though, the setting and scene made me tear up too."
"__MOVIES__ He said it didn't help that the music was epic around that time too."
"__MOVIES__ True.  I think my heart will go on fit better with that movie than any song ever has."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. So we have 2 votes for titanic and 1 vote for wonder woman."
"__MOVIES__ Who voted for wonder woman?"
"__MOVIES__ I did haha. We just saw it and it was so good."
"__MOVIES__ Not better than Titanic though."
