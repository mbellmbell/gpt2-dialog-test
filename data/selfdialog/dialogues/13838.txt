"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Warriors Spurs game yesterday?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I did and it appears the Spurs are done."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, without Kahwi Leonard out the Spurs really have no chance down 3 games to zero."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, but they still have two big man. Both Pau Gasol and LeMarcus Aldridge are playing poorly."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think even with Leonard the Spurs would not win the series, but probably two games."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hrad to tell. The Spurs have a lot of history. They have five world titles."
"__BASKETBALL__ The problem is the Warriors are loaded. Brilliant shooters and great play making."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, but they have a dirty player in Draymond Green."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not sure how dirty Green is, but anyone would like him on their team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why is that? Because he is the heart and soul of the team. Can do anything, rebound and pass and score."
"__BASKETBALL__ Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are superstars. They score are selfless and team players."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true. They are awfully talented and guys like JaVale McGee are having career years."
"__BASKETBALL__ If and when the Dubs win this series how do you feel they will do against the Cavaliers?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It will be some series. Probably go seven games."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree with that. It is particularlly weird because both teams are likely to come into The Finals 12 and 0 which is record breaking."
"__BASKETBALL__ Cleveland won last year. They showed more of a killer instinct with LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is the problem. The Dubs are soft in my opinion. They are a finesse team not a lot of toughness."
"__BASKETBALL__ What makes them soft? They have the best shooters in history"
"__BASKETBALL__ Because they are just that. Shooters. Only Green is tough, in the Finals the play gets rough and you have to be tough."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, the Dubs may win this year but LeBron is a closer and may win it all."
