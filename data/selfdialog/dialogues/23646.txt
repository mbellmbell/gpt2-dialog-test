"__DISNEY__ Did you like the Toy Story movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I really did, I can remember seeing the first one in the theater."
"__DISNEY__ Which one of them is your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, I really like each of them so much.  I guess I'd say Toy Story 3 probably."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that was probably my favorite too.  What did you like about it?"
"__DISNEY__ I was really impressed with the direction the movie took, and how they dealt with Andy growing up."
"__DISNEY__ I know, and then they even added in some pretty scary parts."
"__DISNEY__ For sure, I was really scared for a while, and then I even started to cry."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I cried to.  Although, honestly, I cry at most of the Disney movies that I watch."
"__DISNEY__ It is pretty normal for them to pull on your emotional strings, and trying to convince you that Woody would die is doing just that."
