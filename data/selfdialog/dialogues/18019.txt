"__MOVIES__ What's the last movie you saw in the theater?"
"__MOVIES__ Believe it or not, I think it was Jurassic World."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, one, you don't get out enough. And two: that movie sucked."
"__MOVIES__ It did not!"
"__MOVIES__ For crying out loud, it had the woman running in heels!"
"__MOVIES__ I admit that's bad."
"__MOVIES__ It's not just bad, it's unforgiveable."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, fine."
"__MOVIES__ And then there was the raptor-whisperer."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that was stretching the bounds of being able to suspend disbelief."
"__MOVIES__ It was horrible."
"__MOVIES__ But didn't you like Jurassic World anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ What? Are you crazy?"
"__MOVIES__ No. It was a big, loud summer movie with dinosaurs and a fair amount of blood. That's like the definition of a blockbuster."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's true. But why does it seems like every blockbuster has to have a women running in heels?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the Avengers had Scarlett Johannsen running around in a leather suit she couldn't breath in and heels."
"__MOVIES__ It has to suck: fighting the forces of evil with your breasts hanging out."
"__MOVIES__ And they do it every time. Guardians of the Galaxy: the two main femaie characters are sewn into their clothes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I forgot about that. It was just so stupidly sexist."
"__MOVIES__ Let's not even talk about Cat Woman."
