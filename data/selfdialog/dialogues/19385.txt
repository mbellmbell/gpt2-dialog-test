"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet.  I want to. I just don't know if I can."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it will be too weird watching it without Brian."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah.  I did notice the fact that he was missing."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it too weird?"
"__MOVIES__ No. In fact, they made references to him in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really, like what?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to spoil it for you."
"__MOVIES__ Please tell me. It is ok if it is spoiled."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. One instance is where Dom is talking about 'the Buster' and how he would do his cars."
"__MOVIES__ Awe. I loved the Buster. What else?"
"__MOVIES__ The only other thing is, and this is what really got me, is that Dom named his son Brian."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I bet I would cry at that moment!"
"__MOVIES__ I did!"
"__MOVIES__ Awe I have to watch it now!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think they will continue to make the movies now that he's gone?"
"__MOVIES__ I hope so. They are hard to watch without him but I still love them!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! Love that Dwayne Johnson is such a big part of these movies now."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I love him!"
