"__ROCK__ I'm glad Avenged Sevenfold dropped that new album"
"__ROCK__ Ya, the last one was a little too 'Metallica' for me"
"__ROCK__ How about that new drummer, Brooks Wackerman?"
"__ROCK__ Is he the one that replaced The Rev?"
"__ROCK__ No, they had Mike Portnoy for a while, then Arin Illijay, and now Brooks."
"__ROCK__ Oh, so what do you think of him?"
"__ROCK__ Actually I really like him, his sound is a lot more like their original sound"
"__ROCK__ Ah, I see, so you like their new album then?"
"__ROCK__ Yes, a few songs are weird but mostly it's very good; especially 'Sunny Disposition'"
"__ROCK__ I'll have to check that one out!"
