"__BASEBALL__ The Houston Astros are smoking hot right now!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they have won 9 out of their last 10 games."
"__BASEBALL__ The Astros have the best record in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they are winning about 70% of their games right now."
"__BASEBALL__ I didn't see this coming at all. I figured they would be pretty good, but they are dominating teams"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah right now they are 7 1/2 games in front of the Rangers"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they have won 4 straight games."
"__BASEBALL__ This could be a championship season for the Astros."
"__BASEBALL__ Wouldn't that be crazy. It seems weird that they are a legitimate title contender"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it is a little weird to see them where they are right now."
"__BASEBALL__ But let's not get ahead of ourselves. It is still early in the season."
"__BASEBALL__ True. You don't want to jump the gun because there are so many games left."
"__BASEBALL__ True. But when I look at the American League West, I don't see anyone contesting them."
"__BASEBALL__ Me neither. They may coast in the division all year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah for sure, but their challenge is the Yankees"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the Yankees are their competition this year. To me, they are the frontrunners in the American League"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but I hate the Yankees, I wouldn't mind the Astros getting to the World Series"
"__BASEBALL__ Truthfully, anyone but the Yankees!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah maybe the Astros can pull it off. They have to believe in themselves."
"__BASEBALL__ That's the key, especially for an organization that's not used to winning."
