"__MOVIES__ Did you see the Dirty Dancing remake on tv last night?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I watched it with my mom. She said the original was much better."
"__MOVIES__ You never saw the original movie with Patrick Swayze?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I never watched it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you should check it out sometime. It's a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Does it have a lot of singing? I wasn't crazy about all the singing in the new version."
"__MOVIES__ There is music, but it's not a musical like the tv version. It was more just music throughout the movie and dancing scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Well that makes sense. I kind of liked the dancing scenes. The choreography was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ The choreography in the original version was pretty good too. I guess it was more risky for that time period."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, like really dirty dancing?"
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't that dirty to me. Looking back on it now, it's more dirty because of the age difference."
"__MOVIES__ Well Baby was still in high school right?"
"__MOVIES__ I think she was supposed to be about 16."
"__MOVIES__ That does make it kind of dirty. She should have fallen for someone closer to her age."
"__MOVIES__ It's a love story. He taught her to dance and helped her grow up."
"__MOVIES__ Girls in these types of movies always fall for the bad boys."
"__MOVIES__ He wasn't really a bad boy. He wasn't the one who got the girl pregnant."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was kind of a good guy. Anyway, how did you like the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't really like the changes they made. Why do people have to do so many remakes and ruin them?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Stop messing with the classics, right?"
