"__DISNEY__ Do you like the new Disney movies better, like Brave, or the older ones, like The Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ I like the older ones--the hand drawn ones. Sleeping Beauty is my favorite, but I really love all the old cartoon styles."
"__DISNEY__ I loved that one! The drawings were so romantic and unique."
"__DISNEY__ Another one like that is Alice in Wonderland. The way it looks is really different from anything else they ever did."
"__DISNEY__ A lot of the older ones are like that. Fantasia has like six different drawing styles in it along, and you can tell the difference between each one."
"__DISNEY__ So do you think the CGI looks more uniform? Like it's all the same from movie to movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, the CGI sure gets better in quality, right? You look at something like Chicken Little, it doesn't compare to how gorgeous Brave is."
"__DISNEY__ Merida's hair looks like you could reach out and touch it. And yet they still make it look like a cartoon, you know--not just like it's trying to mimic live action?"
"__DISNEY__ I hear you. I guess while I like the hand drawn ones best, the CGI is its own art form."
"__DISNEY__ I can't argue with that. Every movie they do expresses something special and takes a ton of time and effort to make it a special thing of its own."
