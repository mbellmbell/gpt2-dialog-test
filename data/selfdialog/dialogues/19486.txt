"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie ever?"
"__MOVIES__ That's such a tough question!"
"__MOVIES__ Just pick one that makes you think a lot!"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say the Truman show"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Jim Carrey?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's the star of a TV show that he doesn't know he is in!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it really makes you think about the show for like a month!"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard people start to wonder if they are in a TV show!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it messes with your mind more than Inception."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like Inception?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty confusion for me"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's how it is for everyone"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but for me I was recovering from getting my wisdom teeth out so I wasn't thinking clearly anyway"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I cant even imagine that"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, watched a lot of confusing movies when I was recovering"
"__MOVIES__ What else did you watch?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched Primer, that was a mistake. Way too confusing."
"__MOVIES__ I dont even understand 1% of that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I also watched the Butterfly Effect"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's a good one, I've heard. I'll watch a trailer now!"
