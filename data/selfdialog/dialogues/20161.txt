"__MOVIES__ Did you see the trailer for 'The Foreigner?'"
"__MOVIES__ What is that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a new movie starring Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan."
"__MOVIES__ That's really cool.  Is it going to be a comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's actually going to be a thriller.  Very serious."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a man who's daughter is killed during an terrorist attack, and he goes on a vengeance mission."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's almost like taken.  I didn't realize Jackie did serious roles."
"__MOVIES__ He actually does many serious roles in Chinese Productions.  Just not here."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that is?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it has to do with a stigma against Asian male leads in more serious roles.  And typecasting."
"__MOVIES__ I could see that."
"__MOVIES__ It's time for a positive change.  Don't worry though, Jackie still does awesome stunts."
"__MOVIES__ His stunts were already impressive on their own.  It's especially impressive at his older age."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously.  He's 63 years old."
"__MOVIES__ I'm also excited to see Pierce Brosnan."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  He seems to be playing the main antagonist in the film."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite Jackie Chan movie of all-time, while we're on the subject?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Police Story' for sure.  How about yours?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Rush Hour!'"
