"__MOVIES__ Seen anything good at the theaters lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I did see The Lovers a few nights ago."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was great! It was about this older married couple who were having troubles."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of troubles?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they were cheating on each other with other people and starting to form attachments with the other people. They were prepared to leave."
"__MOVIES__ Did they?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah sort of."
"__MOVIES__ Sort of. What's that supposed to mean? Did they leave or not?"
"__MOVIES__ Eventually they did. But then they got together on the side and were cheating on their new partners with one another!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's kind of a happy ending?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think they decided that they really liked cheating. So, how about you? See anything good?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't. I'm really waiting for Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ You mean The Last Jedi?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't been following the newer Star Wars movies. What is there to anticipate?"
"__MOVIES__ We could find out what finally happens to Luke Skywalker and the Jedi."
"__MOVIES__ That would be exciting, I guess. Should I see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, definitely."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, maybe I will."
