"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see that Don't Breathe movie?"
"__THRILLER__ I might have.  Wasn't that the one about the teen thieves?"
"__THRILLER__ Kind of.  They broke into this guy's house and the guy is blind."
"__THRILLER__ Right.  But all of his other senses are really heightened."
"__THRILLER__ Yep.  So he ends up hunting them in his house."
"__THRILLER__ Kind of a weird dynamic.  The kids aren't good guys, but neither is he."
"__THRILLER__ In some ways, they got what they deserved."
"__THRILLER__ To a point, but being killed for trespassing is pretty harsh."
"__THRILLER__ On a whole, it's worth watching once, but would never buy it."
"__THRILLER__ Agreed.  I feel that way about most of these run of the mill thriller flicks."
