"__ROCK__ You ever hear about the rock band KISS?"
"__ROCK__ Heard of them? My uncle is a huge fan, he never shuts up about them."
"__ROCK__ That's funny, does he have any cool memorabilia?"
"__ROCK__ Well, he actually owns a life-size cardboard cutout of the band, it's quite a spectacle to see."
"__ROCK__ Hahahaha! Your uncle seems like my type of guy, what do you think about KISS though?"
"__ROCK__ I like them too, but I'm not a die-hard fan like my uncle is. He told our family to bury him in a KISS coffin if he ever passes."
"__ROCK__ Tell your uncle I want to be buried right next to him! KISS army for life man!"
"__ROCK__ He'll definitely find that funny. So, what are you doing later today man?"
"__ROCK__ Nothing today, I'm just going to stay at home and listen to some music, as usual."
"__ROCK__ Alright man, well, if you ever want to meet my uncle, I'll let you know when he comes over."
