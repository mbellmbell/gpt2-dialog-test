"__DISNEY__ The Little Mermaid was not a very good movie."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you say that? I loved that one."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah it was okay I guess, but I just didn't like the villain."
"__DISNEY__ You mean that giant octopus lady? Why didn't you like her?"
"__DISNEY__ She wasn't scary enough to be a villian for me."
"__DISNEY__ Are you kidding? She was horrifying!"
"__DISNEY__ Well I don't think anyone was so terrifying as the villian from The Lion King, Scar."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah you're right. Scar was a really bad dude."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah Scar actually got Simba's dad killed."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe I'm starting to agree with you on this whole octopus lady thing. Haha."
