"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the final destination movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're my guilty pleasure."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite would have to be the first one, it was just something so new."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know what you're talking about."
"__MOVIES__ After the first one, I think all the other's are pretty equal.  Except the 3D one."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like the 3D one?"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, I'm just not a fan of any 3D movies."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, first I have glasses, so it makes it tough to watch them.  Besides that, I just don't think it adds that much to the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I can see why you don't like them.  But there are some really good ones."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Avatar was incredible in 3D, and Tin Tin was pretty good too."
"__MOVIES__ I never watched Avatar, let alone the 3D version."
"__MOVIES__ What?? It's so good."
"__MOVIES__ It just didn't seem worth the hype."
"__MOVIES__ It really is, and if you get a chance to watch it in 3D, it's amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to take your word on the 3D part, I wouldn't know where to watch it in 3D."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I did just buy a new 3D TV. Why don't you come over this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, I'll be there Saturday night."
