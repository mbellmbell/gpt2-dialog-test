"__RAP_HIPHOP__ As hard as I try, I just can't get into rap music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really? There are so many awesome rappers out there like Nas, Andre 30 and Dr. Dre."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ One of the biggest issues for me is that so many raps songs have profanity."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's because the lyrics are telling a story."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I get that, but I don't think they need to swear."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is that the only thing that bothers you about rap music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I also found that the music isn't good  A  lot of the time and they'll take the same few notes and play them over and over again."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Rapping isn't so much about the music, but about the actual rapping."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But without good music, I'm not entertained."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ OK. I understand why you don't like rap now."
