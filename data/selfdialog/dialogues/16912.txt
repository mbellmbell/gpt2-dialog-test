"__MOVIES__ Ok, maybe not better than Pulp Fiction...."
"__MOVIES__ Good.  Because Hateful Eight was good, but not his best ever."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  I forgot about all the other ones he made that are good too."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  Do you remember Reservoir Dogs?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea.  I was just thinking about the one.  Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange.....classic."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember True Romance?  That was a good movie too.  One of his first."
"__MOVIES__ Thats right.  That one still holds up.  I like the Kill Bill Movies too."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like 1 or 2 better?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked 1 better.  Theyre both good, but the first one just felt more like a Tarantino movie."
"__MOVIES__ Django Unchained was good, but not one of his best.  I think it was just to make a movie where he could say 'nigger' over and over."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it.  I liked Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz.  Hes a good actor."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my God, he was so good in Inglorious Basterds!"
"__MOVIES__ That was a great one too!  I like his skewed history takes in these movies."
"__MOVIES__ His style is so unique.  He liked the old 70s and Samurai movies a lot.  You can see it in his camera work."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Jackie Brown and Kill Bill do just that."
"__MOVIES__ I loved From Dusk Till Dawn.  George Clooney is awesome in that"
"__MOVIES__ So is Tarantino! I mean, hes not a great actor, but it was good for him"
"__MOVIES__ Hes supposedly doing a Kill Bill 3..."
"__MOVIES__ Dude, that'd be awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Id definitely go see that!"
