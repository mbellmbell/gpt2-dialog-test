"__MUSIC__ Barry Manilow is on tour again. Have you ever seen him live?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't. He's not really my musical cup of tea."
"__MUSIC__ You don't like any of his songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess 'Mandy' is good."
"__MUSIC__ That's a classic."
"__MUSIC__ And I like 'Weekend in New England'."
"__MUSIC__ All right. So you do like his music?"
"__MUSIC__ A couple of his songs are OK."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe he's still performing live. He's in his 70s."
"__MUSIC__ He's still got to make a living."
"__MUSIC__ I think he just loves performing. He probably has enough money by now."
"__MUSIC__ My mom is a big fan of his."
"__MUSIC__ Mine, too. My whole family. I've seen him in concert a few times."
"__MUSIC__ Where is he on tour?"
"__MUSIC__ He's got a gig coming up in Uniondale, NY."
"__MUSIC__ I see. Well, I don't think I'll be going. You?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was just about to get tickets."
"__MUSIC__ How much are the tickets?"
"__MUSIC__ Why? Do you want to see his show?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, maybe. You might be able to talk me into it."
