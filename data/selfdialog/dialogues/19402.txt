"__MOVIES__ I rented John Wick 2 last night."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that it was really good.  Is that the case?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure is.  Did you ever see the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's on my list of things to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you need to see the first one first before we can chat."
"__MOVIES__ That's not very helpful.  At least give me some details."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, well, he obviously is alive at the end of the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Well, duh."
"__MOVIES__ In this one, he's after a guy who blew up his house."
"__MOVIES__ I would imagine that made him very angry."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed.  This one has an extremely high body count."
"__MOVIES__ I heard he killed like 80 guys in original."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds about right.  He caps probably 130 in this one."
"__MOVIES__ That's insane.  In like an explosion?"
"__MOVIES__ No, with his bare hands, guns, pencils?"
"__MOVIES__ Pencils?  Are you serious?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a running joke in the series, but yes, a pencil."
"__MOVIES__ This guy doesn't sound like one to mess with."
"__MOVIES__ He is indeed not.  I would stay on his good side."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'll keep that in mind."
