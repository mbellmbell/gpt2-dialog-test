"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, who you rooting for this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's see.  The Redskins.  The Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha!  That will do no good to root for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the underdog."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then, you're going for the right teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't stand the Patriots.  Cheaters.  I'm not rooting for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though you'll end up with a Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.  I'm not a fair weathered fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, keep on rooting for the Jets.  You'll be a fan allright, just no wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  Maybe I'll start following Pittsburgh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Roethlisberger?  No way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but they've created a dynasty and I think he's matured a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe.  They're a better choice than your others."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping they'll actually utilize their draft picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe.  What about Cleveland?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way.  They can't pick a good player at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha!  You're right.  Better stick with Pittsburgh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  I do like Bell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's paid way too much.  Choose someone else!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll have to think about that.  Everyone's paid too much."
