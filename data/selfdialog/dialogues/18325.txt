"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Wonder Woman yet."
"__MOVIES__ I have!"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was one of the best super hero movies I have ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ I think Gal Gadot really embodies the essence of Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ The part near the end when they go to the ball, she felt like a superhero."
"__MOVIES__ When she pulls the huge sword from the back of her dress?"
"__MOVIES__ The 'god killer', yes."
"__MOVIES__ It felt like that was her turn, in the film from sheltered Amazonian to strong super woman type."
"__MOVIES__ I think they will keep on going with her in more Wonder Woman films."
"__MOVIES__ I imagine so, it did so well."
"__MOVIES__ It out sold The Mummy, with a better known star, at least in the USA."
"__MOVIES__ I hope Wonder Woman shows up in more DC movies."
"__MOVIES__ I am sure she will. She was the best part of Batman Vs. Superman."
"__MOVIES__ To be fair, she was the only good part."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the ending of Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ I cried when he shot the plane down, with him still in it."
"__MOVIES__ But, I think somehow they may bring him back."
"__MOVIES__ How would they manage that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, that bad German scientist was still alive, maybe she saved him, like they did Captain America."
