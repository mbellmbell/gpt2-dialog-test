"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think the coolest character in Star Wars is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that would be Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. He has so much depth."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like him in the first movie the most."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point. He is not accompanied by that overused theme."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder how the idea of Vader was thought of."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am not sure. I wonder who came up with the idea."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it was probably George Lucas."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they should have made Vader turn back to the light side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, he should have remained evil the whole time."
