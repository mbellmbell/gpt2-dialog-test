"__HORROR__ What's the wirst horror film you've ever seen?"
"__HORROR__ Worst would have to be Uncle Sam. It was about a veteran that came back from the dead and wrecked havoc, just awful."
"__HORROR__ Ha I've seen that one, my pick would have to be Troll 2."
"__HORROR__ No way Troll 2 is amazing in a so bad it's good sort of way."
"__HORROR__ I saw nothing redeeming in it and the acting, my God!"
"__HORROR__ Well when one of the main characters is a real life dentist with zero acting credits, what were you expecting, Al Pacino?"
"__HORROR__ Well no of course not, but I wasn't expecting George Hardy either."
"__HORROR__ Don't be so hard on poor George the dentist."
"__HORROR__ Maybe I should give it another watch, it has to be fair been years."
"__HORROR__ Absolutely you should, just remember that Nilbog is Goblin spelled backwards, you will understand if you don't remember that line."
