"__MOVIES__ Do you get out to the movies much anymore?"
"__MOVIES__ Not like we used to.  Kinda just stay at home and look for stuff on Netflicks."
"__MOVIES__ What about rentals?"
"__MOVIES__ Not so much, although we will rent one off of Dish once in awhile."
"__MOVIES__ O.k. here's a question for you--what is your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's not going to be something profound like Citizen Kane or Network."
"__MOVIES__ That's o.k., go ahead."
"__MOVIES__ Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, Paul Newman and Robert Redford--pretty hard to go wrong with that."
"__MOVIES__ It was so funny--the dialogue between them.  And there was suspense and action and symbolism."
"__MOVIES__ I've kind of forgotten about it.  Symbolism?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know the passing of the Old West from wild to civilization--the bicycle scene was part of showing that."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you obviously know the movie better than I, but I do remember a beautiful woman in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes, Katherine Ross.  I was in love with her."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't she in some other iconic film."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, The Graduate--I was even more in love with her in that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Elaine--Dustin Hoffman yelling her name at the church."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you do remember."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes, that was quite a scene."
"__MOVIES__ And then they ride off in the bus together wondering what have we done."
