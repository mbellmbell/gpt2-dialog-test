"__MOVIES__ The sad Keanu memes? Yes"
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if any of that stuff is true..."
"__MOVIES__ Some of it is. He does have a small flat. He did give 80 ill fro his 114 mil earning from Matrix series to the staff."
"__MOVIES__ That's still 34 mill from just 3 movies."
"__MOVIES__ More money thn I can spend in my life time."
"__MOVIES__ i don't know about you, but I can spend 34 mil."
"__MOVIES__ Buying things you need not just to buy stuff. You need a house not a mansion, you need a vehicle, not some rocket, and you need food, and company"
"__MOVIES__ And buying all that will go over 34 mil easily."
"__MOVIES__ i don't even..."
"__MOVIES__ What? House will cost what 10 million?"
"__MOVIES__ There is NO human being alive that 'needs' a 10 million dollar home. They don't exist."
"__MOVIES__ Depends on the location. 10 mil in upper east side is not that much,."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway. Remember that slide phone on the first Matrix movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, yeah. That was good looking phone."
"__MOVIES__ That was a Nokia phone. Nokia 8110"
"__MOVIES__ People actually used that phone in real life?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh Yes. it wqas already an existing phone when Matrix was released."
"__MOVIES__ That's why Samsung copied the idea with their own phone"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, with SPH N270. it was made to look like Matrix phone. Now it'ssold for 100 bucks on ebay. Collector's item you know."
