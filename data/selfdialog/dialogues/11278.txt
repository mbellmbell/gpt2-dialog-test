"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's getting close to pro football season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's almost time for training camps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do your 49ers still have theirs at Sierra College?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they have it in Santa Clara."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must be better for the players--Sacramento area is so hot this time of year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I imagine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It used to be thought that hot weather was good for you to get in shape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think they've gotten over that theory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The players are more valued than they used to be in the good old days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a good idea to dehydrate your multi-millionaires ha, ha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been to the new 49er stadium?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Levi's Stadium, no they made it too expensive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could go to an exhibition game--a lot of season ticketholders will give those games away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but those games aren't much fun, and the crowd is unruly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, a stadium full of people who don't usually go to the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a burn that season ticketholders have to pay full price for those games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure; oh I must correct myself--ownership calls those games preseason games, not exhibitions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, pretty boring whatever you call them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been a season ticketholder?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Shared tickets with a group back in the glory days.  As I remember, we'd each get two tickets to two games."
