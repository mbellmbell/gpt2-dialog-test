"__MUSIC__ Me and a friend of mine was having a music debate the other day."
"__MUSIC__ Really? What was the debate about exactly?"
"__MUSIC__ We were going back and forth about who the best female group of all time was."
"__MUSIC__ That is a tough one, there have been so many great ones over the years."
"__MUSIC__ I know! Sometimes these discussions just need to happen though!"
"__MUSIC__ That is true, so who were your guys' picks for the best?"
"__MUSIC__ He was adamant that it is Destiny's Child. While I think it is TLC without question."
"__MUSIC__ Those are both really great groups.. I would have a hard time picking between the two."
"__MUSIC__ They are both great, but TLC has so many hits. Look at songs like No Scrubs, Waterfalls, and Unpretty. Those are classics!"
"__MUSIC__ They do have some songs that people are still singing to this day."
"__MUSIC__ So, you agree with me about this whole thing?"
"__MUSIC__ I did not say that! Destiny's Child has some classics of their own."
"__MUSIC__ I know they do, I enjoy a lot of their songs myself."
"__MUSIC__ Survivor, Say My Name, and Soldier are fantastic songs as well."
"__MUSIC__ I just do not think their overall material is quite as good as what TLC delivered."
"__MUSIC__ I will throw another group into this conversation actually."
"__MUSIC__ Who? Now things could get real complicated!"
"__MUSIC__ What about considering the Spice Girls as the best female group ever?"
"__MUSIC__ They did have some good songs like Wannabe, and Spice Up Your Life. Not better than TLC though!"
"__MUSIC__ To each their own I guess! Either way, it is a pretty interesting debate!"
