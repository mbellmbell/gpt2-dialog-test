"__DISNEY__ I'm trying to decide if I should see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Do you know much about it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, not really. I haven't seen it yet, either, but I have heard it's good."
"__DISNEY__ Hey, if it has Johnny Depp in it, that's all I really need!"
"__DISNEY__ But is Orlando Bloom in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, he is, but I'm not sure how big his role in it is."
"__DISNEY__ I think Keira Knightley has a small role in it as well."
"__DISNEY__ Any idea what the plot is about?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's related to Will Turner's son somehow. Not quite sure how."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. I might have to go see it then."
"__DISNEY__ Hey, mind if I go with you to see it?"
