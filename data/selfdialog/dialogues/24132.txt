"__SUPERHERO__ I think it made just enough fun of people like Batman, that it made the characters seem real."
"__SUPERHERO__ It really opened a lot up. A very gritty and almost fourth wall breaking film."
"__SUPERHERO__ Sort of like how Deadpool breaks the fourthwall."
"__SUPERHERO__ Not so much, but yes. Something that left me thinking."
"__SUPERHERO__ I liked how the ending was left open, there was no real closure to see what happen to bird man."
