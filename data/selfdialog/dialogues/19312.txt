"__MOVIES__ What's the next movie you're going to see?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that we will go to the latest 'Pirates of the Caribbean'"
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the last one?"
"__MOVIES__ It was ok, although I thought it was very dark."
"__MOVIES__ Not a kid's movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not a kids movie?  More like a 'tween movie."
"__MOVIES__ So why are you going to this one?"
"__MOVIES__ I have heard good things about it...and well, Johnny Depp."
"__MOVIES__ Why Johnny Depp, is he your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he is a good actor, but it is his Keith Richard's imitation that I really enjoy."
"__MOVIES__ Anything else about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I've been reading online reviews, they said it was on par with the first of the series"
"__MOVIES__ Didn't you like the other ones?"
"__MOVIES__ There were moments in the the other ones that I found interesting, but there were a lot of dull spots."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ In the movies following the first ones that had a lot of fight scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is a pirate movie, swashbuckling and all that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but the fight scenes went on way too long. Unless you are heavily into fight choreography, you start zoning out."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that happens to me too."
"__MOVIES__ Plot is so important, directors forget that sometimes when they have lots of money, they like to add bells and whistles."
