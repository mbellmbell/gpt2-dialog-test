"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Rogue One was as good as the other Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but it was very different from them."
"__STAR_WARS__ How was it different?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The other movies focus on a specific group of heroes - like Han, Luke, and Leia. But Rogue One focused on ordinary people."
"__STAR_WARS__ The cast of Rogue One was just as heroic."
"__STAR_WARS__ But they were normal. They were pilots and soldiers, not Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han Solo was just a pilot, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was a super pilot - he was the best pilot, not 'just a pilot.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that's true. He made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, after all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whereas in Rogue One, all the characters were just ordinary. That gave it a lot different of a tone."
