"__MOVIES__ Ever see 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. And when I walked out, I felt like Rock Hudson, who famously said, 'Will someone tell me what the hell this is about?'"
"__MOVIES__ How long ago did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ A few years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Any thoughts about the movie since then?"
"__MOVIES__ I hadn't thought about it, but I'd like to see it again."
"__MOVIES__ I don't usually see a movie a bunch of times, but this one I watch every 10 years or so. Always get something new out of it."
"__MOVIES__ Besides the obvious plot lines, what else do you take away from it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well first off, the movie ends slightly differently than the book."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Kubrick stops with the embryo in space. We don't know if it's going to Earth or what."
"__MOVIES__ Right."
"__MOVIES__ But Clark goes on another page or two and has the baby destroying Earth."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, big difference."
"__MOVIES__ In tone, definitely. I like the open-ended version better."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. What else?"
"__MOVIES__ I see the whole film, the three parts, reflects the evolution of human intelligence."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that."
"__MOVIES__ Before Homo Sapiens, what we are today, and where we will be in the future."
"__MOVIES__ Thus, the enigmatic ending."
