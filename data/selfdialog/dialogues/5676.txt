"__STAR_WARS__ I know you love the original Star Wars trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I am a fan of those 3 films, definitely."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lucas 'enhanced' Star Wars when he got the chance. Is there anything you would change about them, if you had a chance?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not like Lucas did - that's taking perfectionism a little too far, if you ask me."
"__STAR_WARS__ But you would change something?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, everyone would change that scene with Han in Star Wars where he uses 'parsecs' as a unit of time instead of distance. That was embarrassing - for Lucas, who wrote that line."
"__STAR_WARS__ Would you have Greedo shoot first?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hell no, it was fine the way it was. Greedo was a bad dude and threatening to boot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Anything else?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In Return of the Jedi, when Luke tells Leia they're siblings, her reaction is so understated, it almost doesn't register. I would have 'made the moment' a little more strongly, given it the importance it deserved."
