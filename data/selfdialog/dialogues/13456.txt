"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL is about to start.  Are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, pre-season starts in about a month."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pre-season? Nah I don't watch those games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?  You usually get to see the newly drafted rookies play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it's just not very exciting with nothing at stake."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True.  I agree pre-season is a bit too long too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe 2 games per team max.  They are just trying to milk airtime for advertising money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What you can do.  it's big business.  I can't wait to see Brees back in action though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They drafted some defense to help protect Brees"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so.  They can't keep trying to outscore opponents."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah remember that game between the Saints and the Giants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was nuts.  Scored like 50+ points each."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How ironic the game ends on a field goal though haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah very funny.  Defense hasn't improved much since that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still giving up way too many points and Brees probably only have 1 or 2 good years left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is his last stand.  They are not like the Patriots who are stacked on D."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that gives Brady a few extra years before he retires."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, just comes out throws accurately and scores fast so he can rest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady gets sacked way less than Brees cause of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, should be a good year for the Saints.  Hope that D fulfills their promise."
