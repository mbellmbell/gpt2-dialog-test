"__LADY_GAGA__ What did you think about Lady Gaga's album Artpop?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I thought it was great, but it didn't seem to be as popular as her other albums."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree, but it did have some hit singles."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Definitely. I loved Applause when I first heard it on the radio, and I still love it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That is a great song, but I liked Do What U Want more than Applause."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I never expected her to collaborate with R. Kelly."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I didn't expect it either, but they really complimented each other on that song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ My favorite Lady Gaga collaboration was when she starred on Beyonce's song Video Phone."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I would love to see them collaborate again sometime in the future."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me too. They are both great singers."
