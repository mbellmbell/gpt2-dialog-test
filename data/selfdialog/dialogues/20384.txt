"__MOVIES__ Let's talk romantic comedy movies!"
"__MOVIES__ For a chick flick movie night?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, like 'When Harry Met Sally' chick flick."
"__MOVIES__ Haha you're so funny. I liked that movie and Meg Ryan."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing can go wrong with Meg Ryan! Even in 'Kate & Leopold.'"
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, that movie was so good! I want to watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ What about '10 Things I Hate About You?'"
"__MOVIES__ That movie was such a great romantic comedy.  Probably on my top 10 list."
"__MOVIES__ I agree! Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did fantastic in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ So did Julia Styles! She nailed that part for sure."
"__MOVIES__ I cried at the end!"
"__MOVIES__ I can still recite that poem, to this day."
