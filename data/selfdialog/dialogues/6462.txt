"__STAR_WARS__ Which Star Wars alien do you like best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, I've always liked Chewbacca."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do too. What is he again?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's a Wookie. At least I think that's what they're called."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, Wookies! I think I like Yoda better though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda was really cool in Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ I always thought he might have been made a little too cuddly though."
"__STAR_WARS__ His scenes in the prequels make up for that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he really comes into his own there."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's great to watch."
