"__MOVIES__ Do you like Francis Ford Coppola movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I've seen a few - I didn't watch them intentionally because of him, though. What has he done?"
"__MOVIES__ 'The Godfather' and 'Apocalypse Now' are probably is most famous."
"__MOVIES__ 'Apocalypse Now' is the Vietnam war movie, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, based on the book 'Hearts of Darkness'."
"__MOVIES__ That is an amazing movie. I've never seen the director's cut, though."
"__MOVIES__ If you've seen the film anyway, I wouldn't bother. There's just an extra 20 minutes."
"__MOVIES__ And that movie is already so long! 'The Godfather' is long, too."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't feel it at all. Everyone puts on incredible performances."
"__MOVIES__ And the cast... Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton... unbelievable cast."
"__MOVIES__ It would be difficult to make a bad movie with actors like that."
"__MOVIES__ And Robert DeNiro is in 'The Godfather 2', but I haven't seen it."
"__MOVIES__ You haven't? It's most people's favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Is it your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the first 'Godfather' is my favorite, of the three."
"__MOVIES__ That's usually the way, where the first movie is the best."
"__MOVIES__ It was so faithfully adapted from the Mario Puzo novel, and I loved the book."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't read it - the script is just incredible though."
"__MOVIES__ Think of how many iconic lines are still around, and the movie is half a century old!"
"__MOVIES__ And yet it's still better than most movies they come out with today."
