"__STAR_WARS__ Favorite Villian in Star Wars who is it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The obvious would be Darth Vadar but I don't think that would be my favorite"
"__STAR_WARS__ So who is it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Give me a minute this requires some deep thought"
"__STAR_WARS__ give me a break, its easily Boba Fett, he pretty much is the entire Clone army and he tries to kill Han and Obi Wan"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right but he's only in a few movies, I think that Emporer Palpatine might be the biggest Villian that I like"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?  Yoda almost kicked his butt"
"__STAR_WARS__ No he didn't he was so good he forced Yoda into hiding"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right, I guess he is a pretty good villian"
"__STAR_WARS__ See I told you!"
