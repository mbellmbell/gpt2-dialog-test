"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the greatest defensive player in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that JJ Watt definitely has a claim to that spot."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, hopefully the Texans will be solid this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like they are bad every year."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am sad that Foster has since retired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, he used to be so great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The problem is that running backs have short lifespans."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really miss Calvin Johnson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, he was the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Megatron - as they say - was probably my favorite receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine too, he had such grace on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Andre Johnson?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The man is great, but unfortunately just retired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, him and Fitzgerald were great for so long."
