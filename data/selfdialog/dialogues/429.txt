"__MUSIC__ Hey, were you ever a New Kids on the Block fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, yes!  I loved them back when I was a kid."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  They had incredible music for that era."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they really did.  Did you know they reunited in 2007?"
"__MUSIC__ I hadn't heard that!  Which of their songs did you like best?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Hangin' Tough was my favorite.  I remember listening to it at the roller skating rink."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I liked that one, too.  I also liked Be My Girl, their first single."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that one was great.  So do they have a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they had one called The Block that came out in 2008."
"__MUSIC__ So how was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was okay.  It had two singles called Summertime and Single that were both allright."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I didn't like it as much as their old stuff but it was still okay."
"__MUSIC__ Was it still all the same members?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep!  Every one of them is still in the band."
"__MUSIC__ That's crazy.  Usually some of the members kinda disappear after awhile."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it sure has been awhile.  They had Lady Gaga opening for them in concert."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, I guess I could see that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  They're definitely much older than today's boy bands."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they could be their dads practically."
