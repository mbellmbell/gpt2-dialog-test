"__ACTION__ The ones from decades ago, or the ones with Brendan Frasier?"
"__ACTION__ Those, but keep in mind they WERE decades ago."
"__ACTION__ Woah..."
"__ACTION__ Yup. So, opinions?"
"__ACTION__ They were a lot of fun and not overly serious."
"__ACTION__ My favorite part was in the second movie where he runs in late and yells 'Nie!!!!'"
"__ACTION__ 'Noooooooooo!!!'"
