"__MOVIES__ I just watched a movie that took me way back to my childhood."
"__MOVIES__ What movie is that?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the 2017 'Power Rangers' movie."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that too."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I didn't think it was too special, but I was always a fan of 'Power Rangers' as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ What didn't you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought that the pacing was a little off."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ The build-up to the discovery only introduced half the main cast.  Then the final act was too short."
"__MOVIES__ What about the middle?"
"__MOVIES__ Well that's the thing; I barely remember that part.  Wish more happened."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the action sequences?"
"__MOVIES__ That, I did enjoy.  Though I wish there were more of it."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, for a 'Power Rangers' movie, they did lack that.  Though I did like the fact that they focused more on the characters' issues."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed that aspect too.  In the original show, they were called 'Teenagers with Attitude,' but none of them actually had attitude."
"__MOVIES__ That is very true."
"__MOVIES__ The effects were cool though.  I'd probably still watch a sequel if it came out."
"__MOVIES__ You think they're going to make a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah.  Most franchise movies have sequels these days, so expect it!"
