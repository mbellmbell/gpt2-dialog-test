"__MOVIES__ Did you like the Alien series?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, and I'm excited to see the remake."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the Prometheus?  It's got tie ins to Alien"
"__MOVIES__ I did not know it was related to Aliens."
"__MOVIES__ It's in the same 'world' but at a much earlier time.  If you're an Aliens fan I definitely recommend it."
"__MOVIES__ Ridley Scott has made some really good movies, that's for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  Which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ That's hard to say, I've liked so many of them.  But if I had to pick I'd say Blade Runner."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely an amazing film and a classic for sure.  I thought Harrison Ford was amazing in it."
"__MOVIES__ A newer movie of his that I really liked was the Martian."
"__MOVIES__ Matt Damon really brought that movie to life.  I cried when the captain finally grabbed him."
"__MOVIES__ I was hoping for a happy ending but I wasn't sure.  It seemed hopeless!"
"__MOVIES__ Matt Damon has had a pretty good career.  I was glad his buddy Ben Affleck was able to make a comeback."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he made some really bad movies.  I was shocked that his quality improved so much."
"__MOVIES__ He started strong then I agree he had a major slump.  Argo put him back on the map."
"__MOVIES__ That was a quality film, I agree."
"__MOVIES__ I liked him in Gone Girl, too.  I'm not sure if that did as well in the theaters as expected."
"__MOVIES__ It was such a blockbuster book, I'm not sure.  Neil Patrick Harris was an interesting character in that film."
"__MOVIES__ That was quite a gory death scene."
"__MOVIES__ Agree.  Rosamud Pike was terrifying!"
