"__MUSIC__ Hey, who in your opinion is the most under rated artist in music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say Maria Brink is a under rated artist."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that I've never heard of her."
"__MUSIC__ Shes the lead singer of In This Moment."
"__MUSIC__ Oh she's part of a band."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah and a real good on in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ What genre of music are they a part of?"
"__MUSIC__ They do metal core."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't that have a ton of screaming in it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes actually, and she does do a fair amount of it but her voice is amazing when she isn't screaming."
"__MUSIC__ Can you recommend a song by her band that doesn't have too much screaming and really highlights her voice?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. I'd listen to 'Her Kiss'. It starts off great but I do warn you at the end she is screaming a little."
"__MUSIC__ Thats fine as long as it's not a mix of it throughout the entire song."
"__MUSIC__ Not at all, I think that song really shows her strengths as a vocalist."
"__MUSIC__ Almost sounds like you have a crush on her."
"__MUSIC__ Well If I could date her I would, but I really do like her voice."
"__MUSIC__ Who would you compare her voice to?"
"__MUSIC__ Man thats hard. If anything I'd say maybe Amy Lee from Evanescence but better."
"__MUSIC__ Better than Amy Lee?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, absolutely."
