"__MOVIES__ What's your all-time favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That is so hard. It's much easier to give a list."
"__MOVIES__ But if you had to only name one?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I would go with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen that."
"__MOVIES__ What? Are you crazy?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I heard something about it, but never got around to it."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Being John Malkovich?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's a great one."
"__MOVIES__ It's weird just like that one! They're both written by Charlie Kaufman."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in it again?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Kate Winslet and Jim Carey."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a big fan of Jim Carey."
"__MOVIES__ You have to try it though. Jim Carey's character is the quiet, introverted one."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's weird."
"__MOVIES__ He does an amazing job with that. You have to see it."
"__MOVIES__ What is it about anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about what would happen if there was a way to erase all your memories of a relationship."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Just give it a try. You won't regret it."
