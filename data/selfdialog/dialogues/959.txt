"__MUSIC__ Were you more of a Backstreet Boys or NSYNC fan?"
"__MUSIC__ It's embarrassing, but reflecting back I think liked both Boy Bands equally."
"__MUSIC__ They had just about the same number of hits. I think Bye Bye Bye is my favorite NSYNC track."
"__MUSIC__ It's so nostalgic to think about those songs. I still pull up the music videos from time to time and they just bring a smile to my face."
"__MUSIC__ I know that era was something else. It was poppy and fun. Bubblegum pop with the singers too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's right, Britney, Christina Aguilera, who else was there?"
"__MUSIC__ There as Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore too. I guess if you want to count Willa Ford. She had one track that was a hit."
"__MUSIC__ Was Willa Ford really a hit or considered in that category?"
"__MUSIC__ She can be mentioned no doubt, but she was a tier lower than all those mentioned singers."
"__MUSIC__ I'm a little iffy on Mandy Moore too. I know she released a lot of album and she probably is the most successful one career wise and still going today."
"__MUSIC__ Mandy Moore played it safe by the books. I think she has a very devoted group of fans. She never really played up some kind of image like the other singers and her music was very mellow in comparison."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that wholesome image, I think it worked out well for her."
"__MUSIC__ Christina Aguilera had the best music from the batch though, although some would argue Britney's songs were more catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Britney's song are iconic today."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but they're not exactly memorable for genre defining music, more for it's nostalgia to those days."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with that, I can't argue about the nostalgic factor, but they were really catchy, Hit Me One More Time, Oops I Did It Again, there were so many."
"__MUSIC__ Just hearing those titles makes me feel a little uncomfortable, those are such bad title names."
"__MUSIC__ That may be true, but nobody can forget those titles and the chorus lines from the songs."
"__MUSIC__ It's amazing we've moved from that pop area to the Rihanna, Katy Perry, Adele, Taylor Swift, and Beyonce today."
"__MUSIC__ Things happen in cycles, so I'm expecting a boy band resurgence soon!"
