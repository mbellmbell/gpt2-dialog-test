"__MUSIC__ Hey what is that song you are listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, it is Beat It by Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ You like Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, he is like the greatest pop singer of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh goodness no! That has got to go to Justin Timberlake."
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding me? Michael Jackson has had way more hits than him."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of his biggest hits?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a tough question because all of his songs have become number one hits."
"__MUSIC__ What are his most popular songs that you think everyone has probably heard of?"
"__MUSIC__ There is Billie Jean, Man in the Mirror, Black or White, Bad, You Are Not Alone, and of course Thriller."
"__MUSIC__ I will give it to you that Thriller is a good song and an even better video but I still would pick Timberlake over Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of Justin Timberlake's biggest hits?"
"__MUSIC__ Are you talking about his hits alone or are you including when he was with N'Sync?"
"__MUSIC__ No, just his own hits without the group."
"__MUSIC__ Well there is Can't Stop the Feeling, Cry Me A River, True Colors, Hair Up, and Sexy Back."
"__MUSIC__ Those songs do not come close to comparing to any of Michael Jackson's songs!"
"__MUSIC__ I admit that Michael Jackson had many classic hits but overall I would have to say Timberlake is better."
"__MUSIC__ If Michael Jackson was still around would be able to take on Timberlake any day of the week."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think this is something that we will ever agree on."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess we will just have to agree to disagree."
