"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, football is almost back!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know man!  Are you playing fantasy this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course.  No way I'm drafting Russell Wilson, ever again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he was horrible last season.  My Seahawks were so injury prone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they need Beast Mode back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't he sign with the Raiders this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, dude.  I'm not sure how that's going to go to be honest, but I hope they beat the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously, somebody needs to.  Tom Terrific can't last much longer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man.  He says he's playing until age 45."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be insane!  I wouldn't mind having him in fantasy next season, to be honest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I want my boy Aaron Rodgers again.  Dude is insanely talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he plays in the cold like six times a year.  That can hurt fantasy stats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true, and it's toward the end of the season too, when you need the most out of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, your Browns had a pretty solid off-season!  Do you think they will win more than one this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't want to get too hopeful, but yeah I think that's a safe bet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's going to be their quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Kizer will win it.  He's the most physically gifted.  Hopefully Hue can get his head on right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he had a pretty horrible last season in college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, we have Myles Garrett now, so hopefully the defense improves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see why it can't."
