"__STAR_WARS__ Hey you haven't seen the new Star Wars movie have you."
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope. That last trilogy killed all the Star Wars love in me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Come on, really? You didnt like the action in them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea Darth Maul was pretty much the best thing about them and he got cut in two in the first movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed, but still they look amazing and there's alot of awesome characters. Like General uh what's his name? half robot half..."
"__STAR_WARS__ ..Grevious."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha. You knew his name! You do love everything Star Wars! Even the sequels!"
"__STAR_WARS__ OK. Ok. But they really pissed me off with all the plot junk. Where's the emotion? Not in the horrible romance between Anakin and Natalie Portman..."
"__STAR_WARS__ ..Princess Amidala"
"__STAR_WARS__ ..whatever..But yea you're right- they can be enjoyed for just the shear action. Dump the rest."
