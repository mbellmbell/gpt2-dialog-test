"__ICEHOCKEY__ You been watching the Stanley Cup?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, it's been pretty good.  A lot of overtime games, so it's been fun to watch."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I think Pittsburgh and Nashville are going to play for the championship, but I'm rooting for Ottawa so Canadians can have team win the first cup for them in a while."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I don't really care one way or another."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't that much either.  Ottawa is a small market team with a smaller than average payroll and I like underdogs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They are underdogs, but they do have a good team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that Karlsson guy is great!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He is absolutely one of the best."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see that hit on Crosby the other night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes.  He really hit boards awkwardly."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I was surprised he continued.  The way he went into the boards it looked like it would rearrange his spine."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's amazing what these guys do to themselves sometimes and just go back into the game as if nothing happened."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Having played and knowing what it feels like, I especially find it amazing that they do it a such great speed and they're so big.  It's sometimes hard to comprehend how they come back from some of those hits."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, crazy game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who do think is going to win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't know.  I kind of like Nashville because of their defenseman.  They have a half dozen of 'em that get into the offensive play, and Rinne is a good goalie."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think you might be right.  Those defensemen could easily be the difference against any team they play."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think Pittsburgh will win the East, and wouldn't be surprised if they win the cup again."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right.  They have a strong and very experienced team.  I hope someone else wins, but I think Pittsburgh has as good a chance as anybody."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree.  We'll see.  Later."
