"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you think was the best set-piece of the whole Fast & Furious franchise?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They keep ramping up the action and topping themselves each movie.  I need a moment to think about this."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think mine was the scene in Fast 7 when the crew drives their cars out of the plane and parachute down."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was a pretty epic scene.  I read that a lot of the car sequences once they hit ground were practical effects, and not CGI."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They actually threw a car out of a real plane too!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No way.  Really?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes.  There is a behind the scenes video where it is explained and shown."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That gives me new appreciation for the series."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There were camera men jumping with the cars and everything.  I hope they continue to do this."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't think there is any slowing down of this franchise in the near future."
