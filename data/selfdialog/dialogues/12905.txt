"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How well do you think the Carolina Panthers are going to do this 2017 season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. They didn't do so well this past season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah ever since that fatal championship loss against the Denver Broncos in 2015 they just gave up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you. But I heard that they got a new running back named Christian McCaffrey."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that too! He's supposed to be a top notch running back. He was drafted in the first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There may be hope after all for the panthers! Isn't there another new player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah his name is Curtis Samuel his a second round wide receiver pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard of him before, he's supposed to be really explosive when it comes to working with running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only downside is that my favorite player is no longer with the Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mike Tolbert. He was the Fullback for the Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team is he playing for now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard he is playing with the Buffalo Bills now, in the same fullback position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know when their first game is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it is in California. They are playing the 49ers on September 10th."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey thats pretty close to us! We should make a road trip to go see them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good! They play around 4:25pm so we can take off after work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah we will make it on time. What is the stadium called?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dully noted! Thanks."
