"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did do you think the San Francisco 49ers made good decisions this off season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I liked their draft picks a lot. I'm really excited about Solomon Thomas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am too! Don't forget they basically got Reuben Foster as a steal late in the 1st round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't forgotten. I'm really excited about Reuben Foster too. I think they're really going to solidify the 49ers defense this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've struggled so much last season but I like the new editions to the team. I think General Manager Lynch has done a terrific job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe how many good moves Lynch has made already. I didn't expect to be this excited after coming off such disappointing past seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know the last time they made the Superbowl with Jim Harbaugh coaching seems a distant memory away now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't remind me. I still love Harbaugh and will always support him over Jed York."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Worse owner in the league! Hopefully he's stepping back this year and letting Lynch run the show and decision making."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think coach Kyle Shanahan can bring the exciting offense that he orchestrated with the Atlanta Falcons here?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. I mean he doesn't have quite the offensive power and talent here that he has in Atlanta but I'm hoping he has a good eye to scout and bring in the talent necessary to run his offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no doubt, imagine if we had Julio Jones and Matt Ryan passing to him, I'm sure we'd be right back in the talks about championship contention."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be a dream but we have to hope the offense shows some signs this year. It's been an offensively struggle the past few seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know former coach Chip Kelly was suppose to juice our offense up but we just never saw it. It's a shame because Chip is a really good offensive master mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think with the distractions gone like Colin Kaepernick, we'll be able to have a well unified team. Hopefully team chemistry builds early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The division is going to be tough with the Arizona Cardinals reloading and the Seattle Seahawks will never go away. I think the only team that hasn't really improved is the Los Angeles Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Rams are in a similar situation as we are. They don't really have a star player and their defense is strong but their offense out side of Todd Gurley is very suspect."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have Jared Goff with all that potential but he'll need more years and experience to possibly show that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it'll be a fun year for our team as well as the season overall. Who do you think takes it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to bet money, I'd always bet on the New England Patriots."
