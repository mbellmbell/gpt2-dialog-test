"__MOVIES__ I just saw John Wick Chapter 2"
"__MOVIES__ Nice.  How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was awesome.  Its just a shoot-em-up movie, but its badass."
"__MOVIES__ Cool.  Lots of action then?"
"__MOVIES__ Tons.  You've seen the first one, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea.  That was awesome too.  Keeanu was great."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, its pretty much the same formula, but its works so well."
"__MOVIES__ So lots of guns, shooting, action and fights."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  And theres another dog!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool.  I like that part of the first movie.  It added a little bit of reason behind the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  Part 2 continues the story.  Its literally right after the ending of the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Sweet.  So its a continuation.  And I saw Laurence Fishburn in the trailer.  Was that a cool on screen moment?"
"__MOVIES__ I dont want to ruin it for you, but it was.  A lot of the people in the audience cheered out."
"__MOVIES__ Keanu looks badass in it.  He does these roles so well."
"__MOVIES__ Yea.  He literally does like 99% of all the stunts."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I saw the YouTube clips of him in the shooting range training and all the other stuff."
"__MOVIES__ He's really an under rated actor.  More so because of the roles that he is sort of limited to, he does it great."
"__MOVIES__ Yea.  I love him in the Matrix and the first John Wick.  His like an undercover action star"
"__MOVIES__ And to think, it all started with Bill and Ted."
"__MOVIES__ I LOVE BILL AND TED!"
