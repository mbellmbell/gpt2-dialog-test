"__DISNEY__ Who's your favorite Disney prince?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not even sure I can think of any of the princes' names."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, they don't get as popular as the princesses do."
"__DISNEY__ That's true.  I did like Prince Charming."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, always a classic to go with the guy from Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ He always wore such formal clothes."
"__DISNEY__ Any other princes that you liked?"
"__DISNEY__ What about the one from Princess and the Frog?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I can't even think of his name."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't he spend half the movie as a frog?  That's probably why we can't remember him."
