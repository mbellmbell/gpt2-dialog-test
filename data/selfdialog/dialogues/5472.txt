"__STAR_WARS__ So which one do you think is the worst?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's gotta be Phantom Menace.  Everyone agrees on that!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know - isn't Attack of the Clones worse?"
"__STAR_WARS__ But The Phantom Menace has Anakin as a kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, he wasn't very good..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Remember all the times he said 'Yippee!'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I paid more attention to that annoying Jar Jar."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think the kid could act at all.  And Jar Jar?  The worst."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, yeah, and he was in all three of the prequels, so they all kind of stink."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Phantom Menace has the most Jar Jar."
