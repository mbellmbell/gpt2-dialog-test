"__ACTION__ I just watched the movie Collide the other night."
"__ACTION__ That's the one with Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones right?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah I've become a huge fan of Nicholas since his role as the War Boy in Mad Max Fury Road. I'm also a huge fan of Felicity Jones since Like Crazy and recently Rogue One."
"__ACTION__ Is this an action movie or a romance?"
"__ACTION__ It's starts as a romance but it's a pure action movie. I was surprised when I found out Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins were also in this!"
"__ACTION__ Wait, I didn't know Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins were in this!"
"__ACTION__ Ben Kingsley is hilarious in his role. He plays a slimy criminal that makes Nicholas run errands for him. He's basically playing a character very similar to his role in Iron Man 3 as the Mandarin."
"__ACTION__ I've always seen Ben Kingsley as a serious actor but when I watched Ironman 3 that was so surprising in a good way to see that he could really ham it up."
"__ACTION__ He really hams it up in Collide. The movie overall was very average, the action was good, the romance bare, and the story plot pretty basic. I would consider this movie a pretty generic action flick."
"__ACTION__ This sounds like one of those rainy Sunday afternoon movies to throw on. I think I'll save it for that occasion."
