"__MUSIC__ What type of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I listen to a lot of stuff. Anywhere from dance music to death metal."
"__MUSIC__ That's great. I love all styles too."
"__MUSIC__ The only thing I really can't get into is country music."
"__MUSIC__ I'm right there with you. I couldn't tell you five country songs."
"__MUSIC__ I appreciate it for what it is, it's just not my style."
"__MUSIC__ It all just sounds the same to me honestly."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like you could say that about any genre of music, though."
"__MUSIC__ That is true. What are you listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ That new Volume's CD is really good."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard that one yet."
"__MUSIC__ It's really new. The songs are very catchy."
"__MUSIC__ What type of band are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're normally a metal band but there's a lot of soft singing on this release."
"__MUSIC__ So not a lot of screaming?"
"__MUSIC__ Way less than they had in previous releases. It's still there though."
"__MUSIC__ I like some screaming but it can't be the whole song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think it's good for heavy music. It's hard to understand though."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I like to be able to understand the words."
"__MUSIC__ You actually learn to understand it after awhile."
