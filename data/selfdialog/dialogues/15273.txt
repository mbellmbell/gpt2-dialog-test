"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why was Harry's family so mean/"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you mean?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ His brother and mom and dad, they're all mean."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, that's not his real family."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's not?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No.  His mom and dad died protecting him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh.  I must have missed that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's a pretty huge miss.  It's like the center of the whole first movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess I better watch it again instead of get distracted."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I've got a copy if you'd like to watch it tonight."
