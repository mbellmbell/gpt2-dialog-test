"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL season's coming up. I sure hope my team does well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're not still a Ram's fan; are you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What else would I be? They just had a bad season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll say it was a bad season. Coach Fisher got axed and the owner put the rest of the team on notice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The team's a brand. It's worth almost $1.5 billion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The revised estimate values them at $2.9 billion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's one of the reasons why they're my favorite team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Keep in mind though that they lost to the 49ers 28-0. And that was a horrible season for the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe with Coach Fassel they'll do better this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, Sean McVay is their new coach. I thought you said that this was your team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hadn't heard about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was announced the day that the Chargers moved to Los Angeles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't know that the Chargers were an LA team now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're part of the Western Conference now. It's time for the Rams to shape up, or ship out as the saying goes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Rams have a long LA history, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The San Diego Chargers do too. They were the Los Angeles Chargers before moving to San Diego."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and the Rams were the Cleveland Rams back in the day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think they're going to make a comeback this upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they've got good players -- Jared Goff, Malcolm Brown, Tavon Austin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see if that makes a difference this time around....."
