"__MUSIC__ Hey, so with everything going on in music these days, is there anything that really stands out for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, there are tons of great artists doing some awesome things right now. Do you like Imagine Dragons?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they are pretty good. Do you have any favorite songs from their most recent album?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean 'Evolve?' Yeah, I really liked 'Believer.'"
"__MUSIC__ I liked that one too. It kind of seemed like everyone else did too. It might be the most popular song from that record."
"__MUSIC__ You might be right. I really liked 'Thunder' too. That was a great track."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Pretty much every song on that album was good, but those two really stood out."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, not too change genres or anything, but have you heard anything from the new DJ Khaled album?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean 'Grateful?' The one with Justin Timberlake and Rihanna?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the one. Have you heard any of the songs from that yet?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really like 'I'm the One.' It really stands out for me."
"__MUSIC__ That's the one with Justin Timberlake right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it also has Chance the Rapper and Quavo on it too. It's pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked it too. There were just so many great artists on it."
"__MUSIC__ 'Wild Thoughts' is super good too. It might, for me, be even a little better than 'I'm the One.'"
"__MUSIC__ That was a good song. Rihanna was awesome on it!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah you're totally right. She is pretty much one of my favorite artists right now."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I am still playing 'Work' on a non-stop basis!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, I love that song. It is so, so good."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, totally! I just can't wait for her new stuff! Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long!"
