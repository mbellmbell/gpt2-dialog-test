"__MUSIC__ Do you think Beyonce will make a new album next year with the new babies here?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure but she likes to make hits when no one is looking so who knows?"
"__MUSIC__ True. What did you think of her last album?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was good and I like the variety of the music."
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't sure what to make of the one song with the video under water"
"__MUSIC__ I thought that was a creative idea for her to use."
"__MUSIC__ I like the album with Girls on it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes but you had to appreciate the way she swings a bat and takes charge of the block."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know how I feel about her portraying violence but she was very pretty."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think it was so much about violence as it was about self expression."
"__MUSIC__ What is self expression in a song that breaks windshields?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she was maybe reflecting on her personal relationship with her husband."
"__MUSIC__ I think she might have been but I like it better when she is more artistic in her videos."
"__MUSIC__ I think you're right."
"__MUSIC__ Like the video with her kicking water and sand on the beach, now that was artistic, wouldn't you say?"
"__MUSIC__ I would agree. I did like that drunk in love theme."
"__MUSIC__ I still listen to that song regularly."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, me too."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think she will have her daughter in a video again soon?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and maybe the twins also."
