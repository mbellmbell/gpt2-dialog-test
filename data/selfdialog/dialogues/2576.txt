"__MUSIC__ Hey, you have your PhD in music, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Music theory, to be specific, but yes."
"__MUSIC__ My daughter is going to apply for music programs next year. Any recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, what program?"
"__MUSIC__ Music."
"__MUSIC__ No, like...performance, theater, education, theory, business,..."
"__MUSIC__ I think she wants to direct bands."
"__MUSIC__ Right now the best thing you can do is to get an education degree with a strong theory background."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she'll either be super busy teaching band at a bunch of schools, or not busy at all. In that case, she should be able to teach other classes."
"__MUSIC__ Why theory?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, history is easy to teach. Theory is more specialized."
"__MUSIC__ Cann't anyone with a degree teach music theory?"
"__MUSIC__ NO! Most people can't."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well lots of schools hire professors to teach some lessons and a class or two. They're usually bad at theory."
"__MUSIC__ She wants to avoid a big city."
"__MUSIC__ Lots of small schools in small towns have great programs, don't worry."
"__MUSIC__ Good, plus they're too expensive."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy expensive."
