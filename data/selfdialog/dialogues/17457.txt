"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Moonlight that won the Academy Award for best picture?"
"__MOVIES__ I have to tell you I was surprised that it won."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the acting was very good and the storyline did hold my interest, it's just that there were others who should of won."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Mahershala Ali did an excellent job in his role, so I agree about the acting."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he won the academy award for supporting actor.  It was definitely deserved."
"__MOVIES__ The story however while compelling, did not touch my heart the way Hidden Figures did."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Marershala Ali was in that one as well.  He did a lot of movies this year."
"__MOVIES__ Janelle Mon√°e was in both of those movies as well."
"__MOVIES__ She was awesome in Hidden Figures.  Just sort of ok in Moonlight."
"__MOVIES__ What about the mistake when they announced the Best Picture award."
"__MOVIES__ Right, that was unreal.  I must say the La La Land crew was very gracious about turning over the award."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed, they had to convince the Moonlight folks that they weren't joking."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't even seen La La Land yet, so I don't know what all the hype is about that flick."
"__MOVIES__ Me either.  It's on my watch list."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I watch it when it comes out on cable or Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Agree.  You know what makes a Best Picture for me."
"__MOVIES__ No what?"
"__MOVIES__ I have to want to watch the movie again, and for Moonlight - once was enough."
"__MOVIES__ That is an interesting way to look at it.  I have to think about my favorites and see if that criteria works for me."
