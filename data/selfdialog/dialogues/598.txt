"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of the Doors?"
"__MUSIC__ The Jim Morrison group?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yes, that's the one!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  I love their music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!  Break On Through to the Other Side is an incredible song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and I always liked People Are Strange."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like that one too.  I like how they have some piano mixed in their music."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know they were formed in 1965 in Los Angeles?"
"__MUSIC__ No!  I always thought they were British."
"__MUSIC__ They're not.  Their first album, The Doors, was released in 1967."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a long time ago!  So they've been around over fifty years."
"__MUSIC__ Yep!  They broke up in 1973, but I heard that recently several of them got back together and recorded some stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Who was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was not Jim Morrison, but two of the others.  They called themselves the Doors of the 21st Century."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I'd like them without Morrison."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he kinda made the group for me too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  Well it'd be interesting to hear what they sounded like, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I might check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Well, in the meantime at least we have their old hits!"
"__MUSIC__ They definitely aren't going anywhere."
