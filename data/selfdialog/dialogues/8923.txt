"__BEATLES__ So, you've heard of the Beatles, right.  What do you think of their best selling Album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, is that the one that was a concept album about a fictional band?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, that is my all time favorite Beatles Album."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, really.  Mine too. And my favorite track is 'With a Little Help from my Friends'."
"__BEATLES__ My favorite track is 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds'.  What do you think of that song?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I like that one too.  But my all time favorite is 'A day in the life'."
"__BEATLES__ Was that a Lennon and McCartney song?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes. In fact some claim that A Day in the Life was the best Lennon/McCartney collaboration."
"__BEATLES__ I didn't I didn't know that. But  you know, there are so many excellent tracks on that album."
"__BEATLES__ There sure are; and it's hard to believe that it was first released about 50 years ago."
