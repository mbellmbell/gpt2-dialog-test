"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a big fan of the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I watch a lot of games during the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good. Who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a big fan of the packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, okay. I am a steelers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. They're pretty good too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how do you think your team will do this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we will be pretty good. Our division isn;t very strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, The bears, lions, and vikings all are okay, but not really top grade."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. What about you guys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we will be okay. We are pretty solid at all positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you guys are really deep at receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah we are. IT's going to be interesting to see what happens with bryant after his suspension."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he looked like he worked hard with his time off though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true, he looked like he was in really good shape. He also put on about ten pounds of muscle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but that high pick on a receiver put some pressure on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he will definitely be a starter i think. If he's decent him and bryant may fight for the two spot eventually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. What about bell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard they're still negotiating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats interesting."
