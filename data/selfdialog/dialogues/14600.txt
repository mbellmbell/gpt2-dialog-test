"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I really enjoy Bruce Willis movies, what about you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes me to. I think he is one of the best."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I could watch the Die Hard movies over and over again. They never get old!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I really enjoyed part two. I think it was my favorite out of the whole series."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That one was really good, but I would go with Live Free or Die Hard."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Speaking of the Die Hard movies, they may be the best action franchise of all time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't know, the Lethal Weapon series is up there for me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were a great combination in my opinion."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Comparing Lethal Weapon and Die Hard is very difficult but I would give Lethal Weapon a slight edge."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think I would go with the Die Hard series just because Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I can understand that, either way they are both great franchises."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Are there any more action movies that can compete with either of those?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't think so, although Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger may have something to say about that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That is true. The both of them have put out some legendary action films."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ In terms of Arnold, the Terminator films were fantastic."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I agree, but I think Kindergarten Cop is one of my all time favorite films."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Have you seen the sequel with Dolph Lundgren?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes but it was not the same at all!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know, I wish Arnold would have came back and renewed his role as John Kimble."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, that would have been awesome. It would have made a lot more money at the box office if he had of."
