"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey what you think about the Saints this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be interesting, they still don't have the defense they need though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Rob Ryan really screwed us over!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they're defense has been terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited about having Adrian Peterson though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No not really.  The guy is old, and history shows age is not friendly to running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he came back from the ACL so strong a few years ago, I'll bet he has a lot left in the tank."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man, watching him play the last two years, he looks so much slower."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe if he just loses some weight?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but he's never been a really elusive runner, he's more of a power guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We still have Mark Ingram though, and he's proven to be pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's a real shame we lost Brandon Cook though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he was a real weapon, it's gonna be tough to watch him play for the Patriots this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you just know Belichek is going to use him the best way possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure, he's gonna put up number like Welker did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I think he's better than Welker was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might be, definitely has the measurables to be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Welker was just good at beating zones and matchups."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was quick, but Cook is quick too, just with better top end speed."
