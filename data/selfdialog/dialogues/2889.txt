"__MUSIC__ have you seen the wizkid 'come closer' video with drake?"
"__MUSIC__ oyeah i did but drake wasn't on the video."
"__MUSIC__ no way,i was eager to see it because of drake"
"__MUSIC__ nah he wasn't"
"__MUSIC__ maybe a pay back to wizkid for also not appearing on drake 'one dance' video he featured on."
"__MUSIC__ true that could be a possible reason."
"__MUSIC__ still though overall i love the song."
"__MUSIC__ yeah same here  drakes killed it."
"__MUSIC__ wizkid also brought his afro pop flavor to it."
"__MUSIC__ i don't really dig this afro pop stuff, seems most american artist are experimenting with it."
"__MUSIC__ it does sound great though, noticed jedinna  sampled afro pop sound on his new single."
"__MUSIC__ yeah  the 'little bit more' song."
"__MUSIC__ yeah right that song has afro pop all over it"
"__MUSIC__ it sure does and kinda sound good to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ so  back to the wizkid video, any cameo appearance as i can't watch yet until i'm out of work."
"__MUSIC__ nah no cameo from any notable artist, just wizkid and some couple hot girls."
"__MUSIC__ swear drake appearance would have boost its acceptance ."
"__MUSIC__ hmm kinda, although already 6 million views in 24hours"
"__MUSIC__ 6 million what?"
"__MUSIC__ yeah true, i was stunned as well."
