"__DISNEY__ I'm tired today because I was up late last night looking online for ideas on what to buy some of the people on my Christmas shopping list."
"__DISNEY__ I pretty much know what I'm getting everyone. Who were you shopping for?"
"__DISNEY__ One of the hard ones is my seven year old niece. She's the only niece I have, so I like to get her something special."
"__DISNEY__ I have a ten year old niece, and I already ordered some great stuff for her on Amazon."
"__DISNEY__ What did you buy?"
"__DISNEY__ She loves that Disney movie Finding Nemo, so I ordered this cute Finding Nemo blanket, and some stuffed animals, Nemo and Dory."
"__DISNEY__ Oh. That's a great idea. My niece loves the Disney movie Frozen, I bet I could find some Frozen stuff like that."
"__DISNEY__ You could probably find Frozen clothing and costumes too, she would probably like a Frozen nightgown or something."
"__DISNEY__ That's an awesome idea! You just made my shopping a lot easier."
"__DISNEY__ No problem, you know how I LOVE online shopping!"
