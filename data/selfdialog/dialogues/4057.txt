"__MUSIC__ How do you feel about modern folk music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that's an oxymoron."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's no such thing anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Folk music is specific in its definition."
"__MUSIC__ What is its official definition?"
"__MUSIC__ It's music that originates organically and passed down through the generations. It's never written down and can't be used for profit."
"__MUSIC__ And why is that no longer applicable?"
"__MUSIC__ Now, all music is written down. Folk singers are millionaires."
"__MUSIC__ But they sound folky."
"__MUSIC__ Sort of, I guess. It's just slow pop music, a whiney voice, and usually a ukelele."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, why do they all play that?"
"__MUSIC__ It was the poor person's guitar back in the nineteenth-century."
"__MUSIC__ You like to ruin things don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it's a conversation worth happening. Folk music now is nothing like it was back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ So when I go to a folk festival...?"
"__MUSIC__ It's going to be a bunch of rich white women whining on a uke. Sounds horrible but true."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, I'll prove you wrong."
"__MUSIC__ Fine, there might be a guy on a ukelele too."
