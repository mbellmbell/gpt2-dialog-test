"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's your favorite rap song of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a tough question because they have different feelings, so they aren't all comparable. I'll go with 'Hypnotize' by the Notorious BIG."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Great song, a classic of the bragging style of rap. Sometimes you want more meaningful rhymes, sometimes just a great beat and fun lyrics."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Agreed. His 'Juicy' song is definitely a more thoughtful song."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's another classic. I was just listening to 'Broken Wings' by Tupac the other day. The lyrics are like poetry."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You don't hear that much anymore in today's rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ At least not on the radio, but if you look a little deeper you can find some really smart rappers."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Any recommendations?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Off the top of my head, Zion I is a good one, Kendrick Lamar is kind of straddling both worlds."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, good point. He's as much an artist as a rapper."
