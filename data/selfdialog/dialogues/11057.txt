"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the Miami Dolphins Tight ends, the big question is Julius Thomas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No question about it.  Miami traded for him in the off-season, but will they get the player from Denver or Jacksonville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are definitely hoping for the player who caught 24 touchdowns his last two years in Denver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he did that in an offense led by Adam Gase, just like he has in Miami."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that team also had Peyton Manning.  Without him he had two bad years in Jacskonville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True.  But while Tannehill certainly is no Peyton Manning, he is much better than what they have in Jacksonville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was it just the touchdowns that were a concern in Jacksonville?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are some major concerns.  Every year since 2013 he has played fewer games and averaged fewer yards per catch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And fewer receptions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Almost, he caught three more in 2015 than in 2014, but then 16 fewer in 2016.  He only caught more than 50 passes once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he is a big risk, they really don't know what they are getting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they don't, and there are some concerns that he does not seem to be building a rapport with Tannehill."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what is the fallback if he doesn't pan out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is not much of one.  MarQueis Gray had a couple good games, but he does not seem to be much of an option."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Thomas Duarte?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some people had high hopes for him, but he still needs to develop before he can contribute."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They brought old vet Anthony Fasano back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but he is there mostly to block at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he could end up playing on a lot of downs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Thomas doesn't pan out, it will be a lot of Fasano and sets with no tight end."
