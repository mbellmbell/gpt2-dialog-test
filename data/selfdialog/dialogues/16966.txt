"__MOVIES__ Why do you think so many horror movies release in August and September?"
"__MOVIES__ That's right before Halloween. They want to get people in the mood for being scared."
"__MOVIES__ But August is two months before Halloween. No one wants to see a horror movie then?"
"__MOVIES__ It's more of a pallet cleanser. Something to watch after the summer blockbuster season is over."
"__MOVIES__ Still, you would think they'd want to release them closer to Halloween?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, but then every horror film would be released at the same time, and they'd all drown each other out."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. Maybe people want to be scared no matter the time of the year."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure. Remember Krampus?"
"__MOVIES__ What about it? Was it a horror film?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a Christmas, horror, comedy film."
"__MOVIES__ Talk about a genre blending film."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it just goes to show you how people like different things no matter the time of year."
"__MOVIES__ Is horror-comedy really that popular?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of. Zombieland was huge, and that was a horror comedy hybrid."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any others?"
"__MOVIES__ There's been a few. Like Ghostbusters, and The Evil Dead series for example."
"__MOVIES__ If that's all, it doesn't sound like it's a very popular genre."
"__MOVIES__ It's not unpopular. Though, true horror films are definitely more common."
"__MOVIES__ All this talk of horror movie makes me want to see one. Anything coming out soon?"
"__MOVIES__ Polaroid is coming out in a few months. It's basically a Goosebumps rip-off though."
