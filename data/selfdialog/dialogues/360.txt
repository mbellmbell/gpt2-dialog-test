"__MUSIC__ So, my friend and I are doing a sushi night, and we're looking for music to listen to. Any suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ What, like Japanese music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. You know about that sort of thing don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm at least a little familiar."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what would you suggest."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. First off, there's this song by Kyu Sakamoto. It's called Sukiyaki in English."
"__MUSIC__ Sukiyaki?"
"__MUSIC__ In Japanese it's a kind of soup. The real title is Walking While Looking Up."
"__MUSIC__ Why'd they change it?"
"__MUSIC__ American audiences couldn't pronounce the real title."
"__MUSIC__ That's really funny. It sounds like a good choice."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. And also, maybe something by Happy End."
"__MUSIC__ Happy End?"
"__MUSIC__ Their sound Kaze wo Atsumete plays at the end of Lost in Translation."
"__MUSIC__ Any particular album?"
"__MUSIC__ Harumachi Roman."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, got any others for me?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe try something by The Pillows? They sound a bit like The Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Now that sounds like a lot of fun!"
"__MUSIC__ I hope you have a great sushi night!"
