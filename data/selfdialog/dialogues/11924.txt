"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really, really like Marshawn Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, what is it that you like about him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mostly I like his attitude and ability on the football field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree because he seems to let his play do the talking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely does, even during the Superbowl media coverage he would hardly say anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, I would prefer to hear what he thinks more often."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll be happy to see him play again.  Did you hear he's playing for the Oakland Raiders this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did hear that and I'm quite excited about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As a Seattle Seahawks fan I really wish he was still with my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's kind of sad the way that second Superbowl ended."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he definitely deserved that second victory and I'm mostly just disappointed at the play calling there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure most people were."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The worst part of it is, even though so many people agree that play calling was terrible, that guy is still with the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least we'll probably get to see Marshawn Lynch run the football in this upcoming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders made the playoffs last year so maybe having him will make them a real competitor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You never know, sometimes football seems like pure chance with the injuries and all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of injuries, that's another thing I really love about Marshawn Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just seems that he's a super tough guy and is very durable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You definitely need durability to be an NFL running back."
