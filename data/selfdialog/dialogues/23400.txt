"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Like, of all time? That's too hard. You'd have to divide it into, like, pre-Pixar and post-Pixar."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. What's your favorite pre-Pixar movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Sleeping Beauty. Hands down. That movie is absolutely beautiful. And the characters are great."
"__DISNEY__ Is that the one with the dwarfs?"
"__DISNEY__ Uh, no, you're thinking of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.' The one with Dwarfs in the title. Sleeping Beauty has the witches."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, the three little witches. The pink one, blue one, and green one."
"__DISNEY__ Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Plus Maleficent."
"__DISNEY__ She's the bad guy?"
"__DISNEY__ Wait, have you not seen this movie? Oh my god. Sit down, we are watching this movie RIGHT NOW."
