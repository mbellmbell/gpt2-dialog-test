"__DISNEY__ What is it about and what is it based on?"
"__DISNEY__ The idea seems to be from Jack and the Beanstalk and has Jack as the main character."
"__DISNEY__ What happens in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, he meets giants in the sky as the name suggests."
"__DISNEY__ Sounds like a fun premise. What else?"
"__DISNEY__ He meets a 11 year-old girl who is around 60 ft tall!"
"__DISNEY__ Do they become friends?"
