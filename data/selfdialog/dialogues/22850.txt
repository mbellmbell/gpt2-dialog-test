"__DISNEY__ What did you think about the movie, 'Moana?'"
"__DISNEY__ It was a really cool movie, and quite possibly the best one of the past few years."
"__DISNEY__ Better than 'Frozen?'"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, for sure.  The characters and music of 'Moana' were superior to that of 'Frozen.'"
"__DISNEY__ What about 'Let it Go?'"
"__DISNEY__ 'Let it Go' was catchy, but it was almost like the chorus was written, then the rest of the song was an after thought."
"__DISNEY__ Which song from 'Moana' did you like the best?"
"__DISNEY__ 'How Far I'll Go' was so good.  It also had a beginning, middle, and end to it."
"__DISNEY__ I like that song too.  Who wrote it again?"
"__DISNEY__ The talented, Lin-Manuel Miranda!"
