"__DISNEY__ Everyone's saying that 'Let it Go' from Frozen is the best Disney song ever."
"__DISNEY__ That's crazy! There are so many songs that are classics."
"__DISNEY__ That's what I said! What about Aladdin's 'A Whole New World'?"
"__DISNEY__ And 'Tale as Old as Time' from Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ And even more old school like 'When you Wish Upon a Star' from Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ So we agree, classic Disney still holds up."
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely. Although I do love 'Let it Go.'"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's a great song. And I like the snowman song too."
"__DISNEY__ 'Do you Want to Build a Snowman'? Yeah, that's pretty fantastic as well."
"__DISNEY__ So perhaps not the best ever but they can be added to the list of great ones."
