"__MOVIES__ What was the last movie you went to see in the movie theater?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe it was Hitman 1."
"__MOVIES__ Really? You have not seen anything after that?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure I have see movies after that but that was the last one in a movie theater."
"__MOVIES__ Why? Going to the theater is like a national past time."
"__MOVIES__ I have a couple of reasons."
"__MOVIES__ What is the first reason?"
"__MOVIES__ You have to take out a small loan for to buy tickets and then if you want snacks your kids can no longer go to college. Seriously, it is just too expensive when movies at home are cheap and more convenient."
"__MOVIES__ And your second reason?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't stand to miss anything and inevitably I always have to go to the bathroom right at the good parts."
"__MOVIES__ Now that I can agree with since I do the same thing."
"__MOVIES__ Also, there is always someone with a baby or a small child who screams at the loud noises."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know. I never understood why parents would bring kids to a movie they have no business being at."
"__MOVIES__ Also, the theaters are never clean. The floors and chairs are sticky, the air is stuffy and stale."
"__MOVIES__ There is nothing worse than walking across the floor and having your shoes sticking."
"__MOVIES__ Which you then carry with you no matter where you go after that."
"__MOVIES__ Any other reasons?"
"__MOVIES__ My hearing has been damaged and the sound from the movie is too loud. It makes me feel motion sick because of the damage."
"__MOVIES__ So you really do not have a good time at the theater?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it is my least favorite date night venue."
