"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the recent Fast and Furious movie yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it in theaters, it was a lot of fun."
"__MOVIES__ Was it filmed in a new location?"
"__MOVIES__ It starts out in Havana, Cuba but you have to watch it to find out where the rest of the movie takes place."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, fair enough I don't want you to give me any spoilers."
"__MOVIES__ It is really good. I think it might be my favorite along with the first one."
"__MOVIES__ What number is this one."
"__MOVIES__ The fast and furious that was just released is number 9: The Fate of the Furious."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I can't believe they are already at number nine. I heard there was a lot of drama recently with Michelle Rodriguez."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What is the drama, she is one of my favorites in the franchise."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that she was protesting how women are treated in the franchise and that they are not placed for lead characters."
"__MOVIES__ I hope she does not leave, she is one of the only original characters left and I love her personality."
"__MOVIES__ I know Paul Walker is no longer in the movies but is Vin Diesel."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, Vin Diesel is still one of the main characters"
"__MOVIES__ Now with CGI they would be able to bring Paul Walker back."
"__MOVIES__ O wow, I totally forgot about CGI. You are right, they can put Paul Walker back in the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Where do you think the next movie will take place? They already have done so many cool places."
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure but it is always a new culture. And they pick somewhere relevant, cool and exciting to see."
"__MOVIES__ So do you want to watch the movie again with me? I will provide snacks and popcorn!"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a lot of fun. I will definitely watch it again with you."
