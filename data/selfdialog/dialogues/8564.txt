"__BEATLES__ Do you have any Beatles albums?"
"__BEATLES__ No, but if I did which should I get?"
"__BEATLES__ Not sure. There's a collection of number one songs."
"__BEATLES__ That might be good. I'm only a casual fan."
"__BEATLES__ I hardly like them. That album is enough for me."
"__BEATLES__ I'm sure it would have most of the songs I like on it."
"__BEATLES__ It has twenty-something songs."
"__BEATLES__ I'll check it out so I can add it to my collection."
"__BEATLES__ Amazon has it."
"__BEATLES__ Good to know. I bet they also have samples I can play."
