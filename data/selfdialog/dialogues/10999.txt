"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about that Andy Dalton?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Andy Dalton???? He's the worst quarterback in the NFL!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But his stats are always in the top 5% of the league!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's never even won a playoff game!  He's 0 for 6 in the playoffs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Phillip Rivers? He's great, but chokes in the playoffs, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he's never had a great team behind him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither has Dalton. Paul Brown won't spend the money to surround him with quality players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. Paul Brown is the Bengals biggest problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Bengals were owned by Art Rooney, or Bob Kraft, they would have won 6 Super Bowls with Dalton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but they don't have Bill Belichek, or Mike Tomlin, either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What would Belichek, and Tomlin do differently for the Bengals?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're both great coaches that can motivate the team in crunch time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how could the Bengals change their future?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They could hire a better general manager, than Katy Blackburn, and get rid of family nepotism."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that is what is holding them back. Bill Walsh would have been a good pick. Too bad he's dead"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, yeah. But on another note, they could triple the scouting staff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are trying to operate this team on a 1980's type of staff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard their scouting staff is so small, they can't evaluate all the college prospects out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. Their front office needs a major overhaul."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's high time to shake up this team leadership. I would like to see them win a playoff"
