"__MOVIES__ The Halloween movies will be on soon."
"__MOVIES__ Which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Hocus Pocus. I don't like anything gorey."
"__MOVIES__ Neither do I. It's so unnecessary to have all that violence."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like life is violent and horrible enough for some without us turning that into entertainment."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty much how I feel too."
"__MOVIES__ That's why I like family movies."
"__MOVIES__ So do I. Hocus Pocus is a good choice."
"__MOVIES__ Want to watch it with me?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure. Do you get the right channel?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It is on at six so let's get ready to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ I don't watch movies too often but this one is one I've liked since childhood."
"__MOVIES__ I did too. I watch it every Halloween."
"__MOVIES__ I used to but haven't seen it for ages."
"__MOVIES__ You're in for a treat then."
"__MOVIES__ I love the witches. They're so funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I like all the characters accept for that bratty little girl."
"__MOVIES__ It seems there's always a brat in these movies."
"__MOVIES__ True."
"__MOVIES__ They are better without them in there, though."
