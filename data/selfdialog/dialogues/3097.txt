"__MUSIC__ Man, just got back from the Pink Floyd concert.  It was Rockin'"
"__MUSIC__ Really, me too.  It was loud.  My ears are still ringing."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too.  How'd you like that ending.  What a finally."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I didn't expect that third encore."
"__MUSIC__ Me either.  We were starting to head out of the arena when they came back on."
"__MUSIC__ Excellent.  Couldn't believe they played the entire Dark side of the Moon."
"__MUSIC__ Blew my mind.  And they had the big pigs floating above too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, too bad Roger wasn't with them though."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  Would have loved to see them in the old days when they were all together."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  Do you got their latest album?"
"__MUSIC__ I do.  I'd been waiting a long time for it.  I've got all their albums."
"__MUSIC__ I heard they were going to put out a CD of this concert too."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't doubt it.  I know they did for their Momentary Lapse of Reason album."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've seen that one before."
"__MUSIC__ I went to that tour also.  Delicate sound of Thunder is the name of the tour. It was great."
"__MUSIC__ Ain't no band out there like them."
"__MUSIC__ Never was and never will be.  They got a sound all to their own."
"__MUSIC__ That's for sure.  But I doubt they will put anything else out now."
"__MUSIC__ If they do I'll be one of the first to pick it up."
"__MUSIC__ In the mean time I'm gonna go listen to some WHO.  Later."
