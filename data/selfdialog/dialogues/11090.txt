"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's have a conversation on football"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like about the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A serious conversation. I'm against football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football is an extremely dangerous sport, yet kids grow up wanting to be the next Peyton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why they wear protective gear. Sure it's a rough sport but that's the fun of it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know that more than 20% of NFL players report head trauma injuries?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's pretty high but it's a toll that they pay for the sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. So the problem is, why don't people know how dangerous it is? There should be parental advisories"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think people should just choose to play what they want."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They can choose, as long as they have knowledge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Knowledge of what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Consequences."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's fair. I agree with you on that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This way, parents can sign up their kids for little league football after the kid knows they can get a concussion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This reminds me of a movie recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which movie?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Concussion. It stars Will Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll have to check it out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Please do. It's quite relevant."
