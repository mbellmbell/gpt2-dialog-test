"__DISNEY__ What's that new Pirates of the Caribbean movie called?"
"__DISNEY__ Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales."
"__DISNEY__ Right, that's the one. We should go see it."
"__DISNEY__ Sure. I love some Johnny Depp."
"__DISNEY__ I hope he keeps making more Pirates of the Caribbean movies. They're so unique."
"__DISNEY__ I enjoy the world and the lore. Of course it doesn't hurt that Johnny Depp is the perfect Jack Sparrow."
"__DISNEY__ I wish they would bring back Orlando Bloom to play Will Turner and Keira Knightley to play Elizabeth Turner."
"__DISNEY__ They're in the new movie from what I'm told."
"__DISNEY__ Are you serious?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. They are there but only at the end for a little bit."
