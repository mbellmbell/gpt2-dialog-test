"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's almost August! You know what that means!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah man! You going to any of the games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, I got my cheese head ready for the Packers game. Can't wait till we play the Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That'll be a tough game but do you think we have a chance?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hope so. Rodgers is always good we just need to play strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, do you ever miss Farve though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course man, he was one of the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't believe he's still playing though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait didn't you hear he's coming back to Green Bay?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? No way!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't believe it either since he's like almost 50"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dang, that's a lot older than the other guys on the team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but that skill level though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. I wonder how it's gonna go with Rodgers on the team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dunno, will be great to find out though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, that's why I can't wait till next month"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably won't play much in the preseason though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right, but still it's so close"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We should go to a game!"
