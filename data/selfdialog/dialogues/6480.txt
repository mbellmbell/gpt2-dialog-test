"__STAR_WARS__ What is the best quotable scene from the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it has to be, 'These aren't the droids you're looking for?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  More so than, 'No, I am your Father?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, perhaps you have a point.  That is the quintessential Star Wars line."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about, 'Now THIS, is podracing!?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Now I know you're kidding."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right, I was joking around."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the most overused one may be 'Do or do not.  There is not try.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely overused.  I heard it in a graduation speech once."
"__STAR_WARS__ You were correct about 'No, I am your father' being the clear winner."
