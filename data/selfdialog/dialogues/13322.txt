"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts for NFL football this season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I always get my hopes up for the Lions, but they always disappoint me"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! That's true maybe this will be they're year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I always think that right around the 3rd or 4th game, but by the 10th game I'm usually brought back to reality."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think we'll ever see them at the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly no, I think I'd faint if we ever made it into the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well in the mean time I'll be pulling for The Bears"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh, not again with The Bears"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? They are a solid team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah yeah yeah, we have this discussion every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't be bitter because they have more solid seasons than your Lions"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay lets not go there"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we'll both just be happy of the Patriots don't make it to the Super Bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ain't that the truth. I'm so over them even being in the Super Bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know Brady doesn't need another ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, he's gotten too cocky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Sea Hawks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't mind seeing them go all the way"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, ya know, them or the Bears"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or the lions."
