"__MOVIES__ Who's your favorite director?"
"__MOVIES__ Tough choice! I think I'd have to go with Wes Anderson, though."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I like the subjects of his films, but I also think the way the scenes are filled is really beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Beautiful in what way?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's because everything tends to be very symmetric, and I love how it looks."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that makes sense! Do you have a favorite film of his?"
"__MOVIES__ The Life Aquatic is a classic, but I'm also a big fan of Grand Budapest Hotel."
"__MOVIES__ Grand Budapest Hotel sounds familiar. Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It has a huge cast! Ralph Fiennes plays the main character."
"__MOVIES__ Why does his name sound familiar? What else has he been in?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in Schindler's List, and In Bruges, and he played Voldemort in Harry Potter."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes! And didn't his younger brother play young Voldemort as well?"
"__MOVIES__ That's right! His brother Joseph played Tom Riddle."
"__MOVIES__ That's so neat. Tell me about that other film, The Life Aquatic?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's probably my favorite Wes Anderson movie. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, and they spend the whole film hunting down a 'jaguar shark'."
"__MOVIES__ What's that supposed to be? A parody of something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the whole film is a tribute to and parody of Jacques-Yves Cousteau!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's really cool!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Wes Anderson's films are brilliant."
