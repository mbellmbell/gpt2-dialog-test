"__DISNEY__ So, please tell me what you think of Lilo and Stitch."
"__DISNEY__ It has been forever since I've seen the movie, so I really can't say much about it."
"__DISNEY__ Do you at least remember Stitch?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I do remember the little blue alien."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think about him?"
"__DISNEY__ I remember that he got in all kinds of mischief."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, he did. I think that made the movie."
"__DISNEY__ It did because I still can remember those aspects of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ The movie was basically based on the antics."
"__DISNEY__ If I can recall, they were hilarious."
