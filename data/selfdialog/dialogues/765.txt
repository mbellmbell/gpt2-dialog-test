"__MUSIC__ Have you ever had a bad experience at a concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, I think everyone does sooner or later if you go to a lot of them."
"__MUSIC__ What was a bad experience for you?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to see KMFDM. They are a very rowdy alternative rock band, and their mosh pits have a lot of shoving and hard physical stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Did you get hurt in the mosh pit?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I was robbed intentionally I think."
"__MUSIC__ What happened?"
"__MUSIC__ The crowd suddenly started shoving a lot, and then I felt someone shove me really hard, and I kind of stumbled, but didn't see who it was. Then I looked down and saw my shoulder bag was missing- but just the purse part. The fabric straps were still on my shoulders. They held onto the purse and then shoved me really hard to break my purse off."
"__MUSIC__ Oh how horrible. What did you do?"
"__MUSIC__ I borrowed a flashlight from security, checked the floor, and checked again when the lights came on, and never found it."
"__MUSIC__ What did you lose in your purse?"
"__MUSIC__ The worse part was my car keys. I had to call someone to come get me from an hour away, and go back the next day and get the car. I lost $100 and my drivers license."
"__MUSIC__ I bet you were mad."
"__MUSIC__ I was furious, but also scared. They had my address on my license and my house keys on the keychain, so I didn't sleep when I got home and had to get both the door locks changed at my house."
"__MUSIC__ Did you enjoy anything about the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really- I usually liked their songs, but it was just too loud, the mosh pit was too mean, it was too smoky."
"__MUSIC__ So did you ever go see that band again?"
"__MUSIC__ No, because I knew that I would always keep remembering that, and it would ruin another show."
"__MUSIC__ I think I would have skipped seeing that band again too."
"__MUSIC__ It did teach me a good lesson- leave my purse in the trunk, and wear pockets to put my keys in."
