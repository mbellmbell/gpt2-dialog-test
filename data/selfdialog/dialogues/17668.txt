"__MOVIES__ You never did mind spoilers, right? Mind if I throw out some spoilers now?"
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like that idea has been buzzing around in your head for awhile. I know if I don't let you get it out of your system now, you will practically tell me the whole movie later."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so Kurt Russel doesn't really get to accomplish his goal in the movie. I felt cheated."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't something like that make the movie more interesting? Did he have to figure out some other way to accomplish his goal or something close to it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he did not anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Did he die?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he died partway through the film, sorry for the spoiler."
"__MOVIES__ You're not sorry. How did he die?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not going to tell you that part, but I will say that his companions carried on in his stead."
"__MOVIES__ So there was some sort of positive conclusion to the affair?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think there was. I think that the ending, and all of the exchanges just became a vehicle for Tarantino's usual blood lust."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess. Everyone died in some horrific way, yet the plot was able to keep moving on in spite of pivotal characters dying?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but unlike some of his other films, things still made sense, but it felt lackluster compared to the types of showdowns you tend to see in other westerns."
"__MOVIES__ It just sounds like another sort of western to me, kind of like 3:10 to Yuma, the original."
"__MOVIES__ No, Tarantino knew what he was doing. He even had Leigh describe the epic fight scene that everyone was waiting for. You knew it had to come down to that."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think you watch enough westerns. Not all of them have epic showdowns. Some are just a quick bullet to the head."
"__MOVIES__ They set the tone in this movie though- they knew there was supposed to be a big shootout- instead they showed us a massacre."
"__MOVIES__ See, I want to see it now so that I can make some fair comparisons. I think you're exaggerating the issue."
"__MOVIES__ Fine, what day are you free?"
"__MOVIES__ I can go see it with you next Wednesday."
