"__ACTION__ What do you think was the best of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies?"
"__ACTION__ Probably the middle one with the Joker."
"__ACTION__ The Dark Knight?"
"__ACTION__ Yep.  They were all good, but that was the cake of the series."
"__ACTION__ I would agree with you there.  Heath Ledger's performance was an all-timer."
"__ACTION__ He was so creepy in it.  It's a shame he never got back in time for another one."
"__ACTION__ The ending scene was so shocking though.  I actually thought the kid might get it."
"__ACTION__ That's good movie-making in general.  They threw everything at it creatively."
"__ACTION__ I wonder if they'll ever re-explore those movies with Joseph Gordon-Levitt."
"__ACTION__ Unlikely, but you never know."
