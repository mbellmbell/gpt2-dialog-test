"__MUSIC__ Let's talk about the mostly forgotten music genre known as 'bubble gum' music."
"__MUSIC__ Ah yes! good old bubble gum music.  I doubt most people under the age of 50, or maybe even younger, have ever heard of it.  But I'm 65 and i definitely remember it."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  i'm 61 and i remember when there were quite a few hits that could be classifed as 'bubble gum.'  i think mostly this took place in the late 1960s."
"__MUSIC__ I think you're right.  bubble gum didn't have a long life span, but for about 3 years there were quite a few hits that could be called 'bubble gum' music."
"__MUSIC__ One bubble gum group i remember was the 'ohio express.'  they had a few bubble gum hits such as 'Yummy Yummy Yummy.'"
"__MUSIC__ Wow; i hadn't thought of that song for decades.  that was a huge hit.  incredibly silly lyrics, but it certainly was a successful song."
"__MUSIC__ the 'Ohio Express' actually had a record or two before they turned into a 'bubble gum' act.  but they didn't become successful until they found what worked for them...'bubble gum' music."
"__MUSIC__ Ohio Express recorded on the 'Buddah' record label, which was also the label for another bubble gum act, the '1910 Fruitgum Company.'"
"__MUSIC__ What an appropriate name for a bubble gum group: the '1910 Fruitgum Company.'  As i recall, their big hit was '1, 2, 3 red light.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the 1910 fruitgum company had a lighter, more innocent tone than the Ohio Express.'  but both did well on the charts."
"__MUSIC__ There was a group which actually comprised various members of various bubble gum groups called the 'kasenetz katz singing orchestral circus.'  did you ever hear of them?"
"__MUSIC__ are you kidding? the 'kasenetz katz singing circus?' i definitely never heard of them.  were they successful?"
"__MUSIC__ actually it was the 'kasenetz katz singing ORCHESTRAL circus,' and i doubt they had any hits.  but i do remember one song they recorded which i liked alot called 'quick joey small.'"
"__MUSIC__ what was that song about do you remember?"
"__MUSIC__ it was actually about a prisoner who escaped;  with lyrics like 'quick joey small jumped over the wall with a ball and chain behind him.'"
"__MUSIC__ LOL! that's great.  here's a true story: when i was in the sixth grade, my english teacher actually criticized the song 'Indain Giver,' which was a huge hit on the charts."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that song.  i think it was recorded by 1910 fruitgum company, but maybe it was by the Ohio Express.  what did the teacher say about it?"
"__MUSIC__ she took the term 'indian giver' literally.  the lyrics went, 'indian giver, you took your love away from me.'  my teacher thought it was offensive."
"__MUSIC__ you know, i can see your teacher's point of view.  if you take it literally, the term 'indian giver' is offensive.  but i must say it was a good song.  i guess i never considered the lyrics as offensive; at least until now."
"__MUSIC__ well it was good talking about bubble gum music.  right now i'm humming 'mercy mercy.'  it wasn't a big hit, but it was in my 'bubble gum  music' collection!"
