"__MUSIC__ What do you think of 'long hair' music?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean music from the Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ Wrong kind of hair."
"__MUSIC__ ZZ Top?"
"__MUSIC__ No! More like Amadeus Mozart."
"__MUSIC__ Why would they call that long hair music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I always assumed it had something to do with the powdered wigs worn in the olden days."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose that makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you want to know what I think of that, I'd say it is boring. Violins do not excite me."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there are plenty of log-hair music without violins."
"__MUSIC__ If I am listening to them on the radio, how do I know what kind of hair they are wearing?"
"__MUSIC__ Forget the hair. Think classical music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, classical music. Well, that is completely different!"
"__MUSIC__ So you like that type of music?"
"__MUSIC__ No. But I know what that is...and with or without wigs, I don't care for it."
"__MUSIC__ Not at all? Not a single piece?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe some of it is ok."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Like the kind played during Warner Brothers cartoons! 'Kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit...'"
"__MUSIC__ I bet the only truly 'cultured' material you enjoy...is yogurt."
