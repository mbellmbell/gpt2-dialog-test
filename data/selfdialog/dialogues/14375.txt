"__HORROR__ Have you seen The Conjuring?"
"__HORROR__ That is one of the best modern horror movies I've seen."
"__HORROR__ You're right. Really tastefully done, well made, and actually scary in parts."
"__HORROR__ Did you know Ed and Lorraine Warren were actual paranormal hunters?"
"__HORROR__ Yes I did know that. They were involved in the case with Annabelle also."
"__HORROR__ I saw that movie, it creeped me out. I heard they still have that doll housed with the cursed objects."
"__HORROR__ Me too and I heard the Warrens visited the house in Amityville Horror when the family was living there."
"__HORROR__ I saw that documentary with the son, who actually lived there. She was speaking about the experience."
"__HORROR__ Yes and she said she carried a piece of the True Cross into that house with her."
"__HORROR__ Right. The Conjuring did their story justice. Not as many people would have known about their bravery if not for that movie."
