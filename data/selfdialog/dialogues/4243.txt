"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ The rolling stones."
"__MUSIC__ Oh ya, I have seen them live."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, me too 4 times."
"__MUSIC__ I saw then 2002 ish or so. no doubt was the opening act."
"__MUSIC__ That seems like a great concert."
"__MUSIC__ I enjoyed it. I felt badly for No doubt though."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well most people were there for the stones. they did not seems to pay much attention to the set."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy,No doubt is so good too."
"__MUSIC__ Well I agree, but sometimes fans are not crossover fans, ya know?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally. I feel musicians may want to consider their fans when they pick an opener."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. You want to have them appeal to the taste of your fans."
"__MUSIC__ I think some people only care about the headliner. SO many arrive so late."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. The worst is when at a concert and the band is so late."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that absolute worst. One time I think I waited like a full hour for the headliner to come on stage."
"__MUSIC__ Like are they just choosing to be jerks or are they really late from a flight or something?"
"__MUSIC__ You would think they would send the opening act back on to fill the time."
"__MUSIC__ I think that is hard because they need to change out the equipment for each band."
"__MUSIC__ Good point did not take that in consideration."
