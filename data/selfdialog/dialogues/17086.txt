"__MOVIES__ Hey, aren't you a fan of the Star Wars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the older ones.  Some of the newer ones are good and some are not."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen all of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely.  I like to see them as soon as I can after they come out."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like to watch them on TV later?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't like to have them interrupted by commercials.  It sort of breaks up the story."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you.  I get really involved, then have to see something about cereal or fast food.  Yuck!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, especially when they are doing the trash scene in episode 4.  Who wants to see food?"
"__MOVIES__ EEEWWW!  There are lots of places where food isn't a good idea."
"__MOVIES__ Yup, but I get thirsty when they spend a lot of time in the desert.  Episode 1. 2,4, and 7"
"__MOVIES__ Me, too.  I bet they sell lots of soft drinks during those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Uh huh!  Did you get cold during the scenes in the blizzard in episode 5?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really.  I saw that one in the summer.  It was kind of nice to feel a little cool."
"__MOVIES__ I get a little dizzy when they fly.  Anney really got me in episode one with the pod races."
"__MOVIES__ It was fun, but I got some motion sickness, too."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think you needed a translator in many of the films?"
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes.  But I kind of got used to it after a while."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the Ewoks."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite was Yoda."
"__MOVIES__ Do or do not.  There is no try."
