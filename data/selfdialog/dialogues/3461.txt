"__MUSIC__ Who is the best guitar player ever?"
"__MUSIC__ My vote goes to Keith Richards."
"__MUSIC__ Is he from the Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! He is a phenomenal guitar player."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think he is the best though."
"__MUSIC__ Who do you think is the best guitar player ever?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Bob Dylan."
"__MUSIC__ Really? No way!"
"__MUSIC__ Bob Dylan is one of the most talented musicians I have ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ But I do not think he is the best guitar player ever."
"__MUSIC__ What about John Mayer? Is he one of the best?"
"__MUSIC__ He is an incredible musician as well, but I do not think he is amongst the best guitar players."
"__MUSIC__ Even though he filled in and played with the Grateful Dead?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I just do not think he is as talented as someone like Keith Richards."
"__MUSIC__ I guess we will agree to disagree then."
"__MUSIC__ We should read SPIN magazine or a periodical like that. I bet they will have a list of the best guitar players."
"__MUSIC__ They might. But these lists are always so subjective."
"__MUSIC__ At the end of the day, I suppose it doesn't matter."
"__MUSIC__ Right! There are so many amazing guitar players. We are luck to have such great music."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed! Let's go home and put on some albums!"
