"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs put the nail in the coffin on the regular season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Spurs and the Heat both did this before the Cavs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but Cavs look like they will sweep their way to the finals. All of the regular season indicators had them struggling somewhat to make the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron is large part of that since the teams success mostly hinges on how he plays. But 99% of teams cannot do this or have this approach."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess so but they were terrible defensively and simply didn't care. They had everyone convinced they had legitimate issues."
"__BASKETBALL__ I was never convinced of anything. I have been saying for quite sometime call me worried if they are doing this in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ You can only say this when the outcome is positive."
"__BASKETBALL__ I disagree. Nothing happened in the regular season to lead me to believe the Cavaliers couldn't handle the Raptors, Celtics, and Pacers."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs have played the Celtics, Raptors, Pacers. With LeBron in the lineup, we were 9-1 against these teams in the regular season."
"__BASKETBALL__ The problem is beating those teams, proves very little for the exact reason that their ill-equipped to stop what the Cavaliers do."
"__BASKETBALL__ Defense is not something you can turn a switch on. If Cleveland could defend better they would out of pride than to finish in the bottom quarter."
"__BASKETBALL__ Actually it kind of is. This is why playoff defense is always improved."
"__BASKETBALL__ The problem is, teams with more talent, tend to have worse execution during the season, so when the playoffs come, they seem to turn it up a notch when in reality, they are just focused."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs don't have to play great defense to blow out opponents....even average defense will suffice given how easy they put up points."
"__BASKETBALL__ What Cleveland is doing now is impressive, but firstly it is not the norm."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is though! They are a completely unique team because of Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ You just proved my entire point. Without Lebron, the Cavs wouldn't be where they are today."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron's effort and will is the 'switch,' and the rest of the team takes their cue from him. Basketball is a team sport."
"__BASKETBALL__ What are you going to say if the Cavs end up choking?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Lmao get a grip on yourself. Hell will freeze over before that happens."
