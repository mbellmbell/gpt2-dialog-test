"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm marking off the days on the calendar to the most exciting day of the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What day might that be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 2017 NFL season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I though you said before that Superbowl Sunday was the most exciting day of the year. Changed your mind?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK .... second most exciting day of the year, second only to the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll make a note of that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, didn't you tell me before that you worked on a Superbowl when you first graduated from college and got a job at an ABC affiliate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that was me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I so envy you! I wish it was me who got to be on the field during the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That wasn't the best part for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A college friend of mine who lives in Florida is a team doctor to a football team. They gave him two 10th row tickets but he didn't want to come to Minnesota sothey sent them to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why did you need tickets for, you worked the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't use them ... I scalped them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you stand on the street yelling 'tickets for sale?'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. This was pre-internet so I looked in the want ad and found an ad from a professional scalper. I called and they told me what hotel they were in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You, a college girl went alone to a scapler's hotel room?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NO! My dad took me. He was only 5 ft 6 in so he wouldn't have been much help had anything gone wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I knocked on the door, they opened it with the chain still latched, asked me to show them the tickets, I showed them, he closed the door and came back and slipped an envelope stuffed with $100 bills. I made $1,500 in 1991 money. Fun times."
