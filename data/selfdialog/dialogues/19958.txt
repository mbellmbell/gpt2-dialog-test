"__MOVIES__ Did you know they made a live-action He-Man movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I had no idea, what is it called?"
"__MOVIES__ It's just called 'Masters of the Universe.'"
"__MOVIES__ Huh, when did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ It was released in 1987."
"__MOVIES__ I see. Orko was always my favorite character in He-Man."
"__MOVIES__ Oh they actually left him out of the movie since it was too hard to make him float."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad. Who all is in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Dolph Lundgren plays He-Man."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't he the Russian guy in one of the Rocky movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's correct."
"__MOVIES__ So was the Masters of the Universe movie any good?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it was actually quite bad. It's mostly in suburban 1980s Earth."
"__MOVIES__ That is surprising. What are they doing there?"
"__MOVIES__ He-Man gets sent there by a magic portal but he loses it and some teens think it's a synthesizer."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds kind of goofy."
"__MOVIES__ Then they defeat the villains with the power of rock and roll."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds very 1980s."
"__MOVIES__ It really is. I saw it on Netflix though, if you want to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks, I just might."
