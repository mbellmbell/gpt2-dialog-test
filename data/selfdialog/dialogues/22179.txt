"__DISNEY__ What did you think about The Lion King 2."
"__DISNEY__ Ehhh, it was ok, what did you think."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was ok too, it didn't come close to capturing the magic of the first one."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, do any of the Disney sequels ever though?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought Toy Story did really well."
"__DISNEY__ yea, I guess there is that one, but even those sequels didn't capture the same magic."
"__DISNEY__ Well nothing ever will, you will always like the first one you saw the most."
"__DISNEY__ Now we have to consider Star Wars as well since Disney bought them."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, but you can't consider the ones made before they took over."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, those were way better hahaha!"
