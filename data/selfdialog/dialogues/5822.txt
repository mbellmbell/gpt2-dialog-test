"__STAR_WARS__ Did you ever notice the connection between Star Wars and Et: The Extra Terrestrial?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No!  Seriously there's a connection?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  If you watch ET, you will see Yoda, and if you watch Star Wars, you'll see ET."
"__STAR_WARS__ I remember ET in Star Wars.  He was in the senate in episodes 1-3, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes!  Good memory."
"__STAR_WARS__ But where was Yoda in ET?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, remember when they went trick-or-treating on Halloween?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah"
"__STAR_WARS__ A kid was dressed up as Yoda, and when ET saw him, he signaled him as if he knew him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow!  Mind blown!"
