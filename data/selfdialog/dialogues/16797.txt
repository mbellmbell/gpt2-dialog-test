"__MOVIES__ Do you remember what it was like going to the movies alone when you were a teenager?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was a big deal because my mother would never let me see a movie that was rated R (Restricted)."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean you snuck in when you were underage?"
"__MOVIES__ Well sometimes I did.  I guess I was big for my age.  I remember seeing some movies that had nudity so I doubt they were rated G or PG."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that too.  I think I saw Carnal Knowledge.  My parents would not have been happy!"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that with Ann-Margret and Candice Bergen?  I always thought Candice Bergen was gorgeous.  Art Garfunkel was in it too."
"__MOVIES__ I see to remember sneaking out to see Bonne and Clyde.  I doubt it was first run, but I know I wasn't old enough to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing that in the theater and that last scene where Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty were shot up by police was so scary.   Seems pretty tame now."
"__MOVIES__ I remember back then it was a big deal when Midnight Cowboy came out and was nominated for Best Picture. I think it was the only X rated movie to win Best Picture."
"__MOVIES__ That's so funny because I just saw it on TV and it seems pretty mild compared to some of today's movies.  I think Jon Voight's hustler character was just a bit much back then.  Also one of the earliest movies showing homosexuality."
"__MOVIES__ When I was watching Midnight Cowboy on TV, I was thinking Dustin Hoffman always seems to be the same age.  He played Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy and I swear he seems to be about the same age now though he must be near 80."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was so sad seeing his character die on the bus to Florida in that movie.  You were really rooting for him to make it."
"__MOVIES__ It's funny but there is a line in that movie I always think of when I am crossing a busy street and the cars won't stop.  Remember when Ratso hits the hood of the cab and says 'I'm walking here!'"
"__MOVIES__ LOL...Yes!  That's me too. I swear I think I have actually said that to drivers whizzing past me."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, I really wish they made more movies that were charcter studies like the old days.  Now it's just animated movies and superhero flicks."
"__MOVIES__ I have heard good things about the new Wonder Woman movie though.  It's directed by a woman too.  Her name is Patty Jenkins."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's progress at least.  Maybe I need to give these movies more of a chance.  The review say the movie delves into her transformation into Wonder Woman from her childhood."
"__MOVIES__ My daughter saw it and really liked it.  I think maybe having a female director makes a difference."
"__MOVIES__ I heard on TV that they had screenings of Wonder Woman just for females.  Not sure I agree with that."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess I can see from a marketing standpoint  But I can imagine how I would feel if there were men only screenings of"
