"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard much of anything good on the radio these days."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know what you mean. I usually listen the country station or the 'oldies' 80's/90's station."
"__MUSIC__ Oldies makes us sound too old!  I do love the sounds they play on there though. I heard some good Phil Collins and Bonnie Taylor the other day."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love Total Eclipse of the Heart!  That's one crazy video!"
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of videos, I used to love to watch MTV when I was a kid. Loved that Milli Vanilli video."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!  I'd also have a blank tape ready to record the radio. Boy how things have changed."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song of all time or favorite group?"
"__MUSIC__ Gotta be Aerosmith - mid 90's or even 80's.  I love Dream On."
"__MUSIC__ That has got to be one of the best songs of all time. I also really like Cryin' and Amazing.  Janie's got a gun is great too."
"__MUSIC__ I like to go back even further with Angel."
"__MUSIC__ What about country music?  Do you have a favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the older stuff - Chris LeDoux, Garth Brooks, Sawyer Brown."
"__MUSIC__ Those are great. I think one of my all time favorites of any music has got to be the great Simon & Garfunkle."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they are amazing!  I do love a lot of Paul Simon's solo songs too - especially Graceland."
"__MUSIC__ The Graceland album is one of the best albums of all time. So many good songs."
"__MUSIC__ And so original too. Ladysmith Black Mambazo was so good."
"__MUSIC__ How about CCR?  Do you like their stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Credence Clearwater Revival - for sure!  Who'll stop the rain?  Amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ I just don't feel like today's music doesn't have  the same soul - hey! I sound like a song myself!"
"__MUSIC__ I like that Old Time Rock & Roll!!!"
