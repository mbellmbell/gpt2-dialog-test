"__ROCK__ You ever listen to The Offspring?"
"__ROCK__ I haven't in a while, but they are awesome!"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I like to listen to them when I'm stressed."
"__ROCK__ I can understand that.  I've played their stuff while I'm driving and screaming at the top of my lungs."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, it just helps you get the energy out."
"__ROCK__ They've been around forever, huh?"
"__ROCK__ They've been around for a while.  I remember playing one of their cassettes in the nineties."
"__ROCK__ What tape was that?"
"__ROCK__ I don't remember the name, but the case had a picture of a little boy swinging."
"__ROCK__ Oh, I think I know the one you mean!"
