"__MUSIC__ I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ They're one of my favorite rock groups. Do you have a favorite album by them?"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely do it's called Stadium Arcadium. Best album of theirs in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ That's a double album isn't it? Came out a few years ago."

"__MUSIC__ I remember the Jupiter side being a little more mellow than Mars."
"__MUSIC__ That's right and John Frusciante had come back on guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Right where he's supposed to be. He was their best guitarist."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. Of course I also love Blood Sugar Sex Magick."
"__MUSIC__ That's a classic album. Give it away give it away give it away now!"
"__MUSIC__ That's my favorite from that album along with Under the Bridge"
"__MUSIC__ Everyone loves Under the Bridge. I liked their Californication album too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh right off top, Other Side is my favorite song on that album."
"__MUSIC__ Right it's so dark but lively at the same time, I love it."
"__MUSIC__ That guitar solo in the middle of the song...that was so classic Chili Peppers."
"__MUSIC__ I saw them in concert a few years ago in San Antonio."
"__MUSIC__ I bet that was an awesome experience."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I was pretty close. It was the Stadium tour so they sang those songs plus some classics."
"__MUSIC__ One of my other favorites from them is Breaking the Girl"
