"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you see Get Out yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, but it was kind of unexpected."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Jordan Peele directed it, and all I know from him is the Key and Peele stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, but what was unexpected about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I was expecting it to be a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't you read any of the reviews about it or watch the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I still expected it to be a comedy haha."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I can see why it caught you off guard then."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, yeah it did but, it was definitely a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it.  What was your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the whole reveal at the end.  I could really feel his pain when he realized what was happening."
"__MOVIES__ I know for a fact I wouldn't get hypnotized by that crazy lady."
"__MOVIES__ Right?  I guess he kind of got tricked into it though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he did. Thinking about Jordan Peele, I really can't believe how well he portrayed all of the emotions the characters were feeling."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was more on the actors, but I know what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, it was both of them."
"__MOVIES__ Does Peele have any more movies coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, if I hear of any, I'll let you know."
