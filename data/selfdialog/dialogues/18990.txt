"__MOVIES__ That was an awesome movie! So unexpectedly fresh, and funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Right? Yeah. And who'd have thought Jack Black could be funny without wearing spandex?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. And I really liked that British chap, too. He was also quite funny in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ Jude Law...yeah. Great casting choice to have him play someone in need of a nanny for his kids."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and I just loved the 'movie trailer maker' character. The one that couldn't cry..."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah.  Cameron Diaz.  She's really developed as an actress since her debut in 'The Mask'"
"__MOVIES__ Even the old guy next door was funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Eli Wallach. Did you know his work dates back to the spaghetti westerns...although he was eating Matzah balls in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who was the guy Careon Diaz punched?"
"__MOVIES__ Edward Burns in another winning role, as an adulterer without pants. Surely a shrewd career move to show his range as a serious actor."
"__MOVIES__ I would have rather seen 'Jim' from 'The Office' play that role. Now that would have been unexpected."
"__MOVIES__ I think you could be on to something..."
"__MOVIES__ And what was the name of the British lady...the one who got jilted by the sleazy writer?"
"__MOVIES__ Kate Winslet"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't she is that vampire movie"
"__MOVIES__ No, you are thinking of Kate Beckinsale. She was in the 'Underworld' series of movies."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that was Cate Blanchett?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Cate Blanchett was the Ice Queen in the Narnia series."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that was Tilda Swinton."
"__MOVIES__ It's a little know fact that Tilda Swinton IS in fact Cate Blanchett.  She created a second identity in attempts to get more auditions."
