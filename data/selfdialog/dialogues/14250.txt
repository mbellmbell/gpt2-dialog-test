"__HORROR__ What's your favorite horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ I'd have to say A Nightmare on Elm Street"
"__HORROR__ Oh yeah, that movie's great! Do you mean the first one?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, the original Wes Craven film. Although, I did like all of the movies in the series."
"__HORROR__ I didn't really like the second one as much as the rest, how about you?"
"__HORROR__ The second movie is definitely the worst in the series, but it's still fun to watch. I just like watching Freddy kill teenagers."
"__HORROR__ Did you know that in the first film, Glen was played by Johnny Depp, and it was his first movie role?"
"__HORROR__ Oh, totally! He also makes a cameo in the Freddy's Dead film, which I thought was awesome."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, that movie was fun. Did you see the 2010 remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street?"
"__HORROR__ No, I don't like the idea of anyone playing Freddy but Robert Englund."
