"__STAR_WARS__ I've recently noticed something about the Star Wars films."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It seems like they're releasing a new film each year towards the end of the year."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've noticed that too. It started in 2015 with The Force Awakens, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. Then in 2016 with Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's this years film again?"
"__STAR_WARS__ This year's film is going to be The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's it supposed to be about?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's supposed to revolve more around Luke and Leia, I believe."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that sounds pretty good so far."
