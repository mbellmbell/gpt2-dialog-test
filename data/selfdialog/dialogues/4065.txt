"__MUSIC__ Do you remember that band called Nightwish?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, i love that band. I stopped listening to them when their singer Tarja left though."
"__MUSIC__ I did too for awhile. I tried to get into the songs of their new singer after Tarja, but Christine could not reach the pitches Tarja did."
"__MUSIC__ My thoughts exactly. did you know the band fired Christine and replaced her with a new singer now?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh! I love the new singer, Floor is amazing. She sounds just like Tarja. She has some lungs to carry a tune."
"__MUSIC__ True. I see that Nightwish is actually selling out more concerts and tours these days with Floor as lead."
"__MUSIC__ They are coming to the States sometime next year, I plan to save up enough and buy tickets for myself and my boyfriend."
"__MUSIC__ I would love to go to a Nightwish concert. Has always been my dream sans Christine as lead singer."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. And I always wanted to see Tomas and Marco up on stage doing their thing. Marcos voice drives me insane. I love that guy!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, which reminds me...did they replace the drummer?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean Jukka?"
"__MUSIC__ That's him, I heard that he was leaving the band awhile back but never got to check out what happened."
"__MUSIC__ No he only left for one tour but he came back after. Someone named Hahto took over for him during that time. But it was only temporary. Hahto was a pretty good drummer just not as epic as Jukka."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard of Hahto then, he is originally from a band called Winter sun. Well, I'm glad Jukka is back and not gone permanently."
"__MUSIC__ That would make me a whole lot of sad if that were so."
"__MUSIC__ In any case, you know what I wish would happen?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you wish would happen?"
"__MUSIC__ I wish that Tarja and Floor would lead a Nightwish reunion and duet some of their songs together."
"__MUSIC__ Dream on, sister, dream on."
"__MUSIC__ I'll be happy with what Nightwish gives me."
