"__MOVIES__ Hey did you see the new Jurassic Park movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Jurassic World?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the one with Chris Pratt."
"__MOVIES__ No not yet, I've been kind of avoiding it so I don't ruin my childhood."
"__MOVIES__ It's not the best film but it certainly won't ruin your memories of the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad you say first movie as I did not like Lost World."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know you didn't and that's why I'm confident you'll at least enjoy Jurassic World."
"__MOVIES__ Does it try to play on our nostalgia by referencing past movies?"
"__MOVIES__ There are a few callbacks but nothing obnoxious or anything."
"__MOVIES__ What about the whole idea of them genetically engineering dinosaurs?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, how else are we going to get dinosaurs in this day and age?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but genetically creating some kind of super dinosaur seems a little lame."
"__MOVIES__ You just have to watch it and see for yourself, I genuinely had a great time with the film."
"__MOVIES__ Alright I'll check it out, but if I don't enjoy it you know who I'm messaging first."
"__MOVIES__ I'll be waiting patiently to shield your attacks."
"__MOVIES__ Are they making a sequel to Jurassic World?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe so, it did really well in theaters and Chris Pratt is hot right now."
"__MOVIES__ Well then if this stinks then I'll know to blame your financial contribution to the sequel."
"__MOVIES__ I'll be waiting patiently to shield that attack too."
"__MOVIES__ Alright then off to watch some dinosaurs."
