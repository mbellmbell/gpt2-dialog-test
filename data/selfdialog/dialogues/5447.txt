"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of this new line that Luke, in the next Star Wars, is over the whole Jedi thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it means he means to bring balance."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, is that not something to show he is going to become a bad guy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, the whole premise is a balance. Dark and light, Jedi, Sith, he wants it to be equal."
"__STAR_WARS__ Would that be equal, in the movie, killing off Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, according to Darth Plague, if one is gone maybe they both will be, that goes into a real grey area."
"__STAR_WARS__ There is no grey area with jedi, is there?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There is not supposed to be, but look at the way they loved post Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ The whole order went into hiding, you would think that would be grey."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was, hence them all dying awful deaths in the movies, well most."
