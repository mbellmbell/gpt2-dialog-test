"__DISNEY__ so what did you do last night?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh I just stayed in bed and watched Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ I love Aladdin! I haven't seen it in years."
"__DISNEY__ Yea it had been a little while for me too. It still holds up."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I'm sure. I remember I used to be able to quote all of the Genies lines."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yea I can imagine. There's so many good ones."
"__DISNEY__ I loved his cheerleader bit. 'If he can't do it, Great!'"
"__DISNEY__ I laughed really hard at that last night. I forgot how much I loved that bit."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, you know I'm going to have 'A whole new world' stuck in my head all day."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I'm right there with you. Its been in my head for the last four hours."
