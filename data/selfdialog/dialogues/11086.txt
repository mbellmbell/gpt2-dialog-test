"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, what do you think of the Raiders chances this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will definitely be a lot better and keep improving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think they will have enough to make a run at the championship?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they have all the pieces quite yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think with Derek Carr signed to a new deal we are really investing into the future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Carr is a stud, but do you think he is worth all of that money?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he got 5 years for $125 million, which is a lot, but he is a rising star."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes him the highest paid player in the league by average salary, lot of pressure on his shoulders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is for sure, but he's shown so far that he handles the pressure, brings a winning attitude, and he's a leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. I think he has it all to be able to lead the team to a ring, but like I said they need more pieces."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think adding Marshawn Lynch is huge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he is one of the greatest ever for sure, his age is a bit worrying though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he is getting old, but I think the one season break will have he refreshed and ready to go for this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he will need to take the pressure off of Carr a bit and score some touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this is exactly what the team needed and we can really start making a statement in the league now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the team is coming together quite nicely, got the quarterback, running back, and receivers. Now that offensive line and defense needs work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We made some great picks in the draft for the defense and as you said everything else is pretty solid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think if Carr keeps improving and making the team better then they will be a contender in no time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so. It's been a tough time being a Raider fan the last decade."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you. I just can't wait for the season to start!"
