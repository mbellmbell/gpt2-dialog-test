"__MUSIC__ I really can't deal with the radio these days."
"__MUSIC__ Why not? It's not too bad."
"__MUSIC__ It's just that so much of it is lacking strong melodies."
"__MUSIC__ Well to be fair, you are a jazz fan. You don't hear much jazz on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I like pop too! Would you consider Andrea Bocelli pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely not, my friend. He's kind of crossover though."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I just resonate with strong voices like June Christy or Dean Martin."
"__MUSIC__ June Christy was an absolute goddess."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. She is so underrated."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard her Gone For the Day album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I only have Something Cool and The Misty Miss Christy, both in mono."
"__MUSIC__ She has so many good albums in her discography."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. I should check them all out."
"__MUSIC__ And if you like June Christy, Blossom Dearie is essential."
"__MUSIC__ I do have a couple of her LPs. You know she used to perform in Paris?"
"__MUSIC__ I did. Her and Josephine Baker were huge in Paris."
"__MUSIC__ Josephine Baker is another one who had such an incredible voice."
"__MUSIC__ There will never be another one like her."
"__MUSIC__ Or another Billie Holiday or June."
"__MUSIC__ They really were a cut above."
