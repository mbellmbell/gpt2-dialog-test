"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen the new Star Wars: Rogue One ?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! It was really good!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was way better than i expected it to be."
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure. i like how it shows how everything started to fall once the Empire took control."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, cause in the originals they talk about how people died getting the plans to the Death Star but nothing else is said about them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, this gave you so much more and bridged the gap on what happened and how the Rebels were able to start really fighting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see how detailed the CGI was?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! it looked like it was really Grand Moff Tarkin really there and a young Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus that last scene with Darth Vader, that made it worth it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yes! He was the Darth Vader we needed, not being sensitive Anakin Skywalker. He was Darth Vader, and showed why he was so feared across the galaxy."
