"__STAR_WARS__ You know what was a good movie?  The Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, probably the best of the Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wouldn't argue that a bit.  Vader was just amazing in the second film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that force choke was taking people out left and right."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course Han and Leia were a good side story too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, like when she said that she loves him right before being sent into the carbonite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course his classic response, 'I know.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ One of the best parts of the franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course I'd be remiss if we didn't say that best line of the Franchise, and maybe of movie history."
"__STAR_WARS__ No!  I am your father."
