"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hogwarts must be a huge place."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course it's huge.  Look at how big the place is."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What I mean is that to house that many students, it must have a ton of beds."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Each house has it's own section not too mention all the hidden parts of the castle."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah,would have been cool to explore that place."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Probably really easy to get lost."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, you'd definitely need a map of some kind.  I would just sit in the hall the whole time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And probably eat all the food, right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, those banquets looked awesome."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Best buffet ever!"
