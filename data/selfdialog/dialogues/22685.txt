"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite Disney movie as a child?"
"__DISNEY__ The Fox and the Hound. Have you seen it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I'm not familiar with that one. What's it about?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it's a story of friendship between a fox and hound, but it has a very sad aspect to it."
"__DISNEY__ How so? What is sad about it?"
"__DISNEY__ The fox and the hound become friends when they are young, but when the hound grows up they are split apart."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that sounds fairly typical of Disney movies from that time period."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that is true. Lion King, Bambi, and all of the other movies at that time had some sad parts in the plots."
"__DISNEY__ I can't count how many times I watched Lion King, but I always looked away during the scene where Mufasa died."
"__DISNEY__ I can understand that. Tough for a kid to watch."
