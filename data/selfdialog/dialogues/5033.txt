"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How do you like Fast Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think it's a great movie series, if Harry Potter accompanied my childhood, I think Fast and Furious accompanied my teenagehood."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I kinda feel the same, well you kinda make us look old, haha"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ did I? that wasn't intentional, but which one was your favorite?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ you remember the one where the crew dragged a safe across the street of Rio?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ oh yeah, it was such a blast in that summer, I can still remember it vividly"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's crazy what they can do with cars, do you remember which car they used to drag the safe?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ that I'm not sure, it seemed to be a bullet proof super tough military SUV"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ indeed, I don't see myself buying one in the near future"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ me neither"
