"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What NFL team will have the best regular season record this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard not to go with the Patriots, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not so sure, this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, for one thing, I think the Dolphins might be a good team this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If their division gets more challenging, that will make it tougher for them to roll through the regular season, true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, at SOME point Tom Brady's age will catch up to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hasn't happened yet! The dude just won the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But eventually, it will happen. Maybe through injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eventually, you'll be right about Brady, but I wouldn't bet on it this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Seahawks have a really good chance to have the best record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm, I think they'll be good, but why do you say best record?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First of all, they have the best home field advantage in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, no better home field advantage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Second, I think their division is soft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're not a believer in the Cardinals?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sold on their QB situation, and I think both the Rams and the 49ers will be bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If all three teams are mediocre to bad, then Seattle should have a great record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's just how I see it falling out this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope it's not another Seattle/New England Super Bowl. I want some new talent!"
