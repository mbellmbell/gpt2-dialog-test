"__DISNEY__ I love watching Behind the Scenes for Disney films."
"__DISNEY__ I do too. It makes you really appreciate the time and dedication they put into their work."
"__DISNEY__ For sure. And some of the scenes they share are funny too."
"__DISNEY__ Are you talking about the classic Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Haha, yeah - with the 3D model of Mufasa's death."
"__DISNEY__ Oh my god, yeah! The voice acting was so serious but the animation was so stiff!"
"__DISNEY__ That's what made it hilarious! Scar's neck and arms were stretching across the cliff when he was threatening Mufasa."
"__DISNEY__ Right right! And then Mufasa's model just tumbled down into a river of still antelopes!"
"__DISNEY__ Then Simba's face was stuck making that 'ah' face!"
"__DISNEY__ Haha, that was too funny. Almost uncanny, really!"
