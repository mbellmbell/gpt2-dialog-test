"__MUSIC__ Are you a Beyonce fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I am! I don't know anybody who isn't a fan of Beyonce."
"__MUSIC__ It is exciting that she's having twins, but also a little sad."
"__MUSIC__ Why would that be sad?"
"__MUSIC__ I meant sad for her fans. She probably will have to take quite a bit of time to herself."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, but that's the price of motherhood."
"__MUSIC__ At least she has Jay-Z to help her."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not a fan of Jay-Z's music."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not a rap fan. I don't like hardly any rap at all."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I love rap! I love some of the collaborating things that Beyonce and Jay-Z have done together!"
"__MUSIC__ What have they done together?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, one of the first things they collaborated on was in 2002, called '03 Bonnie and Clyde, and the most recent is called Drunk in Love."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've heard either of those."
"__MUSIC__ What about the song Crazy in Love?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I've heard that one! That's a little older too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that came out in 1998. I think that's how they met."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's amazing."
"__MUSIC__ They have a great career together."
"__MUSIC__ A great family too."
