"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll have to think about that one for a minute. Who's yours?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's easy to say Luke Skywalker, since he's clearly the hero. But my favorite character is Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, he's so cute! I kind of have a hard time taking him seriously."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you kidding? He's a Jedi master!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, but he's so small and green."
"__STAR_WARS__ He can levitate things. He teaches Luke so much!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, I guess I see your point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you decide who your favorite character is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You're going to laugh. I really like Jobba the Hutt."
