"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you think actor who played Harry Potter looked like what you imagined Harry Potter to look like?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No he didn't to me. I grew to like him but he got kind of weird looking as he got older."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I thought so too. I liked Rupert Grint for Ron but he didn't look anything like Ron from the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he was supposed to have a long skinny nose and be very lanky. That kid was not that but he fit pretty well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What about the Weasley twins....not what I expected either."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, but it was okay. I think they were under utilized as characters in the movie and the books."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would have liked to see more of them too. They were great characters."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked that they were good natured pranksters. Who couldn't like them?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, I think they could caused more havoc when the deatheaters took over the school."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but remember they were gone by then. Doing the joke shop thing but they came back to join the fray when the time was right."
