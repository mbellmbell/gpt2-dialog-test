"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thoughts on the AFC West? Should be competitive this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. This should be a tough division this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of quality teams in this division, some seem to be on the precipice of being powerhouses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about powerhouses, but there are a few teams that should be really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We have to see how the additions from the draft and free agency impact the balance of power."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Chiefs a lot this year. I think the combination of the defense and efficiency are what puts them a shade above the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good point. Defense is becoming more rare in this league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, it just seems like the team is due. You look at their record over the past two years and see how underrated they are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but they always disappoint when the big game comes along."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Denver also has the defense, but seems like they are starting to slide."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. But a solid defense gives you the ability to hold things together until the offense can develop a rhythm. I'd have to look at their schedule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe Paxton Lynch shows some growth and they can surprise us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like they've shifted quite a few things around on offense that doesn't make it easy for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You want to talk about QB play, it's hard to ignore the Raiders with Carr."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to get a read on the Raiders, not sure if they just had a lot of luck and good bounces last year before Carr's injury or if that is legitimate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like Del Rio really put some fight in them and Carr just developed into a machine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders defense is the big question mark. They are actually on the right track for once and drafted pretty well but not sure how much defensive help they'll get right away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair. Plus we've yet to see whether or not Carr is 100% after the leg injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Signed that record-breaking big money contract, I don't think they'd put pen to paper if the leg wasn't healed. Then again it is the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha. Good point. Should be a battle in the west."
