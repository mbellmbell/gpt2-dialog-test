"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you familiar with how the NFL draft works?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've followed it some, sure. Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its something I've always been interested in. I don't always follow it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah sometimes I'm too busy to take much notice either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you have an understanding of how it works?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so, its not too difficult."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every spring the NFL drafts college football players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the process used?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are 7 rounds. Each club in each round takes their pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the easy part! Who picks first?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Playoff teams are ranked on the furthest round of playoff levels reached, plus their season record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See I didn't know that. What then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The order for non-playoff teams is driven by the season record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, I've got it.  You would think the Super Bowl winners had earned first draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No they actually pick last in each round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not much of a payoff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, right after the worst performing team has their pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The draftees, they can be pretty young then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least three years out of high school!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a bad career for kids with the right skills."
