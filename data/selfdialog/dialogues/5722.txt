"__STAR_WARS__ You'll never guess how much Harrison Ford got paid to be in Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll guess something small, like $100,000."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're so wrong.  Think lower?"
"__STAR_WARS__ $50,000?  It couldn't have been much worse."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was $10,000 and received no royalties?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?  That's total madness."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he only $1,000 a week for filming and did it for ten weeks."
"__STAR_WARS__ He got totally ripped off."
"__STAR_WARS__ He made up for it with the other movies and got millions for them though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd be bitter that I got stiffed so much the first time!"
