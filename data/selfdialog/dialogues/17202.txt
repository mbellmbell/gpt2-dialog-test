"__MOVIES__ Did you see the Weiner documentary?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I have. Tell me about it."
"__MOVIES__ It is about Anthony Weiner, the former Congressman from New York."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is he Human Abedin's husband?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep! Although I think they have since gotten divorced."
"__MOVIES__ I think you are right. How was the documentary?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really, really good. It was filmed during his campaign for mayor of NYC."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I remember that! It ended pretty badly, didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he didn't do well in the election at all. The documentary ends on election night."
"__MOVIES__ I will definitely have to see if its on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. Did you see Jackie last year?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I love Jackie Kennedy and I loved the movie."
"__MOVIES__ So did I. Natalie Portman was great."
"__MOVIES__ She really was. It is scary how similar they look."
"__MOVIES__ There were so many good movies last year. I feel like Jackie didn't get the credit it deserved."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Who else was in Jackie?"
"__MOVIES__ Peter Sarsgaard and Greta Gerwig were also in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's right. Did Peter Sarsgaard play Robert Kennedy?"
