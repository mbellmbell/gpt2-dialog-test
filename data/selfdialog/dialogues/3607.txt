"__MUSIC__ I need your help."
"__MUSIC__ What's up?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to figure out what the best cover song is."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's a lot of cover songs out there, some of them are great, but some of them suck."
"__MUSIC__ I think there's more that suck than not, but what are your thoughts on it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I agree that a lot suck, but sometimes the new artist completely takes over the song and makes it their own."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I see what you're getting at."
"__MUSIC__ Like Hurt, for example.  Nine Inch Nails' version is awesome, but I think I prefer Johnny Cash's version."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't Trent Reznor even say he liked Johnny Cash versions better too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think so.  It's so good."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have any other examples?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think the greatest cover song is Respect by Aretha Franklin."
"__MUSIC__ That was a cover?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! I found out a few weeks ago. Otis Redding sang it first."
"__MUSIC__ Man I never knew that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, even Otis Redding said it's her song now."
"__MUSIC__ That must've meant a lot to her."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure it did, I doubt half of the people in the world know it's a cover.  You should look into more of them."
"__MUSIC__ I sure didn't.  I'll definitely look into more of them."
