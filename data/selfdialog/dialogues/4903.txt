"__MUSIC__ Do you like Mariah Carey?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. She does have a good voice though."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you like her?"
"__MUSIC__ I meant I don't like her music."
"__MUSIC__ She makes great music! Mariah Carey is iconic."
"__MUSIC__ I disagree. I would say Madonna or Michael Jackson are iconic."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they might be iconic but they cannot sing as good as Mariah."
"__MUSIC__ I will agree with you on that. Does Mariah Carey even still make music?"
"__MUSIC__ I am not sure. I think she does."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the last thing I remember about her was that disastrous performance that she did on New Year's Eve."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you're talking about. That was horrible to watch."
"__MUSIC__ It seemed like she forgot the words to her own song."
"__MUSIC__ Possibly. However, she is still one of my favorite artists."
"__MUSIC__ I know! You talk about her all the time."
"__MUSIC__ I do not. Well, maybe I talk about her a little bit."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, how do you feel about Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ She is too generic or me but I know you're a fan."
"__MUSIC__ I am her biggest fan! I am going to see her in concert next week."
"__MUSIC__ Really? With who?"
"__MUSIC__ My sister. It is going to be a surprise."
