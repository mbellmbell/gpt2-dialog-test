"__BASKETBALL__ Did you watch the Celtics-Cavs the other night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I don't watch the NBA; I prefer collegiate."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you at least hear about it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I saw a lot of people from Cleveland posting about it on Facebook."
"__BASKETBALL__ Holy crap, right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, seriously, losing by nearly 50 in the playoffs. Horrid."
"__BASKETBALL__ I've never heard of such an epic loss"
"__BASKETBALL__ I kind of want them to be punished for it, it was that bad."
"__BASKETBALL__ How so?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Like, they should forfeit the entire series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Come on, you know they'll come back to win at least one more."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I don't. You lose by 50, you're done, and should be out of the playoffs for years."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't follow."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, in European soccer leagues, if you don't perform at a certain level over time, you're demoted."
"__BASKETBALL__ So, what would you suggest?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They shouldn't be allowed to play in the playoffs next year unless they win the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's cruel."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's also realistic. They're being paid tens of millions to get humiliated."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're a bit harsh."
"__BASKETBALL__ No...and they lost at home. By nearly 50. In the conference finals."
