"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I think of it as profit sharing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the movies are made by a bunch of staff also. What about them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They get paid upfront, at least, as far as I know."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they should also get paid a share of the profits as the revenue grows."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's not how their guild is organized, I don't think. Besides, a lot of them are happy with the arrangements"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're stupid. What their union, or guild, or whatever need to negotiate a mandatory percent profit sharing with the movie makers."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's not a movie maker who will agree with that i don't think. let alone the 'George Lucas' Though he's made ton of money off Star Wars. Total over all the films in the series they made over 7.5 billion and it's growing everyday"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a ridiculous amount of money off just one series, rehashing the same story over and over."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh no you didn't. The series is an epic retelling of good vs evil, not merely rehashing of the same story."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but the motifs are the same in all the trilogies. The original was good guy revealed, bad guy loses, bad guy strikes back, and good guy wins. That's the same way with the prequels, sequels and the anthology. It's just the same thing over and over. 16 films total about the same thing."
