"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new live action Beauty and the Beast movie yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't, have you?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but I'm dying to go."
"__DISNEY__ Me too.  I think they did such a good job picking Emma Watson to portray Belle."
"__DISNEY__ I agree.  She really looked the part from the advertisements."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder how they did Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, but I bet it required a lot of make up and CGI."
"__DISNEY__ Speaking of CGI, I heard the servants are great also."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I can't wait to see the 'Be Our Guest' scene."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think they have the original songs?"
