"__HORROR__ I saw the scariest movie ever last night!"
"__HORROR__ What did you watch?"
"__HORROR__ The original Halloween."

"__HORROR__ I like him too. What's your favorite movie of his?"
"__HORROR__ I like Escape from L.A.a lot."
"__HORROR__ That one is pretty good, not very scary though. What's your favorite scary movie by John Carpenter?"
"__HORROR__ Probably, Vampires then."
"__HORROR__ I liked that one too. Its great when vampires are actually scary and they aren't sparkling teenagers."
"__HORROR__ I couldn't agree more!"
