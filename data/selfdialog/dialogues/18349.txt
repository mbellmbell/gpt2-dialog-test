"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen any movies adapted from Jane Austen books?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have seen several."
"__MOVIES__ They are some of my favorite movies.  I really like Sense and Sensibility, starring Emma Thompson."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is a really good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Emma Thompson wrote the screen adaptation, and she won an Oscar for it."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed watching her play Elinor.  Kate Winslet was good too."
"__MOVIES__ I think playing Marianne Dashwood was one of Kate Winslet's first major roles.  She did an excellent job."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't a big fan of Hugh Grant as Edward, but Alan Rickman made an excellent Colonel Brandon."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think Edward was a bit miscast.  But Alan Rickman was and excellent choice, and he and Kate Winslet played off of each other very well."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that the actor who played John Willoughby is actually married to Emma Thompson?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they met on set.  He first briefly dated Kate Winslet, but then eventually ended up marrying Emma Thompson, and they are still married today."
"__MOVIES__ That is fascinating.  His character was such a jerk."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the way Willoughby treated Marianne was horrible.  He broke her heart."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but Colonel Brandon was there to put it back together.  I really liked the end scene where Brandon and Marianne get married."
"__MOVIES__ That was a beautiful scene.  If you look closely, I think Edward and Elinor get married too; they walk out behind Brandon and Marianne."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes.  I think I saw that."
"__MOVIES__ I also really love the scene where Brandon finds Marianne in the rain and carries her home."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is one of the most dramatic parts of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ You aren't sure if she will survive her illness, but she does and then goes on to marry Brandon.  It was so romantic."
