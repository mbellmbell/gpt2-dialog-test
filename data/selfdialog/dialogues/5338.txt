"__STAR_WARS__ How much do you think luke skywalker will be in the new star wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope a lot. I love seeing the original characters back."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was looking pretty rough and old."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder how much that is the character choice and how much is due to mark hamil not aging well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably a mix. But it makes sense for the character to look haggard."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose it would make sense. Do you think the last jedi refers to rae or him being the last?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have been pondering the same question. It really could be either of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am looking forward to finding out. I also wonder what they will do about carrie fischer."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya her passing away was so sad. Too young for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes too young, the world still needed princess lea but at least we had her at all. No other actress would have done it so well."
