"__HARRY_POTTER__ My favorite part about the first Harry Potter movie is when he is learning about magic!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, me too. Especially when he learns about Diagon Alley!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Picking a wand and a pet must be soooo exciting !"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would go straight to Ollivanders !"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would be a little scared to see what wand chooses me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wouldn't, I'd be so anxious and ready."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you think you'd get a pet ?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think so, probably an owl and you?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't think I would. Maybe a cat."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The owls are beautiful though."
