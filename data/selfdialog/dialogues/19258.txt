"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Doubt?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It stars Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis."
"__MOVIES__ Wow what a great cast. I still can't remember though. What happens?"
"__MOVIES__ It stars Meryl Streep and Amy Adams as nuns. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a new priest Father Flynn."
"__MOVIES__ I think I may have seen that. Desn't Meryl Streep not like Father Flynn because she thinks he is too nice?"
"__MOVIES__ Ya then she thinks he possibly sexually assualted one of the boys, but you never find out if that is true or not."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that's right. I remember thinking he hadn't done anything wrong, and Meryll Streep just didn't like how liberal he was compared to her."
"__MOVIES__ I think you are probably right. I kind of thought the same thing."
"__MOVIES__ Ya like when she mentioned his finger nails not being cut enough"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and how he was talking about laughing with the boys."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that movie supposed to have been set a long time ago?"
"__MOVIES__ Not that long ago I want to say like in the sixties."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, maybe I will have to watch that one again to remember."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite part is the end dialogue where Meryl Streep says she has doubt."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I remember that part!"
"__MOVIES__ Ya and then there is also another part I didn't realize at first but the boy is the first black student accepted."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's interesting, so I wonder if Meryl Streep didn't like that either?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm.. I'm not sure I don't remember it really being mentioned."
"__MOVIES__ It could have been there though."
