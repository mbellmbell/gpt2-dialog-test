"__FASHION__ So now that I'm a little heavier, where should I shop for fashion?"
"__FASHION__ Lane Bryant created the first modern maternity dresses, and her company's ads were the first to mention pregnancy. What a scandal!"
"__FASHION__ But isn't her stuff kind of matronly?"
"__FASHION__ Not really. But try Torrid if you want sexy things in Plus Sizes."
"__FASHION__ Well, no, I don't really want sexy, exactly. Just some interesting clothes."
"__FASHION__ Try Modcloth then. They use real women in their ads, and carry a full size range of vintage and indie clothing."
"__FASHION__ But aren't they part of WalMart now?"
"__FASHION__ They're an independent part of of a subsidiary. But if you like cute clothes, you won't care."
"__FASHION__ I dont want to shop online, though, I want to try things on in the store. And I dont want to overspend."
"__FASHION__ You might like Forever 21, then. Although it's mostly young looks, they do carry a full range of sizes."
"__FASHION__ Their prices are pretty good? Money's tight."
"__FASHION__ Very good, sometimes. But you know, it's fast fashion, not the classics."
"__FASHION__ Sounds good. Have you got more stores like that?"
"__FASHION__ There's Topshop. They're actually an English brand, but they sell over here too."
"__FASHION__ And they have my size?"
"__FASHION__ Yes. And looks you won't find anywhere else."
"__FASHION__ Well, thanks for your help. Shopping can be depressing when you're overweight."
"__FASHION__ Are you kidding? You look fine."
"__FASHION__ Then why can't I find fashion I like?"
"__FASHION__ Sweetie, the average woman is a plus size. They do make clothes for us--they have to."
