"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win the NFC East this upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Cowboys will repeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott and Ezekial Elliot will only get better in the second year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Philadelphia will surprise."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the defense stinks you'll see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys will go deep into the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this will be a back to reality year for Dak Prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he looked like the real last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carson Wentz will come on this year the Eagles have upgrades in many positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They may do a little better but I still think they do not lead the East."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The wide receivers should be much better this year and I think the defense will improve some."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The cowboys have the new trio Dak, Ezekial, and Dez."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always thought Dez Bryant was over rated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a good receiver who opens up the field."
