"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, you ready for the NFL to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, I got a feeling my Raiders are gonna go all the way!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ LOL what makes you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ David Carr is the truth!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure signed a deal like he was the truth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah isn't he the highest paid player in the NFL right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. About 25 million a year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you have a good quarterback like that, you have to lock him up though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, even if you land a decent quarterback, you have to lock him up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right about that, kind of like Andy Dalton in Cinci."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly like Dalton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the biggest curse an NFL team could have.  Landing a 'decent' NFL quarterback. Because you still have to pay him big bucks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and once you pay him the big bucks, there's no money left for support players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at the Seahawks, they were great when Russell was new and only getting like 500k a year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, because they were able to spend money elsewhere, on support players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's hard to keep a good roster together when you're paying one player a ton of money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but the Raiders will still be really good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll agree with you on that, they still have a good line and a decent defense, but they're paying a few players too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marshawn joining them is gonna be huge for this year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, after that though they'll probably gonna fall apart as they lose key players to free agency from not being able to pay them."
