"__MUSIC__ At this point, we've all heard 'Shape of You' a thousand times, but what do you think of the rest of Ed Sheeran's album?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I love Ed Sheeran best on his slow, romantic songs, but I think 'Shape of You' is a new creative direction."
"__MUSIC__ He can really be quite the story teller, no?"
"__MUSIC__ For sure! Like 'Castle on the Hill' on this album."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song. It's so nostalgic. What other songs do you like from 'Divide'?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Galway Girl' is a really sweet song. It's cool he put it some Irish music elements."
"__MUSIC__ Ed Sheeren is British, right? Not Irish?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep! He's from Yorkshire."
"__MUSIC__ I read that he has 7 stadium concerts in Ireland in 2018, though!"
"__MUSIC__ Woah, I didn't know that! He must be very popular in Ireland, then."
"__MUSIC__ I think he's popular all over the world!"
"__MUSIC__ How old is Ed Sheeran? I'd say at least 30 by the sound of his music."
"__MUSIC__ He's actually pretty young! Only 26."
"__MUSIC__ Only 26? But didn't his first album come out in 2011?"
"__MUSIC__ So he must have been 20 when that came out."
"__MUSIC__ That's insane. I would have pegged that CD for a singer of 30 as well!"
"__MUSIC__ That's the album with 'Kiss Me,' right? I'm still obsessed with that song."
"__MUSIC__ It is! I got hooked on him with 'The A Team.'"
"__MUSIC__ Another great song. He's got so much talent."
"__MUSIC__ For the club and starry nights, we've got Ed Sheeran."
