"__DISNEY__ My kids are making me watch Moana over and over!!"
"__DISNEY__ I know, mine too!"
"__DISNEY__ Mine love it more than Frozen!"
"__DISNEY__ Mine too!  Especially that song 'You're welcome'.  They now sing it to each other instead of saying it!"
"__DISNEY__ That's so cute!"
"__DISNEY__ It would be, if I wasn't sick of the song!  There could be worse things though.  I really do like Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! I love it when she finally returns the heart."
"__DISNEY__ That's my favorite scene!"
"__DISNEY__ Mine too!! And when she turns back into Te Fiti she is so beautiful!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes she is. The colors are so vibrant in that movie!"
