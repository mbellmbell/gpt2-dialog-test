"__DISNEY__ Did you like the remake of Disney's The Jungle Book?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean the new live action version?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's the one I'm talking about."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't like it as much as the original."
"__DISNEY__ Why didn't you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ The music wasn't nearly as good as in the first one."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I mean, maybe you're right. There was like only two songs afterall."
"__DISNEY__ Right. Also the giant monkey freaked me out in the newer version! So Scary!"
"__DISNEY__ Hahaha. That's funny because I thought the same thing."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah his temple was really scary."
