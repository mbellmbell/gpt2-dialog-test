"__MOVIES__ No, tell me about it."
"__MOVIES__ Buddy 'Aces' Israel is a mobbed up Las Vegas magician, who screwed up and it trying to turn state's evidence to save his skin."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't think the mob would like that."
"__MOVIES__ No, they don't, as the is seems the top boss of the Syndicate, Primo Sparazza,  has hired a killer known only as the Swede, to bring him ' Israel's heart'"
"__MOVIES__ Ouch, sound bad for Buddy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and to make matters worse, one Primo Sparazza's underbosses puts the word out on the contract, and other assassin's join the fray."
"__MOVIES__ Really, who do we have?"
"__MOVIES__ First, we have Lazlo Soot, a master of disguise and impersonation."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you else."
"__MOVIES__ The, we have the Tremor brothers, a trio of psychotic neo-Nazi speed freaks with a taste for excessive scorched earth tactics."
"__MOVIES__ Scorched earth tactics?"
"__MOVIES__ Think over the top firepower, explosions, and one using a chainsaw as a melee weapon."
"__MOVIES__ Ouch!. Anymore hitman that stand out"
"__MOVIES__ Pasquale Acosta, know as the Plague, a torturer and mercenary that once chewed off his own fingertips to avoid indentification."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so a cabal of freaks and psychos looking for a payday come after Buddy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, plus bounty hunter hired by Buddy's bail bondsman for skipping town and FBi agents looking to protect Buddy so he can testify."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds, like a pretty crazy film."
