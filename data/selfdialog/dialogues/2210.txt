"__MUSIC__ So, who do you think is the King of Rock and Roll?"
"__MUSIC__ That's easy Elvis Presley."
"__MUSIC__ Some people think it is Chuck Berry."
"__MUSIC__ Well, some people think it is Little Richard too but if you want my opinion it was Elvis."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think Elvis? He is not the first to be associated with rock and roll."
"__MUSIC__ The looks, the hair, the moves, the sneer and not to mention the voice."
"__MUSIC__ But, Chuck Berry had the best moves and a great voice."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if we are going there Little Richard had some great hair and pretty cool moves."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, of the three pick one of their songs that is really rock and roll."
"__MUSIC__ How about Elvis's 'Jailhouse Rock', it even has the word rock in it."
"__MUSIC__ I thought you was going to say 'All Shook Up', how about Little Richard."
"__MUSIC__ It's gotta be 'Slipin and Slidin' for Little Richard."
"__MUSIC__ I like that one so how about Chuck Berry? What song would you pick for him?"
"__MUSIC__ I am going to say 'Johnnie B, Goode'."
"__MUSIC__ I like that one but I also like 'Maybellene' or maybe 'Sweet Little Sixteen'."
"__MUSIC__ I think it really depends on which singer you like the best."
"__MUSIC__ I like Elvis and Little Richard but Chuck is definitely the king."
"__MUSIC__ I like all three of them too, but I think it is a matter of opinion and I pick Elvis."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess we are going to have to agree to disagree."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, to each his own."
