"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Romo had a nice game against the bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it. How badly do you have to suck to make Cutler look good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do they pick these quarterbacks to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cutler and Romo both should be on a stranded island somewhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rodgers can be cast off as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady is not too far down on that list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sanchez is starting soon. I think he can turn the team around"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could be, but I've learned not to hold my breath after Roethlisberger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really thought Ben was that bad?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wasn't awful, but definitely not worth writing home about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess that's true. I don't see Roethlisberger getting them any closer to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For some reason he remind me of Vick, classic Vick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that. He was better as a rookie, but not too consistent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but teams would kill for his trade."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Newton stood out more to me than Roethlisberger ever did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but Cam had much better coaching."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Roethlisberger had his best coaching in college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, if he got drafted I can see him excelling past Brady."
