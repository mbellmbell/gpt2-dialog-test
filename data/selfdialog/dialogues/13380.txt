"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the Minnesota Vikings?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are a decent team. Not great but decent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They lost Teddy Bridgewater to that nasty injury. No one knows if he will play again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was a bad situation, they do have Sam Bradford."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bradford didn't do too bad last year given he didn't have an offseason to prepare."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adrian Peterson is also gone, which is a bummer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did get Latavius Murray in Free Agency so they should be fine. AP was old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also drafted Dalvin Cook, so I agree their RB's will be just fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have a great defense, that secondary has become very solid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Harrison Smith may be the best safety in the game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, and Xavier Rhodes is becoming a shut down corner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What you think their record will be this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am thinking 9-7"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Playoffs or no playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wildcard playoff spot by the tip of their tongue. First round elimination"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you think will win that divison?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Packers are still the team to beat while Aaron Rodgers is the QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that also, Bears, and Lions are still rebuilding."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lions yes, I have no idea what the Bears are doing."
