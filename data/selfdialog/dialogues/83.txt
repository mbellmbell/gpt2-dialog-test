"__MUSIC__ Louis Tomlinson is releasing a new single apparently."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that. Are you excited about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of. But I also wish One Direction would just get back together so it's bittersweet."
"__MUSIC__ I wish they would too! Boy band music is my guilty pleasure!"
"__MUSIC__ I love boy bands!"
"__MUSIC__ Now that One Direction is gone, though, it seems like there's no band left to fill that void."
"__MUSIC__ I wish we were still back in the boy band glory days of *NSYNC, the Backstreet Boys, and 98 Degrees."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Who was your favorite out of those three?"
"__MUSIC__ I know most people choose *NSYNC, but I definitely loved the Backstreet Boys most."
"__MUSIC__ I have to go with *NSYNC if only for Justin Timberlake."
"__MUSIC__ That's fair enough. Do you think One Direction will ever get back together?"
"__MUSIC__ I could imagine them maybe doing some sort of reunion tour someday."
"__MUSIC__ I guess if the Spice Girls were able to accomplish that, then anything is possible!"
"__MUSIC__ I forgot about the Spice Girls! They were iconic."
"__MUSIC__ Totally. I know girly pop music doesn't get a lot of respect, but personally I think some of the most iconic music of the new millennium has resulted from it."
"__MUSIC__ You know, someone actually once said to me that The Beatles were technically the first official boy band. So really, there should be more respect!"
"__MUSIC__ That's so funny, I never thought of it like that but I guess that's true."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, teenage girls went just as crazy over The Beatles as they have over *NSYNC and One Direction."
"__MUSIC__ I think the Beatles were still uniquely talented but there's no question that modern boy bands know how to make some catchy tunes."
"__MUSIC__ I agree completely"
