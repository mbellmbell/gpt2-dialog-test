"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hey, did you see the latest one, Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, I hated Charlize Theron's character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What about Dom, did you really think he went bad again?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, not for a minute. I was like, he doesn't have a choice!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't get what Dom trusted Jason Statham's character with that though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, didn't he kill Dom's Asian friend?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That scene in Cuba was awesome, man. When the car was about to explode?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, there was flame coming through the window and Dom was just like, 'Almost there!' Haha."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The submarine! Tyrese Gibson knocking that guy out with the car door!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, for once he's not just the comedic relief. He was like, 'How am I number 11 on the top ten most wanted list?'"
