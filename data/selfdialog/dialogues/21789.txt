"__DISNEY__ Which Beauty and the Beast movie do you prefer?  The cartoon from 1991, or the new live action film that came out this year?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I haven't seen the new movie, so I guess, the cartoon?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, man.  You have to see the new movie.  Belle is played by one of my favorite actresses, Emma Watson."
"__DISNEY__ You're right.  I do have to see it then, but I don't know if I like how they used the CGI to make the Beast appear."
"__DISNEY__ What don't you like about it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, He looks much smaller than in the animated movie. The old Beast had broad shoulders and looked ferocious.  This one is much slimmer."
"__DISNEY__ You get used to it I suppose."
"__DISNEY__ Who plays Gaston in the 2017 movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Some actor named, Luke Evans.  He is pretty good in the film."
"__DISNEY__ I may watch it just for the scene where Gaston storms Beasts' castle with the townspeople; to see if the newer technology adds something to that scene I remember as a child."
