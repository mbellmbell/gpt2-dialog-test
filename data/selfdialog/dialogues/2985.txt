"__MUSIC__ Are you excited about the concert tonight?"
"__MUSIC__ You know it, playa!"
"__MUSIC__ That's not how you typically talk. Anyway, what time should we pick you up?"
"__MUSIC__ We have to be at the ticket window at 6:45, so 6:15 sounds good."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't you excited?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! I've never seen Beethoven 9 live before."
"__MUSIC__ Who are the four soloists?"
"__MUSIC__ They're voice professors at our school."
"__MUSIC__ That must be awkward--aren't there more than one per part?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, we have two tenor and two soprano professors, but just one bass and alto."
"__MUSIC__ Was there any in-fighting over who got the part?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, they're crazy jealous at each other. The side-eye I see every day is hysterical."
"__MUSIC__ Have you been to this concert hall before?"
"__MUSIC__ No, how are the acoustics?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. They were already great, but then there was $2 million in renovations over the summer."
"__MUSIC__ It better be spectacular."
"__MUSIC__ Just so you know, bring your ID. There are drinks in the lobby."
"__MUSIC__ I can listen to a live concert completely plastered?"
"__MUSIC__ Don't get drunk."
"__MUSIC__ I won't, but I can't wait to hear the music swirling around while tipsy."
