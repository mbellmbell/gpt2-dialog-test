"__POP__ I just saw a movie on an old pop music star who was living off fame he gathered in his youth."
"__POP__ Oh, yeah! The movie with Drew Barrymore..."
"__POP__ And Hugh Grant!"
"__POP__ That's right!"
"__POP__ But doesn't that always happen? Some group, like the Boyz II Men, gets famous on teeny bopper music, and then make a career out of being former teen idols?"
"__POP__ Yeah. I was a former teen idol."
"__POP__ You were? No way!"
"__POP__ Well maybe not me personally, but I had a few teen girls fall in love with me because my first name is Barry..."
"__POP__ I don't get it. In the movies, the guy named 'Barry' is always the weirdo..."
"__POP__ Yeah, but when I was young, there was this Pop music star named Barry Manilow, who the girls couldn't resist. I even had one girl aks to marrty me so that she could say she was 'Mrs. Barry...'"
