"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that movie Moonlight that won best picture?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think I should rent it?"
"__MOVIES__ If you want to see it, I would wait until it's on HBO or something."
"__MOVIES__ Why? I heard it was supposed to be really good."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that too. Maybe that's why I was disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ What disappointed you?"
"__MOVIES__ It just felt like not very much happened. It was kind of weak on plot."
"__MOVIES__ From what I know of the plot, it sounds pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know how to describe it. It's like most things happened off-screen."
"__MOVIES__ Example?"
"__MOVIES__ One of the main characters dies, but you only find out when someone makes a brief reference to it."
"__MOVIES__ That's not necessarily bad."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. It could work, but it just felt like every scene was in slow motion."
"__MOVIES__ I tend to like movies like that."
"__MOVIES__ You might like it then."
"__MOVIES__ Were the characters good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they were, but sometimes they weren't really fleshed out."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard so many things about it that I think I'm going to rent it, but I get what you're saying."
"__MOVIES__ I hope you enjoy it."
