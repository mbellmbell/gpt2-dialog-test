"__MUSIC__ What was the greatest musical decade in the past 100 years, would you say?"
"__MUSIC__ Gotta go with the 60s, I think."
"__MUSIC__ That's definitely the traditional answer."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I think that's true for good reason. SO much good music made in the 60s."
"__MUSIC__ It was definitely an influential era for music."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, peak production for the Beatles alone would make it one of the greatest decades of music of all time."
"__MUSIC__ I do think the narrative gets pushed a little bit by the Baby Boomer thing."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by 'Baby Boomer' thing?"
"__MUSIC__ That the Baby Boomer generation has dominated media and pretty much all avenues of US life for the past 40 years or so."
"__MUSIC__ And?"
"__MUSIC__ That the music of the 60s is what the Boomers grew up on."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I think I see where you're going."
"__MUSIC__ So of course they love the music of their teens and early 20s, so they rate it the highest."
"__MUSIC__ And kind of mythologize the whole era into something greater than it actually was."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it's possible that something like that has been going on."
"__MUSIC__ I can sort of see where you're coming from, but at the same time, there really was some great music from that decade."
"__MUSIC__ No question."
"__MUSIC__ Jimi Hendricks, Janice Joplin, the Rolling Stones, The Who, the Doors, and did I mention the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I think you might have!"
"__MUSIC__ Point being, it might be somewhat overhyped, but it was also a fantastic decade of music."
