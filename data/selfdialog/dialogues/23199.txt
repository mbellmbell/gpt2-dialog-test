"__DISNEY__ I just heard that a new Descendants thing is coming out."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, I didn't really see too much of the first one, but parts of it sounded pretty good."
"__DISNEY__ It just doesn't make sense to me. How are the villains still alive? Who did they have children with? Why have them at all if they're going to treat them like that?"
"__DISNEY__ Look at House of Mouse, that's just one giant crossover that throws all the rules out of the window. Disney just does what it wants."
"__DISNEY__ I know, it's like canon continuity doesn't exist. It's kind of annoying."
"__DISNEY__ Sometimes, you just have to go with it. It's just a show."
"__DISNEY__ It's not just a show, it's not just even one show! How is everything supposed to make sense if they can't keep the timeline straight?"
"__DISNEY__ Relax, will ya? Let's just ignore it. Think of it as an alternate reality. A reality where children of heroes and villains somehow go to the same school and sing a lot."
"__DISNEY__ It's still ridiculous."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed."
