"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a football fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am. I follow pro, but not college. I can't keep up with college...there are too many teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm the same way. Who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ow! They are our number one rival!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Arizona Cardinals. I've been a fan since they moved from St. Louis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, we kinda have love hate relationship...but I thought your rival was Seahawks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah...maybe. I can't stand the Seahawks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Russell Wilson is good though. Isn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he is over-rated, honestly. Same as Arron Rogers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they do win a lot of games though..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know who's good? The new QB for the Vikings!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah...I can't think of his name...he's good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a good season though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I would love to see them beat the packers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha! Cheeseheads hates that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My husband is from St. Paul, so we root for Minnesota against Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be an interesting season, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm keeping eyes on the Raiders, too..."
