"__MOVIES__ Did you see Hidden Figures yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I really wanted to though.  Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it.  I had no idea that African American women worked for NASA back then."
"__MOVIES__ I like Octavia Spencer a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's really good.  I can never see her in anything though without thinking of that movie The Help."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know especially that part where she feeds that woman the pie!"
"__MOVIES__ That part was hilarious. Speaking of The Help did you see Emma Stone in La La Land."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that yet but I'm dying to."
"__MOVIES__ That director really is going places."
"__MOVIES__ Who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ Damien Chazelle.  He also directed Whiplash so he must really have a thing for music."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Whiplash!  I never have played in a band or anything but something about that movie kept me tense the entire time."
"__MOVIES__ J.K. Simmons completely took that role and owned it.  Man he was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I know!  On one hand you hated him and on the other you kind of understood what he was doing."
"__MOVIES__ Miles Teller did a great job as well."
"__MOVIES__ I thought he was really good in Bleed for This but I'm not sure that many people saw that one."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see it.  What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a boxer that was in a car crash and was told he probably wouldn't even walk again came back and won the title."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a good one.  Sometimes though these inspirational sports movies are kind of done to death."
"__MOVIES__ This one is a true story though."
