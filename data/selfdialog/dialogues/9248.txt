"__BASEBALL__ Who do you think is the best team in baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Astros."
"__BASEBALL__ Really?  What about the Yankees?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Astros beat them 3 out of 4 last weekend.  They were dominant."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, they are pretty good.  What is their weakness?"
"__BASEBALL__ They are more than pretty good, they are very good.  I think they probably need one more quality staring pitcher."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they will get one?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think they will make a trade for one by the trade deadline."
"__BASEBALL__ When is that?"
"__BASEBALL__ The deadline is mid-July."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they will make it to the World Series?"
"__BASEBALL__ For sure.  They have the best record right now and are very good."
"__BASEBALL__ How many games do you think they will win."
"__BASEBALL__ I would say 97 or 98."
"__BASEBALL__ You don't think the Rangers can catch them?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Rangers are ok, but they have their own problems."

"__BASEBALL__ This is a different Astros team.  A better blend of young stars and seasoned veterans."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope you are right.  Who do you think they will play in the World Series?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Cubs will bounce back after their slow start.  It could be an interesting Cubs-Astros series."
