"__MUSIC__ Do you like the Lumineers?"
"__MUSIC__ The Lumineers...what do they sing?"
"__MUSIC__ Cleopatra, Ophelia..oh and Ho Hey"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! I remember them! They're okay."
"__MUSIC__ I feel the same. I mean, I really like the sound. But honestly..I'm hesitant to like them because they're too popular."
"__MUSIC__ Too popular? Come on. Seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I know it's stupid."
"__MUSIC__ You obviously like their sound, though, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Ophelia was my favorite for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Then why not just admit you like them."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. I like them."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard their latest album?"
"__MUSIC__ Cleopatra? Most of it."
"__MUSIC__ Is it worth me checking out?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Its a different sound from the last album and has some really catchy songs."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'll check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think you might want to go to a Lumineers concert with me sometime?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, that sounds fun."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Maybe next summer?"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like a plan!"
