"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Attack on Titan?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the show and the movie, but I don't follow the Manga."
"__MOVIES__ How'd you see the movie? It wasn't released."
"__MOVIES__ It was, but in very select theaters."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it but had to do an illegal stream to see it."
"__MOVIES__ So, did you have a question?"
"__MOVIES__ How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I hated it passionately, despite the plot being awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I like that the other human civilizations are the ones making and sending the Titans."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, but the technology to do that makes no sense."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they have their flying devices and super-advanced DNA manipulation, yet they don't have lights."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, never thought of that."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the live-action Titans and how they looked?"
"__MOVIES__ The colossal titan was great when he emerged because he was 'steaming' like he was just made."
"__MOVIES__ That was definitely a cool visual."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Eren's Titan form was a bit... ugly."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but looks don't matter when you're 100 feet tall."
"__MOVIES__ The visuals overall were really well-done, but something lacked."
"__MOVIES__ It's the acting. I don't want to sound improper, but Japanese shows and movies are full of over-acting."
