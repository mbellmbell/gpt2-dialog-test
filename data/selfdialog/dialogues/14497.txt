"__HORROR__ Do you want to go see a horror show tonight."
"__HORROR__ Sure.  I saw that Screemdream is out now.  Looks pretty scary."
"__HORROR__ No.  I like the old B rated horror flicks like the ones they play at 5th avenue."
"__HORROR__ Oh, that sounds good.  Something like 'The Swamp Thing'."
"__HORROR__ Exactly, an old black and white flick.  I think the original Dracula is playing."
"__HORROR__ With Bela Lugosi?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, that's a classic for sure."
"__HORROR__ Ok, that sounds good.  But next week we've got to go see something modern like Light's Out."
"__HORROR__ I've heard that one will keep you on the edge of your seat."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I've heard it's an unsettling, fright-filled experience."
