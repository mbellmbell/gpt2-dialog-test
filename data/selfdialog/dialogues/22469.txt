"__DISNEY__ Okay so there have been 3 cars movies out so far."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I know."
"__DISNEY__ Which do you think is your favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I'd certainly have to say Cars 1."
"__DISNEY__ Well I like Cars 2."
"__DISNEY__ Well Cars 1 is just where everything started, you know?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I can see that. It's where all those funny characters came around."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, characters like Mater, Lightning, and Doc Hudson."
"__DISNEY__ I think Mater is my favorite character. He's hilarious."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah you're totally right. Larry the Cable Guy did a great job with that one."
