"__MOVIES__ So what did you think about star wars rogue?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think its one of my favorite star wars movies."
"__MOVIES__ Really i thought it was pretty good too but i don't know about one of my favorites, i liked the orginal trilogy a lot more."
"__MOVIES__ Yea but it was certainly better than the george lucas prequels."
"__MOVIES__ Thats for sure jake loyld and hayden christian were terrbile."
"__MOVIES__ Lol, thats for sure.  Are you excited for the han solo and boba fett movies that are coming out soon."
"__MOVIES__ You bet i am i cant wait, im as excited for them as i am to see the last jedi."
"__MOVIES__ Ya me too,  Ive already started thinking about wether im going to camp out opening night."
"__MOVIES__ Thats a little much for me, its too cold to be waiting in line and im too old for that."
"__MOVIES__ True but i always think its worth it, that way no one can accidently ruin the movie for you."
"__MOVIES__ Thats always true i had someone do that for zombieland right before i went to go see it."
"__MOVIES__ Aww man that is a bummer, did i tell you i started my rogue one collection?"
"__MOVIES__ No you didn't what are you collecting."
"__MOVIES__ O my favorite characters action figures in the black series, i also got 2 rogue one movie posters from the theaters, and some of the POP booble heads."
"__MOVIES__ Ahh too cool, who are your favorite characters from rogue one."
"__MOVIES__ O i really like jyn erso, bodhi, blaze, and the new robto ks20."
"__MOVIES__ KS 20 was also one of my favorites, his lines in the movie were so funny."
"__MOVIES__ I know i especially loved the line 'ill be there for you jyn, cassain said i had too'  i lost it when i heard that the first time watching the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Lol me too, i think i might even like him more than R2-D2."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that but he is up there in the top 5 best driods in the star wars universe."
