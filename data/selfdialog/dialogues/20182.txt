"__MOVIES__ i agree with that big time"
"__MOVIES__ it was nominated for an academy award for best picture that year!"
"__MOVIES__ wow, i didn't know that, i guess Christopher Nolan did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ better than okay, to bad that heath ledger died in January, the same year the movie came out"
"__MOVIES__ i know, that's really sad, he was an accomplished actor"
"__MOVIES__ yeah, he sure was, at least he won the Oscar for best supporting actor"
"__MOVIES__ that's a great honor i know that."
"__MOVIES__ did you know that he secluded himself for one moth in a hotel room to perfect the role of the joker?"
"__MOVIES__ incredible, now that's dedication and it paid off at the end."
