"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I have but I didn't care for it much."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh you didn't like it? I thought it was ok."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right for what it is. But they were introducing a powerful woman superhero so they should have done better."
"__SUPERHERO__ I like the character that plays her though, Gal Gadot. Good actress."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I did like her, and she does look a little like Linda Carter."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did you ever watch the Wonder Woman series a long time ago."
"__SUPERHERO__ No that was before my time. And I've never seen any reruns."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh that's too bad, you should find some on YouTube."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe I will. I loved the battle scene at the end of the movie though, love conquers all."
