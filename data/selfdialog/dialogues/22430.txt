"__DISNEY__ The whale still scares me a little!"
"__DISNEY__ I would never want to get swallowed by a whale like that, that's for sure."
"__DISNEY__ All of the Pleasure Island parts are scary, too! He basically gets kidnapped!"
"__DISNEY__ And he almost turns into a donkey like the other boys."
"__DISNEY__ When you talk about it like this, it's surprising that it's a movie for children!"
