"__MOVIES__ Did you see the latest Star Wars yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Rogue One? Yes, but on dvd, did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ No I thought it was awful, money grab type of thing."
"__MOVIES__ You think it was worse than episode one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think it was way worse. Did you see they are making a Han Solo Stand Alone?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I did not. How will they do that if he is dead?"
"__MOVIES__ The solo, Solo film is set when he was younger, kind of like the first set of prequels, you think you will see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I am sure I will check it out. Do you think they will add a stupid character like Jar Jar Binks?"
"__MOVIES__ I am sure they will add a useless one.But I liked Jar Jar didn't you?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he was awful.Almost as bad as kid Anakin."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked kid Anakin. I was freaked out by the Padme relationship, what was your take on that?"
"__MOVIES__ Padme and Anakin? I thought it was actually cool, I think Natalie Portman played it well, do you think she will somehow come back in any other Star Wars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do not see how she could, unless it was a pre- Prequel. Do you think they will try to have 'ghost' Anaking played by Hayden Christianson in any of the new films?"
"__MOVIES__ I am sure they will. Did you see that other movie he made, Jumper?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did a long time ago. Did you think it was any good?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually hated every second of it. It did remind me of Inception somehow though, the camera angles and mystery at least.Have you seen that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I love Inception, so weird but so good. Did you ever see Leo's part in Titanic?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I have never! Is it a good Cameron movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it is a real romantic, but also an epic. Like Avatar, did you dig that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I liked the way he wove all the story in with such ease on a crazy premise. Executed well don't you think?"
