"__MOVIES__ Are you a Star Trek fan?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of.  Why?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Star Trek Beyond and thought it was pretty good.  Did you see that one?"
"__MOVIES__ I did go see that one.  I like the later Star Trek films like JJ Abrams'."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see.  So what did you think of this last one."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed it, but not on the same level as JJ's films."
"__MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ The director is good.  Maybe because there wasn't a lot going on."
"__MOVIES__ The story wasn't as compelling."
"__MOVIES__ It was kind of an average story.  I loved what they did with the deep space station though."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  Gorgeous computer graphics."
"__MOVIES__ Mainly the story was about stranded on a planet.  Not so exciting."
"__MOVIES__ Not for me.  And they used a young girl as an alien to keep things interesting, but it wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ Not like Benedict Cumberbatch."
"__MOVIES__ I guess not!"
"__MOVIES__ So this latest Star Trek film has a half thumbs up from me."
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha I can relate."
"__MOVIES__ So with the next Star Trek film, I hope they heat things up."
"__MOVIES__ That might depend on the director."
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  Too bad its not JJ."
