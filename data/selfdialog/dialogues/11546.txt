"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You ready for another Giants Superbowl win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course not!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I cannot stand Eli Manning to save my life."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no, why? He's a good guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a jerk disguised as a good guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way. How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember when he was drafted?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A bit, what happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember who drafted him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ WRONG. The Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. I didn't know that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So here's why I hate him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He flat-out refused to play for them. He literally said he would not play a single snap."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He said he'd only play for the Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You hate him for that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. He had the audacity to come out of college and demand which team he plays for, and threw a fit."
