"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you follow the NFL draft at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not really, It's three days of shenanigans and fifteen minutes between picks is insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, all the trading is hard to keep track of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel bad for the fans, seeing their hopes get dashes when the team picks someone the instantly trade them for two picks in the next around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I watch sometimes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? Seems taxing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is, I'll usually have the draft on in the background while doing work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll look at the results at the end, especially if one of my college teams has someone making it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Schools I attended or taught at. If a student is projected to go high in the draft, or at all from a small school, I pay attention."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which schools?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ An undergrad without a football team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's fine. I studied at Penn State and Cincinnati so I follow the draft if they have someone going in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where do you work now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eastern Michigan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How often does the NFL get someone from there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every 2-3 years or so, ONE person will be selected."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they ever make it big in NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. A lot of them are just defensive players without recognition. Looking to see what Hackenberg does for the Jets next year."
