"__MUSIC__ I find the best band around right now is Say Anything"
"__MUSIC__ What? They have completely changed."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but their is so much back catalogue."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite album?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Baseball was their best."
"__MUSIC__ That was a pure rock album but it was written so long ago"
"__MUSIC__ And it still holds up today"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but the songs were basic three chord rock tracks."
"__MUSIC__ Is a real boy is their second best."
"__MUSIC__ No way that was a rock opera and clearly their finest work."
"__MUSIC__ They did put out a double album"
"__MUSIC__ And some of the songs were filler"
"__MUSIC__ They had a lot of featured guests on that album"
"__MUSIC__ I believe it was every song having at least one guest spot"

"__MUSIC__ That was one album, it could change"
"__MUSIC__ Do they even have a record label anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ Well its just one person nowadays"
