"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think that Rey is underwritten as a character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. Her ability to access the Force was the biggest distraction in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke and Anakin had to train and still got beaten up in their trilogies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, right."
"__STAR_WARS__ However, they could make her into a new Chosen One."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be too repetitive."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, but these movies tend to recycle certain elements."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but only to a point. The Prequels didn't copy plots."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ah, true."
