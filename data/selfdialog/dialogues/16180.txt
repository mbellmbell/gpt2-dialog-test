"__ROCK__ That's cool. Chili Peppers are an awesome band."
"__ROCK__ One of the band members has this symbol tattooed on his arm, and it's thir symbol on a lot of their cds, so I had it tattoed on my wrist."
"__ROCK__ You must really love that band."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I listened to them all the time when I was in college in the 90s, and their music really helped me get through some crazy times."
"__ROCK__ Let me guess- that song Under The Bridge?"
"__ROCK__ I love the opening guitar part on that song, and sometimes in college I did feel really lonely."
"__ROCK__ They have a lot of good sing along songs."
"__ROCK__ I know, I probably kept a lot of my dorm room mates up singing along at night while I was studying!"
