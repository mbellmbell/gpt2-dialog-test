"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Three Days Grace?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't listened to them since Adam left."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Because his voice is irreplaceable to me. That's just something I don't like for bands to do."
"__MUSIC__ What? Change singers?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, especially when they've been established for so long. It gets to the point where you can't hear anybody else but them singing the songs."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I get that, but you should still give them a chance."
"__MUSIC__ Is the music at least still the same."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. It's exactly the same, really."
"__MUSIC__ What about the new singer? What're they like."
"__MUSIC__ Matt Walst. He sounds different from Adam, but his voice still fits well over the music."
"__MUSIC__ Any songs I should look out for?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say Painkiller. It has the musical structure of any Three Days Grace song."
"__MUSIC__ And the vocals are good?"
"__MUSIC__ In my opinion, they are."
"__MUSIC__ I'll take your word for it."
"__MUSIC__ It comes off of an album. It's called Human."
"__MUSIC__ I'll look up the song first."
"__MUSIC__ If you like the song, check out the album."
"__MUSIC__ I'll see what I think."
