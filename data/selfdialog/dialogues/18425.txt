"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I just watched the second John Wick movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? How was it? I liked the first one."
"__MOVIES__ You know, it was pretty much just 2 hours of Keanu Reeves killing people."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that was pretty much the first movie, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it seemed like it was gratuitous. There was very little else going on."
"__MOVIES__ There was no plot?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, there was, I guess. Instead of killing over his dog, he was killing over his car, and then his house."
"__MOVIES__ I guess he really liked his car."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but i don't know that it necessarily warrants slaughtering like fifty people. and his car is totalled in the process anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Were there any memorable deaths?"
"__MOVIES__ He killed a couple of guys with a pencil. Those were particularly graphic."
"__MOVIES__ A pencil? Like a number 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Apparently it wasn't the first time either. The stories about him are 'watered down', says one character."
"__MOVIES__ That is pretty sweet."
"__MOVIES__ He seems superhuman. He gets pretty badly injured and is still out there killing people with ease."
"__MOVIES__ Adrenaline is a really powerful thing, even for people who aren't assassins."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I agree, but that can only sustain you for so long. After that, it has to be something more."
"__MOVIES__ It's his sheer force of will, then. There's a reason the movie is named after him and not one of his victims."
"__MOVIES__ Well, everyone he killed was probably not a 'victim', they were all in the underworld already."
