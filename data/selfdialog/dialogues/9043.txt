"__BEATLES__ Did you buy all the remastered albums that came out in 2009?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it took me over a year to get them all."
"__BEATLES__ Can I borrow 'Meet the Beatles!', I've never listened to the whole thing."
"__BEATLES__ Oops, sorry I didn't keep that one. I bought it, kept for a year and then I gave it away."
"__BEATLES__ How come?"
"__BEATLES__ I only liked two or three songs from that album and since they were also in one of their greatest hits album, there was no reason for me to keep it."
"__BEATLES__ Was that their first album?"
"__BEATLES__ I believe that was their first album released in the US, but in the UK I think they released 'Please Please me' first."
"__BEATLES__ Let's listen to 'Please please me' then."
"__BEATLES__ Okay."
