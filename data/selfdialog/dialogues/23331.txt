"__DISNEY__ The kids and I finally got around to seeing Moana this weekend."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, what did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ It was OK. I was hoping for more. Especially with the Rock in it. Maybe it's just because my boys weren't that into it."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe they will like Cars 3 more."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah. We are excited to see that one. Planes was a disappointment though."
"__DISNEY__ I don't actually think we saw that one."
"__DISNEY__ I heard they are making an Incredibles 2."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! But I've been hearing that for a while now."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I wonder why they haven't yet."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, it was such a good one!"
