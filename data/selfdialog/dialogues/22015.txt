"__DISNEY__ What was the most impactful animated movie in your life?"
"__DISNEY__ Honestly, it was probably Lilo and Stitch."
"__DISNEY__ That's an answer I didn't expect."
"__DISNEY__ I just loved the friendship they shared. I also loved the way they designed Stitch."
"__DISNEY__ I'll agree Stitch was a great character idea."
"__DISNEY__ Between his design and his voice, he's instantly unique."
"__DISNEY__ His voice was really cute. One of my friends can recreate it perfectly."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and he had a bunch of super abilities."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah. Wasn't he super strong?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and fast. I thought it was a good break from the princesses at Disney."
