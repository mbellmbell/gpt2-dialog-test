"__ROCK__ What do you think of rock music?"
"__ROCK__ I really love it, I just wish more people I knew were into it."
"__ROCK__ What bands do you like listening to?"
"__ROCK__ I really like the rock music of the early 80s. Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, there were a lot of good British bands."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, shame Def Leppard got lumped into the hair metal genre."
"__ROCK__ Not really, hair metal was fun to listen to. They dressed weird, of course, but they had some pretty heavy rock music."
"__ROCK__ I honestly did like Motley Crue, they were a guilty pleasure."
"__ROCK__ Girls, Girls, Girls was great, but power ballads like Home Sweet Home and Without You really hit close to home."
"__ROCK__ Power Ballads, yeah, you hear of Tesla, they had a good one."
"__ROCK__ Love Song? Indeed, I really liked that one!"
