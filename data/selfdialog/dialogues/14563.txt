"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I wondered if he's still alive."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Who Ayers? Or Fox? or Downey Jr?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ayers! There's supposed to be a foundation dedicated to that gifted people with mental illness thing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You know what people say about this movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Um.. I reckon they say a lot about the movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ yes, But in particular, they say it's a typical White Savior narrative."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That is NOT a thing. A white savior narrative? That can't be a thing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ ON the contrary. it IS a thing. And people categorize this movie precisely in that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So if a white person helps a black person and if it's portrayed as a medium, then it's a White Savior narrative."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yep. And the movie fits that perfectly."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The movie does or the real life does? This actually happened, so to belittle it calling it a white savior narrative isn't really fair."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Fair, Not fair. I'm just telling you what people think."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Who wrote the cello for the soundtrack anyway?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Some Italian composer guy. Marianelli."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's not some italian guy. He's the one who composed the soundtrack for the atonement."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, he did win the Oscars's for the best score. But he's still an Italian guy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You said some italian guy, liek he's not that important."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I did say that, but that doesn't mean I don't think he's important. io just mean he's some italian guy which is what he is."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ An italian vs some italian. There is a difference. Anyway, I love that track. Atonement. What's that movie about anyway?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Atonement? I guess... the process of atoning. That might have something to do with it. just a guess though. I haven't seen it."
