"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the movie 'Twister'?"
"__MOVIES__ Was that the movie with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that movie was scary."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  I thought the movie was funny and informative."
"__MOVIES__ Informative?  How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm sure there were liberties taken, but that's close to how I imagine storm chasers work.  The humor was what really sold me on the film, tough."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite comedic moment?"
"__MOVIES__ There were so many...I can pull so many one liners from the dialogue.  'Rabbit is good, rabbit is wise!' 'Cow? - Same cow!'"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't the character of Rabbit played by the guy who played Cameron in Ferris Bueller?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Alan is awesome.  But, it's also interesting that Twister starred  Phillip Seymore Hoffman."
"__MOVIES__ Did it really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was one of his first big roles in Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ How many times have you seen Twister?"
"__MOVIES__ At least twenty times."
"__MOVIES__ Wow!  Who else was in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Carey Ewles, the guy who played Wesley in 'the Princess Bride' was the rival storm chaser."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that they used a lot of real footage in the movie, is that true?"
"__MOVIES__ As I understood it, they were actually filming on location in Kansas when a small tornado touched down so they sent the crew to get some B Roll footage."
"__MOVIES__ That's realy cool."
