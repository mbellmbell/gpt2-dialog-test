"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Brown's will be the worst team in the NFL this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. They made some nice moves in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did but it is a long term strategy. They will grow over the next couple seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they didn't waste any more picks on quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be interesting to see how Brock Osweiler performs in Cleveland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where was he before he got traded?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he was in Houston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is right. He did alright down there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is tough being a Brown's fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least we have good company. I heard Lebron James has season passes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Myles Garrett comes back strong from his injury we may have a chance at a win this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that one of the rookie QB's might start over Osweiler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe Kizer or Kessler. If they do they wasted a trade on Osweiler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is typical of the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to any games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might go to one or two games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have not decided yet if I will. Tickets are really cheap this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not as many season pass holders this year for the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hue Jackson will turn things around for the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he doesn't they will fire him."
