"__MOVIES__ I think the best action movie of all time is Die Hard."
"__MOVIES__ You see, I'd agree with you if they didn't just put out Mad Max Fury Road."
"__MOVIES__ Wait you're going to put Mad Max Fury Road over Die Hard?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing against Die Hard, Bruce Willis is the man and it's his best film but come on, George Miller."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'm just not seeing what makes Mad Max Fury Road so good."
"__MOVIES__ Did you watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I've watched it twice."
"__MOVIES__ Then if you still can't see what makes it so good then I'm not sure what to say."
"__MOVIES__ It's just Max barely said a word."
"__MOVIES__ And that's fine because it's an action movie, and when it comes to practical effects and directing it's the greatest of all time."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to give it another watch but in my mind nothing competes with Bruce Willis."
"__MOVIES__ You're not going to get much push back from me because in a world where Mad Max doesn't exist I would pick Die Hard."
"__MOVIES__ That is comforting to hear and in a world where Die Hard doesn't exist I would pick Mad Max."
"__MOVIES__ Very well, now can we talk about Mad Max being better than Die Hard?"
"__MOVIES__ But Die Hard exists so no, no we cannot."
"__MOVIES__ Alright you got me."
"__MOVIES__ I will agree though that what George Miller accomplished with Fury Road was magical."
"__MOVIES__ Seeing in theaters is an experience that cannot be replicated."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think we'll see a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ He says it's coming, who knows when though, it's an exhausting movie to make."
