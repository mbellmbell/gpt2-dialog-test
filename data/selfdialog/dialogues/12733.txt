"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for football season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pre season is only like a month away"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but it really means nothing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know and the first strings only play the first quarter"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they do have to check out the rookies and see who is in and who is out"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it will be interesting to see who makes the cut"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, do they let some people go after the first couple games and then the rest after the next two games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am really not sure how that works, I do know that they have two cuts before regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I knew that, I was just wondering when the cuts are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, now I just read, that instead of two cuts, it is now only going to be one cut."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, still the same 90 to 53 all at once?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, I just read that on the internet"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow, I wonder why they are doing it that way now"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure, it states that the rosters will be down to 53 no later than 4 pm ET on Sept 3rd. right before the regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, those rookies are going to really have to play their butts off then"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they well, must be really nerve wrecking to wonder if you are going to stay or go"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet, when they play they are sweating two fold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I bet they are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, all I can say is good luck to all the NFL rookies."
