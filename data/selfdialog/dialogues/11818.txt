"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you catch any of the game last night?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm still in shock on that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe they came back from it; I mean three sack in a row then a soft pitch on the off hand."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was almost hiding behind my couch after the second one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was too, then when I saw him catch it I almost hit the ceiling."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I knocked over my girl trying to get a better view."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait, do you want to watch at my place, just got a new 4k TV, the picture is crystal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be awesome, I'll bring the refreshments."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better bring some extra, you remember what happened the last time we played Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't worry I'll bring my helmet this time, just remember your pads."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will do, I can't wait to see Brown running circles around them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope Big Ben is doing alright by then, he's gotta be sore after all those hits."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping this is our year to go all the way up the stairway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seven rings would make my decade."
