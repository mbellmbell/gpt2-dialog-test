"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the House on Haunted Hill?"
"__MOVIES__ What the original, or the newer one?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm talking about the newer one.  I didn't know there was an original."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness, yes!  It was very popular."
"__MOVIES__ When did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the original was in 1959, and the newer one was in 1999."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, so a forty year span.  I thought the new one was great!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was really scary and well done.  I liked it too."
"__MOVIES__ When did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's been awhile.  Didn't it have Taye Diggs in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Geoffrey Rush."
"__MOVIES__ So what was the original like?"
"__MOVIES__ It was similar.  They were being offered $10,000 instead of one million to stay in the house."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Vincent Price and Carol Ohmart are the only ones I remember."
"__MOVIES__ I bet it was spooky too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was good, but not as good as the remake I don't think.  I thought the second was scarier."
"__MOVIES__ Probably because of the special effects."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah those have definitely come a long way."
"__MOVIES__ I'd still like to see it though.  I'll probably rent it."
