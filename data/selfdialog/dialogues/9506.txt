"__BASEBALL__ So how do you think the indians will make it to the series again this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I sure hope so i would like to see them win it, but im not sure i heard they lost some players."
"__BASEBALL__ Ya i heard that too, hopefully it wasn't anyone we needed."
"__BASEBALL__ I know speaking of what we need we need some more pitchers."
"__BASEBALL__ Ya i'll second that, the only thing i believe we are good on is the people in the outfield."
"__BASEBALL__ The indians outfield is pretty good, they were tearing it up last season."
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely were, although i cant remember his name but one guy was horrible, especially during the world series."
"__BASEBALL__ I think i know the guy your talking about, was he the one that kept getting waved off but ran in anyways to try and catch it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep i remember he cost the indians an easy out because he messed up the guy that was waving him off."
"__BASEBALL__ That was pretty awful, hopefully the indians replaced him this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Have you gone and seen any games yet?"
"__BASEBALL__ No I havent yet."
"__BASEBALL__ Thats a bummer I'm going up at the end of the month to see them play the royals."
"__BASEBALL__ O nice i hear its going to be a good game."
"__BASEBALL__ I heard that too, even if it isn't its still dollar a dog night!"
"__BASEBALL__ O score, i love those nights."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too i always eat way more than i should."
"__BASEBALL__ You betting on the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ I usually do, im betting my buddy they win by 3 runs."
"__BASEBALL__ I think thats a safe bet, i heard they are supposed to beat the royals fairly easily."
