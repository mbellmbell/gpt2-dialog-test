"__MOVIES__ Do you like Kubrick movies?"
"__MOVIES__ The ones I have seen. Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ What have you seen."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, 2001. I loved those"
"__MOVIES__ You ever see Barry Lyndon?"
"__MOVIES__ No. It's a Kubrick film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he did it in the 70s. It's real different from those other movies."
"__MOVIES__ How?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it is real long and very slow-paced. It's set in 18th century Europe, but it starts in Ireland."
"__MOVIES__ That is different. Who stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Barry Lyndon is played by Ryan O'Neil. It really is mainly ablout him."
"__MOVIES__ He's OK. Not my favorite. Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee. it has a good solid cast but not a lot of well-known names."
"__MOVIES__ OK. Well what is it about, then?"
"__MOVIES__ An Irish rogue named Redmond Barry who rises through society."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds kind of boring."
"__MOVIES__ Well it isn't. It is slow, but he fights several duels throughout the movie. In fact duels are a big part of the story."
"__MOVIES__ Like that movie, the Duellists?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, not as much but still a lot goes on. You should check it out."
"__MOVIES__ I might some time."
