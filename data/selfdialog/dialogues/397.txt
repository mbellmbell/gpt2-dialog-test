"__MUSIC__ Hey, what kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Um...well, right now I am listening a lot to a psytrance band."
"__MUSIC__ What's psytrance"
"__MUSIC__ It is considered psychological trance."
"__MUSIC__ Is there a particular artist you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they are called Infected Mushroom."
"__MUSIC__ They? How many are there?"
"__MUSIC__ There's only two, but they do enough that it sounds like a whole group."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. How long they been around?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, They've been around a good while. They have at least 10 studio albums, although their first couple are pretty basic."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. That's a long time. I've never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ They are from Israel. But they moved to LA a few years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Sweet. Have you seen them in concert? Do you play live?"
"__MUSIC__ They do, but I have never seen them. They are on my bucket list though."
"__MUSIC__ Are they gonna be around here soon."
"__MUSIC__ Not soon, but they are ridiculous. They play over 120 venues a year."
"__MUSIC__ Holy crap, really? So in your words, what do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ They would be compared to techno, but they change tempos and riffs so often that the song never ends the same way it starts. They are amazing."
"__MUSIC__ What bands do they sound like."
"__MUSIC__ They sound nothing like any band I have heard and I have yet to find anyone who comes close. I just love them."
