"__MUSIC__ Most of his songs usually do."
"__MUSIC__ Plus the lyrics are pretty solid."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, his bars are pretty solid most of the time. What makes this one different?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the last minute just kind of turns things on their head."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ It's like, in the last minute or so, he just breaks it down."
