"__MUSIC__ I'm lost, I hardly ever know the names of the top bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you're stuck in the 90s.  Try downloading something new."
"__MUSIC__ I've been looking at the UK charts.  Mike Posner is in the top 10 now."
"__MUSIC__ Top 10 for what?  Isn't he like a John Mayer type of guy?"
"__MUSIC__ Justin Bieber is still kicking, he has a new song in the Top 40."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, it's called 'sorry' and he should be.  It's terrible."
"__MUSIC__ I must be getting old, most of the music I hear is terrible."
"__MUSIC__ It's not just you, most of it is unlistenable unless you are a 15 year-old girl."
"__MUSIC__ There is this new song by Muse out but I can't for the life of me remember the name."
"__MUSIC__ If it's in the last year, it's probably called 'Deep Down' or 'Dig Down', something like that."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard anything new from Kings of Leon since the Wall CD."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't either, they must be partying too much."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of the Imagine Dragons."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, my ex-girlfriend used to play them a lot.  That's why I'm not a huge fan."
"__MUSIC__ Green Day hasn't put out anything lately.  Are they over?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so, they put out something last year.  I think it was called 'Still Breathing' ironically."
"__MUSIC__ Did Coldplay break up or what?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  All I've heard in the news is like gossip column stuff about who's dating who."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, Wheezer has a new song out or should I say video?"
"__MUSIC__ If it's the one I'm thinking of, 'Feels Like Summer' or something.  It wasn't bad."
