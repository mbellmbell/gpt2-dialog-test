"__HORROR__ If you like period vampire movies, I think you'd like Interview With a Vampire."
"__HORROR__ Oh, really?  Who's in that one?"
"__HORROR__ Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are the stars."
"__HORROR__ That must be pretty mainstream to have them in it."
"__HORROR__ It is mainstream, but it's still well-made.  A European directed it."
"__HORROR__ Oh, who directed it?"
"__HORROR__ Neil Jordan directed it.  He does a good job making you feel like you're in that time period."
"__HORROR__ Isn't Antonio Banderas in it?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, he is in it.  He makes an impression in it."
"__HORROR__ I like period movies and vampires a lot so it'd probably be right up my alley."
