"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are we going to see in the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know there are a lot of teams that loaded up in the off season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady and Belichick are a winning formula."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady isn't a spring Chicken, getting closer to 40 every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So is every other quarter back in the league. Belichick has a plan. He's the greatest coach in the history of the sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean his plan to cheat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All the teams cheat. It's part of a winning strategy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They may all cheat but New England is the only one that's been caught multiple times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you win everyone wants to find something wrong with you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think they are going 16 and 0 I assume?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about a sweep but 14 or 15."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to give them trouble this year aside from Atlanta?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe the Steelers, Kansas City?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pittsburgh's defense is the real deal, and I think Brady is going to have a tough time with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be surprised if we win that game, but Im not really to worried about anyone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So maybe 13 and 0 because you're not winning against Atlanta, and if you're worried about the Cheifs you've got to factor in that possibility."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I won't lie Atlanta is a better team, but they don't have Brady and Belichick leading the charge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You realize they're just people, not magic in any way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're wrong."
