"__MUSIC__ Would you like to learn a little about music theory?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess so if it isn't too difficult."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, let's go look at the piano keyboard together. It will help us visualize some of the important concepts."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds great! I'm a visual learner."
"__MUSIC__ Do you see that there are two kinds of keys on the keyboard. One kind is white and the other is black."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I see that but I'm not sure what significance it has."
"__MUSIC__ Let me explain. Music, or at least music in the west, is made up of notes. Each key on the piano is a specific note."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that seems easy enough, but why are there two different colors of keys?"
"__MUSIC__ Hold on and I'll get to that. First, look at the keyboard again. Do you see that there are groups of two and then three black keys?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I see that and they repeat from the left side to the right side."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good observation! Music is very repetative. Did you know there are only twelve notes?"
"__MUSIC__ Twelve notes? How is that possible? All the songs in the world can't be made up of only twelve notes!"
"__MUSIC__ True, but we are not talking about all the songs in the world. We are talking about Western or European music. Music in other parts of the world is a bit different."
"__MUSIC__ I still don't see how that is possible."
"__MUSIC__ I'll show you! If you put your finger on the white key that is just to the left of the black group of two keys then you are playing the note called C."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, but there is more than one group of two black keys. How do I know which one you are talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ Every one of them is called C and if you move to your right one white key that is called D. The next white key is E and so on."
"__MUSIC__ So you mean that I can start on C and move to the right and the next white keys are D, E, F, G, and then H?"
"__MUSIC__ No. Look at the one you called H. It is the white key just to the left of the group of two black keys. That means you are back at C!"
"__MUSIC__ This is too complicated for me! I changed my mind about music theory. Let's go listen to the radio instead."
