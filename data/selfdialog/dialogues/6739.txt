"__STAR_WARS__ Remember in Empire Strikes Back there was that scene with all the bounty hunters"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, Vader recruited them to catch Han Solo"
"__STAR_WARS__ There was like a robot one, an alien one, some guy wrapped up like a mummy"
"__STAR_WARS__ And of course Bubba Fett"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, Bubba Fett. He was a great character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder why Vader needed bounty hunters to catch Han Solo"
"__STAR_WARS__ True, I thought he had the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Must not have worked with Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ In the end Bubba Fett caught them though, right."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he was the one that finally got them."
