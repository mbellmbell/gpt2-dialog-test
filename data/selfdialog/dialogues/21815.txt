"__DISNEY__ What's the worst Disney cartoon you've ever seen?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably Dumbo.  You?"
"__DISNEY__ The Hunchback of Notre Dame."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, I completely forgot about that one.  Truly one of Disney's darker moments."
"__DISNEY__ It just wasn't a fun movie.  A box office failure to boot."
"__DISNEY__ It's hard to make a good story about a hunchback."
"__DISNEY__ Kind of sad really.  They had a talented lineup of musical players."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but good music can only overcome so much."
"__DISNEY__ I think Disney learned it's lesson: stick with princesses."
"__DISNEY__ That's always a recipe for success."
