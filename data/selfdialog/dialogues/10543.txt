"__RAP_HIPHOP__ East Coast or West Coast? Who you got?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I really don't care about which coast or where you came from. I just like cool music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm with you. The rap coast war was very destructive to the genre and the community."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I was a Biggie and Public Enemy fan back in the day, and a fan of 2 Pac and NWA."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Me too, I liked groups and artists on both sides of the country. I never had a bias towards one or the other."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Groups like Outkast and guys like Eminem kind of dissolved that beef didn't they?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What about Kid Rock? He was a Detroit kid and I heard his first album in the early 90's."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's been around for a lot longer than people realize hasn't he?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yup, and he's still doing his thing today and he does different styles of music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think it would be cool if Eminem did like a southern rock song thing. It would blow people away."
