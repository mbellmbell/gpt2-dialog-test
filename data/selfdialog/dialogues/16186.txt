"__ROCK__ What is a good, heavy rock band to listen to?"
"__ROCK__ Do you like Metallica? They're pretty awesome."
"__ROCK__ Yeah but I don't like their newer stuff. They're a completely different band these day than from their early days."
"__ROCK__ That's for sure. After The Black album, they completely changed their sound."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, they went from a metal band to more of a hard rock band. Nothing they do now sounds like Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets."
"__ROCK__ I guess when musicians get older it's difficult to maintain the same intensity as when they were younger and angrier."
"__ROCK__ Their newer album, Hardwired sounds a little like their early albums. It reminds me of Kill 'Em All."
"__ROCK__ I've heard a couple song off of that album and yeah, it's better than most of their post-Black album music."
"__ROCK__ I think when Jason Newsted left the band is when they really went downhill. Maybe even after Cliff Burton died."
"__ROCK__ I'd almost agree about them changing after Cliff Burton died but And Justice For All was a pretty heavy album. That was the last good album from Metallica though."
