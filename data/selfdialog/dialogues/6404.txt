"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think George Lucas should have left the line alone in A New Hope for the special edition?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I personally do think he should have left it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, it fundamentally changes the character."
"__STAR_WARS__ It kid of does, when Han shoots first it shows he is willing to kill before he gives someone the chance to kill him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, by changing it to Greedo shooting first it made what Han did a 'defensive' act."
"__STAR_WARS__ I rather liked it the way it was, I think Han would shoot Greedo outright if he thought his life was in danger."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right? Now in the special editions he is a 'good guy' who doesn't shoot until the other person does."
"__STAR_WARS__ I still think of Han as the original version, I don't like the soft Han that George made in the special editions."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they should make a 'ultimate edition' where they fix all the little things that George messed up by messing with the films too much."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, it could also be a good opportunity to remaster some of the effects and other scenes with mistakes as long as they don't fundamentally change the content."
