"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's definitely The Matrix, hands down. Great movie with a great message."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great one but I'd have to say mine is Forrest Gump."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love Forrest Gump! He's got to be the most lovable character in movie history."
"__MOVIES__ People don't realize he was actually a genius."
"__MOVIES__ He really was, and I don't even mean just as an idiot savant. He understood and grasped things even we don't."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I love Tom Hanks in general. Have you ever seen Castaway?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I've seen it like a million times. Broke my heart when he lost Wilson."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I felt his pain. It was only a ball but it was his only companion."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think it was right for Helen Hunt's character to move on?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes they had no idea when or if he was coming back. She couldn't just continue to put her life on hold."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Do you remember Girls Just Wanna Have fun with her and Sarah Jessica Parker?"
"__MOVIES__ That's from the 80s right? I think they were trying to get on a dance show."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. I used to watch that over and over when I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ The 80s had the best movies hands down. Especially in the horror genre."
"__MOVIES__ Oh Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th... all bonafide classics."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the Rob Zombie reboot of Halloween?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and I kind of liked it but I had a problem with him trying to humanize Michael Myers."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that? It was good to have his background explained."
"__MOVIES__ Well it means that you're no longer that afraid of him and his status as a psychopath with no cause sort of disappears."
