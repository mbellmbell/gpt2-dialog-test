"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would you consider of a big NFL fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. I love the NFL. Being from Ohio, are you a Browns fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yes and no. I tend to have a love/hat relationship with Cleveland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is interesting. Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are considered the 'Home team', but it's difficult at times to get behind them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were considered the 'worst team in the NFL' last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that is correct and I do recall hearing that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are most of your friends and family Browns fans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yes, absolutely. And that is why I try to stay behind them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because if they do well, your friends and family will be happy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, pretty much. If the Browns do better, than it's a happy day for those close to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a decent enough reason to get behind a somewhat negative-received team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, as well. Not only that, but I am also a fan of the underdog."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems that when it comes to the Browns, they either do really well or really poorly most of the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I can see that point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have had some real negative defeats but also some decent wins over the years. Who would you consider their best rival?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most would say the Ravens, but I actually think the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting point. Why do you say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think because Browns/Steelers games always are fun to watch and usually competitive."
