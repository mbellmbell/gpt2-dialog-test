"__DISNEY__ My daughter's 4th birthday is coming up and she wants a Disney princess party."
"__DISNEY__ My daughter just went to one last month. It was pretty cute."
"__DISNEY__ You should bring her! Kayla is dressing as her favorite Disney princess, Ariel."
"__DISNEY__ Isabelle would love that! She'll probably go as Belle, her favorite because of the name."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, there are so many more reasons to like Belle! She's my favorite!"
"__DISNEY__ She's an avid reader just like me. And she doesn't fall for just any guy."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly! Gaston had no chance!"
"__DISNEY__ There is so much you can learn from Belle too! Like the importance of family, and reading."
"__DISNEY__ And staying true to yourself, no matter what people think."
"__DISNEY__ And of course, how to look beyond someone's exterior, because you never know what 'beast' may turn out to be your true love!"
