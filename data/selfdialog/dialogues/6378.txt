"__STAR_WARS__ And how he develops the dual blade light saber."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would've been cool to see also."
"__STAR_WARS__ And why is the Sith saber's red?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a common knowledge. It's the negative energy from the Sith that turns them red."
"__STAR_WARS__ How come Some Jedi's have blue and others green?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Green like Yoda's indicate he's a Jedi Consular who spent more time studying the mystical nature of the Force."
"__STAR_WARS__ And if it's blue like Kenobi's?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That indicates he's a Jedi Guardian who's more in tune with the physical aspect of the Force, like fighting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh... Ok. That makes sense. All this should've been explaiend in the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ That wiould make the movie 10 hours long. All these back stories developed over the past 3 decades."
