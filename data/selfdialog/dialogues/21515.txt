"__DISNEY__ Which one do you like better, Sleeping Beauty or Snow White?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that's a hard one.  Snow White is the first full length Disney so it's awesome."
"__DISNEY__ But Sleeping Beauty has the three fairies and Maleficent."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Sleeping Beauty is hardly in her own movie."
"__DISNEY__ But Snow White goes on a long time.  I mean, we spend a long time cleaning that cabin."
"__DISNEY__ Well, what do you want her to do in the miners cabin?"
"__DISNEY__ At least in Sleeping Beauty she knew the prince before he kissed her awake."
"__DISNEY__ True.  The end of Snow White is slightly creepy"
"__DISNEY__ I mean, oh she's a dead pretty lady, let me kiss her and marry her is she wakes up?"
"__DISNEY__ It is a cartoon."
