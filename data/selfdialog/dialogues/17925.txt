"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard much about the second one."
"__MOVIES__ Really?! Have you seen a trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't. Does it look good?"
"__MOVIES__ It does! The scenes with baby Groot are adorable."
"__MOVIES__ Groot and Drax were my favorite characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Groot was my favorite as well."
"__MOVIES__ It's funny that my favorite Vin Diesel role of all time is just his voice character."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I completely forgot Vin Diesel was Groots voice!"
"__MOVIES__ I know! It's funny that an action star is in a superhero movie as just a voice."
"__MOVIES__ This one has a lot of new actors. I love Kurt Russell as Ego."
"__MOVIES__ I still don't understand the whole Ego character yet. How is a planet a father?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you haven't seen it yet. I don't want to ruin it for you."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I hate spoilers."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we could go see it together?"
"__MOVIES__ You want to see it again?"
"__MOVIES__ With you? I would see anything twice."
"__MOVIES__ You are just too sweet."
"__MOVIES__ But also, it's a great movie so it won't be a hardship."
"__MOVIES__ Ha! Let's see it then."
