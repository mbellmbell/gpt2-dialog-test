"__DISNEY__ Hey, which Disney movie do you like better: Mulan or The Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ Mulan, definitely! The Little Mermaid was kind of lame."
"__DISNEY__ I like The Little Mermaid better, Ariel was very pretty."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but she fell in love with Prince Eric as soon as she saw him!"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I guess she was a little desperate."
"__DISNEY__ Mulan, on the other hand, saved the entire country of China! And what did Ariel do? Nothing!"
"__DISNEY__ Sheesh, okay!"
"__DISNEY__ Sorry. I respect your opinions, but Mulan was still better!"
"__DISNEY__ Okay, okay!"
"__DISNEY__ Sorry. They were both good."
