"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, what's up with the Bears?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not sure what you mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They may have made the dumbest draft pick ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the QB they drafted?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Mitch Trubisky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why was it a dumb pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They traded up for this guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They gave up a ton of draft capital for someone who has one season as a starter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but that doesn't make him a bad pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But why draft him when you had Mike Glennon?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Glennon's not that good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, but Chicago is dumb enough to pay him $15 million a year to sit on the bench."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a bit strange, but you need a good backup QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, no matter who starts, that old saying about quarterbacks is how I think of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What old saying?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 'If you've got two quarterbacks, you've got none.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a weird saying."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Basically means that you don't have a franchise QB if you can't decide on who's better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Than you trade one of them for a bevy of draft picks."
