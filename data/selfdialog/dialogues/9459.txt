"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the game between the Giants and Dodgers last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  It was a big game between rivals."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I always try to catch those big rivalry games."
"__BASEBALL__ The Giants won, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  I think they've won four straight games now."
"__BASEBALL__ Interesting.  They have not looked good for most of the season."
"__BASEBALL__ No they haven't.  But they started getting some players back from the DL."
"__BASEBALL__ I heard.  They got Crawford back, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. He's a good player so that is important."
"__BASEBALL__ And Buster Posey is hitting home runs all of a sudden."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, I saw something that said he hit just one home run in April and six already in May."
"__BASEBALL__ That's pretty amazing, he's not a guy known for huge power."
"__BASEBALL__ No, especially in that ballpark.  But he's off to a great season offensively."
"__BASEBALL__ He is a former MVP, so that is to be expected."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about the Dodgers so far this season?"
"__BASEBALL__ Honestly I thought they would be just a bit better, but it's still early."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they are still the favorites in the NL West?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  The Rockies look good, but I think in the end the Dodgers will win."
"__BASEBALL__ What about the Giants?"
"__BASEBALL__ No way.  They dug themselves too deep a hole already, in my opinion."
