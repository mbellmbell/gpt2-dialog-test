"__MUSIC__ I'm looking for some new singer-songwriter types  to listen to, but they don't have to necessarily be recent."
"__MUSIC__ Well who have you been listening to recently?"
"__MUSIC__ I've actually been really into Dylan lately. I never gave him much of a chance I was younger, but lately I've been enjoying him."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, if you didn't really grow up with him, he can  definitely be an acquired taste."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure what happened. I used to find his voice kind of annoying when I was a kid, but then one day it just started working for me."
"__MUSIC__ It's weird how that can just happen. Suddenly somebody clicks with you."
"__MUSIC__ But even still I've kind of been burning myself out on him. Think I need to step away  and listen to something different, but I kinda want something with a similar feel."
"__MUSIC__ You ever listen to Rufus Wainwright?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! Definitely a fan of his."
"__MUSIC__ You ever try listening to his dad?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh Loudon? No, I mean, I know who he is, but I never really got into his stuff."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people only know him for that novelty song he did in the mid-70s 'Dead Skunk', but he has a really good discography apart from that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I was just thinking of him too because he was one of a bunch of artists in the 70s that used to get called 'the new Dylan'. His first couple of albums were mostly just him and a guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Well I don't know, I'm not just looking for Folk, I've actually never been big on the genre until Dylan."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of why I bring up Loudon though, he's not really your typical Folk guy, he has a really strange sense of humor but he can also write a damn catchy tune."
"__MUSIC__ I may have to check him out then. Anyone else from around that time I should investigate?"
"__MUSIC__ Well if you want something a bit more melancholy then Nick Drake is great, Cat Stevens... You ever listen to any Tom Waits?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. It seems like everyone else has though."
"__MUSIC__ Tom is great, and he's reinvented himself a few different times throughout the years. But you should try listening to his mid-seventies album 'Nighthawks at the Diner', I think you might really like it."
