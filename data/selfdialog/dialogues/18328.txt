"__MOVIES__ What type of movie interests you?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I like romance and comedy.  Maybe some drama."
"__MOVIES__ I like those type of movies too!  I do not like science fiction or fantasy movies in the least."
"__MOVIES__ I don't ever watch those type of movies either.  They don't hold my interest.  I want something real not fantasy."
"__MOVIES__ So what have you watched lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen anything recently."
"__MOVIES__ Well, name a movie that you have seen even if it's been a while."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen Bridges of Madison County.  It is an older movie, it came out in 1995.  One of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I love their acting.  I bet they did a great job together in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Clint Eastwood is a photographer and he happens to need directions and stops at Meryl Streep's house and asks for directions to a bridge that he wants to photograph."
"__MOVIES__ Well, tell me more."
"__MOVIES__ That's how they  met.  Her husband is out of town so she is alone when he comes to her house."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, sounds like romance in the making."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, It turns out to be such a romantic love story.  They fall deeply in love with each other."
"__MOVIES__ Does her husband ever find out?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not that I can reacll.  He does come back into town."
"__MOVIES__ How does it end?"
"__MOVIES__ She ends up seeing him in town while she was with  her husband.  Of course it is one of those tear jerker parts where you just wish they could be in a relationship forever.  Very touching."
