"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Championships tonight?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You mean the Ottawa Senators versus Pittsburgh Penguins match up?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's the one! Did you see it?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I saw it went into Overtime."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ There have been so many Overtimes with the Senators games in the playoffs thus far!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know, right? Bobby Ryan scored the game winner."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Looks like Pittsburgh should have picked Ryan over Sidney Crosby back when they were drafted 1st and 2nd overall."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't know about that. The Penguins have won a Stanley cup in the last 2 years while Ottawa hasn't won the cup in forever."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What do you think will happen this series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think the Penguins will give the Senators a tough time."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Tougher than the New York Rangers gave them?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, definitely. Pittsburgh is a tough team to beat."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ottawa is proving to be a top contender, though. It's about time a Canadian team won the Eastern Conference Championship."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who knows what will happen. The Rangers did give Ottawa quite a run."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's not like that series went to Game 7. Ottawa won the series 4-2 in Game 6."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Very true. Do you think the Senators and the Penguins will go to Game 7?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think they very well could. It's a really intense match up."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You have to remember the Penguins are coming off a 7-game run against the Washington Capitals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right. They could lose steam during this series against the Senators."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I really thought the Capitals were going to make a comeback and advance, but yet again, they're out of the playoffs."
