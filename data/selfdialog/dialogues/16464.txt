"__ROCK__ What rock bands do you like?"
"__ROCK__ I loved the Stones, lots of classic hits."
"__ROCK__ Hard to believe they are still touring and playing.  Still have a lot of appeal of the songs from their glory days.  Like Ruby Tuesday for instance."
"__ROCK__ I loved to listen to them on my 8 tracks.  I had one in the garage run by a battery charger and one in my car.  Listened to the stones, Eric Clapton and some Elvis."
"__ROCK__ I liked Neil Diamond too, sweet Caroline among others."
"__ROCK__ We used to ride around in the car and listen to 8 tracks like 'Paint It Black' or Tommy from 'The Who'."
"__ROCK__ Sure it was easy to ride around, gas was cheap and you could listen to your trade a tape like Neil Diamond or the latest artists."
"__ROCK__ The care free days were so cool, it seemed like the hits would keep coming but so many of the bands broke up like the Beatles."
"__ROCK__ And they moved on to other things, formed independants and struck off on their own like happened to the Byrds."
"__ROCK__ Sure, they had a song 'eight miles high' that was supposed to be about flying but everyone thought was about drugs."
