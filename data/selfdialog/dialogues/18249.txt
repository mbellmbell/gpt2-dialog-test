"__MOVIES__ You've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, right?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't."
"__MOVIES__ You really should. All three of the movies are amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I don't know much about them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so you've never read the books?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Are they good?"
"__MOVIES__ I like them, though the movies are easier to follow. Peter Jackson did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ Is he the lead?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he's the director. He does have brief cameos in all three of the films though."
"__MOVIES__ What actors are in the movies? Anyone I might recognize?"
"__MOVIES__ Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett"
"__MOVIES__ I like Orlando Bloom! He was great in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies."
"__MOVIES__ He's great in Lord of the Rings, too."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Does he have a big part?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. He's one of the nine members of the Fellowship."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure what that means."
"__MOVIES__ Well, there are nine characters who go on a quest to destroy an evil ring."
"__MOVIES__ Does Cate Blanchett's character go on the quest, too? I liked her in the movie Elizabeth."
"__MOVIES__ No, she's not a member of the Fellowship, but she's still an important character. She helps the others on their journey."
"__MOVIES__ That's really cool. Maybe I should rent the movies this weekend."
