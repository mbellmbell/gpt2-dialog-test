"__STAR_WARS__ Which character did you find most annoying in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ C3PO-- I always thought he was such a coward."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know what's funny?  Before I saw the movies, I only had the figures, and since he was gold, I figured he was the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, far from it.  Which character did you find to be most annoying?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely Jar Jar."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he single handedly ruined the Phanton Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ Only a character as moronic as Jar Jar could ruin a movie with Darth Maul."
"__STAR_WARS__ The fight scene with him taking on Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan is the only redeeming thing about that movie.  And, Watto."
"__STAR_WARS__ You like Watto?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah! He was cute in a weird way, and kinda funny."
