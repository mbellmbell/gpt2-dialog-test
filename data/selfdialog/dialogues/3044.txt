"__MUSIC__ I've decided on my dream job."
"__MUSIC__ You find a new dream job every month. What're your thoughts this time?"
"__MUSIC__ I want to be the person who plays music at the baseball games."
"__MUSIC__ The organ guy who plays the 'Duh duh duh duh da-duh... charge!' stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Or girl. But yeah, that job."
"__MUSIC__ Why? It's a horrible job. You're sitting in a cramped booth watching a game."
"__MUSIC__ I'd mess with people so bad."
"__MUSIC__ I should have known this was coming. How would you do that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you know how everything is perfectly timed and rhythmically accurate?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ I'd include extra beats, change the tempo."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds irritating"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I'm not done."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, lordy."
"__MUSIC__ Know who those quick 'songs' of sorts modulate by a half step each time?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the pump-up modulation?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, I'd do random modulations, like by a tritone sometimes, a third another time, a major second..."
"__MUSIC__ That's REALLY annoying. You'd get fired."
"__MUSIC__ I'd love it."
"__MUSIC__ You'd have the job for a month. You know it pays minimum wage right?"
