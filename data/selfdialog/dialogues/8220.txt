"__POP__ Have you hard that new Iggy Azalea song?"
"__POP__ Yeah, it's okay. She's been kind of bad of late."
"__POP__ Yeah she hasn't had much success with the last few singles."
"__POP__ Do you think her star is fading?"
"__POP__ Maybe, we'll have to see. I think maybe people are just sick of her."
"__POP__ Nicki Minaj is still doing well, so it isn't a female rap thing."
"__POP__ I think it's because Iggy isn't authentic. People can tell."
"__POP__ Nicki is authentic at least. You're right, Iggy's Australian isn't she?"
"__POP__ Yeah, but she raps with an American accent."
"__POP__ It's kind of cringey when you think about it."
