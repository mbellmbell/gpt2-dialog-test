"__HORROR__ I'm on the fence about horror movies."
"__HORROR__ What don't you like about them?"
"__HORROR__ I feel that they give me nightmares. I don't like being scared like that."
"__HORROR__ What particularly gives you scared feelings?"
"__HORROR__ Well, take Hitchcock's Psycho. That creepy guy."
"__HORROR__ Oh, you mean the guy who has a strange relationship with his mother?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, the guy who acts her out. That's just disturbing."
"__HORROR__ Well, it is, but it's also fascinating to those who like horror."
"__HORROR__ I do like the cinematics of Sleepy Hollow, though."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, that's a good one."
