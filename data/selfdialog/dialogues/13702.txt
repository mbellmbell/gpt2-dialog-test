"__BASKETBALL__ Ok then how much money do the D league players make?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well consiering NBA players are some of the best payed athletes in the world, in comparison it won;t seem much"
"__BASKETBALL__ How much? On the average?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, they range. From something like 25000 to 13000"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's not much at all."
"__BASKETBALL__ No. It's a barely a life sustaining wage considering the amount of food they have to eat to stay healthy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do they do it? It's amazing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Again, for the chance. If they perform well, they might make it to the big league. It's their dream."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's a big gamble."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not really considering many read at a 5th grader's level."
"__BASKETBALL__ Get out... no way, they went to college?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, for real. They focus on playing the sports from middle school and on. And their academic development gets stalled and schools don't really do anythign about it"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's just plain wrong."
"__BASKETBALL__ So you see why they're willing to get paid 13000 for a dream of being able to play in the big league."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah..."
"__BASKETBALL__ See for me that's what's sad to me. Not that they're rejected and then still holding on to their dreams. But rather, they think they don't have much other options."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh my god stop. You're gonna make me cry."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well if they make it, it's all good and well, but many of them don't. And what do you think they're capable of doing? Their communications degree won't get them a job in a corporate world."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wonder what happens to those who don't get picked in the D leagues. What do they do after a couple of years?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Some get jobs, doing things unrelated to Basketball, others get basketball coaching jobs, and high schools, community colleges, universities. etc."
