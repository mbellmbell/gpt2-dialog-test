"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How often do you like to watch NFL football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty often, who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers since I'm from around Pittsburgh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't like them since I'm from around Philly and like the Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats too bad because I think we are going to win the super bowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? How many more years do you think Ben Roethlisberger has?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure but definitely no more than five."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I can't imagine he'll be playing in the league for much longer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How often do you get to go to the Eagles games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not too often, I usually have to work on Sunday mornings so I never get to actually go to the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Surely you could go when they play Sunday or Monday night!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I could, the last time I went they played the Baltimore Ravens and it was a really good game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's awesome, did you like seeing Joe Flacco play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it was really cool to see him play since he's so good but I didn't like to see him do well against the Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know the Baltimore Ravens used to be the Baltimore Colts?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I did! My dad used to be a big fan of them and the Houston Oilers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Houston used to be the Oilers? That's crazy I thought they were always the Texans!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No! Although the Texans are a really good team nowadays after making it into the playoffs last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah since they got the new head coach Bill O'Brien they've been doing really well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot about that, didn't he coach for a college team recently?"
