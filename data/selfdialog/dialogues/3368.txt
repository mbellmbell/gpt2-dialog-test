"__MUSIC__ Here we go.  Have you ever heard of the band Phish?"

"__MUSIC__ I know, I know.  This band is notorious for being prejudged."
"__MUSIC__ It's just that their fans are so weird."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I actually am very annoyed at their concerts when dealing with certain people."
"__MUSIC__ Then why do you even like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Because every second of it is incredible and worth the trouble."
"__MUSIC__ What in the world is so good about them?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the excitement that is derived from their approach from playing."
"__MUSIC__ What is so special about their approach?"
"__MUSIC__ Well most bands come out and play the songs the same way each night they perform, correct?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and where are we going with this?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Phish does have rehearsed sections, which are still loose."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, those folks are loose alright."
"__MUSIC__ And then there are open sections for improv."
"__MUSIC__ How does that work?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's a chord structure, underlying rhythm patterns and a melody from the rehearsed section of the song."
"__MUSIC__ And with those elements, a story is told?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, but the story is created right in front of you."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I get it.  I think I see the light."
