"__MUSIC__ Who would you say is he most overated artist in music?"
"__MUSIC__ Thats hard to say. Do you mean from a fan standpoint or just in general."
"__MUSIC__ From a fan's standpoint."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say Beyonce then."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think she's overated. She has a lot of good songs."
"__MUSIC__ I don't argue that fact but she and her fans make her out to be some kind of goddess."
"__MUSIC__ Whats wrong with that?"
"__MUSIC__ There are people out there that thank her for things that she has nothing to do with."
"__MUSIC__ Give me an example."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, a fan thanked her because she was given an extra peice of chicken at a fast food resturant."
"__MUSIC__ Was Beyonce there?"
"__MUSIC__ NO! Her reason for thanking her was because she though the news she was having twins some how influenced the resturants descion."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my. That is strange to say the least."
"__MUSIC__ Strange? That is just plain crazy."
"__MUSIC__ I'll admit it's very weird to hear that."
"__MUSIC__ I just feel she is on a pedestal that she really shouldn't be on. Let alone let herself be on."
"__MUSIC__ She can't help it if fans hold her to a certain regard."
"__MUSIC__ Of course she can. If she remained humble she wouldn't act the way she does now."
"__MUSIC__ I guess fame gets to people."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it will always get to you if you let it. Thats why you should always be humble."
