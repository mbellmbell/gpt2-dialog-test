"__DISNEY__ What's your favourite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm, it's hard to pick. Maybe Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Mulan is my favourite Disney Princess for sure but I don't know if it's the best movie they've ever made."
"__DISNEY__ What would you pick?"
"__DISNEY__ I think probably Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Eh, I'm not such a fan of the newer 3D ones."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, come on."
"__DISNEY__ He was in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he's like the second main character."
"__DISNEY__ Huh. Maybe I'll give it a go then."
