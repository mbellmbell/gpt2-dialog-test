"__STAR_WARS__ What's the deal with all the desert planet scenes in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It seems like most of the movies had at least one desert scene"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, not all of them, but yes there seemed to be a lot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke Skywalker lived in Tatooine and they go back to rescue Han from Jabba"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they like the remoteness of the desert planet"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess. Maybe they like the way the light is filmed for production purposes"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it helps show how remote Luke's background is"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's a good point. Lonely life in the desert."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but helps provide perspective."
