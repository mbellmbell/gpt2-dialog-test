"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been to an NFL game before?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Twice, both times with my Auntie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did you afford it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well this was way back in the 1980s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lifetime ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty much. She had season tickets for the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, you told me about that outside winter game you went to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I never understood why anyone would play outside in a frozen tundra like Minnesota. Have an indoor stadium, jeesh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was the other game? Vikings, too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I had just seen urban Cowboy and was interested in Dallas so asked my Aunt to take me there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot you used to travel with her a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And while there we bought same day tickets to see a Cowboys vs Bears game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same day tickets? That's a thing of the past."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it. They were cheap, too. We sat way up in a nose bleed section but I didn't care."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you manage to have any fun at the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure. You know I like the concession stand food!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's all you liked about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, we were seated behind 4 Chicago Bears fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was fun about that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This was back when their team sucked. Bears fans took to wearing paper bays over their heads with cut outs for the eyes to hide their identity. I still have a photo of those 4 guys with bags over their heads with 'Bears Fan' written on them."
