"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think the Han Solo stand alone movie will explain about how he got the Falcon?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope so, and how he met Chewy.  Best team in movie history."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope Lando has some good parts in it too.  One of the most underrated Characters in Star Wars history."
"__STAR_WARS__ He definitely needs plenty of screen time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope Harrison Ford makes some type of appearance in it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like in the beginning, talking to a young Ben Solo before he becomes Kilo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly like that.  I understand Harrison is older than dirt and cannot play young Han but you have to tip your hat to the original."
"__STAR_WARS__ It should be good, I also hope they find a way to get Vader and some other Star Wars characters in there."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm sure they will.  They always do find a way, and I hope they use a good plot device to get them in there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Great way to start the movie, Leah says to Han, 'tell Ben how you met Chewy' Han says 'I've got a bad feeling about this'"
