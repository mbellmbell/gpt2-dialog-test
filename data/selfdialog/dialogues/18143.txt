"__MOVIES__ What is that movie you're watching with Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Demolition Man', another of my guilty pleasures. It's so funny!!"
"__MOVIES__ It looks pretty seriously violent to me! Who's that as the bad guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Wesley Snipes. He's pretty amazing in this, but that's not why I like it."
"__MOVIES__ So tell me why it's funny - does Stallone do comedy?!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. My favorite bit is, 'He doesn't know how to use the shells!'"
"__MOVIES__ I don't get it. What's the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ This really tough police officer gets frozen to deal with a super-villain in the future. he gets unfrozen when the future society can't deal with the villain, and hilarity ensues."
"__MOVIES__ You still haven't sold it for me. Try again."
"__MOVIES__ Imagine a future society that idolizes things like old commercial jingles, actually playing them on the radio. Rock music has been outlawed, and swearing out loud results in your getting a ticket."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds freaky. What else?"
"__MOVIES__ They don't use toilet paper anymore. Instead they use three scallop shells, which they never explain."
"__MOVIES__ This sounds a little juvenile."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is! That's the charm of it. Stallone's character acts like you and me, expressing his horror at the changes in society which have made people so pliable and innocent that they don't even have real sex anymore."
"__MOVIES__ No sex?1 What do they do?They put on these helmets, and they telepathically have sex."
"__MOVIES__ That reminds me a lot of that Woody Allen movie, 'Sleeper'."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yes, you're absolutely right. It's 'Sleeper' and 'Cops' all rolled into one."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I could sit through it, Sandra Bullock as a future cop? That's just creepy."
"__MOVIES__ That's exactly what you're meant to think. But her character really is fun."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'll watch it with you. 'My baloney has a first name!' now that's funny."
