"__HORROR__ So, have you seen any good horror movies recently?"
"__HORROR__ Oh yeah, I actually have. I just saw the new Mummy movie, the one with Tom Cruise."
"__HORROR__ Really? How was it? I heard it wasn't very good. At least it seemed that a lot of critics didn't seem to like it."
"__HORROR__ I actually thought it was pretty good. It was a good, summer tentpole, popcorn movie."
"__HORROR__ What did you like about it? How much was it like the classic Universal monster movies?"
"__HORROR__ Well, I definitely liked how they portrayed the Mummy. She felt both new and interesting, but, at the same time, still grounded in the world of Universal's classic monsters. Also, the overall movie had a neat sort of classic, B-Moive monster movie vibe to it."
"__HORROR__ Oh, that is kind of cool. Where there any other references in the movie to Universal's other monsters?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, there totally were. I don't want to say exactly what they were because I don't want to spoil anything, but I would say definitely keep an eye out when the main characters reach the 'lab.'"
"__HORROR__ That sounds pretty cool! Maybe I will check it out."
"__HORROR__ I would. You will for sure be entertained!"
