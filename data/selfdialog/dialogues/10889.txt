"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think it's actually awkward for Raiders fans to support the team, knowing that they're leaving town in a few years?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I definitely do. They're going to Vegas, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. It must be odd wearing team apparel that you know will be outdated in a few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why fans shoudn't buy anything they can't afford to burn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's pretty funny. I do think it would be cool to see a team in Vegas though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I love that city. But I never thought it would have a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that the city has a good chance of really making good money off of the team considering how many people go through that city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But don't you think that would be a problem, considering the city might not have enough home town fans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think that's what makes having a football team there marketable. It'll be an international favorite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that happening."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, especially since football is becoming more famous overseas. Tourists from other countries might become fans of the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be pretty cool to see the NFL have more international exposure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would probably mean more games overseas like they do now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's actually something I don't like. I hate watching games that are played in London for example."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They aren't too bad. Plus it'd be cool to see more international athletes take up football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just want to make sure that the games aren't affected because the players are jet lagged by the trip."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least the NFL makes sure the schedule accomodates those types of games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if the NFL would think about bringing a team to Canada first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I heard rumors that there might be for the future, but I'm not too sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It definitely would be a cool thing to see more expansion teams."
