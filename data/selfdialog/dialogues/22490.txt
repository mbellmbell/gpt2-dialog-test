"__DISNEY__ I just found out that they may not be doing songs in the Mulan remake!"
"__DISNEY__ I heard something like that too.  It would be a shame."
"__DISNEY__ I loved Christina Agulera's version of Refection."
"__DISNEY__ I loved all of the songs in the movie, they were so motivational."
"__DISNEY__ There really weren't a whole lot of songs in that movie though.  At least not compared to some of the movies."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if it will be the same storyline, and if they will have Mushu."
"__DISNEY__ They would have to have Mushu, he is the funniest character, along with the cricket."
"__DISNEY__ I forget sometimes that Mulan is a war movie, I wonder how they would handle that as a live action movie?"
"__DISNEY__ It is a little darker than most Disney movies. Maybe they would change the actual war movie parts."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know how they would. Fighting the Huns was a pretty big part of the movie."
