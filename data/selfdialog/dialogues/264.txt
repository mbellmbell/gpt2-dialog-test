"__MUSIC__ Were you ever into Whitney Houston?"
"__MUSIC__ I grew up on her. She was my favorite singer for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too. Such a great voice, it's tragic what happened to her."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. What's your favorite song by her?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Run to You off the Bodyguard soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ That is a pretty song but I Will Always Love You is my favorite"
"__MUSIC__ She won so many awards. Did you see the tv movie based on her life?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I did and the woman playing her did a great job."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that and the New Edition story. Her and Bobby Brown had a crazy relationship."
"__MUSIC__ Yes they did. I remember they did a song together a while back."
"__MUSIC__ Right I think it was called Something in Common."
"__MUSIC__ That was it. Him and the rest of New Edition were done so wrong at the beginning."
"__MUSIC__ Right that's what happens when you don't read contracts."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite New Edition song?"
"__MUSIC__ When Will I See You Smile Again. That's a classic."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it is but I have to go further back with Mr. Telephone Man."
"__MUSIC__ The old school song I like from them the best is Is This The End?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a beautiful song. Ralph Trezvant had such a sweet voice."
"__MUSIC__ He really did. Johnny Gill came into the group and really upgraded them though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh he definitely had the best voice of them all."
