"__MOVIES__ I have the kids this weekend and I wanted to take them to see a movie.  I need some ideas"
"__MOVIES__ Have they ever been to a 3-D movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No I am pretty sure they haven't. That's a good idea!"
"__MOVIES__ Let me see what is playing that they may like. Hold on just a minute."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. I know that The Lego Batman Movie is out."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that would be a good one or Emoji Movie."
"__MOVIES__ They are border line age wise starting to like a little older movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well be careful you don't want to insult them by the movie you suggest."
"__MOVIES__ This sounds pretty tricky. Maybe you should come with us."
"__MOVIES__ What and help you navigate through the evening?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that would be nice."
"__MOVIES__ Well let's look for some alternatives to offer."
"__MOVIES__ I trust your judgement. You are much better at picking movies than I am."
"__MOVIES__ Okay so I found that Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars are playing"
"__MOVIES__ Pirates of the Caribbean would be one they would like for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Good then You can give them an option when we pick them up."
"__MOVIES__ Let's get them early enough to go to dinner and then ask them to pick which they would like to do."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds good to me. Just let me know me know what time to be ready."
"__MOVIES__ I will do that. Hey where should we go to eat?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh brother!!! Not that too!!"
