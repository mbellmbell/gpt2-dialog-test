"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hey, you read the books, right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, why?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Did Harry break the Elder Wand in the books?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, he just re-buried it with Dumbledore where anyone could get at it. One of the few film changes I actually liked, though they could've handled it better."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How so?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well in the book, Harry repaired his wand first, remember when Hermione broke it in Hallows Part 1?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But what about the wand he was using during the final battle?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was Draco's, and the movie implies he never gave it back."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well there was a nineteen-year time skip, anything could've happened."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess, I just like the more definitive way the book spelled it out."
