"__HORROR__ Have you seen a scary movie called The Others?"
"__HORROR__ Yes with Nicole Kidman? That was a great movie."
"__HORROR__ I loved it. Never saw the twist at the end coming."
"__HORROR__ They did a good job of hiding it. I can understand her reasons though."
"__HORROR__ Nicole Kidman's characters reasons for what she did?"
"__HORROR__ Well not for murdering the children but for everything she did as a ghost when she thought they were alive."
"__HORROR__ Oh right. She thought they had a serious photosensitivity to light and she tried to protect him."
"__HORROR__ Right. It was sad because you could see she loved them, she just went insane."
"__HORROR__ I can't believe people used to take pictures of their dead sitting up and posed."
"__HORROR__ That was probably one of the creepiest parts of the movie, those photos of the dead."
