"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Wonderwoman movie that just came out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was awesome! What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Well a stupid friend of mine asked, 'does she even twirl?' which I thought was funny, but yeah, I LOVED it!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too, it was so amazing to see her presented as an Amazon warrior."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you could totally tell it was directed by a woman."
"__MOVIES__ Amazing job, just amazing."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the CGI?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was great.  Well balanced and not too over the top like other action movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the fight scenes, and the trench warfare were insane."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember when she just walked across no man's land while all the Germans were shooting at her?"
"__MOVIES__ I know right? talk about one bad ass woman!"
"__MOVIES__ She was such a bad ass.  And such a cute little girl too."
"__MOVIES__ Aww, the young Diana was so cute doing her little fighting moves."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't take long to grow up though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and when she rescued the hot hunk of a soldier..."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god was he fine. 'Bigger than average' apparently too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh he was so sexy in that weirdly blue lit pool, water dripping off his naked body."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and when they were upstairs together."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my, the director better left it unseen"
"__MOVIES__ I know right! Isn't the imagination much better at filling in what might have happened up there?"
