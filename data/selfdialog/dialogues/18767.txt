"__MOVIES__ Do you know of any good movies to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ What kind do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like almost all genres, but I'm really feeling a romantic comedy right now"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'Me Before You'?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so..."
"__MOVIES__ It has that blonde chic from Game of Thrones in it"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love her!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I read the book a couple years ago and I'm not a big book-to-movie fan, but they did a really good job on this one!"
"__MOVIES__ What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about an adventurous guy who gets into an accident and becomes a paraplegic. His parents hire someone to take care of him and it ends up being a romantic comedy, with a twist at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Twist?!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I'm not going to tell you because I don't want to ruin it."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, okay. But it's a romantic comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, just what you're looking for."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Emilia Clarke is the Game of Thrones girl, and Sam Claflin is the other big star. He played in 'Love, Rosie' another book-to-movie that is great!"
"__MOVIES__ I think I remember him!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah so definitely check it out and let me know how you like it!"
"__MOVIES__ Would you be up for watching it with me?"
"__MOVIES__ of course!"
