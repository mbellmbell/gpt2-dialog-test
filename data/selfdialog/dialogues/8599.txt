"__BEATLES__ What did you think of the musical adaptations of the Beatles songs in the movie 'Across the Universe'?"
"__BEATLES__ I really enjoyed them actually."
"__BEATLES__ Yea me too."
"__BEATLES__ I was nice to hear different people sing the songs, like when the girl was singing 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'."
"__BEATLES__ Yea, they slowed the song down and make it less rockish and more intense."
"__BEATLES__ I also really liked Evan Rachel Wood's adaptation of 'Blackbird'."
"__BEATLES__ Yea? I wasn't such a fan of that one."
"__BEATLES__ Why not?"
"__BEATLES__ I mean it sounded good, but I just don't think it was better than the original."
"__BEATLES__ Yea, I can see that. The original had the guitar and I think in the movie they had some instrument that sounded like an accordion."
