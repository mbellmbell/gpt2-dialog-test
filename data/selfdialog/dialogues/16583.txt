"__MOVIES__ Is it just me or are there a lot less huge hit family movies than when we were kids?"
"__MOVIES__ What about The Lego Movie or Inside Out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I mean more live action. Like E.T."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I love E.T."
"__MOVIES__ That's my point. There aren't really any more family movies that we would call a classic."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty subjective though."
"__MOVIES__ True. Maybe it's more that I was a child of the 80s and therefore feel closer to those movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably a big part of it."
"__MOVIES__ There were a lot though: Back to the Future, Big, The Goonies, The Karate Kid, Honey I Shrunk the Kids..."
"__MOVIES__ Those were really great films."
"__MOVIES__ And they were great for all ages. Movies today seem to be geared to one age group."
"__MOVIES__ Except for the animated ones."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and even though those can be entertaining for adults, they're not exactly made for adults."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it would be weird to see a theater of just adults watching a Pixar film."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe there are just more movies now so they get lost faster."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like slip through the cracks?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like it's harder to be a hit because everything has to compete with so much content."
"__MOVIES__ It would be interesting to see how a movie like E.T. would do in the situation of today."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure adult me would have been as touched."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, maybe not."
