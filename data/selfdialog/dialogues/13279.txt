"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been following the offseason news?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I do everyday"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the biggest story according to you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the bears signing Mike Glennon for such a huge amount of money"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I agree, what were they thinking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously they weren't thinking"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then they turned around and drafted a quarterback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must've felt bad for Glennon"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would be mad if I were him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard the head coach didn't even know the bears were gonna do that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I would've felt betrayed by that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the coach certainly did"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the bears are in a bad place for the upcoming year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they deserve it with those horrible off season moves"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel bad for the fans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know a few personally, and they really are starting to hate the team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then they should make some changes without a doubt"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like some of those may be coming"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be for the better though, the Bears cannot get much worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least the fans can find solace in that"
