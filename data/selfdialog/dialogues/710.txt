"__MUSIC__ Who are the worst artists of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ I gotta give Limp Bizkit the nod.  Even beyond how juvenile their songs are, Fred Durst's whiny voice would ruin a brilliant song."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really care for Bjork.  I used to know people who were really into her music, and I thought it was crap, and she was a nut."
"__MUSIC__ What are some overrated bands, in your opinion?"
"__MUSIC__ Nirvana.  I like them, but people act like Kurt Cobain was such a genius because he died young."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed-- Rolling Stone said he was the artist of the decade a while back, and I was thinking not even close."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they had a few catchy songs.  It'd be like saying the guy from Dexy's Midnight Runners was artist of the decade for the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ Come On Eileen is better than Nirvana's entire catalogue."
"__MUSIC__ You can't trust Rolling Stone at all-- they have no credibility."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I remember they called R. Kelly a genius for his awful Trapped in the Closet series."
"__MUSIC__ When they lost all credibility with me was when they claimed Jack White was a better guitarist than Dave Gilmour."
"__MUSIC__ Pink Floyd is a legendary band.  Jack White is a guy who people think may've married his sister."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, yeah, but he was big at the time, so they had to toe that corporate line."
"__MUSIC__ What're some other overrated bands, in your opinion?"
"__MUSIC__ Sublime.  Once again, I like a few songs of theirs, but not as good as everyone says."
"__MUSIC__ I completely agree with that!  The lyrics to their songs sound like what a 12 year old would write."
"__MUSIC__ I never saw the big deal about Madonna, either.  Once again, a few catchy songs, but I wouldn't pay 100s of dollars to see her in concert."
"__MUSIC__ What's your guilty pleasure?  Something you listen to that you'd rather others not know about?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really care what people think of my music tastes, but I'd say Tahiti 80-- this French pop band."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, for me, it's George Michael."
