"__MOVIES__ Did you watch Set It Off last night?"
"__MOVIES__ You know I did. That's one of my favorite flicks."
"__MOVIES__ I like it but I never liked that raggedy detective."
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ The one that thought Vivica Fox had something to do with the first robbery that Darnell and them did."
"__MOVIES__ I know right. He was just all out of pocket thinking it was an inside job."
"__MOVIES__ Man you know you right. It was messed up how the cops killed Jada's brother."
"__MOVIES__ He was wrong place wrong time. Little clown should have never gotten that haircut."
"__MOVIES__ He didn't want to go to college. He was scared to tell his sister that he didn't get in."
"__MOVIES__ I know but remember how Jada went and slept with the old dude for them ten stacks?"
"__MOVIES__ Dude was crazy. I ain't paying ten stacks to sleep with nobody."
"__MOVIES__ Then you had Queen Latifah acting out all like a lesbian and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ I think she was a lesbian in real life."
"__MOVIES__ Man, that don't matter. Remember slimey Luther when he stole their money?"
"__MOVIES__ They was dumb enough to stash the money at they job."
"__MOVIES__ I know that's right. That money would have been stashed right at the crib."
"__MOVIES__ If he wouldn't have robbed them they wouldn't have hit another bank."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know. I'm glad that at least somebody made away with some cash at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you talking about Jada on the bus?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. The detective saw her at the end but let her go because he felt sorry for her brother getting killed."
