"__DISNEY__ After Beauty and the Beast, what other classic movie do you think they will turn into a live-action film?"
"__DISNEY__ I heard they plan to do that with the Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think that would work? Since there aren't any people in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ They will be using CGI animals."
"__DISNEY__ Isn't that basically the same as animating them?"
"__DISNEY__ Pretty similar I guess. But it will look more real."
"__DISNEY__ I love the Lion King and the music is great, so I would still go see it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I would too."
"__DISNEY__ I guess it is a good idea for Disney to do."
"__DISNEY__ I guess so too."
