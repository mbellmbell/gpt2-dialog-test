"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so excited that the Last Jedi is coming out this year."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too! They've really stepped up the fight choreography in these newer movies so I'm hoping for some awesome light saber action."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I like the fight stuff but the big thing for me is to find out what happened to make Luke Skywalker walk away from everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not as interested in the mythology, I just want to see people bashing each other with awesome weapons."
"__STAR_WARS__ But who could even really fight him if he's the only Jedi left."
"__STAR_WARS__ He'll fight Kylo Ren and get revenge for him killing Han Solo in Force Awakens!"
"__STAR_WARS__ OK, number one, Jedi's don't get revenge, that leads to the dark side.  Number two, he should be able to take out Kylo Ren in about two seconds."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way! The dark side makes you more powerful, that's how two Sith were able to cause a whole legion of Jedi trouble."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kylo Ren is a big whiny woos who just sits around and complains.  Luke Skywalker trained with Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda, he'll destroy Kylo Ren while he's crying about how hard it is to pull against the light."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Supreme Leader Snoke?  He's going to complete Kylo's training and then there will be an epic battle."
