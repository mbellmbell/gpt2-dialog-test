"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the nicest player in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard that Russell Wilson is pretty good with fans, especially young ones"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've seen him on the news visiting children's hospitals in Seattle"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of players do that, like Andy Dalton in Cincinnati with his wife, if I remember right"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of players and their wives, I see a lot about Eli Manning and his wife making pretty sizeable donations"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Donating money is great, of course, but seeing players out there volunteering is pretty awesome"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of my favorite NFL videos that isn't game-related is seeing J. J. Watt passing the ball back and forth with young fans before a game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ J. J. Watt seems like a pretty cool guy, considering he's huge and those pictures of him covered in blood are kind of terrifying"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's just a big teddy bear who loves the game and loves life"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When players are enjoying themselves, it makes them a lot more fun to watch"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, like Odell Beckham Jr. when he's in a good mood"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kirk Cousins has that video where he's yelling, 'You like that!' and now it's like his catchphrase"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cousins is pretty popular as a nice guy and all around good player"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they'll trade him to the 49ers like the rumors have been saying?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but I hope that they do so he brings some of that positivity to San Francisco"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does seem like the team has been down in the dumps for a while, what with the lousy records and all their players leaving or retiring"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a pretty nice guy too in Joe Staley; he's a character"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't really see offensive linemen being super popular like that, so it's a nice change of pace"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or fullbacks like John Kuhn, who I think should have been kept in Green Bay"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the NFL for you, though, and the Saints are another team that could do with some uplifting"
