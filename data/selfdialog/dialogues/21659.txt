"__DISNEY__ I saw on Facebook that you watched Inside Out last night."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yea. I loved it."
"__DISNEY__ Yea me too. I think the message is so great. It's telling kids it's okay to be sad sometimes."
"__DISNEY__ Yea definitely. It's going to be one of the first movies I watch with my kids for sure."
"__DISNEY__ Yea. I just hope they don't confuse me with Bing Bong. We have the same taste in clothes."
"__DISNEY__ I loved Bing Bong! You definitely dress like him."
"__DISNEY__ I don't smell like cotton candy like him."
"__DISNEY__ There's probably perfume that smells like that."
"__DISNEY__ I loved Riley in the movie too."
"__DISNEY__ Yea I wish I could play hockey like her. She was really cool."
