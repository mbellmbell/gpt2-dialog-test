"__MOVIES__ Did you catch Step Brothers on TV last night?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but I'm not a fan of it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's not good to hear."
"__MOVIES__ The jokes didn't really land for me, delivery seemed off."
"__MOVIES__ Well to be fair it was on cable and a lot of censored."
"__MOVIES__ Oh then why would you tell me to watch it there?"
"__MOVIES__ Was just a suggestion, it was on TV so why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to watch it on DVD then, because I didn't hate it, just not a fan."
"__MOVIES__ The movie is very vulgar and a lot of jokes land because of it."
"__MOVIES__ If the jokes are good though does it need the profanity?"
"__MOVIES__ I think you can argue that sometimes profanity makes the joke."
"__MOVIES__ Can't anyone just make a profane joke then?"
"__MOVIES__ The joke still needs to be funny, there's a reason not everyone is a successful comedian."
"__MOVIES__ True, I guess I'm just a little bummed I spent two hours watching this and didn't laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me watch the movie uncut and you'll get some payoff laughs."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, do you have it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I have the DVD, I will bring it the next time we see each other."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good, bring me some complimentary snacks in case I still don't like it."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa wait what is this now?"
"__MOVIES__ It's my new thing for recommending me movies I don't enjoy."
