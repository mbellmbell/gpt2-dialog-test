"__DISNEY__ Hey, have you seen the new Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Only the 2016 ones, I haven't see any 2017 Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ So, which one did you see?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw Zootopia and Moana"
"__DISNEY__ I saw those two movies too, they were very popular."
"__DISNEY__ What you think of them?"
"__DISNEY__ I only watched Moana for Dwayne Johnson...wasn't as magical as previous Disney movies, but not bad."
"__DISNEY__ What about Zootopia?"
"__DISNEY__ Ehh, not as wonderful as I though it would be, but still a good quality movie."
"__DISNEY__ I think there's a little propaganda in there. But that's everything nowadays."
