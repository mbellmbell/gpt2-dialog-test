"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Dr.Strange yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have."
"__MOVIES__ I loved it, though it wasn't quite what I expected."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I was expecting less of the 'how he got that way', more about after."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought that a bit, too, but I didn't really know the character's backstory at all, so I appreciated it."
"__MOVIES__ That's true; one of those movies that is setting up for the sequel."
"__MOVIES__ What about the special effects?"
"__MOVIES__ They were wonderful! Of course, the cape settling itself on his shoulders is bound to be iconic."
"__MOVIES__ Nice cape to have on your side!"
"__MOVIES__ No kidding! Some of the special effects took 'Inception' to the next level."
"__MOVIES__ Loved the wandering through dimensions, too."
"__MOVIES__ Benedict Cumberbatch was terrific as Strange."
"__MOVIES__ He was perfect! As a skilled and arrogant surgeon, to lose his ability to use that skill."
"__MOVIES__ And what he was willing to do to get that skill back."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the Benjamin Bratt cameo, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Don't forget Tilda Swinton; it was so easy to believe her character."
"__MOVIES__ All the actors seemed so well chosen, they all seemed to belong."
"__MOVIES__ I sure hope there's a sequel coming out!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so do I! won't be fast enough!"
