"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the movie Flubber with Robin Williams?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I seen that long time ago though."
"__DISNEY__ I just watched it again recently and it was just as funny as when it first came out."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I bet, even though it seems so different since Robin passed away though."
"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite parts of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I love the basketball game scene, if only we could actually have our very own Flubber that would be so cool."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think it is actually possible for that kind of thing to actually happen though?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure it could happen if they have the right equipment and funding."
"__DISNEY__ What did you think about the ending with the wedding?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought that was cute and then flying off in the car was just awesome."
