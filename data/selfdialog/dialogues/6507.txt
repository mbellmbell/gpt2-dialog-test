"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about how the Star Wars movies portrayed Anakin's transformation to Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was done well I think. He went from an innocent little boy in 'Phantom Menace' to a full-fledged Sith in 'Revenge of the Sith.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I think the movies did a good job showing how Senator Palpatine manipulated him as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that actor did a good job. He gave off such a creepy vibe."
"__STAR_WARS__ And while I wasn't a huge fan of Hayden Christiansen as Anakin, he did an alright job and I enjoyed the movies he was in."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ewan McGregor really stole the show though, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! He was so awesome as Obi Wan! I don't think they could have picked a better actor for that role."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, and I really thought he added a new depth and layer to the whole Obi Wan and Anakin relationship."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, such a tragic storyline."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but at least Anakin found his way again before he died in 'Return of the Jedi.'"
