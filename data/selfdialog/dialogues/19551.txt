"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen a good movie in such a long time."
"__MOVIES__ I can make some suggestions if you'd like."
"__MOVIES__ What have you seen lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I recently saw Now You See Me 2."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the first one when it came out back in 2013. Was the second one better?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say it was a little better. They basically took what made the first movie so great and multiplied it."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds incredible. I remember Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, and Dave Franco were in the first one."
"__MOVIES__ They are also in the second one. A new actress in the sequel is Lizzy Caplan."
"__MOVIES__ I know her from The Interview! She is a beautiful actress!"
"__MOVIES__ She does a great job in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ I will definitely have to see this especially since Lizzie is in the new one!"
"__MOVIES__ Let me know what you think of it. Have you heard of Masterminds yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I know that Zach Galifianakis is in it so it must be good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he is a funny but odd guy. He fits in great in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ That is good to know. I definitely have to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Zach and Kristen Wiig have great chemistry in it."
"__MOVIES__ She is a wonderful actress as well!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes she is and very pretty."
"__MOVIES__ I started out today not knowing any movies to see and now I have two that I really want to see!"
"__MOVIES__ Glad I could help. Enjoy the movies!"
