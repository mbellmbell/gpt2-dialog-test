"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, sometimes in the NFL you just have to start rebuilding."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree, but the Seahawks are definitely not at that point yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I'm just trying to see that its hard to sustain winning without any period of losing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, you are right, but a few teams have done it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well with the salary cap, it puts the pressure on making the most of your money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, but two or three bad contracts and your team is in a bad hole."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that is why it is so important to take advantage of the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, teams that do that end up in bad situations from overspending in free agency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! Teams like the Redskins do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea and they haven't experienced much winning, have they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all. They sometimes have a good year or two, but never sustain anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Then you look at the packers who win year after year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, because they build the right way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea! Have you ever seen their roster? They were almost all drafted by the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is an incredible accomplishment!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, not many teams can say that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! Trades and free agency fill needs. Not built teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats exactly right! The teams who realize that are most successful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, its not rocket science, but some owners and GM's just like to open up the checkbooks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, without thinking. Always a wise choice."
