"__STAR_WARS__ To me, the best Star Wars is the first one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, me too, I love it!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is still visually stunning, even after all these years."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I love the scenes when they are flying in space, it looks real!"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Death Star looks so ominous sitting there like a planet that is meant just for attacking other planets."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, was the the Star Wars where they all got stuck in that garbage place?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean that gross room that had the walls closing in, it was compacting the trash?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and Chewy was barking about the smell!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I laughed at that, I don't know if Chewy is a dog man, a bear man or what!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hey's he's a Chewbacca oops, I mean a Wookie!"
