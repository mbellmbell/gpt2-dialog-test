"__BASEBALL__ Hey, last night I went to the Mariners game."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? Nice. Who were they playing?"
"__BASEBALL__ They were playing against their main rival."
"__BASEBALL__ Hmm, you must be talking about the Oakland A's then!"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly! You must be a true fan then if you know that!"
"__BASEBALL__ Well yeah, I've been going to Mariners games since the Kingdome days!"
"__BASEBALL__ Ahh yes, the good ole Kingdome! I actually kind of miss that place."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, me too, but Safeco field is much nice. You have to admit it."
"__BASEBALL__ I do. It's a great place to play baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ So anyway, I didn't catch the game last night. Did the M's win or what?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah, it was a tight game for a while but then we broke out in the bottom of the seventh and scored 3 off a 3 run homer with 2 outs."
"__BASEBALL__ Nice, always good to beat the A's."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes it is. With that win we swept the series against them in Seattle."
"__BASEBALL__ Where did you sit?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I have season tickets so I sit in the same spot which is just behind the visitors dugout, 4 rows deep."
"__BASEBALL__ You have season tickets? Hmm, I didn't know that! Very nice indeed. Is it worth it?"
"__BASEBALL__ It is nice but only if you are going to making it to most games. If you can't make it then you are wasting your money."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you get any foul balls?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nope, had one that came close but the guy behind me was a bit quicker."
"__BASEBALL__ Ahh, too bad. I remember one year I snagged a home run in left field with my bare hands, It was back in the Kingdome days. Seattle was playing against Minnesota and I was set up in left field for batting practice. I can't remember who it the homer but I know it was someone on the Twins. That was an epic day for me!"
