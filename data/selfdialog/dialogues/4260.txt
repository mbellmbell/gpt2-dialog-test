"__MUSIC__ How did you like the wedding last night?"
"__MUSIC__ It was a lot of fun, but the music could have been better!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I totally agree."
"__MUSIC__ It just seemed like a lot of the same old wedding music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah when the DJ played Old Time Rock and Roll I wanted to die!"
"__MUSIC__ Totally."
"__MUSIC__ And then he played We Are Family!?"
"__MUSIC__ Ugh, I know!"
"__MUSIC__ What did you think of the DJ?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he didn't play YMCA... so I'd say he wasn't terrible!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's true!"
"__MUSIC__ I think if I were to get married I'd give the DJ a specific list of songs to play."
"__MUSIC__ And songs to not play!"
"__MUSIC__ You're right, that's probably more important!"
"__MUSIC__ I'd want to play songs people know, but also songs people enjoy."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed."
"__MUSIC__ I really hate the traditional wedding music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think people know to expect the same old stuff at a wedding!"
"__MUSIC__ Well when one of us gets married, we'll show them all the good stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like a plan!"
