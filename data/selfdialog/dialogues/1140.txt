"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favourite Newsboys song?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, it used to be Entertaining Angels, but I kind of like Take Me To Your Leader."
"__MUSIC__ I love the creative writing on that one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it took me years before I made the connection of what he was trying to say with the names."
"__MUSIC__ I feel that way about the puns in 'Breakfast'."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. I miss the old Newsboys."
"__MUSIC__ You don't like them now with Michael Tait?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't even care for them before that. I thought the last album they put out before changing lead singers wasn't even that creative."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the songs were definitely more original and funny when they started out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, now they're just trying to sell in mainstream Christian markets."
"__MUSIC__ They used to be so unapolagetic in a witty and confrontational way."
"__MUSIC__ Like with 'I'm Not Ashamed' and 'God is Not a Secret'."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I wish more artists were honest about when it's time to throw in the towel."
"__MUSIC__ They still have to make a living."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure Peter Furler had made enough money at that point that he didn't need to worry about that."
"__MUSIC__ You're probably true."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I take it kind of personally because that was like my favourite band growing up and to see it take a turn for the worse makes me sad."
"__MUSIC__ I don't blame you. They put out a lot of high quality stuff though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. And they are all getting older and evolving, I can't expect them to stay the same forever."
"__MUSIC__ Just keep enjoying their older stuff that's still good."
