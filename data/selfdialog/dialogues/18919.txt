"__MOVIES__ Rank the Star Wars movies from best to worst."
"__MOVIES__ Do I include The Clone Wars?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, since it's canon."
"__MOVIES__ Okay: Rogue One, Episode V, Episode VII, Episode III, Episode VI, Episode II, Episode I, The Clone Wars."
"__MOVIES__ WHAT? Blasphemy!"
"__MOVIES__ Which part?"
"__MOVIES__ Episode V is by far superior to everything."
"__MOVIES__ It's really not. It's one of those that's really good but not so much on subsequent viewings."
"__MOVIES__ So why is Rogue better?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, modern technology alone gives it the appeal. It has more unexpected elements like the laser machine gun ... which he reloads!"
"__MOVIES__ True, I've never seen a weapon reloaded or even low in the Star Wars movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know you're not done digging into me."
"__MOVIES__ Duh. Why III over VI?"
"__MOVIES__ VI is awful and was made to market to kids. The happy ending and teddy bears overthrowing the empire?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but they're cute!"
"__MOVIES__ But teddy bears can't fight. And Luke and Leia JUST met them."
"__MOVIES__ You don't think a bunch of teddy bears can defeat a bunch of AT-ATs?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not even in the dense forest setting."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously, why were they there?"
"__MOVIES__ No idea. The emperor is an idiot for thinking that was the appropriate response for a jungle battle."
