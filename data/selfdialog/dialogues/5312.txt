"__STAR_WARS__ I love to watch old school Star wars movies how about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! The new ones are just not as good."
"__STAR_WARS__ I did like the newest one because it had princess Leia and Han solo but it was missing Luke skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree and I just don't see Leia and Han's son turning evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree and  I like how it gave way to more sequels but then again 7 was enough."
"__STAR_WARS__ 8 if you count Rogue one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I haven't seen that one yet because it goes completely away from the main characters of Leia,Han,and Skywalker and their families."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes but I hear it is really good, better than Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea I didn't care for the actor playing Anakin/ Darth Vader in that one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes and I like that they explained Darth Vader's back story in those Pre-quels but it  wasn't a nearly as good as the original star wars trilogy."
