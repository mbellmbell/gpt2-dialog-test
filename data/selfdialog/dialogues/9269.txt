"__BASEBALL__ Do you think the Pirates have a chance at getting to the World Series this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not sure, I haven't really been following their lineup.  I'm rooting for the Yankees!"
"__BASEBALL__ How can you like the Yankees?  They are only good because they have so much money, they can buy a championship."
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees are a historic institution.  They don't do anything that every other team would do if they had the money."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree that they have a very rich history, but they seem so snobby.  Like they feel they have earned the right to win, like it is expected."
"__BASEBALL__ Say what you will but have you ever been to Yankee Stadium?  It's like magic."
"__BASEBALL__ I've been a couple of times. Nothing like seeing the Yankees play the Red Sox!"
"__BASEBALL__ The best games I've ever seen have been the Yankees versus the Sox.  The crowd is just electric!"
"__BASEBALL__ Completely agreed.  That's when you can see the true spirit of the MLB, you can just feel the energy and passion."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't wait to bring my kids one day to see one of those games.  It's like a family tradition."
"__BASEBALL__ I love the traditionalism of Yankee Stadium.  It isn't one of the fancy stadiums catering to the wealthy."
"__BASEBALL__ Remember when the Arizona Diamondbacks stadium was opened?  They had a swimming pool!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know, it was ridiculous!  We're here to watch baseball, not have a college party!"
"__BASEBALL__ I do admit though that the Yankees have their faults though.  They have premium seating that is beyond expensive."
"__BASEBALL__ Is the premium seating just at a better section of the ballpark?  Or are there rules?"
"__BASEBALL__ I believe it is the first four or five rows behind the Yankees dugout."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't even imagine being that close.  I always end up higher up, more often then not in the nosebleed."
"__BASEBALL__ It isn't a huge deal though.  Half of the fun is the spirit and the energy of the ballpark, not the seats."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree with you somewhat, but it would be exhilarating to sit that close, be able to hear conversations in the dugout."
"__BASEBALL__ One day maybe you'll sit there!  I bet the Yankees have contests for tickets, we should look that up!"
