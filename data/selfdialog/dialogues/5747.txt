"__STAR_WARS__ How many films are there in the star wars series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I guess there are the first three from the seventies and eighties then the prequel three in the two thousands and now they are making the newer series"
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus was there not also a cartoon?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think there was but it wasn't very popular among adults but I think they took the cartoon story line and made that a part of the video game"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow I remember playing the pod racer game on the nintendo back in the day but that was a part of the franchise for episode one"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say that episode one is my least favorite. I just hate jar jar binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure that was the most useless racist character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus the fact that he was completely computer generated so the actual on screen time looked so cheesey"
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like that was something unnecessary for them to do, they could have had a more real feeling from the use of a real actor."
"__STAR_WARS__ In all the movies I hated no character more than jar jar binks."
