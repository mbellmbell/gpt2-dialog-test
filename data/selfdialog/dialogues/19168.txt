"__MOVIES__ OK, I've got a movie scenario for you: You have an unlimited budget, and you get to cast three lead actors/actresses. Who do you pick?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough question. What kind of movie are we talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean genre?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, is it a sci fi movie, a comedy, a drama, a thriller?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's say it's whatever genre of movies you want it to be."
"__MOVIES__ Then I'm going to go with Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, and Jessica Chastain."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, interesting choice. Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Leo is a fabulous actor, and as his performance in Django Unchained showed, he can play a villain."
"__MOVIES__ True, he was willing to be unsympathetic. In Wolf of Wall Street too."
"__MOVIES__ So I'd use him as somewhat of a villain. Bale would be more heroic, though not perfect."
"__MOVIES__ Bale was pretty good in The Prestige as a hero with flaws. And he rocked as Batman."
"__MOVIES__ The true hero would be Jessica Chastain. I think she was amazing in Zero Dark 30."
"__MOVIES__ I never saw that one. That was the one where she was a CIA operative?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, she did a great job. An intelligent, nuanced performance."
"__MOVIES__ So, you've got your dream team. What kind of movie would it be?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking it would be some kind of corporate thriller."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, interesting. Most people wouldn't make a movie about corporation if given the chance!"
"__MOVIES__ I think with that cast, you could make just about any movie you wanted and it would be great."
"__MOVIES__ True. Do you want to hear my list of actors?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe next time - I've got to go!"
