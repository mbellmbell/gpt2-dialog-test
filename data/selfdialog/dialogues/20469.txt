"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Bridget Jones' Baby?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I watched it on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I honestly thought it was just ok. Bridget Jones' Diary was better."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I thought it was a bit contrived."
"__MOVIES__ Though I didn't mind that Patrick Dempsey was in it! He's so hot!"
"__MOVIES__ You're funny... everyone I've talked to seem to be more into Colin Firth."
"__MOVIES__ True. I still can't believe how different Rene Zellweger looks."
"__MOVIES__ I know! She looks totally different. She was so pretty before she had all that surgery! What a waste!"
"__MOVIES__ She does look different, but I guess to each their own."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about Colin ending up being the dad instead of the other guy?"
"__MOVIES__ I figured. She needed a happy ending, but I guess the other guy stayed in their lives. That was a little weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought so too. But it's a movie, so they have to write off all the storylines."
"__MOVIES__ Unless they make another movie!"
"__MOVIES__ They better not! They'll ruin the whole thing for younger people. Bridget Jones' Diary is so under appreciated."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, leave it to Hollywood to ruin a good thing!"
"__MOVIES__ Are you surprised though? Every sequel is pretty bad. Except for Despicable Me 2. That's the best sequel ever!"
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Let's hope they don't keep making Bridget Jones movies. Put the money into a new film!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Although, if they make another, I'd honestly probably go see it. I'm a sucker!"
