"__BEATLES__ Have you seen across the universe, the movie?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I loved it so much."
"__BEATLES__ Me too. i don't know why it was not better received critically."
"__BEATLES__ I am baffled as well. I see something new and powerful in it each new viewing."
"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite cover in it?"
"__BEATLES__ I think while my guitar gently weeps was very well done. The vocals those actors have were so raw and emotion filled."
"__BEATLES__ Martin Luther McCoy was the actor who sang that one."
"__BEATLES__ I think I enjoyed his version even more than the original."
"__BEATLES__ That is saying something, to out do a beatle."
"__BEATLES__ It is indeed. I really did feel his vocals were just that powerful on an already great song."
