"__MUSIC__ It's funny how you can hear a song for years, and not understand what the words are."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, like on Elton John's 'Rocket Man'. What's he saying, 'Burning up his air out there, alone?'"
"__MUSIC__ Something like that. I didn't know myself until I heard the William Shatner version."
"__MUSIC__ Those are fun. Or trying to understand what Elton John's saying on 'Yellow Brick Road'."
"__MUSIC__ Or 'Bennie And The Jets'. I still don't know the words."
"__MUSIC__ My brother for years and years thought that Creedence Clearwater Revival was singing about 'A Bathroom On The Right'."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, on 'Bad Moon Rising'? It DOES sound like that."
"__MUSIC__ I still like to think that the lead singer on the 'Yes' albums is a female. Because that's what I thought when I was a kid."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame how some performers are ignored in their own country, like Suzi Quatro."
"__MUSIC__ She's WORSHIPED in Europe, but I know what you mean. Like Jerry Lewis is popular in France."
"__MUSIC__ And David Hasselhoff is a big music star in Austria and Germany."
"__MUSIC__ Suzi Quatro played one mean, big guitar. I remember her '48 Crash' song, years ago. Whatever that was about."
"__MUSIC__ I think there are YouTube videos of that. She was kind of a punk rocker, like the way they tried to do for Joan Jett."
"__MUSIC__ Or Elvis Costello or even Blondie!"
"__MUSIC__ I remember when Elvis Costello appeared on 'Saturday Night Live' for the first time, around 1975 or 1976."
"__MUSIC__ Well, his 'Watching the Detectives' does sound kind of punk."
"__MUSIC__ The funny thing is, we thought his song was a comedy skit, a put on."
"__MUSIC__ Like the Blues Brothers, when they first got on stage."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Or Leon Redbone, who looked like Elliot Gould in disguise as a musician."
"__MUSIC__ Leon Redbone? With the giant tuba and blues songs? Wow, I haven't seen him in years."
