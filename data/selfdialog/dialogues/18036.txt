"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I actually just watched that movie with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt."
"__MOVIES__ Passengers?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I've been wanting to see that one, he's one of my favorite actors."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I haven't watched much with him in it, just Passengers and the first Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__MOVIES__ You should really watch Parks and Recreation, it's hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of that."
"__MOVIES__ It's a comedy show with him and Amy Pohler, I like it a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I'll have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Anyways, how was passengers?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really good actually, I liked the whole premise behind it."
"__MOVIES__ It looks good, and all the reviews for it are pretty good too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they weren't wrong."
"__MOVIES__ I really want to see the new Guardians of the Galaxy too."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, Groot makes me laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's funny, but I'm more of a fan of the action in the movies, I never thought Chris Pratt would turn into an action star."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I didn't either, but I never really saw him in his comedy roles."
"__MOVIES__ You should definitely check them out."
"__MOVIES__ I probably will now."
