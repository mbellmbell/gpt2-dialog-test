"__COMEDY__ What's a good movie to make me laugh?"
"__COMEDY__ Have you seen 'Clerks?' One of Kevin Smith's best movies, in my opinion."
"__COMEDY__ I've actually never seen it. I loved Dogma though."
"__COMEDY__ Dogma was great. George Carlin was so funny in that."
"__COMEDY__ What other movies has Kevin Smith done?"
"__COMEDY__ He's done a lot, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back."
"__COMEDY__ Didn't he do a movie with Jennifer Lopez?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, it was Jersey Girl. Its not funny at all, so don't bother."
"__COMEDY__ I guess I'll start with Clerks and go on from there."
"__COMEDY__ Try to watch them in order. You can watch Kevin Smith grow as a director."
