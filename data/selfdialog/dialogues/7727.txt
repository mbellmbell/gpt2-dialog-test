"__POP__ I heard the song by Taylor Swift and Zayn is in the top most played songs this year."
"__POP__ What song is that?"
"__POP__ I Don't Wanna Live Forever.  It's off the soundtrack for Fifty Shades Darker."
"__POP__ I don't think I've heard that."
"__POP__ Really?  It's been all over the radio.  Well its sort of died off now but it was played nonstop earlier this year."
"__POP__ One song that I've heard played a lot this year is Ed Sheeran's Shape of You."
"__POP__ I love that song.  It's a lot more pop sounding than most of his other songs."
"__POP__ I heard the guys helping him produce it had it in mind for someone more like Rihanna but then Ed sang part of it and they decided to just go with it for him."
"__POP__ That's really neat.  I like when artists change up their sound a little bit."
"__POP__ Me too, it helps keep things fresh. His Divide album is absolutely fantastic."
