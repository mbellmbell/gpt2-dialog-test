"__MUSIC__ What do you think of disco music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I was always sort of trained to dislike it, by the larger culture of white, male rock fans."
"__MUSIC__ You mean that crowd that turned out for Disco Demolition Night and blew up all those records?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, see, and the thing is that today we understand that anger as reactionary."
"__MUSIC__ As homophobic and sexist too, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Right. Because some would say it's a white working-class uprising, but it's sinister in another way."
"__MUSIC__ Sure. Well, disco music was diverse in terms of celebrating black, Latin, and queer identities."
"__MUSIC__ The thing is, too, that punk was against disco too. You have lots of punk anti-disco anthems."
"__MUSIC__ And they saw the music of disco as anonymous, and bland, and cheesy..."
"__MUSIC__ Which is a sort of reductionist argument, if you think about it. Look at something like Vaporwave today, which celebrates that."
"__MUSIC__ And it finds a kind of eerie beauty in something like department store muzak."
"__MUSIC__ So the music produced by disco was a lot more lush and, well, musical than people gave it credit for being."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, if you listen to something like Larry Levan's Paradise Garage mixes..."
"__MUSIC__ You hear a very intricate sense of rhythm, and an expert rhythm section at work that learned its lessons from funk."
"__MUSIC__ Even less 'cool' disco like The Andrea True Connection's 'More, More, More,' well, there's some great funk and orchestration going on."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, or something like Barry White and the recordings he did with Love Unlimited Orchestra."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love that song... 'Love's Theme,' right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's exquisite orchestral pop with a disco backing."
"__MUSIC__ And my ears weren't really trained to think of that stuff as good until more recently."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, because disco was severely underrated by rock fans and critics."
