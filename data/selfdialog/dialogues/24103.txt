"__SUPERHERO__ Man, Wonder Woman looks better than I was expecting."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know, right? I guess that's what you get when you give it to an Israeli woman director."
"__SUPERHERO__ I like how it's actually set in World War II, the way it should be."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm just... glad they're going for it. It would be so easy to mess this up, out of some assumption that young men don't want to watch a movie about a woman unless it's all T&A."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah! You know, it's... I didn't see any obvious... 'look at my ass' in the trailer."
"__SUPERHERO__ No, I mean. It looks like they're taking this seriously, taking her seriously as a character."
"__SUPERHERO__ They should! She's, like, the third most important character DC has and they're always ignoring her."
"__SUPERHERO__ There was Lynda Carter, but even then they chickened out after a couple of seasons. Brought it into the glamorous 1970s."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's what I was talking about. Looks like they're going for it, and tossing her into the time period where she actually makes sense."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah. Though... that makes me wonder how they plan to resolve this with the rest of the DC cinematic universe... not that I care about anything else they're doing."
