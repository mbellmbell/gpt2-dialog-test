"__DISNEY__ Are you into the Star Wars movies?"
"__DISNEY__ You know, I've never seen any of them."
"__DISNEY__ Whoa!  That is quite shocking."
"__DISNEY__ I was going to try to get into them, but there are so many I don't know which ones to start with."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it can get confusing."
"__DISNEY__ Do I start with timeline order or movie release order?"
"__DISNEY__ I would go with movie release order, that way you can see the movies the way they were made."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think that's a good idea.  Maybe I'll start watching them in time for the new one to be released."
"__DISNEY__ I think you should definitely give them a chance.  They are classics!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm going to spend all weekend watching them, then.  It is settled!"
