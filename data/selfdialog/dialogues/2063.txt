"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a big fan of hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. Who's your favorite hip hop artist?"

"__MUSIC__ What type of music do you prefer?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Who are some of your favorite pop artists right now?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Carly Rae Jepsen, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Lorde, and Ariana Grande."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love Ariana Grande. She has an amazing voice."
"__MUSIC__ I think so too. It's amazing such a big voice can come out of such a small person."
"__MUSIC__ I used to really like Taylor Swift too but in my opinion her more recent albums haven't been as strong as her early ones."
"__MUSIC__ I can see what you mean. Her sound has definitely changed a lot over time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't really enjoy most country music but I liked it when she had a country sound."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think she sounded a little bit more authentic back then."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. You could definitely tell she was writing her own stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Although, her songs now are pretty catchy too I have to say."
"__MUSIC__ They're definitely catchy, but they always get stuck in my head!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know! I remember having Blank Space stuck in my head for days at a time after that came out."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!"
