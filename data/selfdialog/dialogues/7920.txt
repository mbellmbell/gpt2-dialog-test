"__POP__ Speaking of pop music, do you think the format of it has changed over the years?"
"__POP__ Most definately. Just look at pop music songs over previous decades."
"__POP__ Why do you think it has changed?"
"__POP__ Well, less restrictions in wording in music for starters."
"__POP__ I don't understand."
"__POP__ Well, 25 years ago saying 'Bitch' or 'Damn' or 'Dick' was an offence the FCC would come down on you hard for."
"__POP__ Really? That's crazy!"
"__POP__ Yes, and even farther back you couldn't even give a hint of sexuality."
"__POP__ No Way! I find that hard to believe,"
"__POP__ Yes, There was quite the controversy when Donna Summer had a pop music smash where she moaned in a sexual manor."
