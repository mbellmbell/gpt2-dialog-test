"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So man, you hear they are talking of doing guaranteed contracts in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see that ever working out, it doesn't make sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I mean I'm sure it would lead to shorter contracts, like two or three years each."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right now it's only the first 20 or so player that get their full contract pay guaranteed at the draft, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, then the others have to negotiate how much of their contract is or not, like how many years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but if everyone had shorter contracts, plus guaranteed pay, people would be moving around all the time. Teams would change a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But maybe not, this would make the teams give better deals, and treat the whole team better, and as more of a whole, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, maybe it's better for the players, but not the teams or the fans. Just when you like a team, the whole thing will change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We already deal with a lot of change in the teams, fans are loyal to their team, not their player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not all the time, a lot of fans stick to one player, and if they are routing for a new team every few years, may take some of the fun out of it for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see what you are saying, and maybe it would be out of wack for a few years, but it would work out and balance in the end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still don't agree, but what are the chances this is even going to happen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, it would probably have to take one team doing it, then all players wanting to go to them, for others to follow suit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So no one has done it yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, but Dolphins defensive Suh does have a fully guaranteed 3 year plus rolling guarantees for 18-20 so it's close."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But still, the 'rolling' part gives the team a little control there, I don't see them giving that control up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You might be right, but I'd still like to see it happen. The players make the game and this is the best deal for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but if it makes fans back away, it hurts everyone so I don't know man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the next few seasons should be interesting, I bet at least things change a bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They change a bit every year."
