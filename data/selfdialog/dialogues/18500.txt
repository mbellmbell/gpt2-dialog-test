"__MOVIES__ Hey, you own Deadpool, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, I have a few copies of it, why?"
"__MOVIES__ Can I borrow one? It's about time I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, you can have my Blu-ray or DVD."
"__MOVIES__ Is it really as good as they say?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved every second of it. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as it."
"__MOVIES__ Is it really rated-R worthy?"
"__MOVIES__ It's constant super-graphic violence and sex."
"__MOVIES__ How graphic?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, think about 300. It's that level of gory, but far more fast-paced. There are even floating severed heads."
"__MOVIES__ Is it done well, though?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's over-the-top, but not tasteless."
"__MOVIES__ Is it funny?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's hysterical. He and Morena Baccarin have wicked chemistry."
"__MOVIES__ I hear there's a lot of fourth-wall jokes."
"__MOVIES__ Tons."
"__MOVIES__ What is a fourth-wall joke?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Breaking the fourth wall' is self-referential jokes, and talking to the audience directly."
"__MOVIES__ How's that factor in here?"
"__MOVIES__ Deadpool makes lots of in-jokes about the X-men. It contains X-men, but they have B-listers because the studio couldn't afford a better cast."
