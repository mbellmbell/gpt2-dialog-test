"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you remember seeing the latest fast and the furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I do, remember I went with you and my dad?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah I do.  What was your favorite part in it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was when Vin Diesel turns bad and joins the enemy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What is that part your favorite?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's my favorite because I love Vin plus I never saw the turn coming."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me either. I am glad they are making more of the movies to hopefully explain his actions."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me to.  The way they drive the cars around with the stunts makes it a great movie to see."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree.  I love the black muscle car the Vin's character drives around."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I love the green honda.  It is little but packs a punch."
