"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the movie Gone Girl?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, but it's on my list!  I actually just finished the book."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you should totally see the movie!  It's great!"
"__MOVIES__ Is it similar to the book?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's really similar.  But it's still worth seeing because the way they portray the characters is great."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I heard.  It does kinda ruin it to know the ending though."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah.  It reduces the suspense, but you'll still enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Gone Girl, but The Girl on the Train was just as good."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I haven't seen that one yet!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's great.  It's also really similar to the book but it's neat seeing the characters in the movie like you said."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check that out.  I loved the book almost as much as Gone Girl."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it even better.  It was more intriguing to me and the characters were more likable."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it sounds like I need to check out the Girl on the Train and you need to check out Gone Girl."
"__MOVIES__ True!  Have you seen any of Gillian Flynn's other movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not yet.  I know there is a movie for Dark Places, but I haven't heard of any others."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw Dark Places on Amazon Prime but I haven't watched it yet.  The book was great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the book really was great.  I'm not sure how good the movie would be though."
"__MOVIES__ Someone told me it was good, so I've been meaning to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like the book is always better than the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's usually the case no matter what."
