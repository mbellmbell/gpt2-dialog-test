"__MUSIC__ What do the think of today's musical artists?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really impressed with the music being made today.  I'm more of a classic rock fan."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?  Why don't you like today's stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ It just doesn't appeal to me as much as the older stuff does."
"__MUSIC__ Have you really given it a try?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, not really.  When I was younger, I would listen to the radio in my car, and I do like some stuff from the 80's and 90's."
"__MUSIC__ Why nothing later than that?"
"__MUSIC__ The rock stations I was listening to started playing more classic rock, and I found I really enjoyed that.  Then, one time in the early 2000's when I rented a car, it had Sirius radio in it and I found a station called 70's on 7."
"__MUSIC__ So that station just played 70's music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, pop music mostly, from the 70's.  That turned me on to Sirius.  So the next car we bought, we made sure it had Sirius radio."
"__MUSIC__ So what other stations do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Classic Vinyl and Classic Rewind.  They play 60's, 70's on Classic Vinyl, and 70's and 80's rock on Classic Rewind."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you enjoy that type of music so much?"
"__MUSIC__ The late 70's and early 80's were my teenage years and so I listened to music and went to concerts a lot during that time.  Of course, I haven't ever stopped going to concerts!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?  Who do you go see?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a huge Beatles fan, so I've seen Paul McCartney seven times.  And I've seen The Who, The Rolling Stones a few times.  I also had a chance to see Three Dog Night - they're one of my favorite bands from the 70's."
"__MUSIC__ How was that show?  Aren't they a little old?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, they are.  But they can still rock on!  In fact, fairly soon after my husband and I went to see them, one of the lead singers, Cory Wells, passed away.  That was in 2015.  Sad."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad.  Do you think they'll stop touring?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I bet they will."
