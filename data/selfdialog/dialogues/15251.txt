"__HARRY_POTTER__ What death is the saddest do you think?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Dumbledore in Half-Blood Prince! I hated Snape for doing that!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I hated him too but then he was actually a good guy!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wasn't expecting him to be good! I was ready to hate him!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Or what about when Hedwig was killed and fell from the sky?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was so sad too. Harry was so upset, it was hard to watch."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Or Lupin and Tonks when they just had a baby?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ At least he got to grow up not having Voldemort in his life!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes that is one good thing!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And Harry can take care of him!"
