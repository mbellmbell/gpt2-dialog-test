"__MOVIES__ You ever watched a movie, then watched it again years later?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I saw the movie 'Clue' when I was a teenager."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the movie based on the game?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one. Anyway, saw it when I was a teenager and seem to remember enjoying it. Watched it with my wife a few months ago, and we both hated it."
"__MOVIES__ What was wrong with it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's stupid. My wife actually enjoys silly comedies. And even she didn't like it."
"__MOVIES__ But you liked it years ago?"
"__MOVIES__ I seem to remember liking it, yeah."
"__MOVIES__ Any other movies like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Superman IV."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought you loved the Christopher Reeve Superman movies."
"__MOVIES__ I do. Or I did."
"__MOVIES__ You don't like them anymore?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't like number four as much anymore. It had been a while since I saw. Watched it with someone else and well, all kinds of flaws started to show up."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of flaws?"
"__MOVIES__ For one, the story makes No sense at all!"
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Superman throws all of the nuclear weapons into the sun and everyone gets all upset. The governments of the world know how to build more."
"__MOVIES__ YOu got a point."
"__MOVIES__ And the hair. Superman's hair is in a museum holding up a huge weight. Luthor comes in and cuts the hair free with a pair of scissors."
