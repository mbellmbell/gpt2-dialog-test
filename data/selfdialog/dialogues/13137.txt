"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going to watch a rugby game on Friday. Would you like to come?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No thanks. I don't really like rugby at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's surprising. I know you like football, and they're a bit similar"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are I guess. I just never really watched much rugby."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm from Australia, so we don't really watch NFL much. Rugby is our thing since we were kids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess NFL is similar for me. Growing up I was always going to the Ravens games with my father."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are there any NFL teams outside of the US? I know we don't have any in Australia."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, all teams are in the USA, although occasionally they do play overseas for exhibition games / friendly games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know if they ever play in Australia? If they do I'd definitely tell my friends back home to check it out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. I know the Jacksonville Jaguars began play one game a year at Wembley Stadium in London."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very cool. I wonder if it's only in London because there are a lot of Americans living there nowadays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure actually. I remember the Buffalo Bills used to play one game every season at Rogers Centre in Toronto for a few years, but don't think they do it anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where in the USA are most of the teams? They're spread all over right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they're pretty all over the map. Althought there are more teams on the eastern half of the country."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mentioned you used to go to the Ravens games. Is that in Philadelphia?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No the team in Philly is the Eagles. The Ravens are the 'Baltimore Ravens'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Baltimore? I thought you grew up in DC"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I grew up in Maryland, right on the border of DC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah so you could have supported either the Baltimore Ravens or whatever team there is in DC"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The team in DC is the Redskins. They're a good team as well"
