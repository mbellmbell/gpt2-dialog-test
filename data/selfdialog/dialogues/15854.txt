"__ROCK__ Were you ever a fan of Creed?"
"__ROCK__ Not really.  Why?"
"__ROCK__ I just started listening to them again.  I really like their sound."
"__ROCK__ I never really was into them.  Didn't the lead singer go solo or something?"
"__ROCK__ I'm not sure, but he did go into another band."
"__ROCK__ What was the name of it?"
"__ROCK__ Art of Anarchy, i think."
"__ROCK__ Oh, do you like them too?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, but I'm a fan of Scott Stapp anyway."
"__ROCK__ I don't think I'd like it.  I never really cared for his voice."
