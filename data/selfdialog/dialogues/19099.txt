"__MOVIES__ Heya, did you see Hidden Figures?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course I did! I wanted to work for NASA basically my entire life."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet! How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Amazing! Revolutionary! It's so rare we have women at all leading movies, much less women of color."
"__MOVIES__ I know! It's about three black female rocket scientists, right?"
"__MOVIES__ It is! We know about the men who went into space, but the women behind the launch?"
"__MOVIES__ Not the story in our history textbooks."
"__MOVIES__ Not the ones we grew up with! I think this movie might add some new characters to our books."
"__MOVIES__ Did the movie win any awards?"
"__MOVIES__ It was nominated for three Oscars, but didn't win any. But it did win a SAG award!"
"__MOVIES__ Which award was that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it won Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture?"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it deserves an Oscar, though! How was the acting?"
"__MOVIES__ The leads were all terrific! Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon√°e will go down as legends."
"__MOVIES__ Where does the movie take place?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was filmed in Atlanta, but it's set at the Langley Research Station in Hampton, Virginia."
"__MOVIES__ It takes place in Virginia? You know I'm from Norfolk?"
"__MOVIES__ Really? You have to see this now! They even use Virginia license plates."
"__MOVIES__ A movie about women in science--especially one that takes place in Virginia? So cool."
"__MOVIES__ So cool."
