"__MOVIES__ I see they're making a Justice League type movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I hope it better than what DC seems to be putting out these days."
"__MOVIES__ How are they going to bring back Superman?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Remeber, they killed him in the last movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right! Batman vs. Superman."
"__MOVIES__ That was awful."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, didn't really care for that flick myself."
"__MOVIES__ Did you get a look at Aquaman?"
"__MOVIES__ I did. Right at the end in the pictures."
"__MOVIES__ Yup."
"__MOVIES__ Looks like that guy from Game of Thrones."
"__MOVIES__ I think it is."
"__MOVIES__ Kal Drogo, or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Interesting choice for Aquaman."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but that character needed a little updating."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe a little, but this seems like a complete overhaul."
"__MOVIES__ So it would seem."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, I still want to check out Justice Leage."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too."
