"__MOVIES__ So I just got back from seeing that movie Logan."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I still haven't seen it! How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well you know I'm a huge X-Men fan. This one had me almost in tears, it's kind of the end of an era."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. Now they're doing all these prequels."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah everyone is young again -- Scott, Jean Grey, Charles Xavier, Magneto."
"__MOVIES__ While I'm happy about that, because I do really love James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. But I don't know, I'm kinda nostalgic for Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan."
"__MOVIES__ Well you just saw them in Logan! Well maybe not Ian McKellan, but he was in Days of Future Past."
"__MOVIES__ Spoiler alert! I haven't watched that one!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm so sorry, well which ones have you watched so we can talk about it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw X-Men: Apocalypse on my way home from London."
"__MOVIES__ What? Apocalypse comes after Days of Future Past!"
"__MOVIES__ Well I didn't see it! I've seen all of them besides that one."
"__MOVIES__ You must really be confused by the plot then. Do you know that X-Men, X2, and X-Men 3: The Last Stand didn't actually happen."
"__MOVIES__ Excuse me, spoiler alert!!! What?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, because Logan went back to the past and changed everything. But it's okay because Magneto and Charles Xavier are friends again."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I do remember in the early movies they would call each other 'old friend' and stuff like that."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, did you see First Class? You see how they became friends in that one too."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess I haven't seen that one either."
"__MOVIES__ .... we gotta do an X-Men movie marathon. Pop some popcorn, we're starting at X-Men."
