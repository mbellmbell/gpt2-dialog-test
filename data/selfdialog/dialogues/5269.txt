"__STAR_WARS__ So, what are some of your favorite funny lines in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I like that line in The Force Awakens when BB8 gives Finn a thumbs up.  I thought that was cute."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha.. that was a good.  Here's one of mine, it's from the first film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, lay it on me."
"__STAR_WARS__ When they're in that control station and Han's talking on the radio to the empire guards and he's all, 'We're fine here!  Everything's fine!  Situation normal!  Uh... how are you guys?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's is pretty funny!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What's crazy to me is I didn't even remember that line until I re-saw the film in theaters several years back."
"__STAR_WARS__ You saw it in the theaters?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, not the original though... it was special edition."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ahh.. we they added all those effects for no real reason."
