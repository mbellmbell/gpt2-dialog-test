"__DISNEY__ Have you noticed that all the Disney princesses have animal sidekicks?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, like Cinderella has her mice that help make her dress, and Snow White has all the forest animals that help clean the house."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, and Jasmine has her tiger and Pocahontas has the hummingbird and raccoon!"
"__DISNEY__ Exactly!"
"__DISNEY__ What would your animal sidekick be if you were a Disney princess?"
"__DISNEY__ Good question. I'd want to be some kind of forest princess, so any kind of forest animal I guess."
"__DISNEY__ I like that. I'd want a wolf or bear, or something fierce like that."
"__DISNEY__ Mulan had a dragon, that's pretty fierce."
"__DISNEY__ Not sure if you could call Mushu fierce!"
