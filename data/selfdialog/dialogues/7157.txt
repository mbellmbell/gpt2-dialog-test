"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you see Lady Gaga cohost on RuPaul's Drag Race?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes! She was so great! It was so nice seeing her on the set."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know, especially since they're almost impersonating her anyways. I loved when they lip synced to her, 'Poker Face.'"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Speaking of 'Poker Face', what's your favorite song by her overall?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think I'd say it's, 'Born This Way' since it has so much meaning behind it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I really like the meaning behind it as well, but the beat is not my favorite."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's true. As far as beats go, I think I like 'Applause.'"
"__LADY_GAGA__ That beat is amazing! And the video is phenomenal."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her videos are always great. They're so flashy and unique."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree! Lady Gaga is sure one of a kind. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next."
