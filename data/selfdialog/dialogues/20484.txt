"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the end of Cloverfield Lane?"

"__MOVIES__ Absolutely, with modern black and white effects, that movie would be amazing."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think of old westerns?"

"__MOVIES__ Do you ever watch 'B' movies?"
"__MOVIES__ When I'm extremely bored!  Titanic 2 was my favorite."

"__MOVIES__ This is the way those movies should have been the whole time?"

"__MOVIES__ Kevin Costner.  He ruins almost every movie he is in with his accents.  Field of Dreams was a great movie, though."
