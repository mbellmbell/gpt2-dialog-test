"__MUSIC__ Where do you find new music?"
"__MUSIC__ I read some blogs like Stereogum and Pigeons and Planes and I check Pitchfork."
"__MUSIC__ I know Stereogum and Pitchfork, what's that other one? Pigeons and Planes?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a hip hop blog that also focuses on indie rock."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, sounds right up my alley. I'm gonna make a note about that right now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you should do that for sure. How do you find music?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like podcasts for finding music, actually. My favorite podcasts are All Songs Considered and Sound Opinions."
"__MUSIC__ I really love Sound Opinions. They do such deep dives on my favorite artists and even things like guitar solos."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I find with both shows that the passion of the hosts for music is contagious and that I find myself having a much more vociferous appetite for music following listening to them."
"__MUSIC__ So true. Podcasts give a very intimate feel."
"__MUSIC__ I know recently I heard a podcast about A Tribe Called Quest and I've been on a huge binge since. The host was super passionate about them."
"__MUSIC__ Tribe is from Queens just like you!"
"__MUSIC__ I know. They're so good."
"__MUSIC__ They were one of the first hip-hop groups I could put my dad onto."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ They're conscious rap and they sample Lou Reed and have a jazzy feel. That's all up my dad's alley."
"__MUSIC__ Well, did he like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Like it? He loved it."
"__MUSIC__ That's really heartening."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it completely changed his attitudes towards rap."
