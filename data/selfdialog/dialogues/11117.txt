"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Packers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because of Aaron Rogers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, best QB in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't argue with that, but he is all they got!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They added a nice receiver in the Draft, Malachi Dupre, from LSU"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like that pick too. That division is weak"
