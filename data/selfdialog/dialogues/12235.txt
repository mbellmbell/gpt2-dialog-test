"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks may just not have it anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think? They still have some great players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but they are getting older too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they are, but they are still talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but eventually age usually catches up to you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it might start to catch up to them, but Russell Wilson is still young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. He is very young, but he could ware down as well with the way that he plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he plays hard and he is fearless. Thats for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many other quarterbacks can you think of like him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. Theres a couple. Marcus Mariota comes to mind first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he could be one of them. Rodgers may be another one, but he doesn't run as much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, those are two good choices. Griffin was, but I do not know what to even consider him anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are always a few speedy quarterbacks, but the pocket passers tend to succeed more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it does seem like that. They are able to stay healthier and be more productive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, health definitely helps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it has for Brady. That is for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it has helped them win multiple superbowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! Health goes a long way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it definitely has for the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, we will see how they fare this year."
