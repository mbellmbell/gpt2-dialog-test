"__BASEBALL__ Hey, you know what I like? Baseball!"
"__BASEBALL__ Fooseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ No! Baseball. You know, Saturday afternoons, hot dogs, programs, all that crap."
"__BASEBALL__ I find it boring. Why do the pitchers always spit?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think they're trying to intimidate the batter. You missed a great Twins game last night."
"__BASEBALL__ There are no great Twins games so I doubt it. Did Baby Jesus finally get a hit?"
"__BASEBALL__ Mauer stuck out. But the pitcher, whatshisname, only threw a 14 hitter game."
"__BASEBALL__ Say, that is good for a Twins pitcher. Did anyone get on base?"
"__BASEBALL__ Dozier got beaned in the head and got a walk."
"__BASEBALL__ That's as good as a hit. Anything else exciting?"
"__BASEBALL__ Actually, yes. A wild pitch hit T.C. Bear and decleated him. I guess he's ok but he'll never be the same bear."
"__BASEBALL__ Bummer. Did the Twins charge the mound?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nope. They just laughed and pointed and spit tobaccy jiuce."
"__BASEBALL__ I suppose it's pointless to ask if they won?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, yes it is."
"__BASEBALL__ What did you eat?"
"__BASEBALL__ I wasn't very hungry. I only had a chicken burrito, a burger, two hot dogs, and 7 beers."
"__BASEBALL__ Who helped you out of the stadium? Or did you just roll down the steps?"
"__BASEBALL__ I went with a buddy from worker. He wasn't drinkin'. We had a great time. I don't remember much after the 5th inning, though."
"__BASEBALL__ That's the best kind of Twins watching there is."
