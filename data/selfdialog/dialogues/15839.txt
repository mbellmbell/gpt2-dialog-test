"__ROCK__ So what are you listening to these days?"
"__ROCK__ Music from the 1990's which was my younger days."
"__ROCK__ Why is that?"
"__ROCK__ We have lost a lot of talent from the 90's and I'm just missing them."
"__ROCK__ Like who?"
"__ROCK__ Well the world just lost Chris Cornell.  He was lead singer for Soundgarden and Audioslave."
"__ROCK__ Oh ok! I remember that weird video for Black Hole Sun."
"__ROCK__ It was a bit odd but it is an awesome song. Have you listened to any other music of theirs?"
"__ROCK__ No, do you recommend anything?"
"__ROCK__ Yes, buy Soundgarden's cds 'Badmotorfinger', 'Superunknown', and 'Down On The Upside'.  You will hear some awesome music!"
