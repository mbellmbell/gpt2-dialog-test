"__MOVIES__ I don't know what movie I wanna watch today."
"__MOVIES__ What movie haven't you seen?"
"__MOVIES__ There in lies the problem; I've seen almost al of them."
"__MOVIES__ I thought you wanted to watch the underworld series again?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, Kate Beckinsale is always a good bet."
"__MOVIES__ Well there you go, crisis averted."
"__MOVIES__ Come on, it's never easy picking out a movie when you seen as many as I have."
"__MOVIES__ Then maybe you should try reading a book every now and then."
"__MOVIES__ That's not fair I read occasionally."
"__MOVIES__ Other than the back of the dvd case?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes smarty pants; sometimes I read the book the movie is based on."
"__MOVIES__ You have serious issues."
"__MOVIES__ Oh like you're any better? How many times have you seen the Underworld series?"
"__MOVIES__ I hardly see how that's relevant."
"__MOVIES__ Avoiding the question are we? seriously how many?"
"__MOVIES__ 20."
"__MOVIES__ And yet, you say I watch too many movies?"
"__MOVIES__ YOU do, I just like watch vampires taking out werewolves; perfectly natural."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Vampiric death dealers with lots of cool toys, not a bad way to spend an afternoon."
"__MOVIES__ So are we gonna watch it or what?"
