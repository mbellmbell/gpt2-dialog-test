"__DISNEY__ Do you want to watch Wreck It Ralph tonight?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I was actually thinking about it the other day."
"__DISNEY__ Yea? What about?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh how much I loved fix it Felix."
"__DISNEY__ Yea Jack McBrayer was perfect for that role."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him."
"__DISNEY__ I loved how he had a crush on the girl Sargent."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that was rediculous, I laughed really hard at the singing taffy too."
"__DISNEY__ Yea me too. I really loved King Candy too. He was just rediculous even though he was so evil."
"__DISNEY__ Yea I loved the twist with him at the end too. That was really unexpected."
