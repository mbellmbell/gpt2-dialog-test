"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nothing much. Just bored out of my mind."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't see how you can be bored, especially with the invention of music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ha, ha. Lately, all these music artists sound the same."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How could you say such a thing? (feigns shock)"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's true. Who can you say is different from the rest?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Beyonce."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok, you have a point. I don't really listen to her though."

"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Is she that great? You're driving a hard promotion here."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Are you kidding me? Beyonce has changed my life for the better."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How can a celebrity affect you in such a great way?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ All of her albums speak life into me, especially Lemonade."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Isn't that the one about a tumultuous relationship and how she overcame it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, exactly! What gal can't relate?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You have a point there too. (smiles)"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ See there, Beyonce has already made you smile and you have yet to press play."
