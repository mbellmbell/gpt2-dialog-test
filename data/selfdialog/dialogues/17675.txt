"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Hesher?"
"__MOVIES__ No. I haven't. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about this anarchist living in an abandoned building who meets a boy, and he moves in with his family."
"__MOVIES__ Go on..."
"__MOVIES__ He is really harsh and mean at first, but as the story unfolds you see that inside he is a good guy."
"__MOVIES__ Is he really mean in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. He's this anarchist with long hair. He does whatever he wants."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Joseph Gordon- Levitt and Natalie Portman."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. Those are some big names. Did it win any awards?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so, it's different and unique. Great movie but not popular or proper enough to be award material"
"__MOVIES__ I see. Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I love it. I own it on blue-ray."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Natalie Portman huh? She must look really pretty on blue-ray."
"__MOVIES__ Of course she does. All the actors have great chemistry in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's good to see a movie like that, where all the actors have a chemistry and blend together."
"__MOVIES__ Is is similar to other movies you have seen?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and no."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It's very unique, but it based on a character who acts mean but is actually noble, and we have seen movies like that before."
