"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for this year's NFL season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! Although, I'm sure that my team is already out of contention"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a die-hard Chicago Bears fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year was definitely not their year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. We're a long way from their 1985 championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they had a lot of injuries last year. Maybe they'll turn it around this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe. Who are you rooting for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a big fan of the Dallas Cowboys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Prescott did great last year, but too bad we didn't get to see much of Tony Romo. I've always liked him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's retired now, so it's onwards towards a Superbowl ring"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to admit, the Cowboys here phenomenal last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It isn't often that a team sends two rookies to the Pro Bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll, they sure deserved it. Especially Ezekiel Elliott for breaking Tony Dorsett's rushing record"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How they didn't make the Superbowl last year, I'll never know"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The lost to the Green Bay Packers, a wild card team. How did that even happen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys lost by a field goal. That was a sad day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then the Falcons stomped the Packers. Poetic justice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Well, it's going to be our year this year. Just you wait and see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good luck to you. Me, I'm still rooting for my Chicago Bears."
