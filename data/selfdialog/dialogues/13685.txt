"__BASKETBALL__ The Wizards defeat the Celtics here in Game 4 to tie the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ The series is tied at 2 a piece and game 5 will be in Boston on Wednesday."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yup tune in at 8 PM on TNT."
"__BASKETBALL__ Now its a best of 3 series, and Boston has 2 home games and only 1 away game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Neither team has won on the road yet this series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lets see if the Wizards can take care of business Wednesday and secure the first away win of the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ That Celtics crowd will be loud on Wednesday night!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Rightfully so, I think it will be an electric atmosphere, and they have every right to be."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you know the Celtics have gone down at least 20+ points in every game this series..."
"__BASKETBALL__ They are lucky to be tied in this series, and you'd have to imagine the Celtics would hopefully avoid being down 20 at home in game 5."
"__BASKETBALL__ I like the Celtics chances, I definitely think this will go 7 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ I do too... and I have no clue who would win Game 7."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'd have to give the slight edge to the Celtics just because it will be at TD Garden in Boston."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but John Wall has been eating the Celtics alive, hes been so crafty, getting his teammates involved, scoring a ton of points and assists."
"__BASKETBALL__ Only time will tell, I guess we will just have to wait and see. As we know the Cavs have already advanced to the eastern conference finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ That will be a tough task for either of these teams as the Cavs are undefeated so far this postseason."
"__BASKETBALL__ You got to think the Cavs will beat either team, and the Cavs will prob advanced to the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I think I agree with you there, and I don't think the Cavs care who they get... Lebron seems to be on a mission this year again this postseason."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well thank you for tuning in, again the Wizards have beat the Celtics thanks to a 26-0 run in the third quarter, to tie the series at 2 a piece."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's been a pleasure to be with you guys, we will see you Wednesday night in Boston for game 5!!!!!"
