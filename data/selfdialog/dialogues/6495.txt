"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I liked it a lot. It was probably the weakest of the original trilogy but it was still good and a classic Star Wars movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say it's the weakest? What's wrong with it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well that's just in comparison to the other two. There's a lot of great thing about it but the weaker parts are probably the Ewoks and the retread of having another Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ You didn't like the Ewoks? I thought they were really cute."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's the problem, they're there just to have some cuddly cute creatures and sell toys and not to add anything to the plot. At least that's my opinion."
"__STAR_WARS__ The battle scene near the end of Return of the Jedi was pretty great though, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that and the final lightsabre duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is amazing. That's why I will never say it's a bad movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you think that the final battle went on for too long? Some people say that it did."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think so. At the time it was the end of the Star Wars  series so there should have been this massive epic fight to end a hugely popular series of movies."
