"__ROCK__ What was your favorite grunge band?"
"__ROCK__ I would have to say Nirvana."
"__ROCK__ Not a bad choice, but I'm a Pearl Jam person myself."
"__ROCK__ Could never get into Pearl Jam, I mean they are okay, but I liked Nirvana's more agressive style."
"__ROCK__ You know it's funny I'm partial toward punk and Nirvana was certainly closer to punk than Pearl Jam, but Eddie Vedder seals it for me."
"__ROCK__ I can see it, guy was and continues to be a great songwriter."
"__ROCK__ He really is, sometimes don't feel he gets the credit he deserves in that regard."
"__ROCK__ I wouldn't go that far, he's extremely highly regarded as far as I can see."
"__ROCK__ I guess it depends on your definition of highly regarded."
"__ROCK__ I suppose so, but not sure how anyone could feel he deserves more recognition, he gets a pretty large amount as is."
