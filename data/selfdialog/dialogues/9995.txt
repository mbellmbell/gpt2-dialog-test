"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who's the best hype up rapper in the game?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Jeezy for sure! Have you heard him..'I put on for my city, on on for my city.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Jeezy is up there for sure. I think Lil Jon has the best hype game though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, 'Get Low' and 'Turn Down for What' go hard for sure."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Don't forget 'Snap Yo Fingers' either. That was my go to song when I was getting ready to go out to the club in college."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That is a great one."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ We'd be totally remiss if we didn't mention FLA-VOR FLAV!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ha! Ha! Ha! That's true, I'm not a big fan, but he's essential hype man."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, if a university offered a Hypeman 101 course, he'd get at least a week of study."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, for sure. Flavor Flav was one of the first to do it."
