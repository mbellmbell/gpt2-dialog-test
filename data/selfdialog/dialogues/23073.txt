"__DISNEY__ I really like the movie Fantasia. I hadn't watched it for years until last night."
"__DISNEY__ I haven't seen that movie in ages."
"__DISNEY__ I love the different scenes and the music just makes it epic."
"__DISNEY__ Isn't there a part with dinosaurs in that movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it's kind of the story of how they come to be and then go extinct."
"__DISNEY__ Really, it covers that much?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it was really interesting. Also, the part with the dancing mushrooms is awesome."
"__DISNEY__ I remember that! I loved that one and then the part with the dancing hippos!"
"__DISNEY__ That part was great too! It makes me want to watch Fantasia 2000."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I almost forgot there was another one!"
