"__DISNEY__ Were you a big fan of the Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Not really.  My mom was all into it though."
"__DISNEY__ Your mom?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she took us to go see it in the theatre.  I was almost in high school."
"__DISNEY__ Yikes.  That must have been embarrassing."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and then we were on vacation and she made my dad buy the soundtrack."
"__DISNEY__ Wow.  Did you guys listen to it nonstop?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes.  I hated it."
"__DISNEY__ Well, there are some good songs."
"__DISNEY__ I tell you, I love Elton John, but I don't ever want to hear Can You Feel the Love Tonight again."
