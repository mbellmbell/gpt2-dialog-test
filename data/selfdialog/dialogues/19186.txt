"__MOVIES__ What is you favorite animated movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite is Lady in the Tramp."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that one too. But isn't it old?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is a classic but the classics are the best!!"
"__MOVIES__ Why do you like the classics?"
"__MOVIES__ Because they reinforced things like morals and values."
"__MOVIES__ And you don't think they do that now?"
"__MOVIES__ No not really. Now it is all about making that almighty dollar no matter what the message is."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Do take me wrong, I love the movies but I hate their messages. But take Beauty and the Beast by Disney."
"__MOVIES__ Ok that is a good movie about hard work and believing in oneself will allow one to change."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but it also shows that a man can be abusive and it's ok, or the towns people can be bullies with no repercussions."
"__MOVIES__ I never looked at it that way."
"__MOVIES__ It also shows that a woman should not be seen as smart or aggresive for what she believed in."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Belle's love of knowledge became a push point for the bullies and Gaston to prey upon."
"__MOVIES__ Ok I can see that. But why have I never noticed it before?"
"__MOVIES__ Because society has allowed those things to become an everyday occurrence which has made them acceptable."
"__MOVIES__ Wow I will never watch that movie and see it the same way again."
"__MOVIES__ I know... this is why I love the classics."
