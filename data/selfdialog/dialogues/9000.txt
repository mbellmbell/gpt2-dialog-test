"__BEATLES__ Norwegian Wood is my favorite Haruki Murakami novel."
"__BEATLES__ Does it have anything to do with the Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ Sort of! Only when it was translated into Japanese, there was a translation error."
"__BEATLES__ What kind of error?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, you know how in the song, Norwegian wood is a building material?"
"__BEATLES__ Right, it's talking about how a particular kind of girl has a room made with it."
"__BEATLES__ Well, when it was translated into Japanese, they thought it meant forest."
"__BEATLES__ Oh no. That's a big error."
"__BEATLES__ It's kind of understandable though. Anyway, the novel has all these long passages about being alone in a forest..."
"__BEATLES__ But that's not what the song's about at all!"
