"__MUSIC__ What would you say is the best movie franchise of the past decade?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, undoubtedly The Hangover movies."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Isn't that a stupid comedy franchise?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, yes, it's stupid, but it's the most hilarious set of movies you will ever see in your life."
"__MUSIC__ I would never have guessed it from the trailers."
"__MUSIC__ I can't even explain how funny the movies are, all three of them have something different and hilarious to them."
"__MUSIC__ Name one thing that's funny about those movies."
"__MUSIC__ Well the funniest part is the main character, Alan Garner, played by Zach Galafianakis."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I've heard of him. He's in those movies?"
"__MUSIC__ Where have you been living? Under a rock? Bradley Cooper is also in them."
"__MUSIC__ You're kidding me! Isn't he a serious actor now?"
"__MUSIC__ He's been in some pretty serious movies, but I guess he got his start in The Hangover comedies."
"__MUSIC__ So what does this Alan do that's so funny?"
"__MUSIC__ He's one of those characters that's just completely weird, so strange that he's almost not human. Remember the Ace Ventura movies?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean like how Ace Ventura was more like a wacky cartoon character than a human being?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! And in the second movie, Ace loses almost all semblance of humanity and just becomes completely weird... Alan Garner is like that."
"__MUSIC__ For example?"
"__MUSIC__ He says his uncle once saw an albino polar bear."
"__MUSIC__ Polar bears are white, how can you tell if they're albino?"
"__MUSIC__ He said this one was black."
