"__ROCK__ Hey do you remember the REM days?"
"__ROCK__ Oh man you are taking me back. I remember people cutting school to try catch them at the Globe in Athens."
"__ROCK__ I remember the rumors. It must have been a crazy time to be in Athens. There were so many great bands coming out of that area."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, the early 80's ...we were begging for rides to get there."
"__ROCK__ I had friends that had older siblings in school then so they got to go and sneak in to catch the bands."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, those were days. Things were much more lax then. It must have been great."
"__ROCK__ Murmur to Document was the high time. That music was great."
"__ROCK__ I agree. The later stuff had one or two songs but those early albums were all good."
"__ROCK__ Yep, couldn't touch you play them straight through."
"__ROCK__ There were some good songs later, but those first albums...amazing."
