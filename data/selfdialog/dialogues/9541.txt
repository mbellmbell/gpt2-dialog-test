"__BASEBALL__ The cubs have lost 7 out of their last 10 games"
"__BASEBALL__ I know it has been really frustrating as a Cubs fan"
"__BASEBALL__ Right now their starting pitching has been awful"
"__BASEBALL__ Not only that, but their once heralded defense has been abysmal too"
"__BASEBALL__ They need to turn this ship around while they still have time"
"__BASEBALL__ No doubt. Thanks God they are in a weak division"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly. They still have time to right the ship"
"__BASEBALL__ We are only roughly 40 games in and they are hovering at the .500 mark"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I think they can turn this thing around still"
"__BASEBALL__ I would hate for them to win last year and not even make the postseason this year"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that would suck really bad"
"__BASEBALL__ I just hope they turn it on here soon"
"__BASEBALL__ I think when you win a championship, it's natural to have a letdown"
"__BASEBALL__ I agree, but they gotta fight through it at this point"
"__BASEBALL__ Some timely hitting would also do them so good"
"__BASEBALL__ You are so right on that. The bats have been dead"
"__BASEBALL__ Dead! more like they've been sitting with the grim reaper"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah for sure! They're not hitting anything right now"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm just happy no one has run away with the division yet"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah me too. We still have time."
