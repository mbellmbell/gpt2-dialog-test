"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you think Lady Gaga is our generation's Madonna?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, I don't know enough about Madonna to say, really. Do you think so?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, I think she is our generations Madonna."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Why's that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She's changed looks, she is a dynamic performer, she writes songs that show artistry and controversy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I've seen her dress in some really bizarre stuff that I'm not sure Madonna had ever dressed in. I was thinking she was a bit more artsy than Madonna."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That might be true."
"__LADY_GAGA__ But point taken, she's a popular, creative, and dynamic women musician/performer who retains an independent streak."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, and she's big enough to play the Super Bowl Halftime Show."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's a pretty significant gig. I guess she's way more popular than I realize."
