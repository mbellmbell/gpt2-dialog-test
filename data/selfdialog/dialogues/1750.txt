"__MUSIC__ There are a lot of nice things about music."
"__MUSIC__ I guess so! But what do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I think one of the neatest things is that it can encourage us to exercise."
"__MUSIC__ Oh? How does it do that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I remember the first time I heard 'Can't Stop the Feeling' I was in a bowling alley, and started dancing!"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Did people look at you funny?"
"__MUSIC__ Thankfully, it was pretty empty. But it encourages us to exercise."
"__MUSIC__ I guess, if you're into dancing it could."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it could help even if you're out walking or running, to have a playlist that motivates you."
"__MUSIC__ I walk and could use that idea."
"__MUSIC__ Sure! And another thing that you can do is hula hoop."
"__MUSIC__ Hula hoop? At my age?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! It's very common to do nowadays, and people like to do something called hoop flow."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's generally hula hooping with a song playing. Then doing a routine that just comes to mind."
"__MUSIC__ Not just waist hooping?"
"__MUSIC__ No, you do a lot of off-body moves that go along with the music."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to look into that. All of this could help me get fit more."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Music is such a good motivator for many things."
"__MUSIC__ Just talking about it is motivating me right now!"
