"__BEATLES__ Do you know why living in Liverpool, England was a big benefit for the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Not really. I know it's a midsized city, but that it wasn't super cosmopolitan like London."
"__BEATLES__ Exactly. On paper it seems improbable that it would have birthed a band as dynamic as The Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, why do you bring this up? Do you have a theory?"
"__BEATLES__ A well supported theory, actually?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, what is it? Why was Liverpool beneficial to The Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Liverpool was a port city and it received a lot of American blues, rockabilly, and soul records."
"__BEATLES__ That makes total sense. I knew that The Beatles music was impossible without that stuff."
"__BEATLES__ Yup. Their early stuff includes a lot of covers of American music."
"__BEATLES__ I just had a thought, with the internet, every city is a port city in the sense of having access to culture."
