"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You betcha! You who got this year? You're still not a Cowboys fan are you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ America's Team, baby! Their new offense is awesome. Romo had his moments, but he could never really deliver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well he's probably delivering pizzas now.  For me, the Packers are going to put it together his year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Packers? Their defense is a sieve.  They were ranked near the bottom of the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're going to tighten that up this year, plus Aaron Rogers just keeps getting better, smarter, luckier.  I know they'll own the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Outside of the Packers, who do you think will win it all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Cowboys will be last, but other than that, about twelve teams will end the season tied for the best record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. Parity has made the league almost unfun. You gotta gave some bad teams for everyone to beat up on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if you don't have some 2-14 records, you won't have any 14-2 records.  One year, I think the whole league will finish 8-8."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that can't happen. Not with Cleveland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh so, true. You totally have to try to be that bad. What are they doing there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm pulling for a city, though. I don't particularly like either the Rams or Charges, but how about Los Angeles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right! No football for twenty something years, now two teams. And I think both could go to the playoffs. That's amazing. Exciting!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we agree on something! Los Angeles to the playoffs! Go Rams!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean, 'Go Chargers!'  The Rams are still the hapless Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It figures. Okay, crunch time. Pick a Super Bowl winner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Packers. Team loyalty man. Of course, if we're putting money down, the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ohh, I hate the Patriots. I would rather give money away than bet ON the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least you can celebrate six times this year when the Cowboys win."
