"__MOVIES__ What did you do this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ I just stayed home, being a couch potato and watching movies."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Christmas movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Everyone's favorite- 'It's A Wonderful Life.'"
"__MOVIES__ Aww, everybody does love that movie. It's timeless."
"__MOVIES__ I like old movies. Jimmy Stewart was such a charismatic actor."
"__MOVIES__ It's no wonder he was a true 'movie star' and starred in so many films."
"__MOVIES__ I liked 'It's A Wonderful Life' because it showed people having hardships. So many times, families in movies have perfect homes and lives and jobs, but that's not the way the real world is."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. It makes you feel bad if you don't have those things."
"__MOVIES__ I liked how their house had problems and they had to work so hard to fix it."
"__MOVIES__ That was funny the way that knob on the staircase kept coming off in his hand."
"__MOVIES__ I also liked how he had a hard time at work. It's very realistic, because it's rare to work at a job and not have problems with people."
"__MOVIES__ I've had bosses and coworkers who made my life miserable."
"__MOVIES__ The kids in that movie were adorable though. But kids are usually, if they're raised right."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. The 'Home Alone' movies, that Kevin is a brat with some of the things he does like stealing his dad's credit card and running up big hotel bills with room service."
"__MOVIES__ He is really bad sometimes. I like the kids in 'It's A Wonderful Life.' That little girl Zuzu was so cute."
"__MOVIES__ It had such a wonderful happy ending when everyone came to help and was putting money in the basket."
"__MOVIES__ I actually cry every time I watch that ending."
"__MOVIES__ It's Jimmy Stewart's face. It makes me cry too."
"__MOVIES__ When he reads the signed book from Clarence, I get a big lump in my throat. Watching that movie is one of the best parts of Christmas."
