"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, do you like the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I love it. Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm putting together a watching party for week one, you wanna come?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that'd be great"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is gonna win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the Patriots, they always win"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You never know, the Chiefs have given them trouble in the past"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but last time the Chiefs beat the Patriots the Patriots went all the way"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but I think the Chiefs defense is really solid"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the Patriots picked up Brandin Cooks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, he has unreal speed"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Him and Brady together could be dangerous"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As good as Brady and Moss?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody will ever be as good as Brady and Moss"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not even Montana and Rice?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were good, but a different type of good. Brady and Moss was just so explosive"
