"__COMEDY__ So, I watched '21 Jump Street' last night."
"__COMEDY__ The new one? With Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill?"
"__COMEDY__ The very same. I thought it was hysterical."
"__COMEDY__ It was really good, I love Jonah Hill, he cracks me up."
"__COMEDY__ Me too! He was hilarious in Grandma's Boys!"
"__COMEDY__ Oh yeah, I remember that! My favorite Jonah movie though was 'Get Him To The Greek.'"
"__COMEDY__ I really liked that too. My favorite scene is when they take the 'Jeffrey' and he goes totally crazy."
"__COMEDY__ Yes! And P Diddy starts chasing him and Russel Brand through the hotel."
"__COMEDY__ I laughed so hard my stomach hurt."
"__COMEDY__ I really wish P Diddy would do more comedy acting, he's really good too!"
