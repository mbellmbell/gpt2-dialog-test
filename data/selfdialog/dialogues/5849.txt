"__STAR_WARS__ What are your thoughts on Obi-Wan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In the prequels or in general?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In general."
"__STAR_WARS__ Aside from the issues with the costume, I think he's a good character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Cosume issues?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why would he still be wearing Jedi robes twenty years later? Those are nomad robes. The Jedi outfit should have been different."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that's hillarious. I never noticed.  I think he did a bad job of keeping an eye on Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ I always thought he was just watching to make sure he didn't go nuts."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, in that case he did a good job."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, he could have done more to train him."
