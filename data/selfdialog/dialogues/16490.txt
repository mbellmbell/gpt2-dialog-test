"__MOVIES__ I just got the blu-ray dvd of the movie Avatar!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's nice. I didn't really like that movie though."
"__MOVIES__ What?! Are you crazy? Everyone loves that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Just because a large amount of people love it means I have to love it too?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, no, I guess not. But how can you not like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's boring, way too long, predictable, and what's more, the aliens are the silliest looking creatures I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ What about the digital animation? Nothing like that was ever done before, it was positively groundbreaking."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I'll give you that, it was amazing, however one can't spend hours just looking at pretty virtual scenery."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, why else don't you like the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's full of mistakes and plot holes that just ruin the whole thing. I mean glaring errors that can't be ignored."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't catch any mistakes. Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for one thing, why were the scientists so furious when they discovered what Jake was doing with the video logs? How could they have not known what he was doing the whole time?"
"__MOVIES__ I see. And what else?"
"__MOVIES__ The message of the movie is too preachy for me, and a bit hypocritical as well."
"__MOVIES__ Now I'm totally lost. What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's supposed to be a metaphor for how humans are destroying the earth, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I suppose so."
"__MOVIES__ So then why do they spend the majority of the movie blowing up trees instead of promoting peace?"
"__MOVIES__ They didn't blow up the Home Tree!"
"__MOVIES__ Thank goodness.."
