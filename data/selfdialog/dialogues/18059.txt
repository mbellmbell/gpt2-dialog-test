"__MOVIES__ I think it was La La Land."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"

"__MOVIES__ I wanted to see that so bad! I just never got to the theatre."
"__MOVIES__ It was an amazing movie. The actors were excellent and the story was really powerful."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to have to try to find it on demand or in the redbox."
"__MOVIES__ You definitely should. Do you have an all time favorite movie?"

"__MOVIES__ It has Albert Finney and Billy Cudrup in it. It's an excellent movie."
"__MOVIES__ What type of movie is it?"
