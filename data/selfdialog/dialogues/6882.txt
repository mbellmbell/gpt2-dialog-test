"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think was the worst thing about the Star Wars prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it was Jar Jar Binks. He was too goofy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I thought the problems were much deeper than that."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The characters were all terrible. Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Queen Amidala were flat and had no personality."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that makes sense. I hadn't thought about it like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ And furthermore, the plots were boring. There was so much talk about trade routes and the Galactic Senate and other dull things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I suppose you're right. The original movies were a classic 'hero's journey' arc, but these were a mess."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the new sequel trilogy is off to a better start."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think so, too. I hope they continue to evoke the spirit of the original trilogy."
