"__MOVIES__ Did you like Jurassic Park?"
"__MOVIES__ It was okay"
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it when the trex was chasing the jeep"
"__MOVIES__ It would be cool to have a dino zoo."
"__MOVIES__ I have a hard time believing the animals would be that hard to control"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I would not want to be the one to control them"
"__MOVIES__ There are already big animals in zoos."
"__MOVIES__ The bigger dinosuars would be the coolest ones"
"__MOVIES__ It would be expensive to feed them"
"__MOVIES__ Would you go to extra lengths to fence them in?"
"__MOVIES__ You would not lose electricity if you had multiple redundancies."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure that simply not having electricity would make a difference"
"__MOVIES__ It seemed really unsafe to have the trexes behind those flimsy electric fences"
"__MOVIES__ That was like the electric fence you use to keep animals out of your garden"
"__MOVIES__ You would want some kind of barrier"
"__MOVIES__ In Jurrasic World they almost make the park right"
"__MOVIES__ The birds were the main problem in that"
"__MOVIES__ If the birds were well fed I don't think they would go after the people"
"__MOVIES__ They make the predators scary"
