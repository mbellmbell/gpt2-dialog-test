"__THRILLER__ Did you enjoy Basic Instinct or Basic Instinct 2?"
"__THRILLER__ Basic Instinct 2 was trash. Sharon Stone was in it but Michael Douglas didn't return for it."
"__THRILLER__ I don't blame Michael Douglas for not coming back for Basic Instinct 2. The fact they made a second one is a shame."
"__THRILLER__ Did Sharon Stone do any other notable movies after Basic Instinct. She sort of just disappeared after being such a big star during that time."
"__THRILLER__ She was in a few movies I remember such as the mother in Alpha Dog and various other roles that I can't recall right now."
"__THRILLER__ Alpha Dog is the movie with Emile Hirsch, Anton Yelchin, and Justin Timberlake right?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah that's the movie, Amber Heard, Olivia Wilde, and Amanda Seyfried were also in it."
"__THRILLER__ What a star studded cast. I guess Sharon Stone just got older and stopped getting rolls. Basic instinct was probably her most notable role."
"__THRILLER__ She was terrific in Basic Instinct. It was such an intense thriller, you kept wondering if she was the murderer."
"__THRILLER__ I know, the movie was very sexy, but very mysterious and dark too, a perfect thriller in my opinion."
