"__MOVIES__ Hey, do you want to see a movie this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I'd love to! What should we see?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking something with action."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, what about Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I've been dying to see it. Finally a woman headlining a movie like that!"
"__MOVIES__ Seriously! How many men have we seen at a center of an action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Too many! Did you hear about the men who were complaining about a women-only screening?"
"__MOVIES__ I did see that on the news! How silly."
"__MOVIES__ It would be so cool to go with all women!"
"__MOVIES__ Agreed! Then let's look for a women-only screening tomorrow."
"__MOVIES__ I'm all in! Did you know the director is a woman, too?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know that! Who is is?"
"__MOVIES__ Patty Jenkins. She also directed Monster, from 2003."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Charlize Theron?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one! It was super creepy."
"__MOVIES__ I know! Let's hope that Wonder Woman is a little different."
"__MOVIES__ I think it should be a little more... inspirational."
"__MOVIES__ I think so! Wait, guess what? Look what's on IMBD!"
"__MOVIES__ Let me see! Looks like Robin Wright is in Wonder Woman, too!"
"__MOVIES__ We're definitely seeing it tomorrow then, no question!"
