"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think the 76ers will draft in the upcoming NBA Draft?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They have the toughest pick at #3. There's no clear-cut choice with that pick."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it's not like the first and second pick."
"__BASKETBALL__ This is a two-player draft. Then after that, it's up in the air with 6 really good players."
"__BASKETBALL__ They have to address their needs rather than taking the best player available, which I think is Tatum."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. They have too many big men as it is. Taking another forward or center is redundant."
"__BASKETBALL__ So who should they take? A point guard?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They need shooting. They should take the best shooter available, which is Malik Monk."
"__BASKETBALL__ Even if there are 5 players that are better than him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, because the five players better than him aren't strong shooters or play positions they don't need."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's a shame they didn't get one of the top two picks. Those guys would be perfect for their team."
"__BASKETBALL__ What's ironic is the teams that did get the top two picks don't really need those players on their roster."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Celtics and Lakers both need big men in a draft that's top heavy with point guards."
"__BASKETBALL__ Fultz and Ball are both upgrades over who they have now, but I don't see either team being better the next year."
"__BASKETBALL__ They'll both be better in the long run, which is what the draft is really about."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wish there was a way the Celtics could find a player that makes them both better next year AND better in the long run."
"__BASKETBALL__ They would have to pass up on Fultz and take someone like Tatum, but that's a poor choice in the long run."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think they would trade the pick for the chance to get a lot better next season?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They would need to get a very young player in return who is on a long contract to ensure he stays with the Celtics for at least 3 years."
"__BASKETBALL__ Even then, I don't think it's a good move. Fultz is the best prospect to come around in the last five years."
