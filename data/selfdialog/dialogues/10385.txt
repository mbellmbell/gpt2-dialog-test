"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So, do you listen to much rap music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I won't lie to you, it's not really my favorite genre, but there are a few guys I do."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really, like who?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, I'm more into 'old school' type rap, like Run-DMC, Public Enemy, NWA and stuff like."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, yeah, I listened to a lot of those growing up."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, for example, really loved 'It's Tricky' by Run-DMC and, of course, the duet they did with Aerosmith."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, yeah, both of those songs are classic!  'Walk This Way' was the one they did with Aerosmith."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I'm told it really helped bring rap music into the mainstream environment."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I remember when I was a kid they used to play that video and 'Tricky' a lot on MTV."
