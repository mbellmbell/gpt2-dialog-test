"__STAR_WARS__ Did you watch any of the newer Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw The Force Awakens and Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which did you like better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked Rogue One, The Force Awakens was too much like a remake."
"__STAR_WARS__ I actually liked The Force Awakens much better."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was pretty much a remake though, there was nothing new in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I will agree it was pretty much a reboot but I did not like Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It just seemed too perfect and it was obvious what was going to happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess we see it differently."
