"__STAR_WARS__ Luke Skywalker or Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ If you asked me this question when I was 11 than Luke. If now Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?Why the change?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke at 11 years old because I could relate to the innocence,now Han as an adult because of his defiance against the system."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same with me. Luke is really the pefect hero for children,while Han is a hero for adults."
"__STAR_WARS__ This is why Star Wars is so popular because many different age ranges can relate."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke is so pure and good at the beginning that most children can relate to him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah,sort of like a Peter Pan in away,while Han is more the scoundrel."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han is like this rebel who is trying to do anything he can to get ahead."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is why Han is relatable for most adults and usually becomes the adult's favorite character."
