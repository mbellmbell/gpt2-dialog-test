"__THRILLER__ Did you like Taken?"
"__THRILLER__ Not really.  I'm not into that kind of movie."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I loved it.  Liam Neeson was awesome in it."
"__THRILLER__ I really don't care for him either."
"__THRILLER__ So, I guess you didn't see the sequel."
"__THRILLER__ Nope.  The first one was enough."
"__THRILLER__ It really had me on edge."
"__THRILLER__ I mean, I guess it was exciting, but I don't care for it."
"__THRILLER__ Do you like anything else Liam Neeson is in?"
"__THRILLER__ I honestly couldn't tell you anything else he is in."
