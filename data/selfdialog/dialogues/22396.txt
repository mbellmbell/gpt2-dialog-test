"__DISNEY__ Honey We Shrunk the Kids is a great film."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah it is. Rick Morranis is hilarious."
"__DISNEY__ I really like the scene when they find that giant Oatmeal Cream Pie."
"__DISNEY__ Haha. That makes me hungry every time I see it."
"__DISNEY__ And do you remember when they have to fight the giant ant?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. That would make me so scared if ants were really that big."
"__DISNEY__ I want to build a device in my back yard like Rick did and search my yard for bugs."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, only he was searching for his kids!"
"__DISNEY__ I hope I wouldn't find any of those in my yard."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure you don't have to worry about that."
