"__STAR_WARS__ Some say the best Star Wars movie is The Empire Strikes Back - your thoughts?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, from a storyline and script perspective, but in terms of movie-making and cultural significance, it has to be episode IV, A New Hope (i.e., the original)."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but in terms of movie itself, don't you have to say that Empire Strikes Back..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Let me interrupt you right there. No, Stars Wars -- the first one -- revolutionized the movie industry. Summer blockbusters, product tie-ins, catering to a youth market. We are still living in the consequences of this."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I see what you are saying, but just in terms of a movie itself, much of the story and dialogue of the original is so corny, hackneyed, and B-rate."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, and if memory serves me correctly, Lawrence Kasdan wrote the second screenplay and it was more nuanced, believable, adult, and mature."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you still holding onto your opinion that the original Star Wars is the 'best'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it's not really even a debate when factoring in cultural impact and significance, which you have to."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jaws had a similar cultural impact, but would you say Jaws is a better movie then say, Citizen Kane or The Seventh Seal?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, but you're creating a straw man argument there. Star Wars is almost like a religion, and it's impact has to be taken into account when evaluating all of the movies in the franchise."
