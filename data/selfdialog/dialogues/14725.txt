"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, you planning to go to any concerts this summer?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, but Roger Waters is touring, I would love to see him. Tickets are really expensive though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh man, that would be a sweet show. Is he doing more Pink Floyd or his own work?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I would think more Pink Floyd because that's what the fans want. I think his previous tour was The Wall, but this one is broader."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, that would be awesome to see in person. I've probably listened to Dark Side of the Moon like 1000 times."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too. It's crazy to think that it's been around for 40 years but still never gets old."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ For sure, some of those classic rock albums hold up amazingly well. Just great music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The Rolling Stones are still touring, I think. They're well into their 70s and still rock."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Haha, those tickets are even more expensive."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ If you can afford it, I doubt you would regret paying for the tickets. It must be an unforgettable concert."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I'll probably try to go to a few festivals."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Those are fun, depending on what bands are playing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But the cool thing is there's usually something for everyone. You can go with a big group and split off to see different groups if people have different tastes."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Absolutely, the variety is what makes those so much fun."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The crowds can be a bit overwhelming though. I think I prefer assigned seats."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, you might end up with the girl on her boyfriend's shoulders right in front of you."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That would be super annoying. At least you could still hear the tunes."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ True, and that's the most important part."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The music and the atmosphere. There's something about the live shows that makes it sound so much better."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm 100% with you on that one. The energy of the band and crowd are better than any home stereo ever could be."
