"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the NFL East?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah! The best division in football!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Says you! In the 90's yeah, but not now my friend. Dak and Zeke in Dallas. What do you think they'll do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sophomore slump."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What!?! Your crazy man Dallas is going to repeat as East Champs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't see it. You seen their schedule?  8-8"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever  man. Who you got in Second?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard. I'm going to say NY Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are always hard for me to pick. They can go 7-9 or 13-3, and I never know what they will do!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli should be Eli again 30 td and 20 INT. But that's good enough for second and a playoff spot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then the Redskins ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Cousin has to prove he deserves that money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like him. I really do. I just aint convinced he's a leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he tries.  But im saying they'll play 500 ball"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And that's putting Philly in last."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I Like Carson Wentz, and there Coach too. I forget his name. Used to be Farves back up"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know who youre talking about. They will be ready in 2018, but not yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All the division games in the East will be tight!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt! Always are!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, my final predictions are Dallas, NY, WSH, and Philly last.but all of them over 500. They are all going to be competitive this year!"
