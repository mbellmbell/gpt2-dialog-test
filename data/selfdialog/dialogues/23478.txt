"__DISNEY__ Hi, are you a fan of the Pixar Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I love them! They are so emotional."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah some of them have such tear-jerking moments. It's quite emotional for a kids movie."
"__DISNEY__ I saw 'Inside Out' recently and I was bawling my eyes out."
"__DISNEY__ Were you crying at the part with the imaginary friend, Bing Bong?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, don't even bring that up. You are going to make me cry right now!"
"__DISNEY__ I teared up at that part. The more emotional part was when Riley came home from running away."
"__DISNEY__ It's such a powerful movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I really hope they make a sequel."
"__DISNEY__ That would be great. The teaser about puberty at the end was great."
