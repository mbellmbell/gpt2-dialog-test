"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure like the potential for Carr with the Raiders!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, he seems poised to be a great one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may already have passed Andrew Luck on the food chain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but I still prefer Luck.He did't close his atrocious offensive line, the newly fired GM, Greyson did!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he certainly didn't do Andrew any favors.He is still young.He has amazing physical tools."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His stats are trending down.At one time, people would have taken him over Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was then..this is now!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott! Was he a one-hit wonder?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he just got hemmed up in a fiasco with an autograph machine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Poor decision! His people should have known better.If Prescott plays like he did last year for the Cowboys.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ..They will need a Brinks Truck to carry away all his cash.No unnecessary distractions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he is the 'real deal'. Jerry Jones, the Boys Owner, does as well, and he signs the paychecks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Romo retired to the color booth.He got the message."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Phil Simms got kicked from the top CBS broadcast team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Phil HAD to go.He has been ragtime for years!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree and then some!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the Broncos.What do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, i am not sure, but I think Andre Ware retired. They need more ballers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also like the potential of Houston, with a healthy Watt, and Brian Cushing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is still not enough to topple the Patriots.Let's not even talk about those cheaters!"
