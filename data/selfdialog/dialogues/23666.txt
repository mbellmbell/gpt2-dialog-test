"__DISNEY__ Do you remember Disney's The Black Cauldron?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. That movie really scared me when I was little."
"__DISNEY__ It was a bit dark for a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ I remember hearing they squished pasta to make the sound effects for the living dead army."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I had not heard that."
"__DISNEY__ That was the only part that freaked me out as a kid. The rest was ok though."
"__DISNEY__ Even the part where Gurgi sacrifices himself?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd forgotten that part."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't the witches say they could not save him, but they did?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so. I wonder why they said that?"
