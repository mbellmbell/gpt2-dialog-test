"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen Fight Club?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes. That's one of the greatest movies ever."
"__THRILLER__ I agree. No matter how many times I've seen it, I can always watch it again."
"__THRILLER__ The concept for that movie was so ahead of it's time."
"__THRILLER__ Right? I was so confused by the ending the first time I saw it."
"__THRILLER__ I never expected the split personalities either."
"__THRILLER__ I researched the movie online, and there were certain hints that gave it away early."
"__THRILLER__ I've seen that, too. The characters swapping places for like a split second."
"__THRILLER__ It would be really hard to catch unless you slowed it down."
"__THRILLER__ Definitely. It was a really cool creative decision, though."
