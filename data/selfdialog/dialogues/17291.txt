"__MOVIES__ What was the most overrated movie you've ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess there's quite a few that come to mind."
"__MOVIES__ Try to narrow it down to just one."
"__MOVIES__ Just one?  That's not an easy task."
"__MOVIES__ Well, enlighten me."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'll say E.T."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting choice."
"__MOVIES__ I just don't think the film was that great to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ It was a very 80's movie for sure.  Many iconic parts though."
"__MOVIES__ You mean him saying 'Phone home?'"
"__MOVIES__ Not just that, but eating Reeses, the flying bicycle..."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean, but how much of that was deserved?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't consider it one of Spieberg's best films."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I'm saying."
"__MOVIES__ That being said, I don't think it was overrated.  It was just a good flick that others love more than us."
"__MOVIES__ But that's the very definition of overrated."
"__MOVIES__ Again, it's iconic though, not overrated."
"__MOVIES__ I would much rather watch Alien if we're talking about extra-terrestrials."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, now that's a 180 degree turn."
"__MOVIES__ Just telling you how it is."
