"__MOVIES__ Are you into really freaky movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it depends what kind of freaky you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Well, like abstract kind of horror films."
"__MOVIES__ I'm into most movies like that."
"__MOVIES__ Have you by chance seen The Thing?"
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't ring a bell, who stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ The main character is played by Kurt Russell."
"__MOVIES__ I love him, hes always in crazy weird movies."
"__MOVIES__ He definitely is."
"__MOVIES__ So what is the movie The Thing about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well to start with, he is out in a winter terrain with a team of scientists in a remote building."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting so far. Go on."
"__MOVIES__ Then they find some kind of remains of an alien species that was buried under the snow."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but there is a catch to the story."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so whats the catch?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the alien ends up being very hostile, and more like a parasite."
"__MOVIES__ A parasite? Holy crap sounds nasty."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it really is. It ends up 'consuming' people and taking their form to blend in."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds really gross, I'd probably love watching the movie though."
