"__MUSIC__ Do you like Prince?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes but I lost interest when he started getting political."
"__MUSIC__ I think he was best during the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ Yes during his purple rain days he was the king."
"__MUSIC__ I think Michael would disagree."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Yes I'm sure but I think they had different types of fans."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I know they had a rivalry."
"__MUSIC__ They did but I don't think either of them needed to worry."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they both had very different styles and I feel like their fans were from different worlds."
"__MUSIC__ That's true.  I think that if they weren't listening to prince they probably wouldn't listen to michael anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah almost 2 different genres"
"__MUSIC__ Prince was very sexual in his performing."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's possible that the crotch grabbing might have been michaels way of competing."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe.  There was so much talent between the 2 of them."
"__MUSIC__ Imagine what they could have done as a team?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think the music world could handle that much awesomeness."
"__MUSIC__ No I don't either."
"__MUSIC__ Then again since they had such different styles."
"__MUSIC__ It might have been a disaster."
