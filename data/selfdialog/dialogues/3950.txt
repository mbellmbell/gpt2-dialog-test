"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with Amon Amarth?"
"__MUSIC__ Who or what is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a Swedish melodic death metal band with viking themed lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Melodic death metal. Can you even listen to that?"
"__MUSIC__ Indeed you can, even though it has growling vocals it has some incredible instrumental parts."
"__MUSIC__ Can you even make out the lyrics through the growling?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course you can, you just need to listen and get used to the singer."
"__MUSIC__ So do you have any songs or albums you can recommend from them?"
"__MUSIC__ The first album I heard was Versus The World and it's still one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Have they released a lot of albums?"
"__MUSIC__ They have 10 full length albums released over the last 20 years."
"__MUSIC__ That's actually really impressive."
"__MUSIC__ It is indeed, and that's not even mentioning that they are an incredible live band."
"__MUSIC__ Have you been to any concerts with them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I had the fortune of seeing them a couple of times and they blew me away with their performance."
"__MUSIC__ So would you say they sound better live or in studio?"
"__MUSIC__ They are much better live at least in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I'm not used to bands actually being able to perform the music they make in a studio and making it sound better."
"__MUSIC__ Strange, that's quite opposite of my experience when it comes to live bands."
"__MUSIC__ That makes me look at the metal genre with a newfound respect."
