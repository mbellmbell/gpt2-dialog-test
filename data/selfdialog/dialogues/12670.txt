"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Vikings offensive line will be better this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they have Riley Reiff and Mike Remmers now so that should help a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Reiff is a definite upgrade for the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely and they should be able to better protect their quarterback with a stronger line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were really weak at that last season. That's probably what led to a lot of their losses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're lucky Bradford wasn't injured they way he was getting sacked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they also got Pat Elflein in the third round which should help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have put a lot of money into the team but they really didn't have a choice if the want to be competitive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True and Bradford got sacked 37 times last season so they have to try to fix whatever the issue is there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will use all three as starters?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Reiff is definitely a starter and it looks like Remmers will be as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Elflein will have to prove himself as a backup first though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably because he isn't well known and hasn't had any time in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would like to see their offensive line catch up with the talent of their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Reiff working with Matt Kalil should make for a very strong offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As well as superior protection for their quarterback which is necessary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think T J Clemmings will be replaced?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More than likely after all of the sacks Clemmings allowed last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if their offense improves it will make for some interesting competition in the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as they can keep these guys healthy they should be in good shape."
