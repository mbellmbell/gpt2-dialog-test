"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for the NFL season to start!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either! This is going to be an amazing season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's hard to tell who is going to the playoffs. It's a passing game, with a look of talent at quarterback this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget about the receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't forgotten but receivers mean nothing without someone to get them the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same goes for the other way around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, so who are the top 3 receivers that realistically can help carry their teams to the post season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Antonio Brown, Odell Beckham Jr., and Julio Jones. In that order."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is no way OBJ is better than Julio Jones, and what about Dez Bryant?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dez is good, but he has nothing on the other 3 and even if he did, he isn't carrying Dallas to the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok so what about OBJ and Julio Jones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I'm a Giants fan so I have to give it to my boy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We agree that Antonio Brown is the best receiver in the league though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, his numbers don't lie. He's got over a thousand yards in the last four seasons and coupled with the Steelers defense, they will definitely see the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No credit going to old man Big Ben."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's only 35!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but every year he get's older the ball is going fly a little shorter and less hard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Might be true, but he threw for almost four thousand yards last year so the age isn't showing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steelers in patriots in the big game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. It's going to be a rematch of last year."
