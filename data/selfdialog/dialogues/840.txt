"__MUSIC__ What were you listening to this afternoon?"
"__MUSIC__ I was listening to some Metallica. I used to like them when I was young and haven't heard their music for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Their new album that came out last year, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I pretty much only listen to their older music. In my mind, they stopped making music after 1989."
"__MUSIC__ So And Justice For All was the last album by them that you liked?"
"__MUSIC__ There were a couple of good Black Album songs but they really lost their edge after that. Enter Sandman was okay but not that heavy really."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah if someone had never heard of Metallica before and you played them Ride the Lightning and then Load they would think they were two completely different bands."
"__MUSIC__ James Hetfield seems like a completely different person in his older years."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that their new album is sounding much more like their original stuff."
"__MUSIC__ There's something that sound like For Whom the Bell Tolls?"
"__MUSIC__ Not exactly like that but maybe more along the lines of the song Hit the Lights from their first album"
"__MUSIC__ Interesting, I'll have to give that a list. What's a good song from Hardwired... to Self-Destruct?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the song named Hardwired is good. Also a song called Moth to Flame isn't bad either."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favor Metallica album?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Mastr Of Puppets like most people but I also really like the Garage Days albums. Those are aways pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I like their cover versions of Misfits songs. It's interesting to hear a metal band's version of punk rock songs."
"__MUSIC__ What are some good Metallica videos to watch on YouTube?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorites are the live in Seattle from 1989 videos. That concert looked amazing and I wish I could have been there."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've seen some of those clips, that was Metallica at the peak. What's the best song from that concert?"
"__MUSIC__ I really liked the live version of Blackened that they did. It sounded very tight and heavy."
