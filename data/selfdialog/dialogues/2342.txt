"__MUSIC__ I wonder what the earliest musical instrument is."
"__MUSIC__ That's easy. Human voice."
"__MUSIC__ That's not an instrument."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what is a musical instrument? A device? Or a tool? Does it have to be fabricated? Human voice has been used to make music for all of humanity for all we know."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, yes, but to be an instrument, it has to be fabricated."
"__MUSIC__ Then the earliest 'discovered' musical instrument is a flute made of ivory found in Germany. It was dated to 42,000 years ago."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty old, I wonder what notes it makes"
"__MUSIC__ That's a great question. Not sure. They should really do a study on the pitch of the flute. It will be so interesting."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if there are academics who specialize on such things."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure there are, but I have no idea what they're called."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe musical ethnographic history."
"__MUSIC__ You just made that up"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but sounds likely."
"__MUSIC__ i think some of what we know about ancient musical scales from mostly from Greece."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. How did they figure that?"
"__MUSIC__ well, they have records of how the tones were produced. it's called systema teleion."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you know these things?"
"__MUSIC__ They're interesting tidbits of history. anyway. The major breakthrough in music theory came by the way of the mathematician Pythagoras."
"__MUSIC__ The triangle guy?"
"__MUSIC__ yes. The triangle guy. He figured out that the frequency of a vibrating string is proportional to the inverse of the length of the string. Generating the scales from that is just dividing the string arithmetically. 1:1 is unison, 2:1 is the octave, 3:2 is the fifth, 4:3 is the fourth and so on."
