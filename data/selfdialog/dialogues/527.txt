"__MUSIC__ Who is the best female artist of the 80's?"
"__MUSIC__ That's an easy one: Madonna."
"__MUSIC__ Not Madonna. Sure she was popular, but I wouldn't call her the best female artist of the 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Why not? She was a trend setter. She was like nothing that had ever come before her."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's debatable. There was Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, and the Runaways..."
"__MUSIC__ But they didn't have near the popularity as Madonna, or the impact on pop culture."
"__MUSIC__ Look, if you want to seriously discuss the best female artist of the 80's, then it has to be Tina Turner."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she do the soundtrack for a Mad Max movie?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but she did a lot before that."
"__MUSIC__ I think that might disqualify her right there."
"__MUSIC__ Not a chance. Think about it. She sang Proud Mary."
"__MUSIC__ You mean Rolling on the River?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's the one."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, that rocked. She is amazing when she performed that."
"__MUSIC__ Nobody is in her class."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know about that. What about Cyndi Lauper?"
"__MUSIC__ No way. She Bop and True Colors doesn't make you the best of the 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Then what about Whitney Houston?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, ok, that's a little different. She had quite a few hits."
"__MUSIC__ She isn't Tina Turner, but she rocked in the 80s."
