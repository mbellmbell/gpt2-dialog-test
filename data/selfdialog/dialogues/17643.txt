"__MOVIES__ Sorry we got cut off at last week's lunch movie discussion."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I did think it was rude that you answered your cell phone before I could finish my thought."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we were talking about blockbusters which makes me think of action films and computer generated effects."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, so many films are like that these days."
"__MOVIES__ But another type of film so prevalent these days, animated--you said you don't seek those out either."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I've been burned a couple times planning to go to a movie featuring one of my favorite actors, only to find that they are just doing voiceover for an animated character."
"__MOVIES__ But haven't you liked some of those movies--come on give me a few."
"__MOVIES__ O.K., but most are probably a few years old, but don't worry I won't bring up Steamboat Willy."
"__MOVIES__ What, oh yeah, early Disney; all right, go on."
"__MOVIES__ Toy Story, Tangled, Up,Up and Away, those ogre ones."
"__MOVIES__ Shrek?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes--that's all I can think of--oh I did see some other Disney ones--Little Mermaid and that ice one."
"__MOVIES__ Frozen.  Well what about the new version of Beauty and The Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually did see that."
"__MOVIES__ And?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty good, because I liked that it had real people along with the animation."
"__MOVIES__ Big Emma Watson fan are you?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually I've only seen one or two Harry Potter films, but she's all right."
"__MOVIES__ O.K., you've missed so many animated films, but next time let's talk about a good recent movie."
"__MOVIES__ All right, if I don't get out of the house, I'll see what Netflix has to offer."
