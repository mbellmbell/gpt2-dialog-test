"__LADY_GAGA__ So I finally listened to the Lady Gaga songs you gave me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah? What did you think?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I am so in love with her! She's the best."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know. Any favorites?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I've been pretty much listening to Bad Romance on repeat all day."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. It's a winner. Have you seen the video?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, but I'm guessing I need to!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes! It's so high fashioned and weird in the best way, and the dancing is so hot."
"__LADY_GAGA__ All of her dancing is amazing. But her vocals are spot on."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. She sounds even better in concert."
