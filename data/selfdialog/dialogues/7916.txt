"__POP__ What album is better? U2's Pop or Lady Gaga's ARTPOP?"
"__POP__ Aren't they both supposed to be satirical of pop music?"
"__POP__ Yup, and they were both hated."
"__POP__ Lady Gaga for sure."
"__POP__ Why not U2?"
"__POP__ Well, she didn't really change her character for it. U2 did an entire disaster of a tour."
"__POP__ U2 is better for me. Their music is much more sophisticated."
"__POP__ Lady Gaga was only crazy for two albums. She's 'normal' now."
"__POP__ True, but U2 transcends all culture."
"__POP__ That's their problem. They're super snobby."
