"__MUSIC__ Here is a good CD."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, Handel Concertos. Sounds cool."
"__MUSIC__ It's amazing. Michala Petri and Keith Jarret achieved something spectacular with this."
"__MUSIC__ It's cool to see an actual CD and a jewel case again. It's been a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I still think CDs beat streaming audio."
"__MUSIC__ What's the album like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's incredible. The music comes alive with feeling and grace."
"__MUSIC__ Is it energetic?"
"__MUSIC__ In places. They don't treat the score like a museum piece."
"__MUSIC__ Good. It's sad when classical music is approached in a stuffy fashion."
"__MUSIC__ These musicians followed up with a CD of Bach concertos which is similar, though Bach and Handel were worlds apart, expression wise."
"__MUSIC__ Bach generally used repeating patterns, while Handel wanted to build up themes within pieces."
"__MUSIC__ It's great to have booklets and liner notes instead of just an MP3 title floating in digital space."
"__MUSIC__ We're missing out a lot by abandoning analog media like physical album covers and printed text."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, I prefer the Handel CD to the Bach one. It shines out a warm light, if you know what I mean."
"__MUSIC__ How would you describe the Bach CD?"
"__MUSIC__ It's more of a rainy day walk through dark streets. Bach really dives into minor keys."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds sad and slow."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Handel seemed to put more tension into his music, which adds physical life and works well at many tempi."
"__MUSIC__ I look forward to hearing this!"
