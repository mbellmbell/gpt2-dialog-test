"__STAR_WARS__ The final Death Star scene in Return of the Jedi was intense"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I agree. A lot of action and fighters flying around"
"__STAR_WARS__ There were some pretty cool new fighters in that scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh right, like the A-wing fighter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and then the B-Wings."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't remember those"
"__STAR_WARS__ yeah, they weren't very prevalent."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do remember Lando was piloting the Millennium Falcon in that one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I remember. Pretty good ship for a hunk of junk."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha, ha. That's right. It always seemed to perform well under pressure."
