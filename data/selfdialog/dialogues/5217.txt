"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm really impressed that the Fast & Furious movies are able to get such great actors to join the franchise."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, they really stepped it up ever since The Rock joined."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He was the first one to bring that kind of outside star power into the franchise."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ 'Fast Five' was probably my favorite one, and it had everything to do with The Rock."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's unbelievable that now, they have actors like Charlize Theron playing the main villain."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah. I mean she's won an Oscar before."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Also, Kurt Russell as Mr. Nobody."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I loved him in that role."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I suppose if they can get Helen Mirren, they can get anyone."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's right, I almost forgot about her!  I can't wait to see who they bring into the franchise next."
