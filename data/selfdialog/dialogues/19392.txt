"__MOVIES__ What is the most memorable scene from the movie, 27 Dresses?"
"__MOVIES__ That was a great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too!"
"__MOVIES__ Most memorable scene...I guess I would have to say the scene where the protagonist was modeling dresses."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes. The 27 dresses she had collected from the many wedding parties she had been a part of in the past!"
"__MOVIES__ That's right! It reminded me how special dresses can e like photographs of different moments in one's life."
"__MOVIES__ Because the reporter was taking photos?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe that was part of it, but it was more because each dress was uniquely chosen and used as part of a truly special, one-time event."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that."
"__MOVIES__ And the actress was so convincing at how she felt each dress held a special place i her heart and reminded her of something important."
"__MOVIES__ What was that?"
"__MOVIES__ These dresses meant more to her than mere clothing. They represented her 'being there' for her friends, and they gave her hope that one day her friends would be there for her as well."
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of a romantic sentiment, don't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure. And the other scene that really jumps out at me was the 'Benny and the Jets' sing-a-long in the bar."
"__MOVIES__ That was a riot!"
"__MOVIES__ I loved how neither she nor her singing partner and future love interest new the words. That was so real."
"__MOVIES__ I know! I do that all the time!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! You just sing the words you believe sound right, but don't really know the lyrics."
"__MOVIES__ And sometimes you don't even realize what you are singing doesn't make sense."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! We sing disconnected from the lyrics!"
