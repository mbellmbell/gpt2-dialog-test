"__MUSIC__ What do you think about the music artist Drake?"
"__MUSIC__ Eew. I think he is horrible!"
"__MUSIC__ Why? I figured you would like him because he is super popular."
"__MUSIC__ I do usually like popular music but the artist has to have some talent."
"__MUSIC__ So what exactly don't you like."
"__MUSIC__ All of his songs sound the same and the lyrics are horrible. Shall I give more reasons?"
"__MUSIC__ Go ahead. I'm curious."
"__MUSIC__ He is completely tone deaf. Have you actually heard him before?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I didn't pay much attention. Is he from America?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure but I think so."
"__MUSIC__ He could be Jamaican, it seems like a lot of rappers are."
"__MUSIC__ That's possible, but I don't so.  I think he is from California."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I so a picture of him at NBA games with the Kardashians."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't mean he is from California."
"__MUSIC__ I get it, I am stereotyping, its just because I hate his music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the good thing is, that rappers come and go quickly."
"__MUSIC__ I sure hope so because I'm about to give up listening to the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Stay positive, you love music way to much to sop listening to the radio."
"__MUSIC__ This is true. I'm sure the next new artist I will love."
