"__DISNEY__ My favorite Avenger is Captain America!"
"__DISNEY__ Why?"
"__DISNEY__ He's awesome! He's all about freedom, and fighting Nazis, and his shield is really cool!"
"__DISNEY__ I like Iron Man. Tony Stark can be a bit rough around the edges, but he's got brains! He fights with what he makes himself!"
"__DISNEY__ He kind of took the wrong side during Civil War."
"__DISNEY__ He had a point, though, it's easy to go too far. When you fight monsters, you have to make sure you don't become a monster too."
"__DISNEY__ That's true, but who decides what's right? The Government? If the law says you have to hurt some people and you know it's wrong, you have to go against the law to do what's right."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good point."
"__DISNEY__ That's why Captain America fought against Iron Man. Tony was going overboard to protect everyone because he was scared and it was compromising everyone's freedom. Plus, Hydra had taken over SHIELD."
"__DISNEY__ Man, Marvel's pretty deep."
