"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure if I want to see 'Dunkirk' or not."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about soldiers from different Allied armies during World War II engaged in a pretty heavy battle in Belgium."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds intense."
"__MOVIES__ It could be, though I don't know if it'll be like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Black Hawk Down.'"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, those were really hard to watch."
"__MOVIES__ They were. I'm okay if 'Dunkirk' isn't as tough. Sometimes hard scenes like that are impressive but can make the movie as a whole hard to watch."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Sometimes they overdo it even though it's more factual."
"__MOVIES__ Christopher Nolan directed this one so you can be sure it'll be dark."
"__MOVIES__ And take itself as serious as a heart attach."
"__MOVIES__ Most likely. But it has an amazing cast."
"__MOVIES__ I heard Tom Hardy is in it."
"__MOVIES__ He is along with Kenneth Branagh."
"__MOVIES__ I heard one of the guys from One Direction is in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Harry Styles. It's his first film I think. We'll see how it goes for him."
"__MOVIES__ It'll either be like Justin Timberlake or Vanilla Ice."
"__MOVIES__ That's a huge spectrum. I think his part is small enough that it won't affect the outcome of the movie though."
"__MOVIES__ When does it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Next month. Not sure if it'll be a huge box office draw or not."
"__MOVIES__ Let me know if you go. I might want to join."
