"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Guardians of the Galaxy Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet."
"__MOVIES__ You totally should! I'd even go see it with you just to see it again."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Do you think it's really that good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I totally cried at that movie and I never cry at movies."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't sure I would see it, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I've heard some really mixed reviews about it."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, some of my friends loved it, but others really hated it."
"__MOVIES__ I honestly can't believe that. I can't think of what they could possibly hate about the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, someone told me they thought that the plot was too all over the place."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely disagree. There were a few different plot lines going on, but they are came together in the end."
"__MOVIES__ I also heard that it was a bit too over the top."
"__MOVIES__ What big box Hollywood movies aren't over the top right now?"
"__MOVIES__ True. That is true."
"__MOVIES__ What good feedback did you hear about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, my friend Kristopher told me that he thought it would be this generation's Star Wars if that franchise wasn't still going on."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's a pretty accurate description. Why don't you decide for yourself? Want to go see the movie tomorrow night?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure thing. Let me know what time and I'll be there!"
