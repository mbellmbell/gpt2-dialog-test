"__MUSIC__ Awesome. It's a classical concert."
"__MUSIC__ I love classical."

"__MUSIC__ I appreciate that. I definitely want to go."
"__MUSIC__ We've got good seats too."

"__MUSIC__ I guess that makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ We'll be able to see them from our seat."
"__MUSIC__ That's great. This is going to be awesome."
