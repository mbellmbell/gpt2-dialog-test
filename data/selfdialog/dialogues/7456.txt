"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you heard Lady Gaga's latest? I can't get enough."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I can't say that I have, sport. Tell me all about it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's called 'Boys, Boys, Boys' and it's the best. I'll sing it if you want."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I have to be honest, I have no idea who she is. Is she that girl who wore the meat dress?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yes, exactly. And my second favorite is 'Disco Heaven' and my third favorite is 'Don't Speak' but I think that might be someone else."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Hmmm. I'll wiki it. You are correct, it is someone else. Hey, you're a little late; those were released like 9 years ago."
"__LADY_GAGA__ But I just bought them today so they're new to me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Can't argue with that logic. So something like 'The Cure' from this year isn't new?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I haven't bought it yet. All me all the time, that's how I live."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I fear for the future."
