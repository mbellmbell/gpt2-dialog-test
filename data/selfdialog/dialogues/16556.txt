"__MOVIES__ So are you into the new Star Wars movies or do you just like the originals?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm old school, all the way."
"__MOVIES__ What don't you like about the new ones?"
"__MOVIES__ The new ones are so corny and not at all like the original trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ I understand that about the Episode I, II and III, but what about The Force Awakens and Rogue One?"
"__MOVIES__ Those are better but I still feel like the acting is pretty cheesy, especially Felicity Jones."
"__MOVIES__ What, you don't like female lead roles?"
"__MOVIES__ I do, if the female can actually act."
"__MOVIES__ You don't think Felicity Jones is a good actress?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think she looks and sounds like a chipmunk."
"__MOVIES__ Well, now that you say that, I can see it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like the newer movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I love the new ones, especially John Boyega and Oscar Isaac's characters."
"__MOVIES__ The Force Awakens is probably the best one out of everything made after the originals."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about the shots of the fallen Star Destroyer?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh now, the cinematography was incredible in both The Force Awakens and in Rogue One."
"__MOVIES__ In Rogue One, the city under the Star Destroyer was incredible."
"__MOVIES__ I will agree with that, it's just the movies don't have the magic that the original three had."
"__MOVIES__ I like the new ones, but I see what you are saying about the magic."
"__MOVIES__ Everything came together and had that spark in the first three."
