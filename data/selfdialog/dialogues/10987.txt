"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, what do you think about football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I prefer more manly sports"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  How about I pretend I didn't hear that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha!  Lighten up bro!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but what is more manly than football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ MMA"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's arguable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True.  But you vs one other guy until one of you gives up or is knocked out is super manly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think I'm right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah. I mean football has a group of guys plowing through each other to get a ball to the other end of the court by almost any means necessary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well when you spin it like that..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, there is no 'spin'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there is a spin, but you also have a point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So football we can agree is more manly then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll have to disagree then"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Indeed"
