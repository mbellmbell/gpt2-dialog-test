"__MUSIC__ Has there ever been a song that made you cry?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, definitely!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too. Music has that ability to make me emotional."
"__MUSIC__ I'd probably say that there a lot of songs that have made me cry."
"__MUSIC__ I listened to the song 'I Will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston right after my mom died, and I cried like a baby."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's one of the things about music - if it hits you in the right way, it can devastate you emotionally."
"__MUSIC__ So, what's the song that's most provoked that emotion for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I'm not sure I can think of one."
"__MUSIC__ So then what's one example?"
"__MUSIC__ OK, I can think of one. It's probably a slightly weird one."
"__MUSIC__ I doubt it's that weird. What is it?"
"__MUSIC__ I was listening to the Talib Kweli song called 'For Women', and at the end, I started to cry."
"__MUSIC__ What made you cry?"
"__MUSIC__ The song just gave me so much empathy for people for whom the world has been unkind and cruel."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard the song."
"__MUSIC__ Most people probably wouldn't have that reaction. I probably wouldn't have had that reaction, most times."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can understand that. The music hit you in exactly the right way in the moment."
"__MUSIC__ It's interesting, the connection between music and emotions."
"__MUSIC__ It's an intense thing!"
"__MUSIC__ It's good to talk about it, though."
