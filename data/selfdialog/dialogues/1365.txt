"__MUSIC__ This new Chevelle album is really rocking out."
"__MUSIC__ I've never really gotten into Chevelle..."
"__MUSIC__ Why not if you don't mind me asking, you like the Deftones?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, they sound like Tool wannabes to me"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they are a Tool tribute band, so that's sort of the point?"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I didn't know that!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, check out some of the earlier tracks like 'Comfortable Liar'"
"__MUSIC__ I'm looking it up...I do like their track 'Here Come the Gunmen'"
"__MUSIC__ That's a classic on of theirs up there with 'Hats off to the Bull'"
"__MUSIC__ That one I'm not so into, I like the Red ok, but that's about it."
"__MUSIC__ Are you listening to 'Comfortable Liar' yet?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I pulled it up on Youtube...stupid ads..."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, well this is more the flavor of what they do in Omen, their new album."
"__MUSIC__ I can see tracks, but not albums, what's their best ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, well the good ones here for me are 'Warhol's Showbiz' and 'Door to Door Cannibals'"
"__MUSIC__ This song is awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Which one? The ones I was just talking about or Comfortable Liar?"
"__MUSIC__ Comfortable Liar, it has great guitar parts and drive."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, but the best one is Joyride, just don't drive to that one or you will get pulled over."
"__MUSIC__ This is really cool, I'm gonna give Chevelle another shot."
