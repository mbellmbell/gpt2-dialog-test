"__STAR_WARS__ Hey did you catch The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The new Star Wars movie? Yeah I saw it in the theater"
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about them killing off Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean he was pretty old, so it wasn't as big of a deal. I really like Han, and I'm upset that he died, but it made for a good story"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it did. And how great was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's fantastic, and I totally didn't see that twist coming"
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Rey will convinve him to come to the light side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know. I think he might have a better chance of getting her to join the Dark Side."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? What makes you think she'd do that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rey seemed really angry, and resentful about her parents abandoning her. We still don't know who her parents are, so they could be related for all we know."
