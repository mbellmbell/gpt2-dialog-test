"__BASEBALL__ How long were you a Yankee fan?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh gosh since the glory days when i was a kid."
"__BASEBALL__ Who was playing then?"
"__BASEBALL__ My favorite was Mickey Mantle"
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see him play?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes my dad used to take me to games and I saw him play several times"
"__BASEBALL__ What did you see him do?"
"__BASEBALL__ One time he hit a homer into the upper deck and the ball bounced off the top pf a sign and bounced into the section we were sitting in."
"__BASEBALL__ Was it a big game?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was a important game with the Red Sox and my dad was able to catch the ball because we were in a thinly populated section of the bleachers.  It was a walk off homer, it won the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, cool what happened to the ball?"
"__BASEBALL__ I still have it and my dad was somehow able to get the Mick to sign it after the game.  He was really nice and patted me on the head."
"__BASEBALL__ Any other special Yankee games?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, we got tickets to the 1977 World Series, the first one for the Yankees that they won in 13 years."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you remember?"
"__BASEBALL__ The best memory was when Reggie Jackson hit three home runs on three pitches to win the game.  Those Dodgers could not get over that."
"__BASEBALL__ What did you see."
"__BASEBALL__ We were in the lower deck on the third base side and saw Reggie swing with all he had and drive the ball into another zip code."
"__BASEBALL__ Ha ha that must have been cool."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that was before players got paid so much that they became corporations in themselves, they really loved to play and you might get to meet some of them.  Those were the good old days."
