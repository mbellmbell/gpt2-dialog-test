"__MUSIC__ I'm thinking of getting my mom an album of some kind for her birthday."
"__MUSIC__ That's nice of you! Any ideas on what you're going to get?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm still debating. She's big into older music."
"__MUSIC__ Like classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, more like rock and roll from the 50s and 60s."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I understand. Like Chuck Berry, Elvis, the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ She's a big Elvis fan, I know that."
"__MUSIC__ Then you should get her an Elvis album!"
"__MUSIC__ The problem with that is that she has all his stuff already."
"__MUSIC__ Then maybe you should consider some artists from around that time."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, like I mentioned, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Big Bopper. Guys like that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not all that familiar with their  music. But I can read up a little bit."
"__MUSIC__ I bet if your mom likes Elvis, she'd like Chuck Berry."
"__MUSIC__ Were their styles simiar?"
"__MUSIC__ In a lot of ways, Chuck Berry was the trailblazer, and Elvis followed in his footsteps."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, then I bet my mom would like his music too!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Maybe get her the album 'Rockin' at the Hops'."
"__MUSIC__ I will. Thanks for the recommendation!"
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome. I hope it's a good present."
