"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, of course."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite villain."
"__STAR_WARS__ Tough one, but Boba Fett."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well he is so mysterious and he has some awesome gadgets, he's like the outer space Batman."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus he doesn't say much he's all action which I like."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never really though of Boba Fett as a villain more of just muscle."
