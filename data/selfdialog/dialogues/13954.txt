"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been keeping up with the playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but they've been pretty terrible this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, they should have just skipped the playoffs and had the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Everyone already knew we were getting a final's trilogy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yup, Golden State and Cleveland are just so much better than everyone else."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's sort of unfair to the rest of the league, don't you think?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, both the Warriors and the Cavs have historically been bottom dwellers, so I'm okay with it."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess."
"__BASKETBALL__ Think about it, more than half the titles ever won in the NBA have been won by just two teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're right, the Celtics and Lakers spent decades tormenting the rest of the league."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly, let these two teams enjoy their time in the spotlight, it will be short lived."
"__BASKETBALL__ You have a rooting interest this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm torn, it's the best player versus the best team."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm siding with the Warriors, basketball is a team sport, I can't stand guys like Lebron James."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, but this is like watching this generations Michael Jordan, we can tell our kids, we saw Lebron dominate the league for years and years."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's also a total egotistical diva."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, people didn't hate Jordan until after he retired."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, people have a million reasons to hate Lebron in the past, present and future."
"__BASKETBALL__ You've convinced me, go dubs!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Chef curry with the shot!"
