"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I am not sure about the Seahawks. I believe more in the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I'm not sure. I just feel like the Patriots have to lose eventually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, whose gonna beat them? The Jets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HA! Thats laughable. Talk about a disgrace of a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they really seem to be going nowhere fast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly! Miami could pose a challenge though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I'm just not sold on Ryan Tannehill yet. Are you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure about him either, but he has a nice supporting cast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but eventually he has to just do it or not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is still just a middle of the road quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Miami needs a top flight quarterback if they really want to do good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree, but he has not proven to do that yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. They have some good receivers and playmakers, but he hasn't proven much yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Miami just hasn't done much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, even if they have some success, I'm not sure that they can take down New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, New England just continues to get stronger and especially with their addition of a star cornerback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they just keep getting better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure use free agency that way it is intended to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they do build through the draft, but fill holes through free agency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well that is definitely the right way to do it."
