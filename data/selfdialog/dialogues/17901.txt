"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of any good movies coming up?"
"__MOVIES__ Not any that have really caught my eye."
"__MOVIES__ I saw a commercial for a new Diary of a Wimpy Kid."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I liked the first two."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they were cute and funny. Something good for the whole family."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The books were good too."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think they have the same actors, though."
"__MOVIES__ I doubt they do. They must all be grown."
"__MOVIES__ That's the problem with sequels. If they are too far apart the actors out grow the parts."
"__MOVIES__ It makes it difficult to follow with different actors."
"__MOVIES__ This is the type of movie, though that it really doesn't matter."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right. The characters will still be the same."
"__MOVIES__ I think I might take my daughter to see it over the weekend."
"__MOVIES__ I am sure she will like it."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of want to see the Captain Underpants one too."
"__MOVIES__ What? They made one of those?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, where have you been?"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I'm too busy to pay attention to this stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe well see a double feature."
"__MOVIES__ That would be fun!"
