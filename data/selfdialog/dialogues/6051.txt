"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the new digital remastered versions of Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They were pretty good, some of the stuff wasn't though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't like that extended Cantina scene on Tattooine, they had an entire new musical number thrown in."
"__STAR_WARS__ So?  What's wrong with that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was just cheesy, you have this 80's quality movie then suddenly you just threw in this high quality dance number with aliens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was pretty funny."
"__STAR_WARS__ You would, you also loved Jar Jar."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hey man, Jar Jar was a very well developed character."
"__STAR_WARS__ My point exactly."
