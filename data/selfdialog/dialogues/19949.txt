"__MOVIES__ Which Harry Potter movie do you like best?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a hard one. Probably the third or fourth."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones are those again?"
"__MOVIES__ Prisoner of Azkaban or Goblet of Fire."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right. Goblet of Fire is probably my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's just such a different setup from the ones before it."
"__MOVIES__ True, the tasks are so cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it was nice to have a bunch of new characters in the mix."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! Fleur and Cedric are my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ True, they're both so good looking."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Cedric's death is so sad though."
"__MOVIES__ Don't bring it up, it's horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, at least Robert Pattinson got to do Twilight after."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, he's definitely done well since then."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Goblet of Fire is really when things start to go bad, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Right, it's the first time Voldemort is really back I think."
"__MOVIES__ They made him so scary in the films."
"__MOVIES__ True. They really had to work on Ralph Fiennes to get his face like that, I bet."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely, it's so scary."
"__MOVIES__ Voldemort is for sure one of my favorite villains."
