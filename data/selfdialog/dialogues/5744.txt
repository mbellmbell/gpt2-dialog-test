"__STAR_WARS__ We should totally go see the new star wars movie together."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Last Jedi? I am so down."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's supposed to be out on December 15th."
"__STAR_WARS__ We should go to the premiere."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like the night it opens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, we'll probably have to wait in line a few hours but the premieres are always the coolest!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm down I guess. Do you dress up?"
"__STAR_WARS__ We can if you want to!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it would be fun. Want to go as Hans and Chewy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so down. I call Chewy!"
