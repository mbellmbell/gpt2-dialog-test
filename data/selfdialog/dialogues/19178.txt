"__MOVIES__ Are you planning on seeing 'Rough Night'?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, definitely! I love 'Broad City', and it's directed by a couple of the writers from the show."
"__MOVIES__ I never really got into 'Broad City'."
"__MOVIES__ You're missing out, big time. That show is hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ It seemed like it was trying a little too hard, the times when I watched it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, then 'Rough Night' might not be up your alley."
"__MOVIES__ The premise looks kind of funny, though. And I do like Scarlett Johanson."
"__MOVIES__ What about Kate McKinnon?"
"__MOVIES__ She's hit or miss for me. I love her on SNL, but didn't really like her in Ghostbusters."
"__MOVIES__ The Ghostbusters remake was kind of a weird thing. It had some funny parts, but overall I didn't really enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ See, I thought it was pretty good, but I just didn't really like McKinnon."
"__MOVIES__ Bottom line for me is that bringing together Ilana, Scarlett Johanson and Kate McKinnon means that I'm definitely up to watch 'Rough Night'."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of had a Bridesmaids type vibe for me, watching the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I could see that. It hit some of the same notes."
"__MOVIES__ Bridesmaids was really good. But so much of the awesomeness was Melissa McCarthy."
"__MOVIES__ She was outstanding in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's kind of lame to compare movies to other movies just because the casts are all women."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but at the same time, it goes beyond that. Both 'Rough Night' and 'Bridesmaids' feature raunchy laughs and some heartfelt moments."
"__MOVIES__ Good point. Well, let me know how good 'Rough Night' is."
"__MOVIES__ If it's as good as Bridesmaids, I'll be sure to recommend it to you!"
