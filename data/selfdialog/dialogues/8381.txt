"__POP__ What is your favorite song by them?"
"__POP__ Its so hard to pick just one, but 'Its Gonna Be Me' is up there in my top favorites, along with 'This I Promise You'."

"__POP__ Remember when Justin Timberlake still had the bleach blonde frosted curly hair? It was 'Tearin' Up My Heart' when he said 'Bye, Bye, Bye' to the curls and shaved his head!"
