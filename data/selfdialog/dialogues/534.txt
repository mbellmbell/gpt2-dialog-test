"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of a band called The Hold Steady?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. What's their last album?"
"__MUSIC__ The last one they released was called 'Teeth Dreams.'"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard it."
"__MUSIC__ You should check it out. It was pretty awesome."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty solid rock."
"__MUSIC__ I like rock. But what kind are we talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ It depends on who you ask. They're technically indie rock, but you could call it alternative."
"__MUSIC__ Alternative? I don't know about that."
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of post-punk. It's kind of old-fashioned rock."
"__MUSIC__ Oh okay. I like that kind of music."
"__MUSIC__ I know! They got started singing songs about the midwest."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I'm okay with the midwest."
"__MUSIC__ It's just like their songs are kind of stories. The lead singer, Craig Finn, is really good at character development."
"__MUSIC__ That's different."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's something you don't really hear too much of."
"__MUSIC__ So his songs are stories."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Check out the album, or maybe some of their earlier stuff. Then we can talk about it."
"__MUSIC__ For sure."
