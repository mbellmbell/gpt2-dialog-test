"__MOVIES__ Have you heard they are making another Indiana Jones movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Really, I didn't think the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull did that well."
"__MOVIES__ It actually did well at the box office, but it was not received well by the critics."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it in the theater. It wasn't perfect, but I would watch another one."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Harrison Ford is such a strong actor, he can carry anything."
"__MOVIES__ He is getting a bit old for action roles. Don't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ He did his own stunts for the Force Awakens."
"__MOVIES__ True, but I thought his age was showing quite a bit. He seemed tired."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably because he broke his leg early in filming. I think he still has some action movies left to film."
"__MOVIES__ What? He broke his leg? How did that happen?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the door of the Millennium Falcon closed on it. He had to take some time off before he could finish filming."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess it turned out well. Maybe not so much for Han Solo. I wonder if he will make it through another Indiana Jones movie."
"__MOVIES__ They could try to pass the torch to a younger actor, but I don't think they would kill him off."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe he could be the elder adventurer, like Sean Connery was in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."
"__MOVIES__ I could see him doing that very easily."
"__MOVIES__ It would be a better idea that trying to replace him. I don't think another actor could play that role."
"__MOVIES__ What about Jason Statham?"
"__MOVIES__ What? No, way! Are you serious?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. That would be a whole different kind of Indiana Jones movie!"
