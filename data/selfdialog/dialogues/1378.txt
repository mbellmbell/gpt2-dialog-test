"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the band, First Aid Kit?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't. Do you think I would like them?"
"__MUSIC__ I think you would. They're two sisters from Sweden, who are in an indie folk band."
"__MUSIC__ It does sound like I would like them. What are some of their albums?"
"__MUSIC__ They have three albums out so far, The Black and the Blue, The Lion's Roar, and Stay Gold."
"__MUSIC__ Which one should I listen to first?"
"__MUSIC__ The Lion's Roar, it's the one I like the best. My favorite songs are on it, 'The Lion's Roar', 'Blue', 'This Old Routine', and 'Wolf'."
"__MUSIC__ I'll make sure to listen to them. Can you recommend any other indie folk bands?"
"__MUSIC__ I certainly can. I really like the bands, Gregory and the Hawk, Mumford and Sons, Ingrid Michaelson, and Bright Eyes."
"__MUSIC__ I love Gregory and the Hawk! I can't tell you how many times I've listened to 'Boats and Birds'."
"__MUSIC__ Same here, except for me it was, 'The People Who Raised Me'."
"__MUSIC__ What songs did the Bright Eyes release? Their name sounds familiar but I can't remember any of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't listened to their more recent music. I like their older songs, 'First Day of My Life' and 'Bowl of Oranges'."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I remember them now! I used to listen to them all the time in high school."
"__MUSIC__ So did I!"
"__MUSIC__ They sort of remind me of the band, Never Shout Never."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can see that. I only remember a two of their songs though."
"__MUSIC__ Which songs do you remember?"
"__MUSIC__ 'On the Brightside' and I think the other one is 'Big City Dream'."
"__MUSIC__ Those were two of my favorites, and you were close. It's 'Big City Dreams'."
