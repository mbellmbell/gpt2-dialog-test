"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like Episode I, II, or III?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Absolutely not!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They were horrible movies!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What was the worst part about them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Um. How about Jar-Jar Binks!  That was the WORST character ever!!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Worse then all of the Ewoks?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, good point, those were pretty bad too."
"__STAR_WARS__ So are you sticking to Jar Jar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, all things considered, he was pointless.  At least the Ewoks were cute!"
