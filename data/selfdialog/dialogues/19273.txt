"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Blood Sport the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, it's a classic."
"__MOVIES__ Yea that's my favorite Van Damme movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know that it's my favorite Van Damme movie."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite then?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. Maybe Time Cop."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea Time Cop was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, blood sport was great too, but Time Cop actually had a story."
"__MOVIES__ Blood Sport had a story. It was about a martial arts master honoring his teacher."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you can call that a story. But there was no actual reason to fight."
"__MOVIES__ There was after the main villain put his friend in the hospital."
"__MOVIES__ No there wasn't. It's called Blood Sport, that's part of the game."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. But the fight scenes alone in that movie got me so motivated to get in shape."
"__MOVIES__ Yea me too, I remember working out in my room while listening to the soundtrack."
"__MOVIES__ Van Damme actually has been doing a lot of movies recently."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I know he did that documentary piece, and then started doing a lot of straight to dvd films."
"__MOVIES__ Yea but he was also in the expendables, and in my opinion, was a great villain."
"__MOVIES__ He was amazing. Too bad they killed him off."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I would love to see him return as a bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ Who knows, maybe we'll see him in Fast n Furious some day."
