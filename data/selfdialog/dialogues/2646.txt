"__MUSIC__ Have you heard about what Roger Waters said about David Gilmour this time?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Roger said that David and him were never and WILL never be friends. Roger's freaking crazy."
"__MUSIC__ I cannot wait to see Conor Oberst this weekend. I hope he plays Empty Hotel by the Sea or Cape Canaveral."
"__MUSIC__ Good luck with any old stuff. According to setlist.fm, he's mostly doing new stuff, mostly Salutations and some of the newer Bright Eyes stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I am so tired of seeing Aracde Fire all over Pitchfork's website. I swear they are such posers."
"__MUSIC__ Who? Arcade Fire or Pitchfork? I assume you were referring to both."
"__MUSIC__ Unbunny never released another album. It's already been like seven years and not one sign of life."
"__MUSIC__ I bet he just gave up because no one liked his music which is odd because he reminds me of Elliott Smith."
"__MUSIC__ I read that Belle and Sebastian were asking fans to email a photo of themselves so that they could pick a few fans for the cover of their new album."
"__MUSIC__ I love their music but I don't want to pose like a pretentious hipster and then just have a color filter applied to the photo. Gross."
"__MUSIC__ I was watchig some Frog Eyes videos on Youtube and some of the comments said that Carey Mercer was their high school teacher. How I wish I could say that!"
"__MUSIC__ That's funny but it's also pretty cool that his students like him because of who he is. Good for him."
"__MUSIC__ I downloaded some live Wolf Parade songs on soulseek. The songs are actually good quality for being bootlegs."
"__MUSIC__ I heard one of their live versions of I'll Believe in Anything and I could hear that Dan Boeckner was clearly the leader of the band. This whole time I thought it was Spencer Krug."
"__MUSIC__ That Deerhunter show was freaking awesome. Did I tell you about how I met Bradford Cox?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes like a million times. You were walking into the bar and you looked up and saw him, blah, blah, blah. Also, I was there when it happened."
"__MUSIC__ I bet you if anything that the last Beatle to die will be Ringo Starr. It looks like it's going to be that way."
"__MUSIC__ Just our luck. I wouldn't doubt it since Paul McCartney had already died one time back when the Beatles were barely making it."
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen the Dark Side of the Rainbow? It's when you play Wizard of Oz with Dark Side of the Moon at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I have, but have you seen Alice Heart Motherland? That's when you play Atom Heart Mother along with Alice in Wonderland. Definitely worth it!"
