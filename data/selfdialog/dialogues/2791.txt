"__MUSIC__ Would you say you have pretty eclectic musical taste?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, definitely. I listen to all kinds of music from classical and jazz to Heavy metal and hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like progressive rock?"
"__MUSIC__ If you mean stuff like Pink Floyd and Emerson Lake and Palmer then yes. Is that your favorite kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I suppose most of the stuff I listen to is progressive rock, but I am also pretty eclectic in my tastes as well."
"__MUSIC__ I'm always on the lookout for some new stuff to listen to. What other progressive rock bands are there?"
"__MUSIC__ There are a ton of progressive rock bands, but people don't tend to know about them because they don't get played on the radio as much."
"__MUSIC__ I see. What are some examples of this?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, some really good bands that you never hear on the Radio are Gentle Giant, Happy the man and Camel."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think they never get played on the Radio?"
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, I'm not sure why. I think that when radio stations play songs from several decades ago they only play the ones that were at the top of the charts at some point."
"__MUSIC__ And those bands never had number-one hits on the charts?"
"__MUSIC__ Right, although their music is very creative and even sophistocated. I think it takes a more seasoned musical taste to appreciate it."
"__MUSIC__ I get sick of hearing the same hit songs over and over. I like to find obscure groups that are very good, although not well known."
"__MUSIC__ My feeling exactly."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think makes Gentle Giant a good band?"
"__MUSIC__ The music has a very unique sound. The vocal style is troubadorial, while the instrumentals are very complex and jazz-influenced."
"__MUSIC__ That's hard to imagine. I suppose I won't really understand until I hear it."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of the progressive rock music from the early seventies has a distinctly jazz-influenced sound. You could almost call it jazz-rock fusion."
"__MUSIC__ That's very true."
