"__MOVIES__ Are you looking forward to Transformers: The Last Knight?"
"__MOVIES__ No. No, no no no no. Never."
"__MOVIES__ Why? It's our childhood."
"__MOVIES__ Michael Bay is NOT our childhood. He ruins everything he touches"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. They're entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Then you're a child. His movies have so many cuts and so much action you can't follow who is doing what."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't matter! It's just robots beating the crap out of each other."
"__MOVIES__ Which is part of what makes it unwatchable: we don't know what's happening and with whom."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm going to see it. The plot looks good."
"__MOVIES__ What...IS...the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ You don't know what it is?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the previews and have no idea what it's about other than robots on Earth again."
"__MOVIES__ It's about the Last Knight."
"__MOVIES__ Who is the Last Knight?"
"__MOVIES__ umm, I'm not sure yet."
"__MOVIES__ See? You're hardcore and don't know what it's about!"
"__MOVIES__ It's about why they keep coming back to earth."
"__MOVIES__ You  just looked that up. WHO is the last knight?"
"__MOVIES__ Markey Mark!"
"__MOVIES__ Ha, no. My guess is that the Earth's core has something vital to them."
