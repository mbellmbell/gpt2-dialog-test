"__MUSIC__ Ready for the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ I told you, I'm NOT going. It's not music."
"__MUSIC__ Don't be a snob, it totally is."
"__MUSIC__ John Cage's 4'33' is NOT music."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It's literally some idiot at a piano sitting still for 7 minutes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the music is what's created by the audience and random sound throughout."
"__MUSIC__ No, music is organized. This is random and disorganized."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know you defined music for everyone."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't--that's the general definition."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you like Cage?"
"__MUSIC__ He gets credit for nothing. And performers put it on their resume without doing anything."
"__MUSIC__ But he came up with the idea, so he deserves it."
"__MUSIC__ But how can you pay money to hear what you can hear at home for free?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the experience. This is art, you grump."
"__MUSIC__ I'll go on one condition."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, what's that?"
"__MUSIC__ I eat fiber and protein bars, broccoli, and beans beforehand."
"__MUSIC__ Don't ruin it."
"__MUSIC__ Then I'm not going. Farts can be musical."
