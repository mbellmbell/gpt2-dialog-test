"__SUPERHERO__ Let's talk about Avengers: Age of Ultron."
"__SUPERHERO__ Too many people complained about this movie.It wasn't as good as the first one but it was good."
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought Ultron was a little disappointing."
"__SUPERHERO__ He wasn't the best bad guy but the Vision was so cool."
"__SUPERHERO__ The Vision was the best. He was enigmatic a first but he won the Avenger over."
"__SUPERHERO__ He won Thor over quickly by picking up his hammer."
"__SUPERHERO__ That was so funny, none of the Avengers could pick up the hammer but the Vision did."
"__SUPERHERO__ WHAt was it, only he who is worthy can pick up the hammer Odin said."
"__SUPERHERO__ And the Vision did it, handed it to Thor like it was nothing."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, I like that part."
