"__MUSIC__ sup jarry"
"__MUSIC__ hey mate how's it going"
"__MUSIC__ not bad"
"__MUSIC__ alright"
"__MUSIC__ J you know that colleague of mine i told you he knows how to rap?"
"__MUSIC__ yeah yeah remember we were all together at your girl's birthday party."
"__MUSIC__ oyeah good that dude"
"__MUSIC__ so what about him."
"__MUSIC__ he dropped his demo at the reception of sony music, and guess what."
"__MUSIC__ what?"
"__MUSIC__ he got a call from sony boss himself to see him ,say boy got mad rap skills and they need to talk"
"__MUSIC__ wow that's big, when was that."
"__MUSIC__ just yesterday, they plan to meet today at SONY headquarters."
"__MUSIC__ hmm, whilst am happy for him,also do well to tell him not to rush into signing any legal contract out of excitement, Sony had crippled so many artist they sign, good example is 'DMX'"
"__MUSIC__ you yeah i know about the dmx deal, he signed authorizing sony the right to his material for life,so now he's bankrupt sony still makes million from his greatest hits."
"__MUSIC__ yeah, too many artist had rushed signed deal just to be famous, i have heard your colleague rap and damn that guy got skills so they would want to entice him to accept their offer by throwing him yummy upfront cash."
"__MUSIC__ that some word though i would call him and  give him the advise, so just incase they present him an offer straight up he should ask for time for his lawyer to review the contract."
"__MUSIC__ exactly it makes more sense that way, music is like business he should treat it as one,."
"__MUSIC__ rightfully said,would let him know, i am just so excited i would soon be a paddy to famous rapper."
"__MUSIC__ well that's if he doesn't make industry friends and find you so out of his league lol."
