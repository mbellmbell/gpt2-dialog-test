"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see the new Harry Potter movie."
"__MOVIES__ I though they'd done them all already?"
"__MOVIES__ This is a spin offâ€”Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."
"__MOVIES__ Like that charity book Rowling did?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ So what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. Some magical animal wrangler I think."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I've seen any promotions for it."
"__MOVIES__ You must have, they were everywhere. New York got blown up."
"__MOVIES__ So it's like a disaster movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's supposed to be funny. There was a dragon or something."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the originals, but you're not selling this to me."
"__MOVIES__ But it's got the older character in it. Young Dumbledore!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Okay that could be fun."
"__MOVIES__ Right?"
"__MOVIES__ Will they make him gay in the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They'd better. It's cannon after all."
"__MOVIES__ Is Grendelwald in them?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, but I think it's a twist at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, maybe I'll go see it with you then."
