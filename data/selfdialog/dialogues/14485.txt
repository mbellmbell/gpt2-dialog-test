"__HORROR__ So, this gay Babadook meme has me thinking of the film again. Did you see it?"
"__HORROR__ Yes. I loved the art with the book illustrations but the scares were somewhat standard fare for horror. The meme is fabulous, though."
"__HORROR__ I get what you mean about the  scares but that ending though…"
"__HORROR__ Oh yes, the ending was brilliant. The big bad isn't banished, merely made manageable. Good twist."
"__HORROR__ I read in some interviews that it was a metaphor for grief and/or childhood mental illness."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I can see that. That's a new one. Almost like how Insidious had a haunted child as opposed to a haunted place."
"__HORROR__ Yes, except this movie didn't suck the life out of me with boring actors like Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne."
"__HORROR__ Oh my glob, I know right? They're like watching cardboard. Totally took me out of the atmosphere of the tilm. I just wanted them to die."
"__HORROR__ Wanting the protagonists to die is a bad thing for horror… like normally you want to root for them."
"__HORROR__ Yes, you want your Final Girl to triumph. Not the ill-defined underworld Darth Maul Tiny Tim … thing."
