"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I get all pumped up inside thinking about it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I need to place an order for some football gear pretty soon"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, that's right.  I want a new Lion's hat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HAHAH.  Lion's huh?  That's cute."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?  They play every Thanksgiving you know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah yeah....and what's their record I wonder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't know, I don't follow them that closely.  My kid wants a fidget spinner too."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow...why so many?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All the kids.  They all want one, even the two adult children.  Can you believe it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully they will include a season schedule this time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For what?  The Pats?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why don't you just download the app to your fancy phone?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the app is cool cause you can set reminders and preferences.  It's handy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dunno.  Does it cost?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope...do it today!"
