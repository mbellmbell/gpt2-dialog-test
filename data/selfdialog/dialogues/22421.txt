"__DISNEY__ I going to Disney World for vacation, but I haven't seen any of the movies."
"__DISNEY__ Well you certainly can't watch all of them now.  You'll never finish."
"__DISNEY__ Which one should I watch first?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, if you are going to Disney World, I would watch CInderella."
"__DISNEY__ Why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, Her castle is in the middle of the park."
"__DISNEY__ I guess it is also a pretty famous one."
"__DISNEY__ It is a classic.  It has a beautiful story, and the music is amazing."
"__DISNEY__ Isn't that where 'A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes' is from?"
"__DISNEY__ That's right.  It is a beautiful song."
