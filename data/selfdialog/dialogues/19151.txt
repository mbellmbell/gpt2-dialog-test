"__MOVIES__ I'm a huge fan of Greta Gerwig."
"__MOVIES__ So am I! What are your favorite Greta movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorites are Mistress America and Frances Ha."
"__MOVIES__ Frances Ha is definitely my favorite movie of hers. She's so witty and her improvisation is outstanding."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoy that about her plus she always plays such a lovable character."
"__MOVIES__ She's always the free spirit and so optimistic. It simply makes you feel good watching."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I also caught her recently in 20th Century Women which was a fantastic movie by the way."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that yet, but is that also the one with Elle Fanning and Annette Bening?"
"__MOVIES__ Such a good movie! Yes they're also in that along with Greta. It's basically about three generations of women in the same household raising this boy."
"__MOVIES__ Did Greta's performance blow you away like in her previous movies?"
"__MOVIES__ She was terrific! I forgot to mention Billy Crudup is also in there. He lives in the house with them too."
"__MOVIES__ He's a terrific actor. I still remember his performance from Big Fish as well as Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah 20th Century Women is a terrific film. I have to thank Greta's presence for bringing it to my attention."
"__MOVIES__ I'll check it out. Now I'm tempted to watch Mistress America and Frances Ha again."
"__MOVIES__ Mistress America was number two for me. I really like Lola Kirke. She's so underrated."
"__MOVIES__ She was awesome in Mistress America opposite Greta. They had such good chemistry."
"__MOVIES__ Lola's hasn't failed me either in any of her movies, but I think she needs to do more work with Greta, the banter they pull off is spectacular."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen any other movies with Lola but I did really like her in Mistress America too as the struggling college student looking to find herself."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'll throw on a few of those movies later on tonight."
"__MOVIES__ I'll try to look for 20th Century Women!"
