"__DISNEY__ One Disney movie I really like but many don't seem to is The Lion King 2."
"__DISNEY__ I know that movie. It's pretty good."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I actually prefer it more than the first one because I like the romance story between Kiara and Kovu."
"__DISNEY__ It does seem to be more developed than Simba and Nala's romance."
"__DISNEY__ Plus I like the actor who does Kovu's voice."
"__DISNEY__ Who does Kovu's voice?"
"__DISNEY__ Jason Marsden. He is a pretty popular voice actor that does a lot of work for Disney shows and movies."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I remember him. Didn't he do the voice for Max in A Goofy Movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that's him alright."
"__DISNEY__ Cool. I liked that movie too a lot."
