"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Guess what movie I saw yesterday?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Logan."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's right. How did you know?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You've only been talking about it for the last month."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was fantastic!  There was this great scene...."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Save it. I'm not interested."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What!? Why not?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't like superhero movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Logan isn't a superhero. Well, not exactly. He's...."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't care. I don't like those type of movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, ok.  What do you like?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I like movies about situations I can relate to, with regular people who aren't waving guns around and bulging with muscles but yet they never eat or if they do they only eat salads."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You mean like regular dumb farts who eat Pop-Tarts for breakfast?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ So you must have liked Ordinary People?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, that was superb. Especially the part where Mary Tyler Moore got naked."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wait, what!?  I don't remember that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, you missed an eyeful buddy. She was a knockout."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I gotta check Netflix. I mean, right now."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Relax--it's in my list."
