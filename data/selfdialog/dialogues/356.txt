"__MUSIC__ What are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm listening to one of my favorite bands, Faith No More"
"__MUSIC__ I remember those guys, they had that one song, Epic, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but they had quite a few songs that sounded so different than that one. You should check out the rest of their stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I honestly didn't recognize the band, they sound so different!"
"__MUSIC__ Their lead guitarist on the Real Thing left during the recording of Angel Dust, and Mike Patton is one of the most versatile singers out there."
"__MUSIC__ He sounds a bit like Chris Cornell on this song."
"__MUSIC__ Guys like Patton and Cornell have such a range, you never know what you're going to get out of them."
"__MUSIC__ I bet, I don't hear too much variety on the radio nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ You gotta know where to look, some stuff on the radio is fine but there's just a lot of packaged pop out there."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, even the dance music doesn't get my feet moving."
"__MUSIC__ It seemed like that music's been in a decline since it fell out of favor in the late 90s."
"__MUSIC__ It's made a comeback in recent years but just isn't as appealing."
"__MUSIC__ I blame autotune, personally."
"__MUSIC__ Autotune can make any one sound like they can sing."
"__MUSIC__ Some of those rap artists use it, but they just way over do it. I imagine it can be helpful in some cases, but they should tune it down."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of the rappers we grew up with didn't need it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they could rap and sing, they could have easily branched out into R&B."
"__MUSIC__ I can sure go for some good old fashioned soul music right about now."
"__MUSIC__ I can put on a good R&B station if you want me to."
