"__MOVIES__ My wife bought home 'Clown' on DVD yesterday."
"__MOVIES__ Not to sound stupid or anything, but what is clown?"
"__MOVIES__ CLOWN is a story of a loving father who dons a clown outfit and makeup to perform at his son's sixth birthday, only to later discover that the costume--red nose and wig included--will not come off and his own personality changes in a horrific fashion."
"__MOVIES__ So the clown outfit is cursed?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep and to break the curse of the evil outfit, the father must make grim choices with his own family facing danger."
"__MOVIES__ So, did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I had a blast watching it. It was creepy, and gory."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it is a good thing you don't have a fear of clowns."
"__MOVIES__ Man if I did, I would be messed up right about now."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like an original premise for a movie."
"__MOVIES__ I actually really enjoyed this one but you already know  I'm also a sucker for monster movies."
"__MOVIES__ Who isn't?"
"__MOVIES__ This is a  creative new monster. Sure, we have plenty of scary clown movies, but this one was unique in that the man literally turns into the clown, against his own will, as the suit and decorative attire just absorb into him."
"__MOVIES__ I love the sound of this concept. Plus is sounds as if it was very creepy."
"__MOVIES__ It was! Making the dad become the monster was an unique and a creative new spin on the scary clown idea."
"__MOVIES__ You are making me want to go out and find this DVD."
"__MOVIES__ You won't be disappointed. I can guarantee you that."
"__MOVIES__ Did it remind you of Penny wise?"
"__MOVIES__ In a way but not really. This is a whole different type of beast."
"__MOVIES__ Where did you find that movie?"
