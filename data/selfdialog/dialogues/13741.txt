"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Spurs beat the Rockets in game 6 the other night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you kidding me? That was more like a beatdown and an embarassment."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah! And the Spurs were the more injured team. They didn't have Leonard or Parker."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Rockets should have taken game 6 easily, especially since they were at home."
"__BASKETBALL__ No doubt. But James Harden pretty much quit on his team in my opinion."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. And the Rockets played with absolutely no effort. The whole team just quit."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not the Spurs, though. They got pretty much all the rebounds and did all of the hustling."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who is that guy who wears number 17 for the Spurs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That is Jonathon Simmons. He had some monster slam dunks!"
"__BASKETBALL__ That man stepped up at the right time for Kawhi Leonard. The Spurs needed Simmons."
"__BASKETBALL__ For sure. I hope Leonard will be back in time to play the Warriors. They'll need Leonard badly then."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah! Because the Warriors are the best team in basketball right now. They haven't lost a playoff game this year!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Really? Who have they played so far?"
"__BASKETBALL__ First, they played the Trail Blazers, then the Jazz. And the Warriors swept them both!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I can see that, especially when you have Curry, Durant, and Green on the same team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't forget Klay Thompson. He's just as good as the other three you mentioned."
"__BASKETBALL__ And the Warriors have a great head coach in Steve Kerr. So do the Spurs, of course."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and Gregg Popovich was Steve Kerr's coach many years ago when the Spurs won their first championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow! Has he been coaching that long?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. For more than twenty years now, all with the Spurs."
