"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think of Roger Goodell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well everyone seems to hate him, so I guess I'm initially not too favorable towards him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he definitely takes a beating in the media, and it's always fun to see him get booed at the NFL draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. But why is he so hated?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think most people actually have specific reasons for hating him - but I know many were upset about how he has handled the Ray Rice scandal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was shameful. Ray Rice knocked her out cold. That was disgusting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he's still trying to come back into the NFL, but with no success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that would be a PR nightmare for whoever would sign him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Adrian Peterson was forgiven."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, that's barely the same thing. But yeah I guess maybe Ray Rice's play has something to do with it too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think if you can still produce, someone in the NFL will give you a job. Look at PacMan Jones, he's still around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I guess he is, but he isn't in the news as much anyone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that's a good thing for him though, right? Haha where's he even playing these days? Cincy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, Cincy would make sense and I think that's right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That Cincinnati team seems infamous for having players who get in trouble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they drafted Chris Henry back in the day. Chad Johnson. And now they draft Joe Mixon!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. They really did take Mixon didn't they. That's nuts. However Chad Johnson, or should I Say OchoCinco, wasn't a bad guy. He just got fined a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess youre right, which brings us back to Goodell. I think he shouldn't fine people for celebrating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he must think NFL stands for the 'no fun league'"
