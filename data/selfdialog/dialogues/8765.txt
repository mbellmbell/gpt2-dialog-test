"__BEATLES__ My favorite Beatle is Ringo because I like his voice."
"__BEATLES__ So do I. He sings some weird stuff, though."
"__BEATLES__ I don't like that stuff. I like the love songs or the earlier stuff."
"__BEATLES__ I do like 'A Little Help from my Friends.' That's Ringo."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that one is good."
"__BEATLES__ Do you like the cover they used on Wonder Years?"
"__BEATLES__ Not at all."
"__BEATLES__ I wish they'd just used Ringo's version."
"__BEATLES__ That would be better for sure."
"__BEATLES__ I'd love to hear more of his stuff used in different shows and movies."
