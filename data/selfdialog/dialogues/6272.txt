"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen Rougue One yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes!  That was maybe in my top three Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it was terrifying to see what the Empire really could do."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm also glad they explained the whole part about why the Death Star was so vulnerable."
"__STAR_WARS__ The best part of the movie though, when Vader cut down all those rebels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes!  That was amazing, back to the roots of Vader being an unstoppable force."
"__STAR_WARS__ The way he just threw them around, and deflected beams with this hand and force powers.  I've never seen anything like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly what a villain should be.  Vader is just plane scary."
"__STAR_WARS__ And it sounds morbid, but I like the fact everyone died."
"__STAR_WARS__ No not at all, I know what you mean.  It added realism and depth to the entire franchise."
