"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been watching the NBA playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I haven't missed a game yet!  Who are you pulling for?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am a Celtics fan, but I've watched every game also.  Who do you pull for?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am pulling for the Warriors.  I hope they pull it off this year!"
"__BASKETBALL__ They have a good chance.  Did you watch the games yesterday?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, the Celtics got crushed.  There haven't been many good games in the 2nd round."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, the first round was pretty good, but this second round has been mainly blow out games."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think it will be the Warriors and the Cavs in the Finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree.  It sucks that Tony Parker got injured.  That killed the Spurs chances"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, it was tough to see.  He is such a great player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Wizard playing who got ejected vs the celtics in game 3?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes!  That was crazy.  I can't believe he lost his cool like that."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know.  You can tell he is a young player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed.  Who do you think wins the MVP this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I really hope its Curry again, but it may be Westbrook.  He was insanely good for the Thunder."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hope it's Curry too, but Westbrook does have a good chance.  So many triple doubles"
"__BASKETBALL__ I really don't want it to be LeBron James though.  I am biased because how he kills the Celtics, but i don't like him"
"__BASKETBALL__ He will definitely be a top choice, but I think it will be Curry or Westbrook."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hopefully the Finals will be some good games and go to 7 like last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ As long as the Warriors win this time, I agree!"
