"__STAR_WARS__ Did you enjoy the new star wars at all?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The force awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really actually."
"__STAR_WARS__ Seriously?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I think it was much over hyped. I liked seeing harrison ford and carrie fisher but not the new people."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I get that. When you are so used to the old characters, new ones seem weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus it was by Disney this time. I did not like it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it was nice speaking to you."
"__STAR_WARS__ You too!"
