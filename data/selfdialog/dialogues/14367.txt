"__HORROR__ Did you ever see Cabin in the Woods?"
"__HORROR__ Yes it was amazing! I love the twist at the end."
"__HORROR__ Me too I loved how they poked fun of the horror genre while still creating something scary and fun."
"__HORROR__ I thought it was a typical horror movie then they came out of left field with the whole sacrifice plot."
"__HORROR__ Yes it was a shocker. The scene where all the monsters were let loose and caused carnage, that was epic."
"__HORROR__ I thought it was funny that they hit on the character types that seem to be formulaic in all the movies."
"__HORROR__ Right they had the virgin, the not-so-virgin, the jock, the smart guy, and the stoner."
"__HORROR__ Right you see them in every scary movie."
"__HORROR__ I loved how they basically ended the world because one of them didn't want to be sacrificed. That was so selfish."
"__HORROR__ It really was, but it's a movie after all. Can't expect everyone to have high morals."
