"__MOVIES__ How can you not like them?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the plot is always the same?"
"__MOVIES__ The good guy beats the bad guy?"
"__MOVIES__ No, like in X-men it is always just getting over people not liking them."
"__MOVIES__ Because the are mutant?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, since they are new."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the last one actually said mutants had been around for a long time."
"__MOVIES__ What movie was that?"
"__MOVIES__ X-Men Apocalypse."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought the other ones said they were fairly new?"
"__MOVIES__ No, even the old trilogy said they did not know."
"__MOVIES__ I really miss the Jean Grey actress in the old ones."
"__MOVIES__ Her name is Famke Jannesen."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think Sophie Turner is a good replacement?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, she seems like a new take on it."
"__MOVIES__ In the old ones Jean Grey dies."
"__MOVIES__ No, not any more."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Days of Future Past changed the story of the old ones, they do not even matter any more."
