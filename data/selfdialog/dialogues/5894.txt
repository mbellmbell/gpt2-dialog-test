"__STAR_WARS__ You know who my favorite character is in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, Luke?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, Vader is my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well he's kind of like a cyborg for starters and his voice sounds scary and intimidating."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good point I never liked him though."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's also not scared to use his powers for what he believes in."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like villain characters more than the good guys?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really but Vader does end up having a very good ending to his story in my opinion."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree that moment when he took his mask off and the following minute or two were epic."
