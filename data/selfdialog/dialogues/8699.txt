"__BEATLES__ Why did The Beatles break up?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know, I've heard people blame Yoko."
"__BEATLES__ I've heard that too, I don't think that's fair."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it's totally denying John agency to make decisions."
"__BEATLES__ Exactly, it's ridiculous. It's like Yoko is being totally scapegoated."
"__BEATLES__ I know. John was an adult and could have decided to stay in The Beatles, I've seen no evidence that Yoko forced his hand."
"__BEATLES__ It's sad they broke up."
"__BEATLES__ I know, think of what could have been if you take the best tracks from their solo albums you can put together a few great records."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, but maybe they wouldn't have been as inspired had they not broken up."
"__BEATLES__ I agree because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, so it could be better or worse. For sure different."
