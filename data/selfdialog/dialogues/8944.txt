"__BEATLES__ Oh that's a tough question. Probably Yellow Submarine."
"__BEATLES__ Oh right, that's a classic."
"__BEATLES__ What's yours?"
"__BEATLES__ I love A Hard Day's Night."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that's got some really great lyrics."
"__BEATLES__ Did you ever see that movie with their music. I forget what it's called."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, do you mean Across the Universe?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's the one! I loved that movie."
"__BEATLES__ Me too. I used to listen to the soundtrack all the time."
