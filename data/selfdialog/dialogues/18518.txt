"__MOVIES__ Are you by any chance a fan of superhero movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'd say I am."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, now who would you say releases better movies? Marvel or DC?"
"__MOVIES__ That's easy. Marvel, because they release more consistently good ones. DC has more or less always been hit or miss with their movies."
"__MOVIES__ Marvel hasn't always been good either."
"__MOVIES__ I know they haven't. The Blade and Ghost Rider series still exist, remember?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, dear. Those were terrible!"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. All I'm saying is that Marvel releases far more good movies than bad ones."
"__MOVIES__ Thinking of it now, I can see what you mean about DC being more hit or miss."
"__MOVIES__ Right? Good example would be that while the Christopher Nolan Batman films were all great, movies like Batman & Robin and Superman III were awful."
"__MOVIES__ And Marvel has really been on fire lately. They really haven't released one bad movie yet."
"__MOVIES__ They've all been consistently good since the start of their cinematic universe thing, or whatever it's called."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about DC's cinematic universe?"
"__MOVIES__ They have all the material ready to go, but the execution has been pretty poor."
"__MOVIES__ So I take it that means you don't like any of those movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't. So far, they've all been disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that Batman v. Superman wasn't nearly as bad as people have said it is."
"__MOVIES__ It's not that bad, but it's still very disappointing. The storytelling in that movie was just so all over the place."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to it. I was just there to see Ben Affleck's Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Well, to be fair, he did do a great job as Batman."
