"__MUSIC__ Please tell me what the big deal is about Jason Robert Brown."
"__MUSIC__ He's kind of a big deal I guess, depending on who you talk to."
"__MUSIC__ Right, and I don't know any of his music so I'm trying to understand."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I can try. Let's start off with the ridiculously hard piano parts."
"__MUSIC__ What are you talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ Most of his music is for singers with piano and maybe a small band, but always piano."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I'm with you so far."
"__MUSIC__ Good, but the thing is he's a really good piano player so his piano music is really difficult to play."
"__MUSIC__ Is that a good thing?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if it's good or bad but it definitely makes his songs a bit different in style. It's like the whole orchestra is all in the piano."
"__MUSIC__ All right, I guess I can imagine what you mean and that would be different from a lot of broadway music where the piano's pretty straight-forward."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, and then add to that the fact that most of his songs are written with lyrics like a person's talking to you."
"__MUSIC__ What does that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Here's an example. If you listen to 'She Cries' the whole time this guy's talking about how messed up his life is by this woman he can't leave because she cries and it stops him."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds kind of depressing."
"__MUSIC__ It isn't though because it's like being inside of his head while he's having this whole debate with himself It's complicated but it's also really funny in a way."
"__MUSIC__ That might be worth listening to."
"__MUSIC__ Most of his songs are like that. They're someone trying to explain themselves either to someone else or to themselves."
"__MUSIC__ Like therapy as music?"
"__MUSIC__ More like someone trying to solve a puzzle out loud I think. Less creepily personal than therapy would be."
