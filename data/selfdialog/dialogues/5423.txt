"__STAR_WARS__ Which is why some people are claiming Jar Jar is Plagueis/Hadu who trained Snoke."
"__STAR_WARS__ This is insane. Some people literally have way too much time on their hands."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's an interesting theory. While Jar Jar was ostracized from Gungan and fled to Naboo, he befriends a kid who has a scar on his face from his jaw all the way up to his scalp."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whoa dude. That's just like Snoke..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. and Jar Jar promises to teach the kid saying 'My teachin yousa, pallo. Wesa maken the whole galaxy smilin, huh?'"
"__STAR_WARS__ That story line needed to be followed up on."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, but they never did. And it was left out in a limbo, but was it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe as a hint. You know, to make people go crazy making these stupid conspiracy theories."
"__STAR_WARS__ And we do have some crazy theories all over the internet about it"
"__STAR_WARS__ Some guy at reddit had this one post claiming Jar Jar IS Snoke. i didn't believe it though. But it was documented so thoroughly. it was hilarious."
