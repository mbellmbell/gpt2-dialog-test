"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which rap artist would you like to see collaborate with Bruno Mars?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I hope to see Mase on a track with him someday.  Don't you think?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That would be cool.  I remember he use to work with artists like Brandy and Mariah Carey.   Did he mostly collaborate with women?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, he usually rapped on women's records.  But he had some great songs with Puff Daddy.  Do you remember those from the 90's?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Heck yeah!  My favorite was 'Mo Money Mo Problems.'  What about you?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Great choice.  I'd have to go with the 'Only You' remix."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, how I miss the Shiny Suit days!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Seriously.  Some of the outfits they wore in those music videos were pretty sweet!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah it's too bad artists don't make many music videos anymore.  When's the last time you've seen a rap music video on television?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Does youtube.com count?"
