"__MUSIC__ Do you like accapella music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really sure. Do you mean like old barbershop quartets and that kind of thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of like that, but more contemporary. I mean they use their voices to sing and to create rhythms."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I get it! Like beat boxing, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I really like the accapella group called Pentatonix. Have you heard of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually I have. I never heard their music but I have heard the name."
"__MUSIC__ Would you like to watch a YouTube video featuring Pentatonix?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd love to. It seems like something I might enjoy."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite video they have on YouTube is called The Evolution of Music. It is like fast forwarding through hundreds of years of musical styles."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean hundreds of years?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it starts off like Gregorian Chant from the Middle Ages and then goes all the way up to the stuff you hear on the radio today."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't that take a long time to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ No, actually it's just snippets of songs and it goes really fast. When I first listened to it I was amazed at how many of the tunes I actually knew."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, sounds cool. Who is your favorite singer in the group?"
"__MUSIC__ I like them all and they are all very talented musicians but I think I like Avi Kaplan best. I just love his deep voice!"
"__MUSIC__ I like bass voices too so I'm sure I'll enjoy it. How many members are in the group?"
"__MUSIC__ There are five in total. Four of them are men and then one woman."
"__MUSIC__ How did they get started as a group?"
"__MUSIC__ You know I'm not totally sure. I think they were in high school together and sang in show choir or something."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! Who would have expected show choir geeks to make it big? Let's go check it out!"
