"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good morning!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good morning to you; how are you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Just fine! Woke up to a groovin' song on my iPhone."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What's your alarm?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have it linked with my Google Play, so just whatever top 40 song is up next."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What was today's?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ 'Something Just Like This' by the Chainsmokers."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nice, I love the Chainsmokers!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too, they have such an energetic beat to them."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Indeed, though I think I'd hate to have that as my alarm."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh? What do you use?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I like to wake up peacefully, so I usually play a soft soundtrack piece."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Really? Like what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, lately I've been using the theme from Finding Nemo."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Whoa, that's so soft. That would never wake me!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It works for me, and I love soundtrack pieces, so."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you have a favourite composer?"
