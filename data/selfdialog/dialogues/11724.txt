"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think is going to the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone but the Patriots, I hope!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! I'm sick to death of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, plus they cheat constantly and lie about everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to see some new teams get there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. Look at the last two NEW teams. Panthers and Falcons. Panthers were awful and Falcons were worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true but the Falcons played a great first half."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but look at the second half. That was the worst meltdown we've ever seen in a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the Cowboys? They should stand a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a serious chance but I hope not. I can't stand them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they're America's team!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only in their heads."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, how about the Redskins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Washington Redskins. I like Kirk Cousins and I'd like to see him do well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not much of a Redskins fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the NY Giants better. I like Eli Manning and a few of the other players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli's pretty good. He might have another SB win in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. I'm partial to the Mannings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Houston might have a good chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you. They had a monster defense last year. It will only be better with JJ Watt coming back."
