"__STAR_WARS__ Did you ever like the ewoks in Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did as a kid, but I think they're pretty lame as an adult."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I thought they were kind of fun when I was younger"
"__STAR_WARS__ They played that annoying song at the end of the movie"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that was kind of fun. Besides they just destroyed the evil empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ They also almost killed Luke, Han and Chewie"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but then Luke made C-3PO fly."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and that freaked them out."
"__STAR_WARS__ They thought he was a god."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, because he was all gold."
