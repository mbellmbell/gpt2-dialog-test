"__MOVIES__ Are you into movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I like watching movies a lot. I'm somewhat of a movie buff, but how about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I enjoy movies, but I'm don't obsess over them. I generally go to the theater when someone else wants to go."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm more proactive about keeping up with the latest movies. I've seen like 15 in the theater so far this year."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, that's much more often than i typically go to the theaters. Do you have a favorite so far this year?"
"__MOVIES__ It might be because it was the most recent movie I saw and it's fresh in my mind, but I really liked Guardians of the Galaxy 2."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it. I didn't see the first one, so I'd like to watch them in order, but I heard they were good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're both definitely good. I think I liked the first one a little better though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? Any particular reason."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing incredibly significant, but I think the overall story telling was better in the first one. Don't get me wrong though, they're both great movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool. Do you like comic book movies in general?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're really entertaining. They typically have really good action and intriguing stories."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I like comic book movies a lot too. It's cool to see some of my favorite comic characters in movies."
"__MOVIES__ And they've definitely been on point with them in the last 15 years or so. I feel like there has been a lot more good comic book movies than bad ones, at least in recent years."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, plus they've branched out a lot. It's not all about the most famous comic book franchises and characters."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. To be honest, I'd never even heard of Guardians of the Galaxy before the first movie even came out."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I hadn't either. I know quite a few superheroes, but I'm not a genius or encyclopedia about them, so there's inevitably some characters I don't recognize."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, especially since there are so many comic book movies coming out these days. It's hard to be familiar with every single character from every franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, some even belong to multiple franchises. Batman has been in a lot of his own movies, he's been in a movie with superman, and I think there's about to be a Justice League movie which will most definitely include Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I heard about that too. I can't wait."
