"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I find that rap music more than any other genre can stir me to emotion."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean I've heard it's pretty angry music..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not that, I mean it's diverse in the wide range of emotions it can contain, but there's some really sad stuff out there. Like some of the songs off of Tedashii's 'Below Paradise'."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I haven't listened to it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I think it's the speed of delivery that's so prevalent in the genre."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So it hits you with the sadness before you really know what hit you."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly, with the slow sappy pop songs I can tell if it's leading to something sad and emotionally prepare myself for it, but with rap's typically rapid fire pace I don't get that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is that why you won't listen to Naughty By Nature's 'Everything's Gonna Be Alright'?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's about 10% the actual lyrics and the rest is because when I first heard that song I was going through a really hard time and being depressed and so every time I heard it it brings me right back to that place."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a shame, man."
