"__DISNEY__ You know there is yet another Toy Story in the works."
"__DISNEY__ After how the last one ended?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep, even though the toys were given away."
"__DISNEY__ And Andy went off to college."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if it will be set up, with the little girl he gave them too?"
"__DISNEY__ I imagine. I hope not back in that play school."
"__DISNEY__ That was so scary!"
"__DISNEY__ I do not know how, but they managed to make me fear pre-school. At least for the toys."
"__DISNEY__ I was so stressed at the end when they toys almost got crushed at the dump."
"__DISNEY__ I liked that the bad guy bear ended up as a hood ornament."
