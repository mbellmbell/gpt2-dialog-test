"__ROCK__ So, check it, I watched this documentary the other day on Quiet Riot."
"__ROCK__ Oh, man, there's a name I haven't heard in awhile."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I know!  Love their song 'Cum On Feel the Noize'."
"__ROCK__ That brings me back... I used to listen to that as a kid a lot."
"__ROCK__ Me too.  So, anyway the documentary is about the band's drummer and the history of the band, and how he's trying to reform in current times."
"__ROCK__ Oh, did they succeed in that?"
"__ROCK__ Yes, sort of.  The lead singer died from a drug overdose, so they had to hold a audition to replace him."
"__ROCK__ Oh, I bet that didn't make a lot of the fans happy."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, they mention that in the documentary, and even really a powerful scene where the guy interviews the leader singer's mom and gets her permission to do it."
"__ROCK__ It sounds pretty good, I'll have to look it up!"
