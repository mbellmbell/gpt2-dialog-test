"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Our local college football team is great!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is? I don't really follow college football. I prefer the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we've had a few of our players, like Tevin Mitchel, get drafted in the NFL lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That doesn't sound that special to me though. Pretty much every college does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You've got a good point. I guess I'm just excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My last college's football team was really bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why don't you start watching some NFL games then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I could do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you'd get really into it if you let yourself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have any teams that you're a big fan of?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I grew up in Minnesota, so I like the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And hate the Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. That's practically genetic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rivalries like that are always so funny to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They just seem silly. It's such low stakes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the fun of it though! Getting wrapped up in something that doesn't matter is fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I can understand that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See what I mean?"
