"__STAR_WARS__ I just watched the Phantom Menace on TV last night."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is that the first time that you had seen it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I saw it on opening night back when it first came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. I remember calling 1-800-moviephone to find the nearest locations!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I remember that service!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, time really flies."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the movie on this go around?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It seemed more cute than realistic."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. After seeing how realistic and gritty Rogue One was, the prequels seem like they were meant to be watched by kids."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see that. But seeing Darth Maul still makes me cringe every time I see the first prequel!"
