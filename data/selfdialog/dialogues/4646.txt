"__MUSIC__ Do you like classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ I love classical, especially Mozart."
"__MUSIC__ I think Mozart had too much going on in his music."
"__MUSIC__ Too many notes like they say in Amadeus?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. His music is all over the place with note structures."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Beethoven?"
"__MUSIC__ Beethoven was the greatest of all the classical composers!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow that's quite a statement. Why do you feel that way about Beethoven?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he was the most original when it came to his compositions.  He was like the Heavy Metal composer of Classical music."
"__MUSIC__ Like heavy like Metalica or more like Megadeath?"
"__MUSIC__ I think both of those bands are nothing in comparison to Beethoven."
"__MUSIC__ So what makes you say Beethoven was like a Metal Musician?"
"__MUSIC__ His music was just really strong and powerfully composed.  It has a driving beat that makes you want to bang your head along with the conductor!"
"__MUSIC__ I've never banged my head to classical music."
"__MUSIC__ You should try it, while listening to Beethoven's Ode To Joy!"
"__MUSIC__ I bet that would be fun."
"__MUSIC__ It's a great song, and beautifully composed."
"__MUSIC__ True, but I wouldn't say it's like Heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ What would you compare it to then?"
"__MUSIC__ Ode to Joy by Beethoven is more like a Rock Opera written by Pink Floyd. It has a lot of layers."
