"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast live-action movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't seen the live action version, but I love the original animated version."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. But my all-time favorite Disney movie is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah. That movie is a classic."
"__DISNEY__ I was terrified of the evil queen when I was a kid!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too. I was also afraid of Ursula from The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I thought she was pretty scary, too. What did you think of the stepmother from Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ The stepmother was mean. So were the stepsisters. But they weren't very scary."
"__DISNEY__ I liked the Cinderella sequels where the one stepsister married the baker. She wasn't so mean after all."
"__DISNEY__ She was just looking for love."
