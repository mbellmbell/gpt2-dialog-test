"__MOVIES__ Did you ever get into the Friday the 13th movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen all of them at least once, but I'm not a big fan."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Jason Voohries is too predictable."
"__MOVIES__ What makes you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ You watch the movies.  Kids acting stupid get slashed."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much, but that doesn't make it bad."
"__MOVIES__ I guess not, but it gets boring."
"__MOVIES__ What gets boring about a machete wielding maniac?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much everything.  You know what is going to happen way before it happens."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anything you liked about the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ It started out as a good story."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, they let Jason die, so he comes back for revenge."
"__MOVIES__ Also, he was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a kid that died and came back."
"__MOVIES__ But you still didn't like it."
"__MOVIES__ No, I mean, it makes sense that he just runs around with a knife, but it's boring."
"__MOVIES__ And they can't kill him."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and then we really don't get into his story any further."
