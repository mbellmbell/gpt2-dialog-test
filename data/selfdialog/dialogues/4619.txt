"__MUSIC__ So what do you think about M.I.A.?"
"__MUSIC__ She's pretty awesome, at least musically. I've not followed her closely, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, somehow this had gone under my radar until the other day. Now I keep playing that first album over and over."
"__MUSIC__ Arular? Yeah, that's a great one. She really came out of the gate strong."
"__MUSIC__ Got to admit I don't really understand all of the content, but it seems... revolutionary."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a big part of her music. It's all political, social activism."
"__MUSIC__ It is... but, it's also really flippant and playful about it."
"__MUSIC__ There's a line somewhere, that I love, that goes... paraphrased, probably, but: 'Gonna get squeaky so you can come and oil me.' It's kind of hilarious."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the use of words is interesting. That's part of what makes it sometimes hard to understand, though -- some of the things she says, are these terms I should know?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure part of it is cultural. Still not quite sure what 'Bucky' refers to, and I've not gone to the trouble of looking it up."
"__MUSIC__ I'm -- look, I don't actually know what most of this is about, but it sounds like she's pushing back against an occupying power. Is this about Palestine?"
"__MUSIC__ That's very likely. Though at the same time, you'll see her posing in Sonic the Hedgehog T-shirts."
"__MUSIC__ Anything that seems like it's making a statement, it seems clouded by the way she expresses it -- sometimes the jargon or slang she uses, and sometimes just through onomatopoeia."
"__MUSIC__ She does go for the bangs and the booms, doesn't she."
"__MUSIC__ And other things -- like, what's Galang? Is that another sound effect, or does it actually mean something?"
"__MUSIC__ Reminds me of the Law & Order noise. GALANG."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't Mike Post file a music copyright for that, so he gets paid every time it's used?"
"__MUSIC__ Did he? That's... clever of him."
"__MUSIC__ It's like the BBC and the TARDIS noise. It's categorized as a musical cue, for copyright purposes."
"__MUSIC__ I'm... is there anything that would be disqualified for a music copyright?"
