"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie, 'The Arrival'?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I want to see it. What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was the best movie I've seen in years. I would give it a 10 out of 10, easily."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. What do you think makes it so great?"
"__MOVIES__ The way they developed the plot was unique. It makes you think and inspires a sense of curiosity and wonder the entire time, while Amy Adams was superb in her role, and I would have to say she is now my favorite actress."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool. I think she's a good actress, but I haven't loved all of her movies."
"__MOVIES__ She has done a few that were just so-so. After 'The Arrival' though, I want to see all of her upcoming movies."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think she gets cast for her looks as well as her acting?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say she brings a certain magic to the screen, even if she is not a knockout in the looks department. I do find her curiously very attractive somehow, nevertheless."
"__MOVIES__ I think I know what you mean. She doesn't look like a supermodel, but there is something sweet and charming about her, even though she gives an impression of being extremely smart."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
"__MOVIES__ What else do you think makes this movie so terrific?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's not really a very original premise for a movie, but it was just executed extremely well. The writing, directing, acting, etc. just made it a great overall movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know what you mean. When something is really great, it's hard to pin down one reason why it's that good."
"__MOVIES__ It's 'the whole is greater than the sum of the parts' -- a synergistic effect."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good way to explain it. Who else was in it besides Amy Adams?"
"__MOVIES__ The guy who plays Hawkeye in the Avengers, Clint Barton, plays the lead male role. The lead character happens to be a female in this movie, which is kind of cool."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think this is the kind of movie that could win the Oscar for best picture?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a really great movie, but it wasn't truly ground breaking and it didn't make any social or political statements that usually leads to a best picture nomination."
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of a shame. I definitely am looking forward to seeing it, maybe even more now."
