"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always wanted to go to a Superbowl game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What, like sit the crowd and watch in real time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, I feel like it would be a great experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but loud and crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like loud and crazy! I wonder how people get the tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are crazy expensive, I don't know how people afford them either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I have money, I'm going to a Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I hope that comes true for you."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not personally, but my brother has."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, which one?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't remember the teams, but I do remember it was in 2003."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's so long ago!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I was a little kid at the time so I didn't go, but he talks about it all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did he get the tickets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He won a radio contest with his friend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, nice!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, one of those 'be the 8th caller' things."
