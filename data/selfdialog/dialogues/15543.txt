"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think about the fact that the kids at Hogwarts were always seemingly in danger?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, you know it's a movie. They wouldn't have it set up like that in real life."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's true. I just thought they would have made more provisions knowing there were huge trolls in the area."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah you're right about that. But the kids fought them off bravely."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes they did. I loved the life size game of chess in the first movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right, Slytherin House was upset about losing to them that year for sure."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They were but Gryffindor did deserve to win the House Cup. They put their lives in danger."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know that's right. Malfoy was a victim of bad circumstances but I still never liked the boy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh I don't think anyone did. He hated on Harry so much."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He really did. All that money and power he had you'd think he'd be a little happier."
