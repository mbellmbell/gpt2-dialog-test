"__MOVIES__ I'm lucky, being older than you."
"__MOVIES__ How do you figure that?"
"__MOVIES__ I got to see Braveheart in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I admit it's probably really cool in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. And I saw Gladiator in the theater. These big sweeping historical movies are completely different in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought about it."
"__MOVIES__ I got to see Fight Club in the theater, before everybody already knew every spoiler in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when I saw it I had already heard most of the lines."
"__MOVIES__ It was completely different in the theater. And I saw Sixth Sense in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ How was that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was this movie that you weren't sure if it was supposed to be scary and about ghosts or what, there really hadn't been a lot of hype about it."
"__MOVIES__ That's hard to imagine."
"__MOVIES__ I know. It just blew everybody away. That was before everybody knew the little boy says 'I see dead people'."
"__MOVIES__ What else did you see in the theater that I'll never have the chance to."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Predator, Alien and Aliens in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Dang, I bet that was an awesome experience."
"__MOVIES__ And I saw Star Wars in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ The first three."
"__MOVIES__ You mean 4, 5 and 6?"
