"__HARRY_POTTER__ Who was your favorite Harry Potter character?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think Sirius Black was my favorite."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he was a good guy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ A good guy? Sirius was fantastic!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know, I thought he was irresponsible and wouldn't have been a good guardian for Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course he was irresponsible! He spent all of his adulthood in Azkaban."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But he treated Harry like he was his friend, not his godparent."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that's because he thought of Harry like he did James, because they were so similar."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He still was irresponsible as a godfather."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think Sirius did the best he could, considering his circumstances - his best friend was killed and he was blamed for it!"
