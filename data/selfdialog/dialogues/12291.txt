"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Talking about quarterbacks was so much fun, let's discuss running backs.  I say a name, you tell me what you think of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Awesome!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ David Johnson"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The best all around back in the league.  He'll get 1,000 yards rushing and receiving this year and 23 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Leveon Bell"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very talented back, but gets injured all the time.  I predict he gets hurt after eight games this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ezekiel Elliott"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The best young back in the league.  Running behind that offensive line, he'll easily get 1,500 yards this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lesean McCoy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overrated back.  Runs and catches well but not very physical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Melvin Gordon"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fourth best back in the league.  Good overall back who will have 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adrian Peterson"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the greatest backs to ever play in the NFL.  He's lost a step or two, I predict he only plays two more years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jay Ajayi"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A talented back who is just figuring out the position.  Tough runner who is hard to bring down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Todd Gurley"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Gurley comes back this year and has a solid year.  The Rams upgraded their line which will reflect in his stats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marshawn Lynch"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the greatest physical runners in his prime.  He took a year off, but he should have a solid year.  He's running behind the best line in the league."
