"__MUSIC__ How come we haven't heard anything about Empire of the Sun for a while?"
"__MUSIC__ They released 'Two Vines' last year. That had a remix of Walking on a Dream."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. All of a sudden I was hearing that song on the radio again."
"__MUSIC__ They also released High and Low, but that didn't do as well as Walking on a Dream."
"__MUSIC__ What do they call that kind of dreamy music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that it's called Electro Pop, Dance. I've even heard it called glam because of the makeup and outfits that they wear."
"__MUSIC__ Luke Steele is kind of the most dramatic with the costumes and makeup."
"__MUSIC__ His costume is called Ming the Merciless robe. I've never heard that headpiece referred to as anything but steel headpiece."
"__MUSIC__ They had another hit, but I can't remember the name."
"__MUSIC__ You're probably thinking about 'Without You.' It wasn't as popular."
"__MUSIC__ For Two Vines, they worked with other well-known artists."
"__MUSIC__ Right. David Bowie, Lindsey Buckingham from Fleetwood Mac and a singer that worked with Prince."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard about anything that they might have coming up?"
"__MUSIC__ I could be wrong, but I think that their last concert was in 2015."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that their costumes were influenced by a film maker."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Alejandro Jodorowsky, the surrealist and his Holy Mountain. They said that is the inspiration for their costumes."
"__MUSIC__ And their song was used in a commercial."
"__MUSIC__ Again -- Walking on a Dream. It was used in a promotional advertisement for the Honda Civic in 2016."
"__MUSIC__ I always thought that video was interesting."
"__MUSIC__ FYI, It was filmed by Josh Logue in Shanghai."
