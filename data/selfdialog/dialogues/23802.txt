"__SUPERHERO__ Hey, what did you think about Antman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought it was really good."
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought it was just ok, turning tiny is a really weird power to have."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, but he's still super strong, and he's basically invisible."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea that's true, but it's just not very super in my opinion."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well I'd love to have that superpower."
"__SUPERHERO__ Paul Rudd was really good in it though."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, Paul Rudd is really funny."
"__SUPERHERO__ I can't wait to see him in the Infinity Wars Saga."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, Infinity Wars is going to be epic."
