"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with the various periods of classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ No. What do you mean by a 'period'?"
"__MUSIC__ Classical music spans about 400 years. The music of each century sounds very different from the others."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine so. So there are four periods?"
"__MUSIC__ The classical repertoire, unless you're including early music from before the 16th century, has 5 periods."
"__MUSIC__ What are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They are the Baroque, the classical, the romantic, the post-romantic, and the modern."
"__MUSIC__ There is a classical period of classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. It's probably not the best name for it, but it has stuck for some reason. That's the music of the 18th century."
"__MUSIC__ Would I have heard of any composers from that century?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Mozart?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, of course. Why are there 5 periods for 4 centuries of music?"
"__MUSIC__ The 20th century was influenced by radical movements of avante garde and expressionist thought, so the music of the latter half of the century was very different from the earlier half."
"__MUSIC__ So the 21st century has 2 periods -- the post romantic and the modern?"
"__MUSIC__ That's correct."
"__MUSIC__ Which period has the best music?"
"__MUSIC__ That's mostly a matter of taste. A lot of people say that Bach was the greatest composer, even though he is from the 16th century."
"__MUSIC__ That's weird."
"__MUSIC__ On the other hand, most of the most well-known composers, like Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, are from the Romantic period."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting."
