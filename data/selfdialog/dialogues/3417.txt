"__MUSIC__ Who do you think is a stronger singer adlle or beyonce?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh that is tough.. Beyonce for me."
"__MUSIC__ I go Adele."
"__MUSIC__ Why , beyonce has many more hits and is so much fiercer."
"__MUSIC__ I will give to beyonce when it comes to presentation, Lately her performances at video awards are like moving art. But vocally I think vocally adele has her beat."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe but I think adele must have some bad technique why else did she develop nodes?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think it is only caused by poor vocal technique. Julia andrews also had them and she is a pro."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose I don't know enough on the subject. I just thought the two went hand and hand."
"__MUSIC__ Okay who is the better singer between arianna grande and mariah carey?"
"__MUSIC__ Mariah carey of course!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay this one I agree.But arianna  comes close to carey."
"__MUSIC__ They both possess crazy vocal ranges that are almost unheard of."
"__MUSIC__ Very true , not many singers have the range those two do."
"__MUSIC__ So sad about arianna's london concert."
"__MUSIC__ I know how tragic. I was thinking how awful and guilt ridden I would feel if I were her."
"__MUSIC__ Why? She did nothing wrong at all."
"__MUSIC__ But I would feel badly because they were there for me."
"__MUSIC__ Well she should not blame herself. I think she is being very generous. I think she paid for the funeral costs for those who passed."
"__MUSIC__ Ya I heard that. Also the benefit concert was thoughtful."
"__MUSIC__ yes, it brought a lot of great musicians together for a good cause, just too bad it had to take place at all."
