"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey what do you think about NFL salaries compared to NBA salaries?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both are raking in cash but the NFL players are definitely getting the short end of the stick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because there is no way James Harden should be making more money than any of the top 5 NFL quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree it's kind of silly James Harden makes more money than Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly or Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the NBA doesn't have to pay as many players so they can afford to pay more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be a good argument if both leagues made the same amount of revenue but that's not the case."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think the NFL makes more revenue than the NBA?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They make close to four times more than the NBA."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, that makes things a little different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So when I hear people bring up the more players argument it's laughable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right, the NFL players have a legitimate argument to make."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course they do but NFL players don't have as much power as NBA players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I guess you can blame the NFLPA for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are largely responsible but players share some of the blame as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the NFL is making that much more money than the NBA, they should definitely be paying players more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe things will even out when they renegotiate the next collective bargaining agreement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so, the NFL owners can't complain about revenue if they are making that much money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The definitely can't."
