"__MUSIC__ Do you remember that old song by Franz Ferdinand?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. It has a bizarre music video, doesn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's the one. I can't remember the name of it."
"__MUSIC__ Hm. I think it was Take Me Out."
"__MUSIC__ You're right! That's it!"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard that song in a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Me either, and it's the only song I know by that band."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. I remember when it was popular, MTV would play the music video all the time."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I can remember watching it with my sister."
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember when the Black Eyed Peas were really popular?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I can remember my sister and cousin listening to My Humps repeatedly."
"__MUSIC__ They had some other big hits, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like their song I Gotta Feeling."
"__MUSIC__ That song always puts me in a good mood."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. What did you think of their song Boom Boom Pow?"
"__MUSIC__ I like that one better than I Gotta Feeling."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I like the beat."
"__MUSIC__ When's the last time they released an album?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but it's been a while."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wish they would release some new stuff."
