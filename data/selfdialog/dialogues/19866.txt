"__MOVIES__ I watched a really funny older movie the other day."
"__MOVIES__ What movie was that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was an old Lucy and Desi movie called The Long, Long Trailer."
"__MOVIES__ Were they being Lucy and Ricky, or completely different parts?"
"__MOVIES__ They were completely different characters."
"__MOVIES__ What is the plot about?"
"__MOVIES__ They are getting married and he travels a lot for work. So, they decide to invest in a trailer home so she can go with him and they are always home."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds unique. Is it a comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you bet! It's just one of those 'nothing ever works out' movies."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds funny, maybe I will have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ What about you, seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them the other day. It was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I have been meaning to watch that. I love the Harry Potter series so I am sure I would like it."
"__MOVIES__ They do not really have anything to do with the other. Of course, other than the fact that they both take place in the magical world."
"__MOVIES__ Where does this one take place?"
"__MOVIES__ It takes place in America. An Englishman has come to America and all kinds of hillarious things happen."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good. I have been meaning to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Just to warn you, it is a little slow to get going."
"__MOVIES__ So which is better Harry Potter or Fantastic Beasts?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh hands down, Harry Potter! But Fantastic Beasts is still very good."
