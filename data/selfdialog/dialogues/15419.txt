"__HARRY_POTTER__ Merlin's beard, the Prisoner of Azkaban movie was awful."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, I know you hate it, but can you name ANYTHING you like about it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Um, okay, David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were amazing, and it was the only movie to get Harry's hair right."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's it? What about the Marauder's Map?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would've liked that more if they HADN'T MISSPELLED MOONY. THERE IS NO 'E', THE 'E' DOES NOT EXIST."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, okay, calm down!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ HOW CAN I CALM DOWN? HOW CAN THEY MISSPELL A NAME FROM SOMETHING THAT WAS BASED OFF A BOOK!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What made you more upset, the misspelling of Moony or the were-Chihuahua?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, that's tough. I think it's still the misspelling."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one."
