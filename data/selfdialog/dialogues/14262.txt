"__HORROR__ Did you ever see any of the Poltergeist movies?"
"__HORROR__ Yes I've seen them all. Do you have a favorite?"
"__HORROR__ Well part 1 will always be my favorite but part 2 comes in a close second."
"__HORROR__ Same for me, I loved the relationship between the Native American man and the little girl Carolyn."
"__HORROR__ She actually died not long after the making of those movies."
"__HORROR__ I know, a few people did. There were rumors that the movie was cursed."
"__HORROR__ Right because I believe they were toying with subject matter along with relics that they shouldn't have."
"__HORROR__ Part 3 wasn't all that good but it's still better than most modern horror movies."
"__HORROR__ That's absolutely true. The part where she gets sucked into the puddle in the parking garage was frightening."
"__HORROR__ I loved the use of mirrors in that movie. It shined a light on duality."
