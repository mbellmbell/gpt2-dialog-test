"__BASEBALL__ How much do you put into a pitchers record?"
"__BASEBALL__ None at all."
"__BASEBALL__ I disagree"
"__BASEBALL__ But how? He cant control everything"
"__BASEBALL__ You want your ace on the mound and you want a win"
"__BASEBALL__ But if he gives up 1 run over 8 and the offense doesnt score?"
"__BASEBALL__ How often does that happen?"
"__BASEBALL__ OK even if he gives up 2 over 7 and they score 1 run."
"__BASEBALL__ OK i can see your point slightly."
"__BASEBALL__ I value ERA over everything."
"__BASEBALL__ You are probably right."
"__BASEBALL__ The record doesnt state a whole lot."
"__BASEBALL__ So just get rid of them?"
"__BASEBALL__ You cant do that"
"__BASEBALL__ Then how would you fix it."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe show the record in games he starts"
"__BASEBALL__ Some guys get no run support"
"__BASEBALL__ Like Cole Hamels?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah just like him"
"__BASEBALL__ So basically no Cy Young award winner should be based on record alone."
