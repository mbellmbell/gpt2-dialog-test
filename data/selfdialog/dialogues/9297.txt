"__BASEBALL__ Did you catch the Los Angeles game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ I went to bed early. Did I miss anything good?"
"__BASEBALL__ Did you ever."
"__BASEBALL__ What happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ They cleared the benches in Los Angeles."
"__BASEBALL__ What? Why?"
"__BASEBALL__ Ross Stripling hit Stanton with a throw."
"__BASEBALL__ What? He's got some nerve to be doing that."
"__BASEBALL__ I 100% would have thrown at anyone other than Stanton, dude is  massive."
"__BASEBALL__ Tell me about it. He towers over everyone on the field."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he lost a lot of his nerve when he saw Stanton wasn't dropping his bat though."
"__BASEBALL__ I would too. Stanton is  6'6'."
"__BASEBALL__ You should have seen Stanton stalking towards the mound with a bat. I would have been  terrifed."
"__BASEBALL__ Nah, I don't think so."
"__BASEBALL__ You don't think so? Dude, Stanton is huge!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know. That's why I know you wouldn't be stupid enough to pick a fight with someone who nearly has a foot of height on you."
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely. My mother didn't raise and idiot."
"__BASEBALL__ Reminds me of when a young Porcello accidentally hit Youkilis and for no reason whatsoever Youk charged the mound and an incredibly confused, and skinny Porcello used all that weight moving in his direction to just throw Youk to the ground."
"__BASEBALL__ That's  one of my favorite charging the mound moments in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ I'd be scared out of my mind if Stanton started walking towards me like that. I wouldn't know what to do except to either run or try to apologize."
