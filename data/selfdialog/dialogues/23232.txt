"__DISNEY__ Do you want to go to the movies with me on Saturday?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure, I'm not doing anything. Is there something special you wanted to see?"
"__DISNEY__ Uh, it's not what I want to see. It's what my 6 year old nephew I'm babysitting wants to see...."
"__DISNEY__ Oh Lord. What's the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ It's Disney's new movie Cars 3. He loves Lightening McQueen."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, that's fine. I love Owen Wilson, and he does the voice for Lightening McQueen."
"__DISNEY__ My nephew loves the Cars movies, he has a Cars bedpread and toys and everything. I promised I'd take him while my sister and her husband go to a wedding on Saturday."
"__DISNEY__ Well, since I'm single, I'd rather go to a Disney movie than go to a wedding myself and have to watch all the happily in love people."
"__DISNEY__ I know, right?! And of course we can pig out on popcorn and candy from the concession stand."
"__DISNEY__ All right, tell your nephew he has a date with both of us!"
