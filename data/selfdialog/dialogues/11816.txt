"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey do you know anything about football or watch anything about the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. My family are huge Oakland Raiders fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well now they are the Las Vegas Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I didn't realize they were moving. Weren't they the Los Angeles Raiders at some point?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they were in the mid 80's to mid 90's. But now they are moving to Las Vegas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any particular reason why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They say it was because the old stadium was falling apart and the team couldn't get it renovated in a way that the owners were happy with or something like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They must've really screwed up bad to lose the whole team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the proposals have been going on since 2009, so someone must have just gotten sick of dealing with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if Las Vegas is a good place for any sports team to be honest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, me neither. But I guess we'll find out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just so touristy, I don't see how they can consistently pull in a fanbase."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I go to Vegas to gamble, drink, and see unique shows. Not watch NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. How long do you think it'll take for them to move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL commission has said that the Raiders will play in Oakland for 2017 and 2018."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least my Bay Area family can still see them for a couple more years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It may be longer than that, the stadium in Vegas has ran into issues off and on in terms of investors and building it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like they would need to build it away from the strip since that is already pretty clogged up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm guessing so too. I don't think the NFL has thought this through all the way.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will find out in the next few years if the Las Vegas Raiders will be a real thing."
