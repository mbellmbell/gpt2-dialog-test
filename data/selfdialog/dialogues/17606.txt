"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. The last one I saw in theaters was 'Get Out.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Overall it was pretty good, but the ending sucks."
"__MOVIES__ Really. Would you recommend it?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, if there's nothing better playing. Is it still out?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, I'm sure it's playing somewhere."
"__MOVIES__ Probably. What else is out?"
"__MOVIES__ The new Pirates of the Carribean movie seems good."
"__MOVIES__ I think they're getting a little over done."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they've definitely made a lot but people seem to like them."
"__MOVIES__ I never cared for them much, I do like Johnny Depp though."
"__MOVIES__ He's a great actor. Any movies out you care to see?"
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking about the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I heard that was good!"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the first one. Honestly, I'm more excited to see the soundtrack."
"__MOVIES__ The soundtrack? Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, have you heard the soundtrack from the first movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of the best I can think of off the top of my head. You should check it out!"
