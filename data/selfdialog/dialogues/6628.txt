"__STAR_WARS__ I just rewatched Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ I haven't watched that movie in a while. I bet I can still quote the Emperor though!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you mean when he talks to Darth Vader or when he's talking to Luke near the end?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Both, but especially at the end when he's about to use Force Lightning on Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those movies had great villains. Do you think the new movie villains are as good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Kylo Ren is pretty awesome, but I'm not sure I want to call him a villain just yet."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think he's going to be redeemed in the next movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know if The Last Jedi will redeem him, but I hope so."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think a lot of people want him to be redeemed after Han died in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they still do. If not, Kylo will make an awesome villain to remember."
