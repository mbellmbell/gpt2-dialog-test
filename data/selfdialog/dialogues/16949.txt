"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the Oscar Winners?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if it won anything, but I saw Arrival last week."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I think it won Sound Editing!"
"__MOVIES__ Huh, that makes sense. It certainly had some interesting sounds."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've seen it. What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely my kind of movie, I love hard sci-fi."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the twist came out of nowhere."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it was super obvious."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was just kinda random and seemed too far fetched to me."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, there were aliens, and there was an entire monologue about time at the beginning that telegraphed it pretty obviously in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I guess, but it just seemed like too much to swallow that understanding a language could affect how we view time."
"__MOVIES__ I mean it is the entire premise of the film, and again, aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Human languages don't work like that, though."
"__MOVIES__ I mean to a certain extent the way you speak affects perception; for example some languages don't assign personal blame the same way we do."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Are there other examples?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure! Some languages don't have different words for blue and green, so they consider it the same color."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I'd never thought about it that way."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, language is cool. I thought the way Arrival was filmed really captured that and was excellently made."
"__MOVIES__ You've made me rethink my position. Maybe I'll have to watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ If you do, I'll watch it with you! I always learn something new when I rewatch good movies."
