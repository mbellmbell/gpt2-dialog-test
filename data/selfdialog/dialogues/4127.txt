"__MUSIC__ Can you find a station that plays pop or rock? I don't really like country music, which is what is playing right now."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, sure. I'm the same way, I do not care for country music, usually makes me feel sad."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! That's the main reason I don't really want to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Here we go. What about this band, The Eagles? Is that too old-school for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course not! I love The Eagles!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too. My favorite song is Hotel California, it really makes me want to sing along."
"__MUSIC__ I'm the same way. If I hear a great song, you better believe I am going to be singing along with it."
"__MUSIC__ I bet people in the other cars think I'm crazy when they look over and see me singing, 'Welcome to the Hotel California!'"
"__MUSIC__ That's okay, let them. Music is suppose to get you into a good mood."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, it's soothes the savage beast, right?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, especially The Eagles. Oh, they must be playing a lineup of The Eagles because Best of My Love is playing now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I bet they are. Well, good, now we know we will have some good tunes to listen to until we get to work."
"__MUSIC__ I will feel more upbeat today at work because of it too. We should go to a concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they are still touring? I would love to go!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I know they are. I heard it on the radio the other day."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they will have any near us?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, we may have to drive about an hour or so, but that's no big deal."
"__MUSIC__ You're right, it would be worth it. Who knows how much longer they will be touring."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! They are getting a bit older so we better go while we can."
"__MUSIC__ I will find us some tickets tonight girl! It will be a blast!"
