"__MOVIES__ I've been on a drama movie kick lately. What would be your favorite in that genre?"
"__MOVIES__ Memoirs of a Geisha, hands down."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that a book? Or did they write a book after the movie came out?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a book first, written by Arthur Golden."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, he must be super happy about the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, but I'm sure that he made a lot of money off of it."
"__MOVIES__ So it was really good then?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I loved it, but then again I like anything that has to do with Japanese culture."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ A very young girl whose family sells her to be a geisha."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, poor girl."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah unfortunately it happened a lot back then."
"__MOVIES__ What else?"
"__MOVIES__ She goes through the usual dramatic tribulations, overcoming rivals, winning a love interest, etc."
"__MOVIES__ So, it sounds kind of boring. What is the part that makes it your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ It has a historial feel to it, and then of course it's Japanese history!"
"__MOVIES__ Wait, didn't they use mostly Chinese actors though?"
"__MOVIES__ That definitely caused quite an uproar!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, based on your description I think I'll pass."
"__MOVIES__ Suit yourself, your loss!"
