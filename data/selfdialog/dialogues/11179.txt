"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just read that the NFL cheerleaders only get paid $150 per game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, that's crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ $150 per day? I'll take that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a really small amount of money. Times that by 16 games and it's barely above $2000, pre-tax."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Multiply."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Times is not a verb. Multiply is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh shut up. What do you think about the wages?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're completely fair yet unfair."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like how?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's fair because no one notices the cheerleaders anyway. They are paid $150 to look pretty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they don't lead cheers, do they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know they put a ton of time into it, and I think they have to pay for their own uniforms, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have a solution?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course! I am wise beyond your years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pay them $1,000 per game. That's $16,000 per year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a lot!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pay the concessions people the same, too. It's nothing when compared to the insanely overpaid players. $1 million less from the team salary is unnoticeable, but would greatly improve others' llives."
