"__ROCK__ Have you ever listened to Rush?"
"__ROCK__ Rush, are you kidding, that is my favorite band of all time!"
"__ROCK__ Whoa, really?  They are mine too, they are incredible and have been around forever."
"__ROCK__ I have seen them in concert over 20 times!"
"__ROCK__ I've seen then nine times, and that is not enough for sure.  They are so talented."
"__ROCK__ You know, my favorite album is 'All The World's A Stage', Bytor is so cool played live"
"__ROCK__ I agree, but I have to say I am a huge fan of Moving Pictures and no, not because of 'Tom Sawyer'!"
"__ROCK__ Hey, I'm glad to hear that because I was thinking maybe you were a 'fake' fan that knew the three radio friendly songs and that's it."
"__ROCK__ Are  you kidding, Camera Eye, Witch Hunt, now that's what I'm talking about on Moving Pictures"
"__ROCK__ Ok, I see you do know your Rush, hey, let's go listen to Hemispheres!"
