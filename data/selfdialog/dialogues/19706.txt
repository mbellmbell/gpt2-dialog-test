"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite western movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I like True Grit a lot. That's probably my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Coen brothers' version?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was really good, but I still prefer the original."
"__MOVIES__ I have a hard time getting over how bad Glen Campbell's acting was in the original."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't great, but I've seen much worse. It doesn't take away from the film that much."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty huge though isn't it? He was a country music superstar and he got to star in a classic western film with John Wayne."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it doesn't get any better than that."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite western is Big Jake."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, another John Wayne classic."
"__MOVIES__ I think that film has some amazing dialogue."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. There are a bunch of memorable moments."
"__MOVIES__ I still say little quotes from that movie here and there."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny. I do the same thing sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ I guess we both prefer John Wayne over Clint Eastwood then?"
"__MOVIES__ I definitely do. Clint Eastwood was always cold and unrelatable I thought."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I feel the same way. John Wayne was cool while still being relatable and fun."
"__MOVIES__ Clint Eastwood is still making movies isn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's mainly a director now."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. He came out with that movie about the airline pilot last year."
