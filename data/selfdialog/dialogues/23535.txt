"__DISNEY__ Hey.  Do you want to go see the Race to Witch Mountain with me?"
"__DISNEY__ The reboot with Dwayne The Rock Johnson? Yeah I do!"
"__DISNEY__ Carla Gugino is in it too.  She plays the astrophysicist."
"__DISNEY__ Back in the day, I tried so hard to do my lipstick like hers in the Bon Jovi Always video. And she really rocked that hat!"
"__DISNEY__ Great, we'll go see it in the theater together....do we want to bring our kids?"
"__DISNEY__ Is it really responsible to take them to a movie without watching it first?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably not.  Even with Disney movies, it's important to know what your kids are watching."
"__DISNEY__ OK. So we will leave the children home, for their own sakes."
"__DISNEY__ Yes.  It has nothing to do with wanting to go see a movie with The Rock without dragging around our children."
"__DISNEY__ We are so selfless."
