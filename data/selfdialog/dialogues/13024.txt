"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been following Christian Hackenberg since he's gone to the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, there isn't much to follow. He didn't even dress for games last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I mean all the stories about him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A few here and there. He was such a highly rated college prospect but it's looking like he may never play an NFL game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Jets quarterback situation is pretty terrible so maybe he will have a shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. I used to think it was just his footwork that was bad, but I guess he has major accuracy issues too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither of which do well in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not at all. Maybe he'd do better as a Texan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Bill O'Brien was his college coach during his freshman year and that was the best year he had."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if O'Brien wants to risk another quarterback situation like he had before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, you mean the issues they had with Brian Hoyer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he was just always hurt I think. I'm talking about Brock Osweiler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that's right. One good year for the Broncos and then he turned out terrible for Houston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really did. It is interesting how that can happen with some of these guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll be interested to see if Dak Prescott can be as good in his second season as he was as a rookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. He seems like the real deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, when Tony Romo recognized it and basically stepped aside, I think that was telling."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Romo just couldn't get passed all of his injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, with the money he was making I'm not sure just how bad I feel for him!"
