"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard that new Katy Perry Song?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ Swish Swish."
"__MUSIC__ Is it good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's her and Nikki Minaj, I like it."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check it out, I haven't heard anything new from her lately."
"__MUSIC__ It's good, it's supposedly about Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ Really, are they fighting?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of, it's a clapback at Taylor's song."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ Bad blood."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I like that song, is Katy's as good as it?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think it's as good as Taylor's song, but it's pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to listen to it, why are they even fighting?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it had something to do with stolen backup dancers."
"__MUSIC__ Who steals backup dancers?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think Katy let her dancers go on tour with Taylor but had something in their contract where they could come back when Katy goes on tour."
"__MUSIC__ And they never came back?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think they did, but Taylor fired them when they asked.  Either way, you should out Katy's new song."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I will, thanks."
