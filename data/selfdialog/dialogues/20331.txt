"__MOVIES__ Were you a Twilight fan?"
"__MOVIES__ No I wasn't!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not either, but I've seen the movies."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of them?  I saw just one."
"__MOVIES__ I admittedly watched them for laughs, but now I'm left with so many thoughts and questions.  Which one did you see?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the last one.  Breaking Dawn Part II."
"__MOVIES__ That was a weird one.  It didn't have to be in two parts."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not.  But it's the trend that movies like Hunger Games and even Harry Potter are doing."
"__MOVIES__ It's a money grab."
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't stand Jacob in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, they ran out of things for him to do."
"__MOVIES__ The whole movie, he was just really angry and snotty."
"__MOVIES__ He kept interfering in everything the main characters were doing."
"__MOVIES__ By the way, how do they explain why the werewolves in this movie always have clothes on after transformation."
"__MOVIES__ Good question.  All their jean shorts disappear when they turn into wolves, but they're back when they become human?"
"__MOVIES__ Admittedly, the action scenes in this movie were okay."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  It was really violent for a children's movie."
"__MOVIES__ Especially when the sex scenes were toned down.  Why violence but draw the line at sex."
"__MOVIES__ There were way more inconsistencies in this movie than I can keep track of."
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely better than the other Twilight movies, but that isn't saying too much."
