"__MUSIC__ Do you have my copy of Gym Class Heroes?"
"__MUSIC__ Which cd?"
"__MUSIC__ The Papercut Chronicles."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I do have that."
"__MUSIC__ Dude, I've been looking for that for ages!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry man, I totally forgot about it until you brought it up."
"__MUSIC__ Its all good, just bring it the next time we hang out."
"__MUSIC__ I totally will."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what Travis McCoy is up to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure, I haven't seen or heard anything about him in a while."
"__MUSIC__ Me either."
"__MUSIC__ Its a shame, I feel like the whole Katy Perry thing was like a curse to him."
"__MUSIC__ A curse? Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm only half serious, but you can't deny as soon as she hit it big, he faded out of the scene."
"__MUSIC__ Well, not until after they broke up."
"__MUSIC__ True. I'm sure everything was good when both their albums were popular."
"__MUSIC__ That's right, I remember seeing them at a few reward shows."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, and then she started getting really popular..."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe he was insecure that her albums were doing better than his."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. I imagine that'd be a low blow for a musical couple."
