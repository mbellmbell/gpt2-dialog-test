"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of thrash metal?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. My favorite thrash band is Anthrax."
"__MUSIC__ One of the Big 4. Not bad."
"__MUSIC__ How about yours?"
"__MUSIC__ Mine is Slayer. They're just untouchable."
"__MUSIC__ Hard to argue with that."
"__MUSIC__ I love all of the Big 4, but I feel like newer bands don't get enough credit."
"__MUSIC__ Because they aren't as good."
"__MUSIC__ That's immediately not true."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Name 4 good newer thrash bands."
"__MUSIC__ Alright. There's Havok, Power Trip, Vektor, and Revocation."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of any of those."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you need to check them out, especially if you consider yourself a thrash fan."
"__MUSIC__ Alright then. Anyone else?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, if they were still active, As I Lay Dying might be in contention for best new thrash band."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't they a metalcore band?"
"__MUSIC__ For the most part, they are. They infused a lot of thrash into their music, though."
"__MUSIC__ I find that hard to believe."
"__MUSIC__ Listen to Within Destruction. You'd be surprised by how it sounds."
"__MUSIC__ I'll add those to my watch list."
