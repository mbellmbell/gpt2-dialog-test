"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the Ghostbusters remake?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty funny as a standalone movie. It can't compare to the original though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, nothing can ever beat the original."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, the original was the perfect movie. I often wonder how they came up with such a hilariously perfect script like that."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I always wondered, did some of those funny parts happen by accident? Or were they really geniuses who thought of it?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably a combination of both. However the new movie didn't contain any of that kind of brilliance, even if it was enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like the whole idea of remaking films with all-female cast members?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that's very interesting, I do like to see a new take on my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy in Bridemaids. That's one of the funniest newer movies ever made."
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie too! Although Melissa McCarthy is in everything these days, it's kind of annoying."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I think she's hysterical!"
"__MOVIES__ She is, but you get sick of seeing the same person in every single film."
"__MOVIES__ Sort of like Dwayne Johnson. He has to be in every movie, even the franchises."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention Mark Wahlberg, Samuel L. Jackson, etc."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah totally, take a break already guys!"
"__MOVIES__ Back to the new Ghostbuster movies, I wish Slimer could talk"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah like in The Real Ghostbusters, I loved his voice in that, it was so cute."
"__MOVIES__ I agree! They should bring that back."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe there will be a sequel and he'll talk."
"__MOVIES__ I hope so!"
