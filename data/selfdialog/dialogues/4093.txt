"__MUSIC__ I used to really like country music. But lately it just doesn't feel the same."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. It's basically pop music now."
"__MUSIC__ Basically, but it's like slightly outdated pop music that has a slight twang to it."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I wish I could find some real country music to listen to, like some Sammy Kershaw."
"__MUSIC__ I loved his songs years ago, what about Dwight Yoakum?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Dwight Yoakum was fantastic. His song Try Not to Look so Pretty was one of my favourites."
"__MUSIC__ But that was so long ago."
"__MUSIC__ It was. I also really liked Gary Allen."
"__MUSIC__ I liked him too, but only his earlier stuff, he got weird after awhile."
"__MUSIC__ I forgot about that. Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ I heard the new Faith Hill and Tim McGraw duet, it's terrible."
"__MUSIC__ It is terrible! I used to love their songs together."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. And their solo stuff, but now I prefer his acting over his music."
"__MUSIC__ It's sad."
"__MUSIC__ You know I have had some luck listening to artists classified as folk or bluegrass."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense, they are related to country and not as prone to the pop influences."
"__MUSIC__ So who do you suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ The Avett Brothers, Those Darlins, Old Crow Medicine Show. Those are some of my favourites."
"__MUSIC__ I'm still going to listen to my old Lyle Lovett."
"__MUSIC__ You should. Lyle was great."
