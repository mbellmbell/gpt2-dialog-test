"__MUSIC__ So what if you could only pick ten albums for the desert island -- what would they be?"
"__MUSIC__ Geez, that's always hard, but I have some that are always on the list!"
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Like Crimson's 'In the Court of the Crimson King.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, that's totally on my list, too.  That an Eno's 'Another Green World.'"
"__MUSIC__ I completely agree.  His vocal music is totally overlooked for the ambient music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and now that he's singing again, he makes it worse! His early vocal albums were so good, and he's so awful now!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree. It's like Beefheart had the same problem. His music just couldn't get appreciated sufficiently to keep him going with it."
"__MUSIC__ I know. He said he'd give up after Ice Cream for Crow if it didn't sell well, and he did."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Beefheart?"
"__MUSIC__ Mmmmmmm, I don't know.  I love Troutmask, Shiny Beast, Doc, and Ice Cream for Crow."
"__MUSIC__ Me, too. I keep going back to Troutmask Replica, though. I think it must be my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I think whichever I'm listening to at the time is my favorite!!"
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of Beefheart, did you ever hear the GTOs album? I forget exactly what's it's called -- something like Totally Deranged, but it's not that at all."
"__MUSIC__ Permanent Damage.  It's great!!!"
"__MUSIC__ Isn't it totally insane?  I love the one about the gym teacher."
"__MUSIC__ So do I!  And how about 'Bart Baker, you're a heart breaker!'"
"__MUSIC__ He just screams, 'Brian Jones!'"
"__MUSIC__ That kills me."
"__MUSIC__ Me, too.  I absolutely love it."
