"__THRILLER__ I'm going to go see that new M. Night. Shyamalan movie tonight."
"__THRILLER__ The one about the kids visiting their grand parents? I've seen that one."
"__THRILLER__ No. The Visit was out last year. It was pretty good too."
"__THRILLER__ Oh so he's got a new one already?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it's called Split. James McAvoy is starring in it."
"__THRILLER__ Is Joaquin Phoenix in it too? He was in a couple of M. Night movies before."
"__THRILLER__ No he's not. He wasn't in The Visit either."
"__THRILLER__ I know. I miss that kind of continuity. So what's Split about?"
"__THRILLER__ All I know is that some nutcase with dozens of personalities kidnaps a bunch of teenage girls."
"__THRILLER__ Let me know how it turns out."
