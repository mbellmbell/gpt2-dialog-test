"__MOVIES__ Do you think anime movies will ever be treated seriously by the Academy Awards?"
"__MOVIES__ No way. Not only are they cartoons, they're foreign cartoons."
"__MOVIES__ But Spirited Away won Best Picture the year it released."
"__MOVIES__ And it's the only example. Nothing else has ever come close, and never will."
"__MOVIES__ Jeez, that's sad."
"__MOVIES__ Sorry, but animated films will never be taken seriously as a medium."
"__MOVIES__ Well, why is that? I don't think they're any different than other movies?"
"__MOVIES__ You don't, but the Academy will always see cartoons as for kids, and won't even watch them."
"__MOVIES__ What? They don't watch the movies they vote on?"
"__MOVIES__ In a lot of cases, no."
"__MOVIES__ That's insane. A lot of great movies are animated."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not disagreeing, but you shouldn't expect them to win any awards."
"__MOVIES__ What about Pixar? They win awards."
"__MOVIES__ But they'll never win Best Picture. They're exuded from that since they are in their own category for animated films."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought about that. By having their own category those movies are excluded."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, but awards aren't everything. As long as you enjoy the movie and recognize the beauty in it, that's all that matters."
"__MOVIES__ I think you're right. Animated films especially are capable of capturing great beauty."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Heck, I'd say that even movies like Avatar which are live-action but use heavy CGI are animated."
"__MOVIES__ James Cameron would never agree with that."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't mean he's right. If someone is creating images that don't exist whether by ink and pen, puppets, clay, or CGI, it's still animation."
