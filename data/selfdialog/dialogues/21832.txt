"__DISNEY__ What do you think about Zootopia?"
"__DISNEY__ you mean the movie inside of which a bunny trying to make friends with a fox?"
"__DISNEY__ yes"
"__DISNEY__ I think it was okay. Over all, it's simply too simple and childish for adult to watch"
"__DISNEY__ why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ I mean there are some good value in it, but I just don't see how a bunny can make friends with fox"
"__DISNEY__ that's kinda true"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's better for movies to lead kids to a direction that reflects reality, not completely away from it, one day they'll learn the hard truth"
"__DISNEY__ well, you covered it all"
"__DISNEY__ did I say too much?"
