"__MOVIES__ I know you like Marvel movies, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, as I am a rational sane person with a good opinion."
"__MOVIES__ That was rude... but okay. What do you think is the LEAST successful character?"
"__MOVIES__ The guy who got killed in the opening of the Avengers who wasn't named."
"__MOVIES__ Okay... the least successful superhero?"
"__MOVIES__ In terms of money made, or in the way they're perceived."
"__MOVIES__ Perceived."
"__MOVIES__ Easy: Thor."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Thor isn't human. He's from another world."
"__MOVIES__ So?"
"__MOVIES__ So, he grew up far away, it's hard to relate to him."
"__MOVIES__ But he looks human."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he's a god and super old."
"__MOVIES__ You don't think people like that?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think they like people they can relate to."
"__MOVIES__ So who is the most successful?"
"__MOVIES__ Iron Man, for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ He has no superpowers: he's just really smart."
