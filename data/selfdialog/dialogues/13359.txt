"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about them Steelers?!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the Steelers, but they are going to have to wait until Tom Brady retires to win again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Patriots have our number for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm unsure about the Falcons this season. I think they had their one shot and blew it."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Do you think they'll make it to the Super Bowl again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure. The NFC has so many good teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Totally. It's definitely the stronger division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ AFC is good, too. Watch out for the Raiders this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. They got robbed last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still don't see them making it past the Patriots or Steelers in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll never know. Hopefully they can redeem themselves this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see Colin Kaepernick still hasn't been signed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This country wants to talk about rights and freedom but blackballs a guy for exercising his rights."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a number of teams I could see him being the starter on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like the team he was already on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I wanted to have high hopes for the Browns this year but I don't think I can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a good draft this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it's the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True indeed. Good point."
