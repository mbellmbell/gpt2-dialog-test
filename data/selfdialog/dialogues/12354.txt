"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch the NFL draft closely?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fairly. I tend to skim it over for the most part."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here. Who do you think had the best draft this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm gonna have to go with the 49ers or the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They both did very well with what they had available."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns played it especially well I felt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they didn't spend too much and they got Garret."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also ended up grabbing that Notre Dame quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, DeShone Kizer is his name."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I liked that they didn't overspend and they're in a great position for next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. They have something like 5 picks in the first two rounds next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a very nice spot to be in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More than enough for them to get a first round quarterback and anything else they need next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. The 49ers played that draft well too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they traded their 2nd round pick to the Bears and still got the guy they wanted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That allowed them to make a couple more third and fourth round picks, also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got Solomon Thomas, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they did. That was a highly sought after pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also ended up with Reuben Foster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's crazy. I can't believe they ended up with both of those players."
