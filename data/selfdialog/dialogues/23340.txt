"__DISNEY__ What are some Disney movies that are based on books? I'm writing an essay about adaptation."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds like a good essay. Hmm. Let me think."
"__DISNEY__ I know The Little Mermaid and Snow White are based on Fairy Tales, that sort of counts."
"__DISNEY__ Isn't The Hunchback of Notre Dame a Victor Hugo novel?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah! And One Hundred and One Dalmatians is based on a children's novel too."
"__DISNEY__ It seems like there are a lot of them after all."
"__DISNEY__ Is The Hunchback of Notre Dame anything like the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I bet it's a lot darker. Disney usually makes things happier."
"__DISNEY__ Well, they are children's movies after all."
"__DISNEY__ I guess so. They have to make them kid friendly."
