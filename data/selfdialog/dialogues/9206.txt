"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the scuffle between Joey Bats and the Braves?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I saw it, Jose getting into it again."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about his bat flip?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think it was dumb of him to do when they were losing, but the Braves should not been butthurt about it."
"__BASEBALL__ The next game The Braves hit Joey in the thigh deliberately."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I hope it angered Jose and motivated him to hit another dinger."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree with you, bro. Braves will continue to be wussies."
"__BASEBALL__ True. Every Brave except Bartolo haha."
"__BASEBALL__ Bartolo Colon truly is big sexy."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope he stays in the league forever."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, dude. We need to see him hit another bomb."
"__BASEBALL__ Hope he starts when the Braves come over to AT&T Park later this month."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too! I'm down to going if he pitches. You down as well?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yep, definitely! Haven't been to a game all year!"
"__BASEBALL__ Sweet. I'll hit you up if I hear any more about the series."
"__BASEBALL__ Hope Giants can turn things around fast."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep. They are really struggling."
"__BASEBALL__ The last series with the Reds and Dodgers wasn't bad though."
"__BASEBALL__ True. They've got the Cards coming up. You think they'll win the series?"
"__BASEBALL__ They should be able to. Or else I will be disappointed."
