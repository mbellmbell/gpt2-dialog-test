"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Patriots will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll do great. They added some great offensive players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really, who did they add to the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Brandon Cooks is one of their new guys. He's a wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard of him. He's a really smart player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely is, they also added a great running back. He led the entire NFL in yards per carry last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Gronkowski stays healthy I think they'll win it all again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya, but do you think Gronk will actually stay healthy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I really hope he does but he never seems to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Patriots actually had him the entire season they would probably win every game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet one of the hardest games this year will be the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, the Steelers have a great offensive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, their offensive game is right on level with the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I hope Brady stays healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, I'm going to be kinda sad when he retires."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, it's the end of an era."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, he really is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe he can stick it out another few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's hope so."
