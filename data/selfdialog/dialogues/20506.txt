"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Rogue One yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I finnally got around to it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was fun, I guess. It seemed like a lot of things about the story didn't make much sense."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean didn't make sense?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there were things that were redundant. Like, they're bringing Jynn along to the militant guy because they need to talk to the pilot, but Cassian gets thrown into a cell where he talks to the pilot. But that's probably what would have happened even if he didn't have Jynn along."
"__MOVIES__ You're being way too picky."
"__MOVIES__ And then Jynn gets the hologram which has all the important information from her father about where to go, but then they decide to fly to the place where the father is anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, because Cassian had orders to kill him."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but for story purposes wouldn't it have made more sense if they didn't know where to go until they got in contact with the father?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess, but then Cassian would have had to agree to not kill the father earlier."
"__MOVIES__ But Cassian's decision to not kill the father doesn't even make much sense. It's not like anyone argues him out of it or he has a crisis of conscience. He just... doesn't."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Like I said, it was fun but it just didn't make a ton of sense to me from a storytelling perspective."
"__MOVIES__ The robot was cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I liked him, he had a fun personality. But he was the only one that did, everyone else was kind of boring and one-dimensional."
"__MOVIES__ But there was that cool blind force guy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he didn't do any cool martial arts stuff except in his opening scene. Look, I liked the movie, OK, but if you keep asking me questions about it I'm afraid I'm going to talk myself out of it."
"__MOVIES__ All right, I just wanted to know."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know. It's Star Wars, I get it, we can't NOT talk about it. Like I said, it was fun and kind of exciting, and it was cool to see all the old ship designs and stuff."
