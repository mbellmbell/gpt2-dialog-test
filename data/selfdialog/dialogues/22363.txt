"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the Disney movie 'The Good Dinosaur?' It came out last year and I just watched it again last night."
"__DISNEY__ I love that movie, Arlo is the coolest dinosaur. I cried like a baby when I first watched it."
"__DISNEY__ Spot and Arlo are both so similar. They have similar problems with not fitting in in their lives."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, I think that they teach each other about life and help each other through their struggles."
"__DISNEY__ The movie wasn't very popular, it's not very talked about, but I think its one of the best new Disney movies out there."
"__DISNEY__ I think so too, it i an emotional roller coaster with comedy, action, and drama."
"__DISNEY__ I love showing my kids this movie because it makes them understand that even though you may be a little slow or a little different you can still succeed."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, especially if you have a friend to help you out through the tough times."
"__DISNEY__ I wish I had someone like Arlo when I was younger, I always felt like the outcast."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, 'The Good Dinosaur' is such a heartwarming film and it never fails to make me feel happy."
