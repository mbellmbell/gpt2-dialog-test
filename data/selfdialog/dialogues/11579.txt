"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the greatest quarterback in Philadelphia Eagles history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I am too young to remember Normal Van Brocklin people say he was good for the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If we go by Super Bowls I guess you might say Ron Jaworski."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he didn't win the Superbowl, Donovan McNabb appeared in one too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles didn't have any one super quarterback like a Tom Brady or Peyton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think McNabb has to be a contender though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was the quarterback over a number of good years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have had many short term solutions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like Michael Vick, Bobby Hoying, Rodney Peete, Nick Foles, Sam Bradford?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, those are some of the guys in revolving quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Randall Cunningham was another one who played for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree it comes down to those three for at least the time I have been alive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's either Jaworski, Cunningham, or McNabb."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say I'd have to go with McNabb at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had his flaws but the best on the list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe Carson Wentz will be on the list someday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he will be like a Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One can only dream."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see how it plays out will know a lot more after this upcoming year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Time to be optimistic."
