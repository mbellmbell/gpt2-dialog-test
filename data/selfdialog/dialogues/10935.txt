"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited to repeat this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Brady is going to get his sixth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is the same amount the Jordan won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but it is harder to win in the NFL, so many more players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he's already the greatest, this will just add to his legacy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really cool to have been able to see him play too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely something to talk about to the grand kids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think we can go undefeated this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so, I think we will get above 12 wins, but we will not go full throttle if we lock up the conference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, better to go into the playoffs healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, it matters what we do in the post season, not going undefeated and losing the game when it matters most."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still remember that season, we looked unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that did not end how we though it would."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we've learned greatly from that, but Brady will be 40 this season as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is crazy how long he has sustained this level of play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, at this rate he will be playing till 50."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as he plays at a elite level he can play as long as he wants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny, I also really hope we keep Jimmy so we have that heir apparent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that should be a priority."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well let's go and repeat!"
