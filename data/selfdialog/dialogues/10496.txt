"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I agree she went all the way in on that song."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ She had a lot of personal jabs at Nicki that hit hard."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What was the name of Nicki's reply back with Drake?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think it was called No Frauds."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah i wasn't feeling it as much as Shether."
