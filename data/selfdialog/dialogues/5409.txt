"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of BB8? In the new Star Wars films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought he was a cute little character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they built him well, his plot lines I mean."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is no R2-D2, but I think he played his part, to an extent."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think he will be as important as R2 in the future?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not think so,  I mean come on even then R2 had the rest of the map."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but bb8 had some too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, maybe he will be the new cute R2D2."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like a ewok, only a robot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, speaking of how about how ewoks are just mini wookies?"
