"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think the theme is of Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Its theme? I guess it would be a morality tale - you know, do the right thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Anakin attempts to do the right thing, and it leads to his downfall."
"__STAR_WARS__ He does it in a selfish way, and he gives in to anger."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you're saying its theme is telling you how to be a good person?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess so. Yoda tells Luke, for example, not to give in to anger and hatred."
"__STAR_WARS__ He says the same thing in the prequels. He says anger leads to hate, which leads to suffering."
"__STAR_WARS__ The prequels weren't nearly as well written, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think the new trilogy, starting with The Force Awakens, will follow up with that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It might, but I think it might be better if it finds something new to say."
