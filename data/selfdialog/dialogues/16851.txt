"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about movies that were based on books?"
"__MOVIES__ What are some examples?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, Pride and Prejudice is a movie based on a book by Jane Austen."
"__MOVIES__ I think they're okay. It helps if I've read the book before seeing the movie, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's true. Sometimes it doesn't matter, though."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, sometimes I see a movie and then find out after the fact that it was a book. So the fact that it was a book first didn't impact my viewing experience."
"__MOVIES__ Which movie was that?"
"__MOVIES__ Coraline. It's this stop-action movie that's based on a book by Neil Gaiman."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't hard to understand?"
"__MOVIES__ No. The story was super original and fun."
"__MOVIES__ Nice. With something like Pride and Prejudice, though, I feel like I'd struggle."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there's a lot they have to cut from the book to make it into a movie, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure. You can't get everything in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ So, like, I'll be missing a bunch of information that people who have read the book would catch onto."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that makes sense. Pride and Prejudice is a much longer book than Coraline, so there's probably more story missing."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. So I tend to avoid those kinds of movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad. It seems like every book is being made into a movie these days."
"__MOVIES__ I know, right? You go to Barnes and Noble and every book says something about how it's the basis for some upcoming motion picture."
