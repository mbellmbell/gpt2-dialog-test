"__MUSIC__ Did you know the Death Star has its own music?"
"__MUSIC__ No? I didn't know John Williams wrote a theme for a space station, given it's inanimate."
"__MUSIC__ No, there's music playing inside the death star during certain scenes."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, put on digital headphones and turn the volume up. You can definitely hear it."
"__MUSIC__ Bluegrass, probably."
"__MUSIC__ hahaha, no."
"__MUSIC__ Glad to hear that it gives the employees something to do to keep them sane other than worry about their lives."
"__MUSIC__ It's actually very slow and meditative."
"__MUSIC__ Almost like a drone, changing pitch infrequently?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, like that."
"__MUSIC__ That's not music in the death star."
"__MUSIC__ It's not?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, sorry."
"__MUSIC__ What is it, then?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the sound of machines humming at their frequencies."
"__MUSIC__ Wouldn't it be higher-pitched?"
"__MUSIC__ No, look at the size of the Death Star. It's huge. The machines are huge."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I feel stupid."
"__MUSIC__ The force is not strong with you."
