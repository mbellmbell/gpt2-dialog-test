"__HORROR__ So what did you feel about the remake of the Nightmare on elm Street?"
"__HORROR__ I totally hated it!"
"__HORROR__ Why didn't you like it?"
"__HORROR__ Where do I even start?"
"__HORROR__ Ha, well from the beginning."
"__HORROR__ The fact that Robert Englund wasn't playing Freddy was mistake number one."
"__HORROR__ Yes, that was a box office blunder."
"__HORROR__ Secondly, the retelling though not horrible wasn't quite correct with the movies lore."
"__HORROR__ What did you think about the movie effects?"
"__HORROR__ That at least was the best thing about this movie."
