"__STAR_WARS__ The Empire Strikes Back is, in many ways, even better than Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that's because the filmmakers take the time to explore the characters. In the first film, they were more like archetypes."
"__STAR_WARS__ The psychological examination Luke goes through - from Yoda, but also from his own perspective - was very intriguing."
"__STAR_WARS__ He had to confront that he had a dark side that he needed to control. That was a major realization for him."
"__STAR_WARS__ And it sets up the big reveal at the end that he is, in fact, the son Darth Vader, the epitome of evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw the film for the first time with my sister, and she was so shocked by that revelation that she refused to believe it at first. She was so mad!"
"__STAR_WARS__ But it's such a great mythic element to the trilogy. It shows just how vulnerable Luke is to being seduced by the Dark Side of the Force."
"__STAR_WARS__ The other character study is Leia coming to terms that she is falling in love with a scoundrel. She's so frustrated at herself!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Han Solo doesn't evolve that much in Empire - his big evolution came in Star Wars when he came down on the side of the rebels."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Leia, this totally moral upstanding princess and stateswoman, has a lot of self-learning to do when she falls for Han."
