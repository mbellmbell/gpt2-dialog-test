"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Chargers and Raiders both moving to new cities?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel sorry for the fans. The Raider fans have been through it before but the Charger fans must be crushed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I hope they have lousy seasons. That's just wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. And since I'm a Denver Bronco fan, I really hope they're lousy!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see the Chargers' new logo?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I did. What a slam to San Diego. All the years they were there, they never added SD to the logo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder what the Raiders are going to do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't heard but I'll let you know if I see something. What do you think about John Lynch going to San Francisco?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's great! I always liked John Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me, too! I'm going to be rooting for them to do well. He's good friends with John Elway and he's been giving him tips"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just glad they got rid of Kaepernick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I didn't care for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Denver signing Jamaal Charles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I thought it was fantastic. I like him and he's been a big Bronco fan his whole life."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're kidding, really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I even saw a picture of him as a teen wearing a John Elway jersey. It was funny."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, I can just see the KC fans when they saw that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some of them were really mad. They had no idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe he'll do good there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. We need a good running back."
