"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of kylo ren?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he seems like a very dark character as he should be."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya, I can't believe he killed Han considering the relationship there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting how star wars films deal with the father /son relationship."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya, it makes you wonder a little about george lucas's relationship with his father."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably troubled. I think star wars is so universal, most themes relate to life so deeply."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is true and for sure part of the movie franchise's appeal to the masses."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think rae and kylo are related?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am thinking yes probably brother and sister. Like maybe she was hidden away like lea was seperated from luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya something around those lines would make sense for the movies."
