"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, are you a football fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, love watching football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a huge Seahawks fan.  I'm from Seattle originally, so I love the 'Hawks.  Who do you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Kansas City fan.  Love the Chiefs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I live in Kansas City now, so I root for the Chiefs too.  Unless they're playing the 'Hawks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Chiefs are going to do well this year.  I'm sure glad we got Andy Reid a couple of years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's a great coach.  I'm a big fan of Pete Carroll too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he's done a great job with the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was so disappointed when Marshawn Lynch retired.  And now I'm hearing talk that he's thinking of coming back and playing for the Raiders!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I heard that too.  I guess he's from Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  The sad thing is, they're eventually going to be moving to Vegas, so he won't even be playing in Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True.  You guys have got a great quarterback in Russell Wilson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I love Russell!  I was worried that he wasn't going to sign a couple of years ago, when his initial contract was up.  But he did, thank goodness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks have a lot of great players - maybe they'll be in the Super Bowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be awesome.  I just hope it isn't against those darn Patriots!  I hate Tom Brady!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he is getting old.  But I haven't heard any talk about him retiring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I wish he would retire.  I'm so tired of him.  That Super Bowl a couple of years ago where we lost at the last minute was such a bummer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can imagine you were really disappointed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I was!  I didn't understand why they didn't just give it to Marshawn and let him punch it in.  Instead they threw that pass that was intercepted.  Darn it!"
