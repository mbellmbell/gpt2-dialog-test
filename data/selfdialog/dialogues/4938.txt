"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you like the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah I do, but I liked them more when they were more about cars."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, they stopped that around the fifth one it seems like."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, once the Rock got involved in the franchise it became more about action than racing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It is not as good without Paul Walker."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know right, it is just not the same with Bryan in them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think when Paul Walker passed away, they should of just ended the series there."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, they had a really good send-off for him in the seventh movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That song they played at the end almost made me cry."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was the saddest part of any Fast and Furious movie, I can tell you that."
