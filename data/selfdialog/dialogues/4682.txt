"__MUSIC__ Do you think it's possible to define indie rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Bands that are signed to independent labels that play rock music."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I see that definition, but what do you do with bands that are 'indie' but signed to majors?"
"__MUSIC__ Who are you thinking of here?"
"__MUSIC__ Modest Mouse, The Killers, The Strokes, I could go on and on."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you make a good point, a lot of what we are referring to isn't actually too closely related to whether or not the label is an indie."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it refers to an aesthetic, but I'm not even sure if there is anything that unites the disparate acts that play indie rock."
"__MUSIC__ So what are you suggesting then?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure what I'm suggesting, but how are Sufjan Stevens, Vampire Weekend, TV on the Radio, Joanna Newsom, Tokyo Police Club, and Animal Collective all indie rock?"
"__MUSIC__ They probably all share some aesthetic influences, but I see what you're suggesting. They don't actually sound much alike."
"__MUSIC__ So what is the purpose of this term indie rock then?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. It's definitely not a super coherent term or concept sound wise."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm starting to think it's a convenient marketing term. A way to sell a lifestyle to hipsters."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think it *was* that, for sure, at one point. The hipster is a dying phenomenon and being a hipster doesn't seem super tied to indie rock anymore."
"__MUSIC__ You're right, but do you see what I'm saying. All of these bands might share some influences and have a spirit of independence from overt commercialism, but that they all got lumped in as indie rock suggests something else is at play here."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, something is for sure at play. Maybe it's just a catch-all term to compare to the overproduced, formulaic sounds of the mainstream?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean like in the nineties and aughts the post-grunge and nu metal stuff. Like Slipknot, Nickelback, Limp Bizkit, Korn."
"__MUSIC__ Right, but I think there are a ton of bands that aren't post-grunge or nu metal that wouldn't get classified as indie."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right."
