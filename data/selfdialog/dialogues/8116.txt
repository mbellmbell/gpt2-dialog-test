"__POP__ What do you think of Madonna?"
"__POP__ Oh I love her, The Material Girl is the best."
"__POP__ She sure is, what's your favorite track?"
"__POP__ It's like trying to choose a favorite child honestly, but Papa Don't Preach probably."
"__POP__ Great choice, but I'm partial toward Like a Prayer."
"__POP__ That's also a great choice, guess I'm mostly a fan of her early 80's stuff."
"__POP__ Oh it was absolutely her best period overall, so many classics. Can't believe she's still going strong."
"__POP__ She has talent in spades, that certainly helps."
"__POP__ Agreed, she's also a surprisingly decent actress."
"__POP__ Absolutely, you won't confuse her with an award winner, but she's certainly more than adequate."
