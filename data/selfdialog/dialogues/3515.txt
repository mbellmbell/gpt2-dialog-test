"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite big band?"
"__MUSIC__ Glenn Miller, hands down."
"__MUSIC__ I like Moonlight Cocktail."
"__MUSIC__ I do too!  I really like Perfidia though."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that was his!  I thought that was Cugat's."
"__MUSIC__ It was Miller's but Cugat did a remake."
"__MUSIC__ Cugat is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I bow to no one in my love of Cugat.  But I consider Latin big band different than big band."
"__MUSIC__ You're splitting hairs when they did some of the same music."
"__MUSIC__ I think of Miller, Goodman, Harry James, and the Dorsey Brothers when I think of Big Band."
"__MUSIC__ I still consider Cugat in there too.  I'm not as much of a fan of Desi Arnaz as a band leader."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, his stuff is just ok."
"__MUSIC__ Without Lucy, he wouldn't have lived on."
"__MUSIC__ Cugar was the best Latin band leader."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like big band with or without singers?"
"__MUSIC__ It depends. Some songs are better with singers, but sometimes the vocals are annoying."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Sometimes the singer distracts like a bad musical number in a film."
"__MUSIC__ Most of the great singers started that way though."
"__MUSIC__ I like a group of singers better sometimes. Like the Andrew Sisters."
"__MUSIC__ I like the Andrew Sisters too."
