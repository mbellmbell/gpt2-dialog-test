"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is there a rapper that everyone likes that you just don't get."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yup, his name is Jermaine Cole. J. Cole."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You don't like J. Cole? Really?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nope, I think it's a shame he gets lumped in with Kendrick and some of the other current greats. I think he's making okay music that people think is 'deep.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's harsh! Have you listened to J. Cole's 2014 Forest Hills Drive?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yup, I like a handful of songs, like G.O.M.D., but I'd be fine if I never heard him again. What rapper do you think is overhyped?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't really get Future."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I understand that. He's vulgar and his music is very unique sounding."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, his style just doesn't do it for me. All of his songs sound kind of similar to me, but people love him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, fans, critics and rappers themselves love Future."
