"__MOVIES__ So, what's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I love How to Train Your Dragon. Such a touching movie."
"__MOVIES__ I was impressed they went with the decision to make Hiccup lose his leg in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ So was I. It had a great impact when I saw it in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't a new one supposed to come out soon?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, How to Train Your Dragon 3 is slated to release in March 2019."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's quite a wait. The second one came out in 2014."
"__MOVIES__ It's been delayed a few times, yeah. I really hope the wait is worth it!"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Despicable Me 3?"
"__MOVIES__ No, and I'm not sure if I want to, to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the first one, but I felt like the second one undermined the theme of the first one, so I agree."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. It went from 'man and adoptive daughters can be a real family' to 'every family needs a mom' and was very disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ I'm also just really tired of the minions."
"__MOVIES__ Man, the Minions movie was actually pretty great!"
"__MOVIES__ Was it? I was so burnt out by that point that I never bothered to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ It was very cute, not nearly as annoying as I thought. Sandra Bullock as the villain was fabulous."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I just noticed a Minions 2 is scheduled for a 2020 release."
"__MOVIES__ The first one made $336,029,560 just in the US, so I can see why they'd want to release a second one."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they make a Trolls 2, that movie was amazing. I loved the songs."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! My family and I quote that entire movie at each other all the time."
