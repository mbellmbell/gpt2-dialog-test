"__MOVIES__ Do you like any action movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the ones that are good."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, yeah there are a lot of bad action movies."
"__MOVIES__ I think one of the best ones is probably The Matrix."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that one was great! I love all the kung fu type stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! They did a really good job with all the fight scenes."
"__MOVIES__ My dad loves that movie, especially he loves it to test out his speaker systems."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that one scene where they're fighting in the dojo has really cool music and sound effects."
"__MOVIES__ The whole movie is really cool, it's just so stylish."
"__MOVIES__ It's a shame that the other Matrix movies weren't as good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I'm pretty upset about that too."
"__MOVIES__ The first one was kind of a one hit wonder I guess."
"__MOVIES__ I think so too, but I could definitely watch it over and over again."
"__MOVIES__ Same here, it's still a good movie when compared to some of the modern ones that have come out recently."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it still holds its own for sure."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's probably one of Keanu Reeve's best movies too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I think it's definitely his best, though he isn't the best actor around."
"__MOVIES__ You think so? I think he was great in The Matrix."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he did a good job there, but he's kind of flat in his other movies."
"__MOVIES__ You'll have to let me borrow some of his other movies then since I haven't seen many of them."
