"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey lets talk football. I want to see what your thoughts are on the upcoming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I can't wait to get back to pigskin football again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your thoughts on the Falcons this year and if they can bounce back from that collapse in the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they shoud be fine and it was just inexperience which caused for the game to go the wrong way for the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they should be able to make it back to the playoffs again. Matt Ryan is an elite quarterback in my mind and should be more experienced this time around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Talking about elite quarterbacks, your thoughts on the other big name ones in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Joe Flacco will have a breakout year for the Ravens, and Andrew Luck will finally get what he needs and gets further into the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think thats saying a whole lot, as these guys are great quarterbacks, but their teams as a whole aren't talented enough to move deep in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your surprise teams this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Jacksonville should be a contender, same with the Tennessee Titans and Tampa Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tampa is definitely talented. Jameis has the tools to win, and I think Doug Martin will have a bounceback season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are your surprise teams this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really do like Washington this year, as well as Tennessee."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you like about either team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Washington has the talent, just not the chemistry which defiitely can cause problems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, big egos between teammates never workout in the end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also do believe that Johnny Manziel will be back in the NFL and be a decisive playmaker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The kid definitely has talent and looks to be a safe spot for whoever decides to roll the dice on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think its beneficial for anyone to get Johnny Manziel"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah you are right"
