"__MOVIES__ What kinds of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like a lot of artistic movies."
"__MOVIES__ Like what? Also, what do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, artistic in a couple different ways."
"__MOVIES__ Please explain more."
"__MOVIES__ The directing style has a lot do to do with it, like the Tarantino movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that I can understand. What else?"
"__MOVIES__ A lot of movies do kind of the same thing, or have the same kinds of characters in them."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely feels like that sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it makes each movie kind of feel predictable."
"__MOVIES__ So, an artistic movie to you is one that is unpredictable."
"__MOVIES__ A lot of it is that, but it has a lot to do with the emotional impact of what you see too."
"__MOVIES__ How is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, in the movie Amelie- have you seen that one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think I have."
"__MOVIES__ Oh it's great! Just the way everything is directed is so interesting to watch."
"__MOVIES__ What do they do?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a narrator that talks about things like a cat's personality and what it likes to do."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but each scene has all kinds of cool stuff in it and it actually has a lot of romance."
