"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I mean if Cook was in a different team he wouldn;t have ranked that high."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I don't know about that. Cooks has a pretty good YAC at 15"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ YAC is yards after catch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. 15 yards after catch is right up there with the top receivers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His target/reception is pretty low though. 78 out of 117 targets. That's like 66%"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, but that's not really all on him. it also depends on the defense covering the receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ TY Hilton's is even worse, at 58%. Yet he's the no 1 receiver in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, again the target/reception doesn't really tell you much about the receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jordy Nelson's is about 63% yet he has the most TDs last year at 14"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's because how the Packers likes to score. And Nelson is Rodgers' favorite target for the end zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what's funny?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots's no 1 receiver isn't even in the top 10."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. And they still won the superbowl. Hahaha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And their RBs aren't that great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ LeGarrette Blount is a 8th ranked RB. pat's running game is on point"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Pats use him to punch in for the TD."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does have 18 TDs, more than any other RBs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does he have really that many?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, the second is David Johnson at 16 TDs. and Then Zeke Elliot at 15"
