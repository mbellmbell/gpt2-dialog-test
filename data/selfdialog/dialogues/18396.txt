"__MOVIES__ Did you get a chance to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2, yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't--I've been really wrapped up in work lately."
"__MOVIES__ I think you had said you liked the original, if I'm right I think you'd probably enjoy this one as well."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the original Guardians of the Galaxy, it's my favorite Marvel movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, this one isn't quite as good as the first one, but it sticks to the formula."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the music the first time around, how did they do this time?"
"__MOVIES__ Awesome Mix vol. 2 is definitely worth it--it tells a different story this time."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome!  I love some seventies rock.  Do they have some new characters?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not getting too into it, but Kurt Russell is there and his character is kind of crazy."
"__MOVIES__ Ooooh!  Snake Plisskin vs. Peter Quill!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha!  It's not quite as good as that.  We also have Sylvester Stallone doing more than a cameo, and less than a supporting role."
"__MOVIES__ Is he like some sort of time travelling cop?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he's a pirate--and speaking of pirates, we get to see a lot more of the Reavers this time around."
"__MOVIES__ Arrrggh!  I liked the blue guy, he was fun"
"__MOVIES__ You'll get a lot more blue guy--Yondu is his name. He also has the stabby stylus in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that there was a weird girl with antennae in the trailers, what was going on there?"
"__MOVIES__ You basically hit it on the head--the character is named Mantis is played by Pom Klementieff, a Canadian actress."
"__MOVIES__ The first movie really delivered on the special effects, how'd this one do?"
"__MOVIES__ It's absolutely gorgeous, and they send us to a bunch of different environments.  I think you'll like it."
"__MOVIES__ I do to, I've got a few days off coming up, I think I'll go see it at a matinee!"
