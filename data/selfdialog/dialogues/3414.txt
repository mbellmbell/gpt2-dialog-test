"__MUSIC__ I've decided to give Hip-Hop music a try."
"__MUSIC__ Good choice! It's a great genre."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know a lot of people like it, but I've never really given it a shot."
"__MUSIC__ As you know, I'm big into Hip Hop."
"__MUSIC__ That's why I came to talk with you. Can you recommend something for me?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. So you've never listened to any Hip Hop music in the past?"
"__MUSIC__ I've seen a few Snoop Dogg videos, maybe heard some Tupac. Maybe a Jay-Z song or something."
"__MUSIC__ But nothing really stuck with you?"
"__MUSIC__ That's right. I couldn't tell you the name of any of the songs."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I'd actually tell you to go in another direction."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, all those artists you mentioned are very commercial, mainstream artists."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, if I know their names, they must be!"
"__MUSIC__ But that's only one small part of hip hop music. I think you'd connect with more conscious, activist Hip Hop music."
"__MUSIC__ I could see that. I was turned off by the materialism exhibited by guys like Jay Z and Snoop Dogg."
"__MUSIC__ Try the album Blackstar. It's by a couple of MCs named Talib Kweli and Mos Def."
"__MUSIC__ Mos Def the actor?"
"__MUSIC__ He was an MC way before he was an actor. Music is what made him famous."
"__MUSIC__ I liked him in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I'll try the album."
"__MUSIC__ Start off with the song 'Re:Definition'. You won't be sorry!"
