"__LADY_GAGA__ I introduced my little sister to some Lady Gaga music last night."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah? What did she think?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She loves it. Born This Way is her jam."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Great message."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Agreed. I feel like that song has something for everyone."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. It's about loving yourself, no matter what."
"__LADY_GAGA__ A lot of Lady Gaga's music is like that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. It's so empowering."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I've never really been a fan of female pop singers until her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me neither. I think it's because her music actually says something real and doesn't just pander to men."
