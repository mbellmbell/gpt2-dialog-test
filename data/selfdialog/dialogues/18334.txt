"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the preview for the new Transformers movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, does it look good."
"__MOVIES__ I am not a huge Mark Wahlberg fan but it looks okay."
"__MOVIES__ Is Optimus Prime in it, I heard he maybe wasn't?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he is in the trailer so I think so."
"__MOVIES__ I hope so, how would you make a Transformers movie without him?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that would be crazy."
"__MOVIES__ I know."
"__MOVIES__ It looked okay, in the preview Optimus says he is no longer protecting the planet."
"__MOVIES__ I see, so he is turning on us."
"__MOVIES__ I guess, but  you know how trailers are."
"__MOVIES__ I know, sometimes they give you the best parts in the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I hate that."
"__MOVIES__ me too."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully, that is not the case with this because it is really going to be bad otherwise."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I like Mark Wahlberg in these movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me either, I'm not sure I like Mark Wahlberg movies in general."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me either."
"__MOVIES__ He just doesn't appeal to me."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that, I'm not sure about him."
