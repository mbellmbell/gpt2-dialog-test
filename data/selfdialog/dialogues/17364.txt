"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the Minions movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Despicable me? Love it."
"__MOVIES__ No, the actual Minions movie."
"__MOVIES__ Ohh, right. I saw that a while ago."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Was your theater packed with kids?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was almost unbearable."
"__MOVIES__ You hate family movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course!"
"__MOVIES__ So what was your favorite part of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably them killing all the bosses accidentally."
"__MOVIES__ The T-Rex was a bit weird, though"
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Their weight isn't enough for the T-Rex to even feel, let alone move him."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, that's right."
"__MOVIES__ The villains were super villain-y."
"__MOVIES__ It's not like they stole the moon."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the family the minions joins was super violent and mentally ill"
"__MOVIES__ I guess."
"__MOVIES__ I own it, want to come over?"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, once is enough."
