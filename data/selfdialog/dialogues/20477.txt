"__MOVIES__ I didn't like that new X-Men movie one bit."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the special affects and Munn as Psylocke was my favorite part."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ So, what didn't you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ The story. It's too different from the comics."
"__MOVIES__ I've never read the comics."
"__MOVIES__ Be glad you didn't or you'll be like me right now."
"__MOVIES__ All the characters are there aren't they?"
"__MOVIES__ The story line and character origins are all screwed up."
"__MOVIES__ I guess they don't want to follow the comics that closely."
"__MOVIES__ I'm never watching another X-Men film again."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I thought these last three movies were better than the first three."
"__MOVIES__ Those were equally bad."
"__MOVIES__ I think you should just stick with reading the comics."
"__MOVIES__ I did like the scenes with Quicksilver in them, though."
"__MOVIES__ His power is he runs fast, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, why?"
"__MOVIES__ The way they portrayed him in the movies, I thought he was slowing time instead."
