"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will the Oakland Raiders be any good next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It depends on how Derek Carr plays next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a great season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he seems to get better every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He kept his number of interceptions very low this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good stat to focus on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It can win you games if you limit interceptions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly especially if your team causes the other team to turnover a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In that scenario it is almost a guaranteed win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Derek will win a Superbowl before his career is over?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope he does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know he really deserves it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of players deserve it but not all of them always reach that milestone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah then meanwhile some players reach it five times or more in their career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really is all luck and chemistry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree if a lucky talented team has good chemistry they have an amazing chance at winning the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unless there is a good enough team to overpower any of the luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am so curious how next season will play out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I'll definitely be wanting to see how Derek Carr plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here we can watch together!"
