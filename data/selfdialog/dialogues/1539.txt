"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Lil Wayne?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know who that is."
"__MUSIC__ He's the rap artist that wrote the song Lollipop."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like rap."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I think too much of the content is extremely negative."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ It always seems like they're being misogynistic, using drugs, or doing some kind of crime or violence."
"__MUSIC__ Some songs are like that I guess."
"__MUSIC__ And I just don't think that's the message we should be sending our youth."
"__MUSIC__ Still, it's a bit stereotypical to say that all rap is that way."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but it's a huge turn off nonetheless."
"__MUSIC__ Is there any rap that you do like?"
"__MUSIC__ I've listened to Too Short in the past, but certainly not for the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Why did you like Too Short?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly because the music sounded very good with a quality stereo."
"__MUSIC__ You mean that you like his bass lines?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much.  The bass and the beat in general seem like they were designed for large subwoofers."
"__MUSIC__ That's one of my favorite things about rap."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it's my only favorite.  I just like good, loud beats."
