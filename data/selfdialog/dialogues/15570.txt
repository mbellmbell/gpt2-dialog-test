"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really loved the Harry Potter movies, but I wish we could've learned more about some of the characters. They're fascinating."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Like who?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Lily, for one. We know she was Snape's friend, James's wife, and Harry's mother, but we never get to know her as an individual."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, she was obviously kind and willing to do anything for the people she loved."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, but it feels like we learned a lot more about James than we did about her."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I guess she was a pretty important character, wasn't she?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Her sacrifice basically saved the Wizarding world, so yeah."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She does deserve a lot of credit for that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree. I've always seen her and Snape as the two biggest saviors, perhaps even more than Harry himself."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can see that."
