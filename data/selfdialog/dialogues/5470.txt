"__STAR_WARS__ who would win in a fight darth vader or darth maul?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader for sure!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know. Darth Maul is one strong sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maul may have a two sided light saber but that doesn't even begin to compare to the power of darth vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you think Darth Vader is the ultimate power of the dark side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, how can you not agree?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well what about the emperor dosen't he have more power than darth vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think so at all. I think he is in a higher position to a degree, but darth vader is the stronger power hands down."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe not sure 100%. I would have liked to see those two fight it out."
"__STAR_WARS__ I still think Vader rules all. Would be neat to see a vader versus maul then winner versus the emperor fight scene."
