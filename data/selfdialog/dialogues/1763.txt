"__MUSIC__ I really hate it when a show comes out on DVD and they had to change some of the music."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right! I get that it's a rights thing or a way to save money, but sometimes music make a scene."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. Honestly I discover a lot of new music from TV shows."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. No wonder some shows put out soundtracks."
"__MUSIC__ I think the first time I heard that Kaleo song was on Supergirl."
"__MUSIC__ And then of course an old song can get a bump from being in an important scene."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, man. 'Don't Stop Believing' fits that majorly."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the Sopranos! Although now people probably associate it with Glee too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right."
"__MUSIC__ Bohemian Rhapsody!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think that one wins the prize. Waynes World made that song, even if it wasn't new."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Those are the big ones."
"__MUSIC__ But there have been smaller moments for me too. Like 'Ventura Highway' when Logan is beaten on Veronica Mars."
"__MUSIC__ That was really powerful. Or like when 'Cathedrals' by Jump Little Children was playing as Colin's surgery was performed on Everwood."
"__MUSIC__ I probably never would have heard that song if not for that scene."
"__MUSIC__ TV and film really is a great way to discover new music."
"__MUSIC__ Or even covers of old music."
"__MUSIC__ You're so right. I once heard a slowed down version of 'You're the One that I Want' on the show Parenthood."
"__MUSIC__ I can't really imagine that."
"__MUSIC__ It was actually pretty good. It was a whole new take on the song."
