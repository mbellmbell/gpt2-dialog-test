"__STAR_WARS__ Who is the scariest person in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's such a tough question!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Just pick one person that makes your skin crawl because they are so evil"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would say the scariest person would actually be Anakin as he is burning"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ His eyes are so full of hate and he screams so much"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well he is burning! Of course he is screaming"
"__STAR_WARS__ But besides that, he screams 'I Hate You' to the Jedi as he burns"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wasn't he yelling at Obi Wan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Obi Wan didnt help him as he burned"
