"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you watching the game this Sunday?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for sure. I'm a huge Broncos fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh haha. They're playing the Browns, so I'm going to be rooting for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we can still be friends. The Browns will never win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, some say that the Browns will win the Superbowl when hell freezes over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They keep firing all their coaches, that's why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they do need to find a good coach and stick with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they have some crazy players too. At least there is nothing as bad as Jim Tressel's scandal at the college level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, just rivalries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Other divisions have rivalries too, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll stick with the Browns, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever floats your boat. When was the last time they even won the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not even answering that. Maybe it's because they don't have any good players like the Mannings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton Manning's not so hot now.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was good for the longest time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Peyton Manning and Brett Farve are some of the best career players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brett Farve did NOT know when to retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wonder how he could throw if he was still playing now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty badly. Still, the Vikings aren't doing well nowadays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps they'll beat the Broncos today."
