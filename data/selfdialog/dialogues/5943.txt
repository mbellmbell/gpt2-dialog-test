"__STAR_WARS__ Hi, have you heard about any news regarding the upcoming Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I watched a recent TV teaser trailer on YouTube. It looks amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I watched the teaser trailer too. It is great to see that Luke Skywalker is coming back as a main character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he is one of my favourite characters in the Star Wars franchise. But my favourite is always Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is sad that Darth Vader will not return."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is a pity indeed. But we can see him in other Star Wars movies, like the recent Rogue One movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ You are right. I was so excited to see him in Rogue One. I almost cried in the theater."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. It has been so long to see Darth Vader on the big screen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you know whether there are any other Star Wars movies featuring him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have not heard any yet, but I am sure the movie studio will not forget him."
