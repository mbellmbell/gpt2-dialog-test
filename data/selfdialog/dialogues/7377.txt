"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you think of Lady Gaga now? It seems like she's losing her edge."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I totally agree. Her first album was so amazing."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah,  The Fame had some really great singles on it. I used to listen to Paparazzi all the time in the car."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh my god. Me too! I loved Alejandro as well. That music video was steamy!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah, I remember it was really controversial when it came out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you know she used to write for Britney Spears?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really? I had no idea. I knew she grew up in New York."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I knew someone that went to high school with her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wow, that's funny. Did they still talk?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, no. They were never friends."
