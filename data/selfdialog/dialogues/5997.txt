"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of Han Solo dying in the Force Awakens movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It really saddened me to no end. I mean, he was a true Star Wars icon. And that fact that his own son Kylo dealt the killing blow."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really teared up on that scene especially because of Chewbacca. To lose his best friend that way."
"__STAR_WARS__ That must have hurt the wookie a great deal. Then again, Leia seemed devastated."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even though Carrie Fischer moved on to a better place, I do hope that the image of Leia continues to go on in the Last Jedi. After what happened to Han, I just can't bear to see Leia go as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ If Leia does continue on though the movies, do you think her son Kylo will do something to her?"
"__STAR_WARS__ what do you mean 'do something' to her?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like harm his mother in some way, or even kill her off like he did how father?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say no. I think that Kylo might have more of bond with his mother. And i believe she felt Kylos 'Goodness' through the force that linked them, this is how she knew he could be saved."
"__STAR_WARS__ That could be true. But, he did kill his father. so how redeemable was he after all?"
