"__BASKETBALL__ Man I hope that the Houston Rockets play better in the playoffs next year"

"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they really surprised a lot of people with their play this year"
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean most people didn't foresee them winning 55 games in the regular season."

"__BASKETBALL__ Yep. But he proved them wrong. They have a great system."
