"__DISNEY__ Snow White is such a classic movie"
"__DISNEY__ I think it is one of my favorites, the witch was pretty scary though"
"__DISNEY__ she was and I was alway worried apples could be poisoned after watching this"
"__DISNEY__ which dwarf was your favorite? I liked sleepy he was cute"
"__DISNEY__ I liked grumpy, he reminded me of an old grumpy man"
"__DISNEY__ I thought the glass casket they put her in was creepy but pretty also"
"__DISNEY__ I think so also, they were trying to preserve her body"
"__DISNEY__ I wish I had a mirror that could tell me things"
"__DISNEY__ that would be neat, but it may make a person obsessive after awhile"
