"__MUSIC__ Really, it's  well known. Good women have high voices, and powerful men sing bass."
"__MUSIC__ That's just silly. A person's vocal range has to do with his or her vocal chords I'm sure, not personality."
"__MUSIC__ In opera, the high voices belong to the pure. Consider Desdemona, Juliette, Angelica, and poor, fragile Ophelia."
"__MUSIC__ It's just a convention. And what about Carmen?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she's a mezzo, most comfortable in a slightly lower range. Such voices are usually  guardians, wives, confidants, little people."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? But the Marschallin is a soprano. She's middle-aged, and no maiden."
"__MUSIC__ Yet she behaves as a woman should. Abundantly available, then generously getting out of the way of true love."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, Tschaikovsky's Queen of Spades."
"__MUSIC__ Again, she's a mezzo-soprano. Not immoral exactly, but not perfectly pure, and not young."
"__MUSIC__ Aha, Lulu. You can't say Lulu is pure. She's a soprano."
"__MUSIC__ Yet she is pure woman. There's a raft of tenors and baritones in Lulu, but Jack the Ripper is a baritone, while the banker is a bass."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're going to tell me why."
"__MUSIC__ Just listen. Pinkerton, a tenor, is not man enough to save Butterfly, Jose, tenor, can't hold Carmen, Otello can't control himself."
"__MUSIC__ I'm a tenor, as you know. So I guess the baritones are the real men?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. The hero Wozzeck, Macbeth, Jack the Ripper in Lulu, Don Giovanni, these are the real men, apparently."
"__MUSIC__ So what about the basses?"
"__MUSIC__ They're the real power."
"__MUSIC__ Masculine power?"
"__MUSIC__ Pure power, like a soprano is pure innocence. Wotan, the father of the gods, Bluebeard, the Grand Inquisitor. Power, I said."
"__MUSIC__ You worry me."
