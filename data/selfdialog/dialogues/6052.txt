"__STAR_WARS__ Which of the movies from episode I to III is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess it would have to be Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, that was great as it got to show us how Anakin fell to the Dark Side."
"__STAR_WARS__ Indeed, Palpatine was such a manipulative influence."
"__STAR_WARS__ We also got to see how little separates a hero from a villain."
"__STAR_WARS__ And it really showed us why the Jedi Order wanted to be without emotional attachments."
"__STAR_WARS__ It can be argued that emotions are a strength, but in this case it was a clear weakness."
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure, as it was feelings that allowed Anakin to be so thoroughly manipulated."
"__STAR_WARS__ The best part of the movie for me had to be the fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ For me the best part would have to be how Anakin embraced the Dark Side and became a full fledged villain."
