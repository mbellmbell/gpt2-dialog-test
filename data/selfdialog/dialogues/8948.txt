"__BEATLES__ Oh, I really love the Beatles. Nobody writes music like 'Yesterday' anymore."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I totally agree.So much feeling... Everytime I hear 'Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away...'  I get all teary-eyed."
"__BEATLES__ You too?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, our parents used to complain about how the lyrics didn't make any sense. They should give a listen to the stuff that passes for music these days."
"__BEATLES__ Funny, my Dad did the same thing. But now that he's 87, he actually LIKES the Beatles!  Guess NOW he's comparing them to modern music."
"__BEATLES__ That's funny.  My grandkids like the Beatles more than their parent's music. I played Abbey Road for my 6 year old grand-daughter and she loved it."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, Abbey Road is such a classic. How could anyone not like it?"
"__BEATLES__ I agree.  What's your favorite cut from Abbey Road?"
"__BEATLES__ That would definitely be George Harrison's 'Here Comes the Sun.'  You?"
"__BEATLES__ I prefer Lennon's 'Come Together' but 'Here Comes the Sun is definitely a close second for me."
