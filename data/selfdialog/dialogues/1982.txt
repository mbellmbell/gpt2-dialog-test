"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to the Siriux XM Lithium channel lately."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  That's alternative music, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it has brought back a lot of memories for me and reminded me of the great bands that came from the West Coast."
"__MUSIC__ What bands do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ Bush, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Green Day, tons more."
"__MUSIC__ Green Day!  I haven't heard them in a while"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, not since the Woodstock mudfest, but listening to the music made me miss them!"
"__MUSIC__ I love the song Longview, he sounds like he has an English accent."
"__MUSIC__ Who?  Billie Joe Armstrong?  He's not English."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I remember they came out of California, but to me, he sounds English."
"__MUSIC__ I think they might just be putting on that accent to sound more punky/new wavish."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there are other songs that sound English as well.  Does the channel play songs by Bush?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course they do!  I still think Sixteen Stone is their best album, I heard Everything Zen yesterday on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song, when was Sixteen Stone released?"
"__MUSIC__ It came out in late 1994."
"__MUSIC__ Does the Lithium channel play Stone Temple Pilots?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.  You know, I really miss the lead singer, Scott Weiland."
"__MUSIC__ His voice was so awesome on the song Plush, such a strong voice yet so smooth."
"__MUSIC__ Dead and Bloated is a crazy good song by them as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is dark but so loud and in your face.  STP was a fabulous band for sure."
