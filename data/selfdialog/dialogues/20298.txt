"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of Danny Boyle?"
"__MOVIES__ The director?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the director."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I really liked Slumdog Millionaire"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a good one. Quite poignant"
"__MOVIES__ Some of those scenes in the India slums were pretty tough to watch"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it felt authentic."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't he also direct Trainspotting?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and the sequel as well"
"__MOVIES__ There was a sequel to Trainspotting?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it came out fairly recently."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the first one was pretty depressing. A lot of drug use."
"__MOVIES__ Boyle also directed Steve Jobs"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I didn't realize he did that one as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I liked that one."
"__MOVIES__ I did too. It was three very different acts within a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Right, felt very much like a play."
"__MOVIES__ And the film used was different for each act. Meant to mimic each era of Jobs' life"
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. I didn't realize that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a nice attention to detail."
