"__MOVIES__ Hey, Amazon has Independence Day: Resurgence on dvd, really cheap."
"__MOVIES__ No one would probably buy it at regular price."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ That movie was a travesty to the first."
"__MOVIES__ Because Will Smith wasn't in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Because it was stupid.  It didn't make sense and wasn't any fun."
"__MOVIES__ How much fun can you really have when aliens are trying to destroy your planet?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one made it fun.  Not to mention most of the characters that survive the first don't survive this one."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's true.  I was sad to see David's wife had died."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, I loved their relationship in the first one."
"__MOVIES__ And they killed Bill Pullman's character.  He was really the hero of the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Probably did it for shock value."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe.  In the first one they had these characters who were interesting and by the time the movie was ending, you were chearing."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.. you don't in the sequel.  Most of the characters who do survive have the personality of a dry sponge."
"__MOVIES__ At least the special effects were good."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's where all the money went because it sure wasn't in the writing."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?  Why do movies with really good special effects usually have crappy writing and boring characters?"
"__MOVIES__ Beats me."
"__MOVIES__ So, I shouldn't buy the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Seriously, dude?"
