"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just finished watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think of it? That's one of my favorite movies in the whole series!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked it a lot. But it got pretty dark, especially towards the end when Harry comes out with Cedric's body."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It does get dark. It has some funny parts though too!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which parts are you thinking of?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ When Fred and George try to put their names in the cup and get cursed with beards, and then when Dumbledore corners Harry after his name gets pulled."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is funny. He storms at Harry and yells 'DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME INTO THE GOBLET OF FIRE!' even though in the book it says he calmly asks him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's so crazy too how the real Professor Moony was hidden at the bottom of a huge trunk the entire time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is really crazy. If you could take Polyjuice Potion to turn into any character, who would it be?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Probably Professor McGonnagall. She's whip smart and is one of my favorite characters in the series."
