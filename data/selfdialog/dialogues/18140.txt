"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Tim Burton movie?"

"__MOVIES__ Ah yes. That is a classic."

"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Alec Baldwin and other people I can't remember."
"__MOVIES__ It's funny that Tim Burton has done these kind of quirky films and then really mainstream ones like Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. His movies tend to veer towards the morbid though, which I like."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd. He seems to really use Johnny Depp as his muse."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Johnny Depp is also in his Willie Wonka film adaptation."
