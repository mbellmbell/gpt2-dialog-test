"__DISNEY__ Are you in to Disney at all?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, growing up I had so many Disney movies!"
"__DISNEY__ Same."
"__DISNEY__ Isn't it crazy how they're re-making them all now?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, they're now targeting all audiences with all the special effects and what not."
"__DISNEY__ Beauty and the Beast, The Jungle Book..."
"__DISNEY__ I almost see more adults going into the theaters than kids!"
"__DISNEY__ I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that these movies are near and dear to our hearts."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, like from watching them growing up?"
"__DISNEY__ Exactly, just like movies like Frozen will be near and dear to our kids' hearts."
