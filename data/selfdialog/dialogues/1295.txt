"__MUSIC__ I'm going to a concert tonight!"
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Who's playing?"
"__MUSIC__ The headliner is John Legend."
"__MUSIC__ Aw, that's really cool. John Legend is amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I've been a fan of his music since he did an album with Kanye West back in the mid 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that album. It was a mix of hip hop and R & B, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. At the time I was a big hip hop fan."
"__MUSIC__ So the album was kind of like a nice transition into R&B?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think that's accurate to say."
"__MUSIC__ Who else is going to be playing at the concert."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure about a lot of the opener acts. I think Robin Thicke is performing."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I'm not a big a fan of his."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ If you listen to his music, it's clear that he's basically ripping off Marvin Gaye."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I never noticed that."
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty blatant once you start listening for it."
"__MUSIC__ Now I'll probably be able to think about nothing else. Haha."
"__MUSIC__ It bugs me because Marvin Gaye is one of my all time favorites."
"__MUSIC__ But wouldn't that make you like Robin Thicke, if he sounds like Marvin Gaye?"
"__MUSIC__ It feels like he's stealing from Marvin Gaye, which makes me mad."
