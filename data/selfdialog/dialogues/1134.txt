"__MUSIC__ Hey how's it going. What are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Skillet."
"__MUSIC__ What in the word is Skillet?"
"__MUSIC__ Haven't you heard of them? They are great."
"__MUSIC__ No I have not. What kind of band are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They are considered Christian Rock."
"__MUSIC__ Christian Rock. I always thought Christian music was old people music."
"__MUSIC__ No way. Christian music has all genres now. Rock and alternative Christian are my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Wow that is cool. What kind of songs do they have?"
"__MUSIC__ I am listening Hero right now. Want to listen?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. Oh this is good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and they are a husband and wife band which is really awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Really husband and wife? That is really neat."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they formed in the mid 90s and have really grown in time."
"__MUSIC__ That is neat. What are some other Christian Rock groups?"
"__MUSIC__ Well Mercy Me is a really good band. They are classified as Rock, but I think they're more alternative in style."
"__MUSIC__ Not a huge fan of alternative. What are some others?"
"__MUSIC__ You may like Switch Food, or P.O.D. I do not have any of theirs downloaded though. Sorry."
"__MUSIC__ Oh no worries. Which of those is your favorite."
"__MUSIC__ It would be P.O.D. To be honest."
