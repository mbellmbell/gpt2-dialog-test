"__HARRY_POTTER__ Did you ever have the thought that maybe Snape was a good guy?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I never once thought that. I was taken by surprise."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too. It made me kind of sad that he was given such a bad rap and he was helping the whole time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know and the fact that he'd been in love with Harry's  mother and was teased in school made you really feel for him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know that was sad. It explains how he felt towards Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree. It doesn't excuse his attitude but he'd really been done bad."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love Alan Rickman. Anytime I see him in any role I can only think of him as Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too! I think he was born to play that role."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're right about that. I would have actually loved to take his Defense Against the Dark Arts class."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It sounds like it would have been the most interesting of them all."
