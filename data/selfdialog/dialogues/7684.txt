"__LADY_GAGA__ Are you a fan of Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but I do like some of her songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What songs do you like?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Poker Face and Paparazzi."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yea, those ones are really catchy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yea I don't listen to her enough to know of any of her less popular songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yea same. All the songs I know from her are ones I've heard on the radio."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I will say though, after watching her halftime performance at the Super Bowl this year, I gained so much for respect for her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yea, like her singing was on point. I was surprised how good she sounded live."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly. Sometimes you hear an artist on the radio and then you hear them live and it's such a disappointment."
