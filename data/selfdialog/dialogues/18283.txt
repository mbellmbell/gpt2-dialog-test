"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Dark Knight Rises?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was great.  I like the way Health Ledger was the Joker."
"__MOVIES__ In my opinion he was the best Joker.  Too bad how he died."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it was.  But the movie was still amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the part where he always said 'Do you know how I got these scars?'"
"__MOVIES__ I know, and it was always a different story."
"__MOVIES__ Most under appreciated part of that movie was Two Face."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was awesome.  He should have gotten his own movie."
"__MOVIES__ That would have been ideal. But not every villain can have a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Changing subjects who do you think was the best Batman?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked Bale.  I mean Keaton was good too but Bale just had that Batman violence to him."
"__MOVIES__ I know, and he was the perfect Bruce Wayne."
"__MOVIES__ Imagine if you could combine Keaton as Batman and Bale as Wayne."
"__MOVIES__ That would be a perfect Batman."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to miss Keaton and Bale but Aflick seems to be pretty good so far."
"__MOVIES__ I know, and that was the part I worried about.  I can't believe he was awesome and the rest of the movie struggled."
"__MOVIES__ So here's how I rank movie Batmans.  Bale, Keaton, Aflick on top, then Kilmer, and finally Clooney."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget West did a movie too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was more comedic though."
"__MOVIES__ I know, too bad he died recently.  That was nice how LA put up the Bat single."
