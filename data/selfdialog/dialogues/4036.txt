"__MUSIC__ If you could see any band that isn't around anymore, who would you see?"
"__MUSIC__ I would love to see My Chemical Romance."
"__MUSIC__ I was lucky enough to see them once in 2007."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you are very lucky. I never got to unfortunately."
"__MUSIC__ I believe they may come back at some point. I at least hope so."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know about that. The last thing I saw Gerard say, it seems like they are gone for good."
"__MUSIC__ They were actually spotted together at a Frank Iero show a few months ago."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Maybe they will get back together then."
"__MUSIC__ At least we know they are still close friends."
"__MUSIC__ That is true. What is your favorite song from them?"
"__MUSIC__ I really loved their older stuff. My favorite was certainly Cubicles."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song too, but I was a bigger fan of the newer stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I respect that, but I wasn't a big fan of the change of sound. They got a little too poppy for me."
"__MUSIC__ I understand that. I just felt like Welcome To The Black Parade was such a solid album."
"__MUSIC__ I will agree that it was. There was a few songs that really stood out, but the rest was just okay to me."
"__MUSIC__ Which songs did you really like?"
"__MUSIC__ Dead was definitely my favorite. The beginning guitar solo was insane."
"__MUSIC__ I absolutely love their guitars. I bet it was amazing seeing that live."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it was. Their lead guitarist absolutely rips on guitar."
"__MUSIC__ I am so jealous of you."
