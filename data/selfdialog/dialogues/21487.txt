"__DISNEY__ Have you ever watched Lilo & Stitch?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I watch it almost every month with my niece. She thinks I look like Nani."
"__DISNEY__ I could totally see that! Isn't your niece a bit young to watch it since Lilo's parent's died?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I don't think that's the main point of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Well, what do you think the main point of the movie is?"
"__DISNEY__ Lilo & Stitch is about embracing family and showing them love! It's not about the absence of family."
"__DISNEY__ True, I guess I never thought of it that way. I liked David in the movie, anyways."
"__DISNEY__ Same here. He really became such an important person for Lilo and Nani."
"__DISNEY__ That's why I liked him! I'll go watch the movie again tonight."
"__DISNEY__ Mind if I come? I'll bring my Stitch plush!"
