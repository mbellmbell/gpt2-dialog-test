"__STAR_WARS__ So, yeah, I love Star Wars, but even I have to admit, George Lucas can't write romantic dialogue."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I know, the Padme and Anakin relationship just did NOT work at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but what do you expect from a sixty year old divorced millionaire?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, certainly something better than a guy comparing the woman he loves to sand."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, man, what that was bad!  (dead voice) I don't like sand.... it's coarse... it's rough and it get into everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ Personally, I just find the whole premise that have attachment to a woman is what turns him to the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's kind of a like a 'Jedi's as monks' kind of thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think you're giving it waaay too much credit.  I would have gone with the 'ambition and uncontrollable anger even with the best of intentions' being Anakin's downfall."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they did show he had a bit of a temper in the second film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, by have him immediately start whining Padme within five minutes of them meeting each other again."
