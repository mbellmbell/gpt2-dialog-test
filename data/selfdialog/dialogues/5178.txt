"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen the first Fast and Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I've seen all of them, but that one is my favorite."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I sue it in my class to teach irony."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How do you do that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's dramatic irony because we know something that the characters don't."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Like that Paul Walker is a cop?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Exactly.  Plus it's also situational irony."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ When does that happen?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ At the end when Paul Walker throws Vin Diesel the keys.  Not exactly what your expecting."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Good point.  Those are probably good examples for kids."
