"__MUSIC__ Have you heard about the music festival coming to Pennsylvania?"
"__MUSIC__ What? A music festival in Pennsylvania? Is it in Philly or Pittsburgh?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it is actually in central PA."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious? It must all be really small artists."
"__MUSIC__ You'd think so, but actually John Legend is the headliner."
"__MUSIC__ No way! Anyone else I'd know?"
"__MUSIC__ Chance the Rapper will be there, and so will Paramore, Alessia Cara, and a bunch of alternative bands."
"__MUSIC__ That's amazing. That would be cool to see."
"__MUSIC__ It defintely would. I think they are even going to have Grace Vanderwaal."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ She's that young girl that played the ukelele and won America's Got Talent last year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I remember her. She is a great musician."
"__MUSIC__ She really is. Her voice is sort of that alternative, folk sound that has become more common."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It took me awhile to get used to that. I didn't like it at first."
"__MUSIC__ You do now though?"
"__MUSIC__ For the most part. I guess that style has grown on me."
"__MUSIC__ Anyone in particular that you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, of that style, I like Of Monsters and Men. Their lead female singer really has that sound."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know they are from Iceland?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that's interesting. You don't hear that often."
