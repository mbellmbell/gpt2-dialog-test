"__DISNEY__ Are you going to see the Newest Pirates of the Caribbean Movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I am not sure, when does it come out?"
"__DISNEY__ It is out now, and it is supposed to be really good."
"__DISNEY__ How many movies are there in that series?"
"__DISNEY__ I believe this is number 5, can you believe that?"
"__DISNEY__ A lot of people really like it, I wonder how many characters will be back?"
"__DISNEY__ I know that Johnny Depp will be in it, of course. I am not sure who else."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if it will be funny still, or if they have run out of jokes."
"__DISNEY__ I think it will be really funny, especially with the monkey."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know about the monkey, I guess I'll have to watch a trailer about it."
