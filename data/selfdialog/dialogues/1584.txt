"__MUSIC__ What's up?"
"__MUSIC__ Nothing much. Just listening to music."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. What are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Blink-182."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I can't believe you still listen to that kind of music."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to listen to Blink-182 when I was 12 years old. They're so emo."
"__MUSIC__ If you listened to them, doesn't that mean you like them too?"
"__MUSIC__ I only used to like it. It's so dumb now."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It totally relates to a specific period of our lives. Like, when we were really young and stupid."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Blink-182 reminds me of when I used to straightnen my hair and paint my nails black."
"__MUSIC__ I don't see the harm in giving this new stuff a chance. I mean, you did like them at some point."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right. What song should I listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Bored to Death.' It's from their newest album, California."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. I can't believe they still make music."
"__MUSIC__ Just listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ I can honestly say this is a humorous attempt at music."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever."
