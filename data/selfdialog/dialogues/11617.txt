"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, did you hear the Raiders are moving to Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Completely, isn't that wild?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is really interesting news."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has to be the biggest story of the year so far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, when are they moving? This fall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they said it will be a couple of years yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what's the hold up you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are building a new domed stadium for them and the UNLV team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see, so they will play there in 3 years. That gives us time to plan our vacation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I think a lot more people will want to travel to Vegas to see them than Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I have no desire to go to Oakland at all but I will definitely go to Vegas to see a good game and gamble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think that will attract as many people as the football itself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how the NFL will handle their athletes gambling while they're in Vegas to work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is what I've wondered about as well. It's legal, but doesn't seem like something an NFL player should be doing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I see people like Gronk out there all the time partying though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but that's in the off season when they aren't working you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, I never thought about it like that. And they will be the first pro sport franchise to be there, so there's no history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be very interesting to see what the NFL rules about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I can't wait, I think the Raiders in Vegas is going to be pretty freaking awesome."
