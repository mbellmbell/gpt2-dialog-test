"__FASHION__ What do you think of how Rachel Maddow looks on her show?"
"__FASHION__ I don't like what they are doing with her hair. Or her makeup"
"__FASHION__ Oh, me either. I like gray hair."
"__FASHION__ And she has on way too much makeup right?"
"__FASHION__ Yes! It's like they're trying to make her look straight."
"__FASHION__ Straight and not old. Because society fears older women who don't want to sleep with men. or who men don't want to sleep with."
"__FASHION__ She still looks great though"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I love her suits."
"__FASHION__ At least they haven't made her wear dresses yet"
"__FASHION__ OR blouses or something feminine"
"__FASHION__ I like the kinds of things Ellen wears on her show too"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, but even with her sometimes they try to make it too feminine"
"__FASHION__ Right I understand that it's television and all, but we can bring gender neutral clothing into the mainstream"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, i don't even mind overtly feminine or masculine clothing. But it feels like most people are somewhere in between on the spectrum."
"__FASHION__ Yes! There are so many in between people. I wish they would show that more on television."
"__FASHION__ I like Mary Carillo's outfits as well. It's mostly pantsuits, but they fit her well."
"__FASHION__ I like Mary Carillo's hair."
"__FASHION__ Yes. It is a good cut for her"
"__FASHION__ I used to not like skinny jeans, but they've grown on me."
"__FASHION__ Oh, me too. If they fit well, they are nice."
