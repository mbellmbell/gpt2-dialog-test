"__MOVIES__ Are you going to go see Gaurdians of the Galaxy 2 this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ I still have not seen the first one yet but many of my coworkers told me I need to. Are you going this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I am! Do you think you will find time to watch the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie? If so, then you might be able to come with me this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ It's not a super long movie like the last one you recommended is it? Between my job and family I hardly have three hours to dedicate to a movie these days."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean the last King Kong movie? I didn't honestly recommend it as much as I said it would be nice to see the last version before the new one comes out."
"__MOVIES__ Well even though I still got sucked into watching a three hour movie because of your recommendations but I think I will give Guardians of the Galaxy a try."
"__MOVIES__ I am positive you will like it! Anything featuring Chris Pratt is essentially comedic gold!"
"__MOVIES__ Why does that name sound so familiar? Was he the main actor from the new Jurassic Park movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes he was! So you do watch movies without someone pointing you in the right direction?"
"__MOVIES__ You think to highly of me Jason. That movie was purely the girlfriends choice."
"__MOVIES__ Oh come on! You must have some interest in seeing movies yourself! Have you seen any good movie trailers lately?"
"__MOVIES__ The new Baywatch movie looks good!"
"__MOVIES__ Really Tim? The new Baywatch is what has peaked your interest?"
"__MOVIES__ What can I say? I am a sucker for a nostalgic remake."
"__MOVIES__ But its Baywatch. What nostalgic moments are you actually trying to remember?"
"__MOVIES__ Hey! Do not try to pretend like you wouldn't see a remake of your precious Fight Club?"
"__MOVIES__ Only because Fight Club is on a whole different level from Baywatch! Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are acting gods!"
"__MOVIES__ Well the new Baywatch movie is going to have Dwayne Johnson!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you really just put Dwayne Johnson on the same level as Edward Norton and Brad Pitt?"
"__MOVIES__ You know I think we should probably just get back to work. I am not trying to avoid the rest of this conversation at all."
