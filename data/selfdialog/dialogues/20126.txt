"__MOVIES__ One of my favorite Christmas movies is A Christmas Carol with George C. Scott."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is that a good one?  I've always meant to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ It's the best version of the film in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ What makes it the best version?"
"__MOVIES__ It has so many good points, but the actors are so great in it."
"__MOVIES__ It has a big British supporting cast, doesn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, my favorite supporting character is Scrooge's nephew, Fred, played by Roger Rees."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know that actor.  I like him."
"__MOVIES__ The costumes are very beautiful, too."
"__MOVIES__ I love it when a film has pretty costumes.  It really adds to a film's atmosphere."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the locations look so real."
"__MOVIES__ That's essential for a period movie.  I hate it when you can tell it's a set."
"__MOVIES__ I hate that, too.  That really takes away from a film."
"__MOVIES__ Was it shot on location somewhere?"
"__MOVIES__ It was shot in England, and the buildings are so great looking."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like the filmmakers did a lot to make this one stand out."
"__MOVIES__ I sure think so."
"__MOVIES__ Do you watch it every year around the holidays?"
"__MOVIES__ I do watch it every year.  It's not Christmas for me unless I do."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you've convinced me.  I am going to watch this soon."
