"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 9 weeks until the season starts.  I'm ready--Sunday tailgates here I come!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm right there with you, buddy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So- what's your team?  Are you still a 49ers fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh hell no!  They lost me when Harbaugh left and Kaepernick was benched."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they really blew that call.  That kid was really responding to Harbaugh.  They needed another coach who knew how to bring him along.  That kid is talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah--pisses me off that the league is blackballing him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you gotta give it to that guy, though--he's sticking to his guns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah  You know who really impresses me is the Raiders QB Derek Carr.  That kid is great man--nothing but upside."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as they put an actual line in front of him this year.  That injury was gruesome.  Yo think he'll be ready for training camp?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  The way the league tries to rush these guys back from an injury . . . I'm thinking RG3."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was majorly screwed up, man.  I'm pushing for the Steelers, myself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if Big Ben wants another ring, he'd better hurry.  He's getting a little long in the tooth, and he ALWAYS takes a beating.  Talk about a team that needs an O-line . . ."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding.  I know he's had some off-the-field problems in the past, but there's just something about that guy that I like.  You know, local boy, plays close to home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he's really settled down since he got married and had kids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Green Bay?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think all they got is Aaron Rodgers.  That's a pretty good 'all', but he can't do it alone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I'm just hoping someone will beat the friggin' Patriots.  That Belichick stinks on ice, man.  Is there any way to cheat that he hasn't thought of?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If there is, I'm sure we'll see it this season.  What a jerk!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Amen to that, Bro.  So, I'm saying Super Bowl--Steelers by 6 over Seattle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Get outta town!  Raiders by 12 over Arizona!"
