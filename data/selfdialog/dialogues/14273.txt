"__HORROR__ I'm dying to see that new Annabelle movie?"
"__HORROR__ Which one is that?"
"__HORROR__ Its called Annabelle Creation and its about that doll that's possessed."
"__HORROR__ Did that come from those Conjuring movies somehow?"
"__HORROR__ I think so.  I remember that now that you said something."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, the doll was in the beginning when the couple were talking about some cases they solved."
"__HORROR__ Speaking of, I really liked the Conjuring. Patrick Wilson was good in that."
"__HORROR__ He was.  He's never really blown me away though with his acting."
"__HORROR__ Did you know that movie is based off of real people?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, Ed and Lorraine Warren?"
