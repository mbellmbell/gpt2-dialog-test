"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm dying for the new Azealia Banks record to finally come out."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think it'll be out anytime soon?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well she keeps talking about it, but I'm not sure."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You know, she's missed more than one release date."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly. I need somebody to distract me."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well have you checked out Cakes da Killa?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Can't say that I have."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's really good. You can get his three mixtapes for free, and he just dropped an album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'll check it out. I've been listening to a lot of Angel Haze to bide my time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ She's another really good one."
