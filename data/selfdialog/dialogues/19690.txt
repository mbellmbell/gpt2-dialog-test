"__MOVIES__ Hey, what was the last movie you watched on Netflix?"
"__MOVIES__ I re-watched Forrest Gump the other night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, what? That's on Netflix now?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! It's a classic. Every time it's on tv, I have to watch it. Well, it turns out that's true of me seeing it on Netflix too. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Haha yeah. I watched the latest Adam Sandler movie on Netflix the other night with my girlfriend."
"__MOVIES__ Are you serious? You liked it and him?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he's actually pretty horrible, but there was nothing else to do and she wanted to watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't honestly remember, because it was so bad. It was just a bunch of really inappropriate jokes. It had David Spade in it though and I do find him to be funny."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! I like David Spade. Another movie I can't bypass is Joe Dirt!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah - definitely - that movie is hilarious. I have to watch that when it's on tv too."
"__MOVIES__ That movie really needs to be on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any movies in the theaters lately?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the last movie I saw was Finding Dorry."
"__MOVIES__ I think that might have been the last movie I saw too. I did watch Jackie on a flight though."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that too - that was actually a pretty good movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the thing I wonder about is how factual it is though."
"__MOVIES__ I did too. It would be interesting to see a historians take on the movie and out what is true and what is false."
"__MOVIES__ Any movies you're excited for? I'm hoping the Fast and Furious movies just stop sometime soon. They should have been done about a decade ago, at least."
"__MOVIES__ The Smurfs movie will be cute, but yeah, I couldn't agree more on the Fast and Furious movies. Those are horrible."
