"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So where did that guy play in college?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That guy... Yes because we all know who that guy is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know the one who scored highest on the Woderlic or whatever"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was his major?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, who knows."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I did hear that he said something like oh I blew that test off or something"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. he said, 'Nothing on that test came with football'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahaha. That's funny."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's an average player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So maybe Wonderlic does predict performance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Frank Gore has the second lowest score at 6. he was a leading rusher for the 49ers for years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh, he had 9 seasons with 1000 yards rushing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's whole lotta running with da ball."
