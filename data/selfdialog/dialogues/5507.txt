"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was amazing when it came out. I think audiences were looking for something different in the movie sector."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right. The characters and the story were so different than anything that had been done."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. Who would think that robots talking to each other would make a good part of the story!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and what about Chewie's character? It's a good thing that Luke and everyone always translated for him."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was different to cast Mark Hamill as the hero. He certainly didn't look the part of a glalactic warrior!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, but that made it more interesting. Luke's character was so anxious to get into the war with all his friends, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Casting Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor was a good move. He played the part of Obi Wan great!"
"__STAR_WARS__ And what about the light saber? That was an unusual weapon to have."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and it was interesting that only certain people could use it."
