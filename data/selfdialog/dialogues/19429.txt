"__MOVIES__ Do you like Pixar movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. What Pixar movies can you think of?"
"__MOVIES__ I like A Bug's Life and Cars and that one about the rat cooking in France."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. I remember that last one. It was Ratatouille!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one. Did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw Ratatouille back when I lived in Georgia."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't you think the animation was beautiful?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I remember that now that you mention it. It had a kind of soft feel to it, and the views of Paris were something."
"__MOVIES__ It was a little over the top to imagine a rat controlling the movements of the human cook, wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess so, but it was still fun."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought so. I liked the first Cars movie too, did you see that one?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, was that the one with the race car that got lost out in the desert or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he got lost in an old town along Route 66 at the time when they were building the new Interstate and everyone was bypassing the town."
"__MOVIES__ And that was Owen Wilson that did the voice of Lightning McQueen, wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Lightning had to learn a lesson from the townspeople, or townscars, I guess you'd have to call them."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny, you're right. Did you see the movie with the snail that races?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, what was that called?"
"__MOVIES__ It was called Turbo."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw that one too. It was kind of fun."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I do like some of the animated movies now that we're talking about them."
