"__THRILLER__ Have you seen Saw?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah that was awesome.  Every second you were completely fooled."
"__THRILLER__ Tell me about it.  That guy on the floor the whole time was Saw."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and the guy he was chasing seemed like a genius in his own right."
"__THRILLER__ Yep, but he was just another pawn."
"__THRILLER__ That's what was so crazy.  The whole time you thought wrong."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and it shows how smart Saw himself really is."
"__THRILLER__ I know, and how about those puzzles he left?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah they were crazy.  Basically kill someone you love or die yourself."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it was like all a distraction, look here so we can fool you."
