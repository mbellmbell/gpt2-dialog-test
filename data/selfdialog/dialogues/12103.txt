"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been to the stadium in Arizona where the Cardinals play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, many times. It was only 10 minutes away from where we used to live."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was wondering if it gets really loud because the roof is closed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so...then again any football game can get loud."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where do they train before the season? In Arizona?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Cardinals training facility is in Flagstaff. It's in northern Arizona. Much cooler there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you ever get to see the players up there? Like Larry Fitzgerald?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I saw him and Kurt Warner back when he used to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, he was a terrific player. Didn't he play for the Rams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. He is a great guy, too. So is Larry Fitzgerald."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they have a shot this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's no reason not..but I say that every year. It is a great team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that way with the Titans. too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, they are good team. They are kind of an underdog team. I want to see them do good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a really good season last year. With Mariota coming back after the injury, I think they will surprise us all again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be nice to see some other teams go to the Superbowl besides Pats and whoever..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right? I don't want to see them or the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I'm not big on the Packers either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe even the Browns will do better this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can they do any worse? They had the worst season ever last year!"
