"__MOVIES__ See any good horror movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the movie, 'Get Out.'"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard about it.  Didn't a comedian direct it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  It was written and directed by Jordan Peele."
"__MOVIES__ You mean from 'Key and Peele?'"
"__MOVIES__ Yea.  He's now branching out and doing other things."
"__MOVIES__ What was 'Get Out' about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about this guy who goes up to meet his new girlfriend's parents in the suburbs."
"__MOVIES__ How is that scary?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't say too much without giving it away, but he gets there and strange things start to happen."
"__MOVIES__ Anything else you can tell me?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it actually covers a lot of different social and racial issues.  It's also a hybrid comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that's unlike other horror movies you normally hear about."
"__MOVIES__ It is just so well-written.  All of those elements mix well together."
"__MOVIES__ I'll stop by at Red Box on the way back from the office and get a copy."
"__MOVIES__ It'll be well worth it.  Have you seen any good horror movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw 'Don't Breathe.'  It's about teens who rob a blind man's home, but end up being the victims."
"__MOVIES__ That's a very interesting role-reversal."
"__MOVIES__ It's good.  It stars Dylan Minette from '13 Reasons Why' and 'Goosebumps,' as well as Scott Lang from 'Avatar.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I'm a big fan of 'Scott Lang.'  You watch 'Get Out,' and I'll watch 'Don't Breathe.'"
