"__STAR_WARS__ Who's your personal favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me? I'd probably go with Darth Maul."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that? I've always found him to be a bit bland."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just really like the way he looks. He looks like such a cool character is all."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess so."
"__STAR_WARS__ Enough about me, though. Who's yours?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Mine's Luke Skywalker. He easily has the most depth of any character in the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm actually a fan of the character purely because of Mark Hamill."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's a fantastic actor, isn't he?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That, and he's also the voice of the Joker. The best of two worlds!"
