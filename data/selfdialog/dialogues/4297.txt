"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite oldies band?"
"__MUSIC__ Hm, I like the Beach Boys. Not sure if you consider them 'oldies' though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they are. They are kind of a class above most of the other oldies bands you here."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. They are a classic pop band, really. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a huge fan of Buddy Holly."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! He's also kind of in a different class than most other artists from that time."
"__MUSIC__ I think so too."
"__MUSIC__ Do you also lick Richie Valens and the Big Bopper?"
"__MUSIC__ Not nearly as much as Buddy Holly. They have a totally different sound than him."
"__MUSIC__ True. What other artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I am a huge Simon and Garfunkel fan."
"__MUSIC__ Paul Simon is a genius."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, both his solo work and his work with Garfunkel are classics."
"__MUSIC__ Did you go to their concert in Central Park?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I have listened to that album a hundred times."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I love how they sing their classics then do Chuck Berry songs."
"__MUSIC__ They are brilliant. So you are a Paul Simon fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! Graceland is one of the best albums I have ever heard from anyone."
"__MUSIC__ I like his album titled 'Paul Simon' -- I think his 2nd after he and Garfunkel split."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's a good one. I heard him play 'Duncan' live a couple years ago."
