"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the IT 2 Trailer we just watched?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh My God. I can't wait to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I know right."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know they were making another It movie."
"__MOVIES__ Neither did I."
"__MOVIES__ Pennywise's voice is going to be a huge factor on if this movie is good or not."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. And since we didn't hear him talk I am giving them the benefit of the doubt.﻿"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but we have to remember, this Pennywise doesn't need to sound like Tim Curry's Pennywise. Bill Skårsgard is his own Pennywise best interpreted by the novel.﻿"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Tim Curry was great, but his Pennywise was a far cry from the seductive creature in the book."
"__MOVIES__ People are going to hate on Bill Skarsgard simply because he's not Tim Curry, but given that Tim Curry didn't give a 'true to the book' performance, we have to go into this movie with an open mind.﻿"
"__MOVIES__ Tim curry was a legend in the original films of IT, but I believe this guy who's portraying him now is good.﻿ At least, it looks that way from the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ I think his voice is going to be calm and pleasant. Not creepy at face value, but creepy because what's creepier than a calmly pleasant clown?﻿"
"__MOVIES__ That's so true."
"__MOVIES__ I know I probably shouldn't, but when I saw that kid hit his head I laughed so hard."
"__MOVIES__ I think that is why they put that scene in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if  this movie going to be about them just as kids or are they going to grow up into adults like the original IT."
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking the same thing."
"__MOVIES__ Or is this just like a completely new version like a completely new story just wondering?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's gonna be split into two movies. This first one is just with the kids."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I was kind of thinking that myself just now if so it should be good it will show a lot of what happened to them when they were kids ."
