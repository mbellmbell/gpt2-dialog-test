"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Jon Pardi song?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't even heard of Jon Pardi.  Who on earth is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, seriously?  He's a country singer!"
"__MUSIC__ That must be why.  I don't really listen to country."
"__MUSIC__ Oh strange, I thought you did.  Well you should check him out."
"__MUSIC__ But I don't like country."
"__MUSIC__ He's not really overly country.  There's a bit of rock twisted in too."
"__MUSIC__ What does he sing?"
"__MUSIC__ Well a lot of songs.  The newest one is called Dirt on my Boots and it's got a great tune to it."
"__MUSIC__ I might have heard that.  It sounds familiar."
"__MUSIC__ You probably have, it's really popular right now."
"__MUSIC__ What else?"
"__MUSIC__ He's got another great one called Up All Night.  It really gets stuck in your head."
"__MUSIC__ I swear I've heard that before."
"__MUSIC__ So maybe you have heard of him after all."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've probably flipped past a station where they were playing him or something."
"__MUSIC__ Probably so.  I can play some of his music for you if you'd like."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that would be great!  Turn it on!"
"__MUSIC__ I sure will.  You're sure to like it."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, thanks!"
