"__HORROR__ Have you see Land of the Dead?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I liked it but it was a clear step back from the first 3 movies in the Dead series."
"__HORROR__ I know what you mean.  The acting was a little off for one."
"__HORROR__ And zombies learning to think another.  At least one of them did."
"__HORROR__ I did like how they set up cities across the world.  Shows that we will find a way."
"__HORROR__ I also liked when John Leglazarro came after Dennis Hopper's character."
"__HORROR__ When he was a zombie.  That was great, revenge at it's best."
"__HORROR__ There was also that gross scene that was like a throw back to Dawn of the Dead."
"__HORROR__ When the zombies were basically chowing down."
"__HORROR__ A pretty good zombie bite when that one still had a spinal cord too."
