"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's Spaghetti."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Haha! Have you heard the song 'My Life' with Adam Levine and 50 Cent?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, but that's a real weird trio."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, well there's this line that goes - getting my tastebuds ready to wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-GET EVEN. Man Eminem likes spaghetti."
