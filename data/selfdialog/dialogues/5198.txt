"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The latest 'Fast' movie felt rather empty with Brian, Paul Walker's character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I absolutely agree.  I am just glad that the send-off was so good in 7."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was truly an emotional and touching farewell."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I liked that Dom named his new baby after Brian in the latest movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I did as well, though I don't think it necessarily made sense."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How so?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well in that movie universe, Brian is technically still alive and has just retired.  By that logic, why would they tribute the baby with Brian's name?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh wow that's actually an excellent point."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think it would have made more sense to name the baby, Paul."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree.  That way, it is a tribute to Paul Walker but it also makes sense in terms of the movie's story."
