"__MOVIES__ Do you like the 'Fast and Furious' movies?"
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I don't really like them at all."
"__MOVIES__ I'm surprised.  What don't you like about them?"
"__MOVIES__ I just think they are rather absurd.  Hard for me to suspend disbelief."
"__MOVIES__ Can you be more specific?"
"__MOVIES__ Well for instance, the main characters, especially Dom, are portrayed as invincible."
"__MOVIES__ It is true that they pull off incredible feats, but I think it is excusable because it is fiction."
"__MOVIES__ It may be fiction, but it borders on science-fiction.  There should be established laws in the film universe."
"__MOVIES__ I think the one aspect that I agree is ridiculous, is the plot.  Though I enjoy that element nevertheless."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  They are all street racers who then become heist experts, fighters, and save the country."
"__MOVIES__ I do think that the series has redeeming qualities in spite of the criticisms."
"__MOVIES__ What would you say is the best quality?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the emphasis on family is a really good touch.  Especially in 'Furious 7.'"
"__MOVIES__ 'Furious 7' was particularly touching.  It was a great tribute to Paul Walker."
"__MOVIES__ Brian's was my favorite character, so I was very upset."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like the Rock's character?"
"__MOVIES__ He was a great addition.  The Rock has a way of reviving franchises."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I suppose it was no coincidence why 'Fast Five' was such a commercial success."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they keep making these movies."
"__MOVIES__ Vin Diesel said in an interview that they would be going up to 'Fast and Furious' number 10."
