"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the movie 'The Sword in the Stone'?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes actually that was one of my favorite movies as a child"
"__DISNEY__ Mine too"
"__DISNEY__ Funny that you should bring it up, I just watched this the other night with my children"
"__DISNEY__ Really?  What did they think of it?"
"__DISNEY__ Suprisingly they enjoyed it considering how its from the 60's"
"__DISNEY__ Gosh is the movie really that old"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah hard to believe I remember it like it was fresh in the theatre"
"__DISNEY__ Just goes to show how quick time flies"
"__DISNEY__ No wonder my daughter calls me an old fuddy duddy"
