"__MUSIC__ Joe, have you ever listened to Queen before?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I have, I know a couple of their songs anyway."

"__MUSIC__ Those are classics!  I love Bohemian Rhapsody!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too, whenever it comes on the radio, I have to sing along."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I wish I had the voice of Freddie Mercury!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he was so talented."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any of their other songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure I have, but none come to mind."
"__MUSIC__ How about We are the Champions and We Will Rock You?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yes of course I've heard those."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that Queen did a soundtrack to a movie in the 80s?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I hadn't heard that before.  What movie was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Flash Gordon"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, like the comic book Flash Gordon?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the movie wasn't very good, but I like the music."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool!  Too bad I never got to see them play live, I bet it was amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they still tour, but with a different lead singer.  He's ok."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting, I bet it's a hard job to try to sing Freddie's parts!"
