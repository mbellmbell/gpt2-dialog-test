"__STAR_WARS__ Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie? I think it's coming out around Christmas."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am! I really excited to see Luke Skywalker train Rei."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard the movie is called 'The Last Jedi'. I wonder what that means."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm. Maybe Rei will be the last Jedi because she will return balance to the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was actually wondering if Kylo Ren will turn out to be the last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hadn't considered that. He seems like such a dark character, almost beyond redemption."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, but so did Darth Vader. If Kylo Ren really wants to be like Vader, he will need to return to the light."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really wonder if Kylo is related to Rei in some way."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's possible. I actually think that Rei is related to Obi-Wan somehow."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would make sense, too."
