"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Lions are going to do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know... last year was so weird."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Stafford is getting older now too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they lost Megatron...they will probably go 8-8"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think so? I have them at a perfect season again, 0-16."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ oh- come on.They won't be that bad. You should at least have them at 4-12"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. But, you know, they are totally going to lose against Green Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but, c'mon, they can beat the Bears.... maybe not the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well... alright, I'll give you the Bears. who do you think will be #1 in the nfc North?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is going to be Green Bay again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.. me too. They were doing so badly last year and had to screw it up and win"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't care if the Lions are losing, but when Green Bay is losing, it really makes my weekend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is going to win it all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots. I know, LOL, a boring guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is going to be the Browns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?no way! they can't beat an elementary school girl scout football team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know... I was kidding... I really hope that Green Bay doesn't get in"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be the best quaterback"
