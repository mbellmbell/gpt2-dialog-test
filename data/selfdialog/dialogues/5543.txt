"__STAR_WARS__ So do you think Han shot first?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, what cut are we talking about?  Original or Lucas edited?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Doesnt matter, what do you think happened?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Han only defended himself, so he shot second."
"__STAR_WARS__ What makes you believe that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ When in any of the movies was he the original aggressor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Never... I suppose you are right"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose Lucas should have never switched the scenes..."
"__STAR_WARS__ I could not agree with you more!"
