"__MOVIES__ I hated Cars 3."
"__MOVIES__ You did? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ I could never shake the sense that everything was simulated."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is difficult to care about computer generated characters."
"__MOVIES__ The presence of celebrity voices made it all even more unreal."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is just a kid's movie."
"__MOVIES__ So kids want to see 90 minute stories about violence and giving up at the last minute?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not saying that. Celebrities lend credibility to movie projects in my view."
"__MOVIES__ For me, story comes first."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I don't see why you would hate rather than just dislike or feel neutral about Cars 3."
"__MOVIES__ Come on! Pixar used to set a standard of innovation and humanity in art and storytelling."
"__MOVIES__ I think if you look back on their earlier films, they were quite shallow and haven't aged well."
"__MOVIES__ I just don't know what is wrong with movies anymore. A world of infinite possibilities just recycles everything."
"__MOVIES__ I know. And we, the public, are expected to get excited about sequels to sequels."
"__MOVIES__ If I made a Cars movie, it would not be about race cars."
"__MOVIES__ What's wrong with race cars?"
"__MOVIES__ They are obviously meant to serve as merchandising hooks for young audiences."
"__MOVIES__ I see. And what is bad about merchandising? It's a free country."
"__MOVIES__ Toys often supplant rather than inspire imagination."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're one of those people who believes movies should be purely on the screen."
