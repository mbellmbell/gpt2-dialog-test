"__MOVIES__ I'm really glad we decided to watch Rushmore tonight."
"__MOVIES__ I love Jason Schwartzman."
"__MOVIES__ Honestly I think Bill Murray is better in Rushmore."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I mean, his character is just so wacky."
"__MOVIES__ And Jason Schwartzman isn't?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but, like, his character is supposed to be out there."
"__MOVIES__ Right."
"__MOVIES__ And Bill Murray is supposed to be normalish, but he's hiding behind trees and running over bikes with his car."
"__MOVIES__ I get it."
"__MOVIES__ It's funnier because of the gap there."
"__MOVIES__ This whole movie is like that. It's nuts."
"__MOVIES__ This might be a top five movie for me. It's definitely my favorite Wes Anderson flick."
"__MOVIES__ More than Royal Tenenbaums?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I think so."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ It's just the writing. It feels like he's taking more risks."
"__MOVIES__ That makes it feel more cartoony to me though."
"__MOVIES__ I guess. I dunno. It's hard to go wrong with any of them."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely."
