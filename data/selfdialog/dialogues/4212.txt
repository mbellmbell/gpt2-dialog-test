"__MUSIC__ What do you think of music on the radio nowadays?"
"__MUSIC__ I absolutely hate it."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I just like radio music years ago"
"__MUSIC__ What's wrong with today's radio music?"
"__MUSIC__ It's all trip. It's all rap. It's all the hype without the finesse"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I kind of get what you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's too repetitive, and there are too few vocals it just sounds like noise."
"__MUSIC__ What music did you used to like?"
"__MUSIC__ When it was B.O.B, Eminem, even Katy Perry, Lady Gaga. The music was powerful. It had vocals."
"__MUSIC__ There's some strong music today though. Justin Beiber? Adele?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah sure there are some, but those aren't the most popular."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you need to get with the times?"
"__MUSIC__ Ah maybe it's not too bad, and I'm just a nostalgic sucker."
"__MUSIC__ I agree though, I like older movements like R&B."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they sure don't make R&B anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure there's music of your genres somewhere too. They just aren't on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I don't listen to the radio much anymore. I can find my bands and singers on spotify or youtube."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Maybe the old times made better music, but you can find better music today."
"__MUSIC__ Yep."
