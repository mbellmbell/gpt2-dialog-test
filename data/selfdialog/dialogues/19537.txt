"__MOVIES__ Hi! Have you seen the movie Sausage Party?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, and I really regret it."
"__MOVIES__ I was about to say! I was an animation movies fanatic, but that movie is really disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Aside of the over-excessively lewd humor and such, the plot itself is not really interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I am glad that I did not watch it in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I watched it on netflix."
"__MOVIES__ There are so much controversies surrounding that movie too!"
"__MOVIES__ Ooohh please do tell!"
"__MOVIES__ For example, the animators are forced to work overtime with no overtime pays!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? How awful! Where did you learn about this?"
"__MOVIES__ Some websites. Also while it is rated adult in the US, it was not so in Sweden."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I forget the ratings definition. But basically kids from 7 - 11 years old can watch it wit adult supervision. Kids above 11 years old can watch it themselves!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I wonder how the parents thought after learning about the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha! Probably they have the same reactions like what we had when watching the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That is pretty interesting. I also learned that Edward Norton was one of the voice actor."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting! Which character?"
"__MOVIES__ The bagel! Remember? He is one of the sidekick!"
"__MOVIES__ Ah I remember that character! He sounded like Woody Allen!"
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha! Yes! It was Norton's idea actually to have the character to sound like Woody Allen!"
