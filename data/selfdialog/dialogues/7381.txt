"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like Lady Gaga's recent music?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's interesting, it sounds almost like country music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh right, you mean in her new song 'A Million Reasons'. It wasn't my favorite."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Which songs of her's do you prefer?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like the classics, like 'Poker Face'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yea, those are really good. Reminds me of college."
"__LADY_GAGA__ The dance songs she makes are good for partying!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ They get a little annoying after awhile though, don't you think?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yea, that's a good point. But the music videos were so cool too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love all of her costumes!"
