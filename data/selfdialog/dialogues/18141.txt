"__MOVIES__ That one movie is looking pretty good. I might go see it."
"__MOVIES__ Which one's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Despicable Me 3. I watched the first one, but I missed the second one."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you really should see the second one before the third one."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure the storyline isn't so deep that I need to watch them in order."
"__MOVIES__ Suit yourself. You enjoy animated movies?"
"__MOVIES__ It depends but yeah. Also, Steve Carell is the voice of the main character."
"__MOVIES__ I do like that guy. Especially when he was on The Office."
"__MOVIES__ Kristen Wiig is in it too. As his wife, I read."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know much about her. What other movies has she done?"
"__MOVIES__ Let me think. She was in the Ghostbusters movie, last year."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right, that movie got some flack, but really, it wasn't bad."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see it actually. Any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was different than the old Ghostbusters, but for what it was, it was pretty nice."
"__MOVIES__ Well when you put it that way, maybe I'll rent it sometime."
"__MOVIES__ I'd be down for seeing it again. I saw it in theaters when it opened."
"__MOVIES__ What about Despicable Me 3 though? Should we go see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, let's go tomorrow night."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite animted movie is still Wreck-It Ralph, though."
"__MOVIES__ Then you're in luck, my friend. That one's getting a sequel to. I'll tlel you about it on the way."
