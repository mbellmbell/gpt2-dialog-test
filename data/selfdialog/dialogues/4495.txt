"__MUSIC__ I feel like saying that rap is dead is just absurd."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Too many people are stuck in the past."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! Sure, guys like Tupac and Biggie are masters of the game, but they created quite the legacy."
"__MUSIC__ People just generalize too much."
"__MUSIC__ Right? It's like one song is enough to illustrate the whole genre to most people."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It's ridiculous, isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Like, just look at J. Cole."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, Cole is awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ He just knows how to make good rap music."
"__MUSIC__ That he does. And music with some real meaning, too."
"__MUSIC__ His song 'High for Hours' really got me thinking when I first heard it."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've heard that one. Is it new?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. He just released it at the start of the year."
"__MUSIC__ I'll definitely look it up."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song of his?"
"__MUSIC__ It definitely has to be Change. He does a great job of expressing his philosophy in that song."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. It's a very empowering song."
"__MUSIC__ If only more people thought like that."
"__MUSIC__ There'd be far less wrong with the world."
"__MUSIC__ My thoughts exactly."
