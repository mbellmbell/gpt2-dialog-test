"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because, what do the running backs do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um, they rush."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, do you need a lot of intelligence to hold on to the ball tight and run?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not what running backs do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's exactly what running backs do"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it's not. Running back to have to assess spatial relations between themselves and the defensive line, and the safeties too, That takes a lot of thinking"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, then how was Frank Gore such a great rusher?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For crying outloud. Maybe he blew off the test too. Besides, RBs score about 16. We're not talking about a 4 here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wait, so 10 is being barely literate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 20 is average, so 16 is... below... average."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahaha. I was right. This test sucks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it doesn't. Anything that provides a quatifiable information doesn't suck"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Quantify this"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's just so mature. Seriously. By taking the assessing the mental dimensions, you can improve the game a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I get that. But why publish all this though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why publish their combine data? It's just all data."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it's embarassing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is nothing embarassing about your Wonderlic score if you're in the NFL making millions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. Yeah, give me 40 million and a brain that's only capable of scoring a 10."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, no, you wouldn't be happy with that."
