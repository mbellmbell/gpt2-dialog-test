"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of the Arcadian Wild?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh... is that like a wilderness camp or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not; they're a band."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, I don't think I have. What type of music do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a folk band. The lead singer's got a really nice twang."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so like Fleet Foxes?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, definitely! They have a very similar style."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like Fleet Foxes. What songs do you recommend from this Wild band?"
"__MUSIC__ Personally, I really like Rain Clouds. It's soft and smooth and a little sad, but in a good way."
"__MUSIC__ I get that feel. Are most of their songs slow?"
"__MUSIC__ No, in fact I'd say most aren't. You can dance to 'em."
"__MUSIC__ I'm surprised I haven't heard of them. When did they start?"
"__MUSIC__ Around 2013, if memory serves. So they're not super young, but not super old either."
"__MUSIC__ Hm, okay. Are they on Spotify?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, that and YouTube and Google Play."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, cool. Do they have more than one album?"
"__MUSIC__ Just their first, and an EP."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. And what did you say their name was again--Arcade or something?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the Arcadian Wild."
"__MUSIC__ Perfect, thanks! I'll pull a few songs up right now."
