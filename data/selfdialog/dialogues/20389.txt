"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely Home."
"__MOVIES__ The one with the aliens?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one!"
"__MOVIES__ That's a kids movie."
"__MOVIES__ I beg to differ. It's a family movie. And the values are crossgenerational."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. Tell me what's so great about it."
"__MOVIES__ Well Oh, the main alien, has to overcome obstacles like not fitting in, moving to a new place, making friends, and feeling lonely."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. What else have you got for me?"
"__MOVIES__ Tip? The main human?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember her."
"__MOVIES__ She has to overcome xenophobia, trust issues, and she's also recently moved countries."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, but I still don't see why it's so great."
"__MOVIES__ It also has witty dialogue, compelling and heartwarming moments and the importance of family."
"__MOVIES__ Okay?"
"__MOVIES__ And, there are multiple female leads, the boov acknowledge over 5 genders, the main character is not American and dark skinned."
"__MOVIES__ That's actually pretty cutting edge for a children's movie."
"__MOVIES__ And, it involves a broken family."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right, it's pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely my favorite."
