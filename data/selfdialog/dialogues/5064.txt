"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't think I have but I know about them from watching their trailers on tv."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, me too.  They look okay, kind of interesting."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Didn't one of the main actors die a year or so ago?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think he did.  I think it's a little wierd that they keep making the movies and using his image in them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I totally agree with that. It's a little creepy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ On the flip side, the car chase and race seens look pretty cool."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They really do. I do like Vin Diesel too."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me too.  I'd like to see one or more of the movies just because he's in them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The newest one is called The fate of the Furious and it's got some big name actors in it."
