"__FASHION__ Did you see the stunning dresses at the MET Gala this year?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, I Absolutely adored Selena Gomez's white long gown with the knee slit, absolutely gorgeous!"
"__FASHION__ I agree. My favorite had to be Katy Perry, though. She shocked everyone in that red dreary veil and custom crimson Galliano coat."
"__FASHION__ Yes, that outfit was definitely inspiring. What also caught my eye was Bella Hadid in a tight black crystal embellished jumpsuit custom made by Alexander Wang."
"__FASHION__ Yes! Her body looked amazing in the skin tight jumpsuit and the black high heels to match were to die for!"
"__FASHION__ Absolutely, although I was also not impressed by someone who I look forward to seeing every year, Kate Hudson. She is a vision in the white flowing gown she wore by Stella McCartney but she has done this look before."
"__FASHION__ I agree. I feel that every time I see her on a carpet she is wearing a white gown. How about the men? I thought Donald Glover's Burberry suit was both elegant and sophisticated."
"__FASHION__ Yes, it was. Burberry was a popular choice that night. Matt Smith also wore a Burberry suit with an eccentric tie that looked Victorian-like but impressive."
"__FASHION__ Another one of my least favorites was Gwyneth Paltrow who wore a simple and tight one shoulder pill dress by Calvin Klein."
"__FASHION__ I agree, it was a boring choice. Her black shoes definitely clashed with the tight pink and non-flattering dress she wore."
"__FASHION__ How about Joe Jonas in custom H&M? He looked debonair as he posed in the red and black stripe finely fitted suit."
"__FASHION__ Yes, he definitely dressed to impress! I loved how him and Lena Dunham matched since they both wore red!"
"__FASHION__ I saw the picture they took together, it was hilarious. Her long red strapless gown was the exact same red as his suit. It was meant to be."
"__FASHION__ Someone who also wowed me was Kendall Jenner who showed up in a barely there gown with a black sash on the front and see-through back."
"__FASHION__ Yes, it was very risqu√© but what we expected. Her sister Kylie Jenner stunned in custom Versace in the platinum colored gown she wore."
"__FASHION__ Yes, even matching with Donatella Versace herself. They both wore metallic gowns."
"__FASHION__ Yes, I was not expecting that duo. We have to talk about Rihanna's gown which was  a pure piece of art."
"__FASHION__ Yes, she was a vision. I was surprised that small balls attached to her did not fall off as she was walking, I do not know how she kept it on the entire night!"
"__FASHION__ Yes, Rihanna's gown looked extremely uncomfortable and unwearable."
"__FASHION__ I agree, but I saw pictures of her at her after party where she changed into a more comfortable jeans and white t-shirt."
