"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Teddy Bridgewater will be back for the Vikings this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I thinkl they will do the smart thing and keep him out for another year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you think Bradford can lead them into the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He started out well last year but the rest of the league caught up with the Vikings pretty quickly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and they don't have Peterson anymore"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Peterson was overrated and they relied on him too much.  He was a great player but he never really led the team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree.  It reminded me a lot of Randy Moss from the old days.  He seemed more important than he was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides it is time to get some new looks to the offense and the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Zimmer as a whole"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he is the best coach they have had for a while, but since that is the case he is also overrated because he looks good in comparison to what they have had"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't agree, I think Zimmer has some good ideas and can inspire the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is the Vikings we are talking about you know, one of the most snakebit teams in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it could be worse, we could be Buffalo Bills fans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, thedy have to get their receiving corps to be more relevant.  Treadway has to step up and Floyd needs to at least perform."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The young defensive players have to start shaping up this year as we lost some really good veterans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, camp starts in a couple of weeks so it won't be much longer before we see what is happening"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you planning on attending this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not this year, too much to do at work, I will follow the Twitter feeds and the KFAN reports"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I will head down there for one of the weekends."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like fun!  Let me know how it went and what you saw.  See you later!"
