"__DISNEY__ Did you like Dumbo?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I did. One of disney's best in my mind."
"__DISNEY__ I loved it as well. I heard they are making a remake."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I wonder why?"
"__DISNEY__ I think disney is doing that lots in general."
"__DISNEY__ Ya these days most studios are.. nothing left originall I suppose."
"__DISNEY__ Or they are lazy to come up with new ideas."
"__DISNEY__ Ha! Maybe true. I am intriuged at a dumbo remake though."
"__DISNEY__ Well it is said to be a real life version.. kind of similar to what they did with beauty and the beast."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that maybe pretty neat! I wonder how they would manage a flying elephant... cgi probably."
