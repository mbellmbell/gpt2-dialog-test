"__MOVIES__ Tell me about this new live action Little Mermaid."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it isn't at all like the Disney version. I think it centers around a mermaid at a circus."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so no prince and princess story."
"__MOVIES__ Not that I know of. But I've heard Disney is coming out with a live action one based on their movie. Just not this year."
"__MOVIES__ Disney is doing another Frozen movie too, right?"
"__MOVIES__ They are, but not until 2019."
"__MOVIES__ That's so long! I feel like everyone will have forgotten by then."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I really thought it should've been this upcoming winter."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they would come up with more original movies rather than sequels and remakes."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Moana came out this year and I think there's one in October related to the Mexican Day of the Dead."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I hadn't heard about that. It sounds interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I looks really cute. Then again, most Disney Pixar movies are."
"__MOVIES__ How many are there now?"
"__MOVIES__ I think there are 18 that are out and one upcoming this year, next year, and the year after."
"__MOVIES__ Was Toy Story the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It is confusing now though because Frozen and Moana are in the same animation style, but they are just Disney, not Pixar."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I didn't realize that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes so I get lost as to what is just Disney and what is actually Pixar."
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite Pixar movie is Brave."
"__MOVIES__ I love that one!"
