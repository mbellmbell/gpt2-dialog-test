"__MUSIC__ What are some of your favorite Celtic Bands?"
"__MUSIC__ I was at a street festival in Michigan, and I heard a band called Blackthorn."
"__MUSIC__ What were they like?"
"__MUSIC__ They were really good. It was a really authentic sound."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right? There are so many fusion bands today that are trying to combine folk with rock."
"__MUSIC__ I really don't like when bands do that. If I want to listen to an Irish band, I want something authentic sounding."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have some Blackthorn albums?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes; I have several of them. They're an older band, so I'm not sure how much longer the guys can keep putting out music."
"__MUSIC__ What albums do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Today's the Day for Drinking, Another Round, and Nil 'na La. Its good, authentic Celtic music with good vocals and instrumentation."
"__MUSIC__ I like Blackmore's Night. They're a little more on the fusion side, but they still have an authentic sound to them."
"__MUSIC__ What are your favorite Blackmore's Night songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like 'Old Village Lanterne' and 'Renaissance Faire.' I like the longing and passion in some of these songs."
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately, a lot of songs today are lacking in that passion because they seem very cookie-cutter."
"__MUSIC__ That's especially true of the newer things you hear on the radio; it all sounds somewhat pre-programed."
"__MUSIC__ So do you prefer vocal or instrumental Celtic music."
"__MUSIC__ I often like to listen to the stuff with vocals so that I can sing along while I'm driving."
"__MUSIC__ I like to listen to the instrumental stuff and have it playing in the background while I'm working."
"__MUSIC__ Copy that! Celtic music is great because even when you're doing something, it makes you feel like you're somewhere else magical and antique!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and sometimes that place that you are imagining is far better than the place where you are!"
