"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited for football this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm always excited for football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope Matt Ryan comes back and wins it this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be cool to see. It's very possible too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's so good with making completions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, his pass accuracy is crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have never seen anything like it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope the Giants do better this year, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't see that happening."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't either. Their draft strategy was inconsistent to say the least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe they went for the first round pick tight end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, how much could that possibly contribute?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Evan Engram is good but he's just a tight end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Although, I feel like teams can't always make the huge, game-changing draft picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Not everyone is a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, I think it was a weak pick. There have to be better options."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say they definitely fell a couple ranks due to their drafting process."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still hope they do well, though. I love the Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't feel bad. I'm truly a Jets fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yikes. Yeah, they're not looking too strong."
