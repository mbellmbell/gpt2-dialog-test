"__MOVIES__ Every Christmas Eve I make sure to watch the 24-hour run of 'A Christmas Story.''"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I could pay attention to the same move over and over like that."
"__MOVIES__ It's not hard, though I usually just keep it running in the background while I'm baking or wrapping or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense. Do you watch any other Christmas movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I love 'Miracle on 34th Street.'"
"__MOVIES__ The old one or the one from the 90s?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh God...the old one! That remake was terrible. The old one is classic and is the only one in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ That bad huh?"
"__MOVIES__ It was terrible and took it to kind of a dark place in an effort to 'modernize' it."
"__MOVIES__ It's terrible when they do that and sacrifice the story."
"__MOVIES__ It really is. Plus they cut a couple of key characters. If it ain't broke don't fix it."
"__MOVIES__ Any other Christmas movies on your repertoire?"
"__MOVIES__ I never go a year with 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' 'A Charlie Brown Christmas,' and 'A Christmas Carol' with George C. Scott."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that one used to scare me as a kid!"
"__MOVIES__ Me, too. George C. Scott is so good in it but so grim. And the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is freaky."
"__MOVIES__ He reminds me of the Ring Wraiths in 'Lord of the Rings.'"
"__MOVIES__ Right?! Or a dementor from 'Harry Potter.'"
"__MOVIES__ Very Christmassy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah very. But the acting is really awesome in it."
"__MOVIES__ It's definitely stood the test of time."
