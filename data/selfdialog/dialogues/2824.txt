"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to any King Crimson?"
"__MUSIC__ They sound familiar, but I can't recall for sure. What kind of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ They are a classic progressive rock band from the same era as Yes and Pink Floyd, etc."
"__MUSIC__ I see. I like that style of music but I rarely listen to it. You don't hear it on the radio very much."
"__MUSIC__ King Crimson, in particular, is not played on the radio nearly as much as Yes and of course not as much as Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Pink Floyd is a constant thing on classic rock stations. They're really great though."
"__MUSIC__ I think King Crimson, in terms of artistic merit, is every bit as good as Pink Floyd, if not better."
"__MUSIC__ Really? How would describe their music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they have a long history going back to the '60s, so their style has varied quite a bit over the decades, as have the members of the band."
"__MUSIC__ I see. How does their classic sound compare to other bands from that era?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say it's more hard-hitting when it comes to the lyrics and vocal style, while the instrumentals are less complex, but very experimental at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like an odd mixture."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely don't sound like any other band from that era, although there is definitely a feeling of the classic progressive rock era. I would say this is mostly because of the jazz influence."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. The prog-rock groups from the classic rock period had a very jazzy sound."
"__MUSIC__ I would say in the case of King Crimson the jazz influence is even more apparent than Yes or Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ I don't listen to much jazz to be honest. After a few minutes it gets kind of monotonous or just uninteresting."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. Jazz has a lot of long improv solos that are good, but they don't keep you engaged like a well-constructed song does."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah - The long jam sessions sort of lose your attention, but the music is good for ambience, especially in coffee shops."
"__MUSIC__ True. If you're trying to expand your musical taste into progressive rock, though, King Crimson is a must. They are considered one of the most important bands of that era."
"__MUSIC__ I'm definitely interested in that kind of music, and I probably have heard them but just cant recall any of their songs at the moment."
