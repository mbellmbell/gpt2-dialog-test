"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So football season is almost upon us once again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh.  Yeah I know.  Time to become a football widow again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I kind of like watching sometimes.  I like the Steelers they have some great players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers are the Cincinnati team right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think that's the Bengals.  The Steelers are from Pittsburgh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah that's right.  Wasn't there an ohio team who started in Cincinnati first and then moved?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think it was the Cleveland Browns maybe?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think the Browns are a very good team are they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I don't think they have won a game in like 30 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No surely it hasn't been that long!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it's probably been more recent than that.  But they don't give up, they just keep going."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah you have to admire their stamina despite almost always losing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  They are truly the underdogs and when they finally do win the super bowl, or even get to go, it's going to be epic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see that ever happening. It might, but I wouldn't get your hopes up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be great to see a team that hardly ever wins go out there and win it all one season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that would almost make me want to watch football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right! All the predictability makes it almost boring to watch.  Like where is the fun with all the stats?  It's like you already know who is going to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does take a little of the surprise out of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, our husbands would love to hear us talking like this!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but let's never tell them, then they will want us to watch the games with them."
