"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am getting excited about football season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're getting excited about football?  It is the beginning of July."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rookie camp starts in two weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rookie camp?  Come on man, that's not that exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is to me. I can't help but think of all the effort that these guys put out to get to that spot and I get excited for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're a good fan. Any predictions for this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I predict the Patriots do not win the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really, so who is going to win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Pittsburgh Steelers, that's who!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because they have more talent on offense than anybody.  Roethlisberger, AB, LeVeon and now Martavis is back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the offense is strong but I think defense wins football games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The defense will be better too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because Cam Heyward and Bud Dupree are both injury free."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's really the key isn't it.  I mean, staying healthy that is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is the most important thing of all.  I can't even begin to tell you how many games have turned on injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Games have turned and unfortunately, so have careers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I know, it is the worst part of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Always terrible to see."
