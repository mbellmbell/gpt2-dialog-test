"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, did you see the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I did."
"__STAR_WARS__ Cool, did you have any problems with it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I thought the whole Solo's son goes bad was a little unoriginal, I mean the old Expanded Universe did the same thing with Jacen Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, true. I always thought that was kind of hokey and unnessecary."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, I mean what is Solo-Skywalker clan cursed or something, every generation someone seems to go to the dark side., whether owned by DIsney or not."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's about the size of it, any other issues?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I didn't like them killing off Han Solo, but at least they did it well."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true and think about it, Harrison Ford is a really big name in movies, so he's probably pretty expensive to have."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, his career took off after Star Wars, but Mark Hamil didn't do nearly as well."
