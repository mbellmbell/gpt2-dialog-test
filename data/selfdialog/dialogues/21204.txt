"__THRILLER__ So, okay, I'm back. Night at the Opera was... interesting, so I guess I'll ask you about Hitchcock."
"__THRILLER__ There are four supposed go-to classics here: Vertigo, North by Northwest, Rear Window, and Psycho. All are good, but go with Psycho."
"__THRILLER__ Okay, yeah, sure. That makes sense... but, let me brace myself here... why?"
"__THRILLER__ It changed the way that movies are made. Before Psycho, movies were made with the assumption that people would wander in and out of the theater, so they had to be able to pick it up at any point and follow it."
"__THRILLER__ Seriously? I... guess that would explain a few things, though."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, totally. So Psycho had a whole publicity campaign where they wouldn't let people in after the movie started, in case they got confused by the story structure."
"__THRILLER__ So, it's a weird structure?"
"__THRILLER__ By today's standards, maybe not so much. But, for 1960 it was a total shocker."
"__THRILLER__ Is this some Inception stuff?"
"__THRILLER__ No. It's just... don't get too attached to anyone."
