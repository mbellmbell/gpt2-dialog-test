"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't, but I liked the first three."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't like the fourth one, because Will and Elizabeth weren't in it."
"__DISNEY__ It was the same for me. The first three had very good characters."
"__DISNEY__ Davy Jones and his entire ship were really creepy, though."
"__DISNEY__ That's true, but it made him a good villain."
"__DISNEY__ Barbossa wasn't as creepy, I ended up liking him a lot!"
"__DISNEY__ The scenes with all of the pirates fighting together in the third movie were my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I especially liked that Elizabeth ended up with her own ship during that battle."
"__DISNEY__ She also was the pirate queen!"
