"__MUSIC__ I've been into contemporary classical music lately."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I bought The Essential Yo-Yo Ma, and I've just been listening to it over and over and over."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about it so much?"
"__MUSIC__ He's got a great range of styles. He can do western and eastern music equally well."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like something I'd like."
"__MUSIC__ Probably. I've discovered it's really tough to find artists that do classical stuff that I like."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. What else are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of downtempo hip-hop, some post-rock, anything I can find that's ambient."
"__MUSIC__ So stuff like Explosions in the Sky?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly that sort of thing. Anything calm or relaxing."
"__MUSIC__ Why are you so attracted to music that's like that."
"__MUSIC__ Most of the time, when I listen to music, I'm also doing some kind of work."
"__MUSIC__ So it doesn't distract you."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it just kind of lulls me into a rhythm."
"__MUSIC__ I wish I could work like that. My brain is too active."
"__MUSIC__ So what do you listen to when you're working then?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly up-beat pop songs. They make me feel peppy."
"__MUSIC__ That would distract me so much!"
"__MUSIC__ Different strokes for different folks, I guess."
