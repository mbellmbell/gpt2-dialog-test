"__DISNEY__ Have you noticed how it's... kind of hard to find a Disney movie without some kind of obvious racism in it?"
"__DISNEY__ I, um. Which movies are we talking about?"
"__DISNEY__ Like, almost all of them. Have you seen Dumbo lately?"
"__DISNEY__ Not in the last few hours, no."
"__DISNEY__ There's that whole opening sequence with the black workers and the song they sing -- and then toward the end, those crows... Jesus."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm. I don't really remember any of this. I'll have to take a look, later."
"__DISNEY__ It's painful, seriously. And what about Lady and the Tramp, with the Siamese cats, and the Italians?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, those cats creeped me out as a kid. Yeah, uh."
"__DISNEY__ They're well-done, but boy is that stuff problematic."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I see what you mean."
