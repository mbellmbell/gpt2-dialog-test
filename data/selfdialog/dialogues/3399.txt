"__MUSIC__ Do you ever go back and listen to really nostalgic music from your past?"
"__MUSIC__ I love doing that."
"__MUSIC__ I was just listening to Taking Back Sunday's first CD the other day."
"__MUSIC__ I used to play that CD constantly."
"__MUSIC__ I had completely forgotten about it until I saw it in my old memory box."
"__MUSIC__ I used to listen to them and Brand New on repeat for hours."
"__MUSIC__ Brand New was amazing too. Remember Saosin?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually saw them live once."
"__MUSIC__ Their vocalist made a new band called Circa Survive afterwards."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Saosin replaced him with another guy."
"__MUSIC__ Who did you see them live with?"
"__MUSIC__ It was at the Van's Warped tour, so there was a lot of bands."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the flyer for those events are always filled with bands."
"__MUSIC__ That type of music isn't as popular as it used to be, though."
"__MUSIC__ That's very true."
"__MUSIC__ Everything is going electronic now."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's a good and a bad thing."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. New music sounds great but sometimes you miss having real instruments."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah the quality of recordings is crazy now."
"__MUSIC__ Although some people are deciding to stick with the more vintage stuff, I've noticed."
