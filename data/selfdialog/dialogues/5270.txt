"__STAR_WARS__ Hi, have you seen the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean the new ones or the old ones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The new ones in theaters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah! I saw Force Awakens, but I haven't seen Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh! You have to watch Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I didn't really like Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ What! How couldn't you. It was so good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I've never been a die hard Star Wars fan."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me neither but trust me, it gets good at Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, let's watch it some time."
