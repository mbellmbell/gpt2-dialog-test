"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the last Spurs game against the Warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I did, do you think that the Spurs are going to go on to the next round?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I really hope so, the Spurs are my team but it seems like they can never beat the warriors!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I know it, especially since Tony Parker is out for the rest of the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Last year in the playoffs the Spurs put up a good fight but they just couldn't get past those warriors"
"__BASKETBALL__ Last year they had Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing in the playoffs and they couldnt beat the warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ I was at work last night so I couldnt catch that game, was Kawai in the game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No he didnt play, hes still out, I even heard that hell be out for this whole round in the playoffs!"
"__BASKETBALL__ What, they are going to keep him out for that long!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Thats what I read this morning, I guess ankle injuries are pretty serious so it would be easy to do further damage if he plays too soon."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh my gosh thats terrible! What are they going to do without Tony and Kawai?"
"__BASKETBALL__ So I guess you didnt hear about David Lee either?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No I didn't what happened to Lee?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well he fell in the first quarter and injured his knee, it looks like he will be out for a while too!"
"__BASKETBALL__ So this means we have lost to the Warriors three times in a row, if we lose one more time we are out of the finals!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Thats right, and the past two games they've beat us pretty bad, 100-136 and 108-120."
"__BASKETBALL__ The first game wasn't so bad, I think we only lost by two points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Your right but we had Kawai was in that first game up until the third quarter."
"__BASKETBALL__ I read that Zaza Pachulia from the warriors purposefully slid his foot under Kawais foot to make him fall and injure him."
"__BASKETBALL__ I heard the same thing too but I hope that its not true, talk about bad karma!"
