"__DISNEY__ Do you like old or new Disney movies better?"
"__DISNEY__ I would have to say old, because I grew up on them."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, and I haven't seen many of the new ones."
"__DISNEY__ I really liked 'The Emperor's New Clothes' - that was my favorite of the newer Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ Incredible to think 'The Lion King' is almost 25 years old, and that's not one of the oldest."
"__DISNEY__ Right - there's some from the 1940s that I still play for my kids."
"__DISNEY__ That's the definition of timeless, really."
"__DISNEY__ Even the humor stands the test of time. My kids love old Disney just as much as new Disney."
"__DISNEY__ And the animation has improved but kept the same style, which I just love."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly - there's a typical, iconic 'Disney style'."
