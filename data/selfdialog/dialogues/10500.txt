"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So many of my friends went to Ultra Music Festival this year in Miami. It looks great but it didn't play the type of music I like."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What type of music do you like?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I like rap / hip-hop music. I wish I could go to a big music festival that was mainly rap artists."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Actually there are a few music festivals with mainly rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I have only heard of parties, but I'm referring to huge outdoor festivals with thousands of people."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know. You should check out Summer Jam in New Jersey"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ When is it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It happens ever summer. One year I went and it had an amazing line-up including Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean, Joey Badass, 50 Cent, Remy Ma and more"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow that sounds like a great line-up full of great rappers"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Another one is Urban Beach Week in Miami, but I've never attended."
