"__HARRY_POTTER__ So what did Harry think Sirius was really going to do if he lived?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't think Harry even thought that far. He has delusions of grandeur."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Totally. Sirius was just a regular guy, not a white knight."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess to Harry everything was better than the Dursley's."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He really doesn't realize how good he had it there. I mean he got everything he needed plus the protection from his mother."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're right. He never does seem truly grateful for them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It could have been much worse."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know. He could have lived with all those kids at the Weasley's."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry even eventually got his own room."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was nice too. They eventually left him alone and let him do his thing."
