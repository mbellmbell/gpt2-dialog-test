"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you see the new Fast and Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Fast 8, yeah it was good."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What was your favorite part?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought the part with him fighting people while having the baby wear headphones was funny."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah that was funny, but why did he put the headphones on full blast?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't know."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you ever accidentally had the volume real loud on some headphones? It's aweful. Can't be good for a baby."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No you're right. What about the camera in the necklace? How did Dom know how to do all that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't know, he's Dom. He can do anything. He grew up just a street racer, but now can take down international terrorists."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ True. I guess your right. Just don't think too hard about it."
