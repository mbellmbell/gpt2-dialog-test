"__MUSIC__ Let's keep it going with covers"
"__MUSIC__ Man, you never get tired of this subject do you?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, not really, but it's more music in general that I never get tired of.  Now, more covers you did!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, let's see... 'Nothing's Gonna Stand in Our Way' by Spectre General aka Kick Axe."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I don't think I've even heard of that group."
"__MUSIC__ Will they're mainly known for being a big part of the transformers movie soundtrack.  The ORIGINAL cartoon movie from the 80s, not the Michael Bay stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, a minute, I've seen that movie, I bet if i heard the song again, I'd probably remember it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they use three of their songs in the movie.  Anyway, this one's a cover from an older 70s hit.  The original is just kind.. bland really."
"__MUSIC__ Bland?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I just don't care for it.  Granted, I'm biased I heard the KA version looong before I even knew it was a cover of something else, but still."
"__MUSIC__ So, why does the band have two names?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they're actual name is Kick Axe, but I guess when they were doing the soundtrack they were worried that parents might object to the band's name, so the changed it to Spectre General."
"__MUSIC__ I have to admit, Spectre General does have a bit of cleverness to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I can't help but wonder if the band was all, 'No one who seems the movie is going to know who we REALLY are!  This stinks!'"
"__MUSIC__ Dunno.. not sure how big of a box office hit the original transformers was..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah... so, another cover?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I liked 'Video KIlled the Radio Star' by Presidents of the USA."
"__MUSIC__ Where have I heard that?"
"__MUSIC__ The played on the credits to The Wedding Singer"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah!  That wasn't too bad!"
