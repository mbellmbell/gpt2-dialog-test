"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see Panic Room?"
"__THRILLER__ A long time ago, I did."
"__THRILLER__ Seems like it's one of the last films I've seen with Jodie Foster."

"__THRILLER__ I always thought the idea was kind of weird.  The room wouldn't really protect you."

"__THRILLER__ It would also be very costly to put one in!"
