"__MOVIES__ What would you say is your favorite sci-fi movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a really tough question.  What's yours?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say 'Terminator.'"
"__MOVIES__ I love that franchise.  Genre-defining stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, in that case, I have a more difficult question.  Which 'Terminator' movie is the best?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to go with 'T2: Judgment Day.'  I loved everything about that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Good choice.  The fact that the very villain from the first movie ends up being the savior was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ That was such a cool twist."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the T-1000 as the main villain?"
"__MOVIES__ One of the scariest villains in film.  I remember not being able to go to bed after watching the movie for the first time when I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Robert Patrick was the perfect person for the role."
"__MOVIES__ Arnold of course was great too."
"__MOVIES__ He really was.  What do you think about the other Terminator movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I really liked the first one too.  T3 was a bit weak."
"__MOVIES__ T3 didn't do it for me either.  Neither did any of the rebooted ones."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington was sort of boring."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, but I think it was actually better than the newest one; 'Genisys.'"
"__MOVIES__ 'Genisys' was a bit of a mess.  What did you think about Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well as much as I like Emilia Clarke, I don't think the script allowed her to exercise her full acting range."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  I hope that if they do make another one, she gets a second chance as Sarah Connor."
