"__POP__ Do you like pop music?"
"__POP__ Yes, I don't mind it. It isn't my favorite genre but it is catchy."
"__POP__ Anything in particular that you like?"
"__POP__ Well, I grew up in the 90s so I'm partial to the late 90s/early 2000s pop."
"__POP__ Oh, so you are into the boy bands and the teen idols."
"__POP__ I guess you can say that. I mean, who can really turn down Backstreet Boys or N*Sync?"
"__POP__ If you say so! I like the more recent music like Bruno Mars, Pharrel, and Ariana Grande."
"__POP__ That's definitely not my style. Give me some Spice Girls and Britney Spears, though, and I'll be happy."
"__POP__ I'd love the Spice Girls to make a return."
"__POP__ That would be amazing. They did it once, but unfortunately just for a short time."
