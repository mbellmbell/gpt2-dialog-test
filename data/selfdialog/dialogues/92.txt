"__MUSIC__ What is the greatest song from the 1980s?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a tough one. Rock or Pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Anything. Whatever you think is the best song."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Something by Wham?"
"__MUSIC__ You're not really trying. Try to think of a song that encapsulates the whole decade."
"__MUSIC__ Thriller by Michael Jackson?"
"__MUSIC__ A worthy choice. It had an awesome video, but I am not sure the song itself stands up."
"__MUSIC__ It's still fun to dance to."
"__MUSIC__ I am not saying that it is not. It just doesn't seem like the anthem of the 1980s to me."
"__MUSIC__ This is hard, there were too many things going on in the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, we had the cold war, denim, the british invasion, punk rock, heavy metal, hair bands, power ballads, rap and hip-hop going mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ So much stuff. How can one song capture it all."
"__MUSIC__ I am not sure. That's your challenge."
"__MUSIC__ How about Born in the USA. It captured post Vietnam Americana with hints of Folk and Rock, all wrapped up in a denim jacket."
"__MUSIC__ Good Choice, but I don't think we are there yet."
"__MUSIC__ Winds of Change by the Scorpions?"
"__MUSIC__ A post cold-war power ballad by a hair band. It captured the emotions of a generation. However, it came out in 1990"
"__MUSIC__ What? What about We didn't start the Fire by Billy Joel? It cover's every topic up to 1989."
"__MUSIC__ True, but it's not solely 1980s. The correct answer is We are the World."
"__MUSIC__ Every 1980s pop and rock star standing together for charity? Okay, I concede. You win."
