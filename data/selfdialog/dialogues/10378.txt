"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Did you see the recent claim by that Rolling Stone writer that Bob Dylan invented hip hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I did. What did you think about it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I honestly thought it was really inaccurate. While Dylan's music shares elements with hip hop, lyricism, subject matter, sing-talking, etc., he didn't invent it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Agreed. Hip-hop has its origins much earlier than Dylan in African-American music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I think it's attributing a little too much to Bob Dylan's influence. The man already has enough recognition."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right! He just got a Nobel Peace Prize."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Bob Dylan certainly never did anything like an MC before hip-hop. He didn't use samples, he didn't DJ, he didn't strut around the stage like a rapper."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, the comparison is honestly a little too much for me to handle. It's like the writer who made it doesn't know much about hip hop."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, he probably just knows some of the bigger artists and seminal records."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, and then he just makes connections based on similarities he hears that are historically without basis."
