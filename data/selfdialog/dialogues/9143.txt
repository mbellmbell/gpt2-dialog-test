"__BASEBALL__ Do you think AJ Cole can hold down the 5th rotation slot for the Nats?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's pitching well, I don't see why not."
"__BASEBALL__ Ross is on his way back, that's why I'm asking."
"__BASEBALL__ Is he? Last I saw he was struggling in the minors. Hard to call that 'on his way back.'"
"__BASEBALL__ You never know with Dusty Baker."
"__BASEBALL__ That's the truth. The way Dusty treats pitchers I wouldn't be surprised if the last healthy arm won."
"__BASEBALL__ Haha. Yeah. I like Cole though, I just hope he stays healthy."
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely a lot of promise for Cole and all things considered I don't see a reason why he can't take this opportunity and run with it."
"__BASEBALL__ Roark was in a similar position and it worked out."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep. And some think Cole is even more highly regarded than Roark was at that time."
"__BASEBALL__ Even if Ross does come back healthier that's not a bad problem to have though."
"__BASEBALL__ Got that right. Nats have a solid staff as is."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, bullpen is a little iffy but the starters are all pretty solid quality."
"__BASEBALL__ Scherzer is a monster. Strasburg when he's going strong is unhittable. Thats a 1-2 punch right there."
"__BASEBALL__ Gio Gonzalez is not bad either. At least right now he's looking like his old self."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I always forget Gio, was still thinking Zimmerman even though I know he's gone."
"__BASEBALL__ Gotta keep up with Mets pitching in our division."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they're another solid staff but there's some muck in the works with Harvey and still not sure about the back end."
"__BASEBALL__ Right but they have the depth that can figure it out over the course of the year, I see them as comparable with us maybe even a little better."
"__BASEBALL__ Right. When you guys play a series there's some good matchups on the hill."
