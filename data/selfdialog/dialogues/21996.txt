"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ Who hasn't seen that movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Well what did you think about it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well at first I hated it but then I learned to really appreciate it."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was too much of a basic storyline."
"__DISNEY__ No way! It was the first Disney movie to star two female leads that weren't going after a man."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, but they could've done without that stupid song, what was it called?"
"__DISNEY__ Let it Go, which is what you should do."
"__DISNEY__ That song wont get out of my head now!"
"__DISNEY__ Yet another reason as to why it was such a good movie, it stays with you!"
