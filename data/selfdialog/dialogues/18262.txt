"__MOVIES__ I think that Joe Dante might be one of the most underrated directors out there."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know who that is off the top of my head."
"__MOVIES__ Just goes to show what I'm talking about. He directed Gremlins!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh. I thought Gremlins was a Spielberg film?"
"__MOVIES__ In a way it was. He executive produced it, and his production company made it, but it was a Joe Dante film."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that explains why I associated it with him."
"__MOVIES__ Dante also directed the sequel, which is brilliant in its own right."
"__MOVIES__ The sequel is so weird compared to the original!"
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of the point. He knew he couldn't top the first one, so he decided to take it in a different direction."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty smart, actually."
"__MOVIES__ He also did Matinee. Have you seen that?"
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It stars John Goodman, and it's about a filmmaker in the 1960s who wants to use the fear of the Cold War to make his new horror film the scariest ever."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a horror film?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a comedy. It's kind of different, but it's pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like he makes a lot of pretty different kinds of comedies."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, he also did Small Soldiers, for example."
"__MOVIES__ Now that I have seen! That is another weird comedy!"
"__MOVIES__ It is, but like all of his movies, it's pretty great."
"__MOVIES__ You know what? I think you're right, he is pretty underrated!"
