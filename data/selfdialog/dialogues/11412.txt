"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will have great season in the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Packers, Patriots, and Rams will have good years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think the Rams will be decent?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they have a new location and a decent QB now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their QB is unproven, but we will see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also think the Bengals has a shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds iffy, too. Why do you think this?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense has always been stout."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also have a good home field advantage in the cold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they do, as do the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Aaron Rogers will win MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see, I think Brady has a shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady has won it too many times!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that is because he is so great!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he has definitely deserved them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see I guess - anything is possible with Belichick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Raiders will be interesting this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they lost their QB at the wrong moment last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he's healed up and ready to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will be, but we will see. Go Raiders!"
