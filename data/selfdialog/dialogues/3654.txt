"__MUSIC__ You ever been to the jungle?"
"__MUSIC__ Naw, what do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ The Amazon, never been to the rainforest?"
"__MUSIC__ No, why?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm still having these sounds come to my mind since last month.."
"__MUSIC__ Really? From the jungle?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, these animal sounds, these bird calls, these crickets and frogs at night."
"__MUSIC__ It's stuck in your head?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! All in minor notes. Nature's sounds are all in minor notes, like a symphony, like God's song in A minor."
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha, you're nuts. So what made you come up with this?"
"__MUSIC__ Minor notes are just a slight key off in a pentatonic scale."
"__MUSIC__ You mean like the Blues and Jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ You ever notice? You remember the Jungle Book by Disney? King Louie? 'Well I'm the King of the Swingers oh..'"
"__MUSIC__ 'The Jungle VIP..' Yep, is that with minors?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely, the whole thing is. Also, watch 'The Emerald Forest' by John Boorman from the 80's, great minors in the soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ So where do you think minor notes came from, nature?"
"__MUSIC__ I bet so. Maybe it originally came from African work songs which in turn came from the minor note buzzing of the Congo."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's deep. The forest in a minor scale."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, God's choice for his music scale all blend for nature's harmony."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, you're absolutely crazy."
