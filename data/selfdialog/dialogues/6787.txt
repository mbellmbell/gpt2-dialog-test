"__STAR_WARS__ Were you disappointed that little Anakin Skywalker turned out to be Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, because he started out as a cute kid with a happy personality."
"__STAR_WARS__ His character was so fun and likable in Phantom Menace especially during and after the pod race!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it when he was older in Attack of Clones and was romantically interested in Padme and she in him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, right! You could totally see them getting together. Hayden Christensen is a very handsome young man."
"__STAR_WARS__ What happened to him? Why did he go to the Dark Side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it had something to do with his separation from his mother and the huge fear he had of losing Padme."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think you're right. That fear in him, the kind that makes people do irrational things, turned him to the Dark Side."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so glad George Lucas came out with prequel series otherwise we would have had no idea why Darth Vader said, 'Luke, I am your father'!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too! The Star Wars series has been one of my favorites since they started back in the mid-1970s."
