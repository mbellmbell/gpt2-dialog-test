"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready to watch my Giants dominate this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! The Eagles are definitely going all the way this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You say that every year! Last year you didn't even make the playoffs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was then, this is now. We have Alshon Jeffrey, Torrey Smith, and LeGarrette Blount. You're going to see a brand new offense this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But we have Odell Beckam Jr, Sherling Shepard, and we just got Brandon Marshall. You can't compete with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, if you're so confident let's see you put your money where your mouth is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I should be asking you that question. I'm always confident in my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, so let's bet. $100 says the Eagles will make it further than your Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, you have yourself a deal. Be ready to pay up!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way man, you're the one that's going to have to pay up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. We'll see what happens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Trust me, it's going to happen. And we're definitely dominating the Cowboys this year too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We beat the Cowboys twice last year, I'm not worried about them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That last one was a close game, I wouldn't get so cocky if I were you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not being cocky, just being confident. Dez Bryant had a great year, there's no denying that. But he's still a rookie and has a lot to learn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can agree with that, he definitely has a lot to learn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm interested to see how he performs this year, but like I said I'm confident in my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So am I! I can feel it, this is going to be the year for my Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really do live in a fantasy world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see about that come September."
