"__STAR_WARS__ Was there a part of The Force Awakens that you didn't like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh there were lots I didn't like!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which part did you dislike the most?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it was when Han Solo tried to talk to Kylo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was such a twist to find out he was their son!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I was so shocked!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I totally hate what happened!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I can't believe Kylo Ren tricked Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am just hoping Han Solo is still alive."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish that as well but I don't know if that will happen."
