"__MOVIES__ So did you see the new Beauty and the Best movie with Emma Watson?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say that's a hard question."
"__MOVIES__ Hard question how come?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I do love Emma Watson, but a live action remake seems strange to me."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it has gotten a lot of good reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Still, I'm not sure I want to see it. I loved the animated version years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Same here it was amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ I just worry about if they are going to be true the animated story."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that they did but with slight differences."
"__MOVIES__ Well maybe we should give it a try?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep you never know, we may love it."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good I will meet you at the theater at seven tomorrow."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Oh and maybe after we can catch the late movie?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you have in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's go from  Disney to alien sci fi horror!"
"__MOVIES__ Hey that's right Alien Covenant is playing right after."
"__MOVIES__ That move looks so cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Danny McBride is starting I it."
"__MOVIES__ He is such a great actor. Surprised to see him not doing comedy."
"__MOVIES__ True,  it is strange but I know he will be wonderful in it."
