"__HORROR__ What types of horror movies are your favorite?"

"__HORROR__ What do you consider classics?"
"__HORROR__ You know the ones with Jason, Freddy and Michael Myers."
"__HORROR__ Oh yeah, those are cool. Who is your favorite killer?"
"__HORROR__ I'd have to say Michael Myers, he was always so cool about it."
"__HORROR__ Yeah,  He had a silence that was creepy yet intriguing.   Who is your favorite?"
"__HORROR__ I liked Freddy, mainly cause he was funny at the same time and deadly."
"__HORROR__ I see that,  He did crack a few jokes."
"__HORROR__ But of course Jason was always smooth for his kills, and no matter how fast they ran he caught up to them with his slow walk."
