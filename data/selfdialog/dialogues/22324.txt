"__DISNEY__ Yes and I really liked it, although my nephews thought the lava monster was a little scary."
"__DISNEY__ haha I could see that. I didn't really know much about Hawaiian culture."
"__DISNEY__ Me either, it was interesting to see Maui come to life."
"__DISNEY__ Ya I think Dwane Johnson did great in that role."
"__DISNEY__ Definiatey different from his most recent roles thats for sure!"
"__DISNEY__ I know right... I loved him as Maui.. who knew?!!?"
"__DISNEY__ And you're right it was really interesting to see the Hawaiian culture and their legends of creationism and gods."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I had no idea, it made me want to learn more and visit Hawaii of course!"
"__DISNEY__ We should totally plan a trip... because 'One day I'll know, how far I'll go'..."
