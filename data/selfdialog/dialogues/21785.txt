"__DISNEY__ Did you know that certain Disney movies are available on Hulu now?!?"
"__DISNEY__ No way! That's all I used to watch growing up!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too. They have Hercules on there which is one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ You know Hercules is what got me into greek mythology..."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that but I totally get it. They had so many different characters in it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I was a big fan of Hades too! Haha!"
"__DISNEY__ He was so funny and sarcastic!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah and the sidekicks, Pain and Panic, were funny too!"
"__DISNEY__ I really liked Meg too. I think I related to her a bit when I was growing up. She came off so cool!"
"__DISNEY__ She was super cool! No damsel in distress there."
