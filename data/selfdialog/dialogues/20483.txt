"__MOVIES__ What do you think of the DC Cinematic Universe?"
"__MOVIES__ It's aggravating. I wish the movies were either better or worse."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean? Why would you want them to be worse?"
"__MOVIES__ Well as it is they're just a notch below mediocre, so I can't really work up and justified rage about them. They're kind of disappointing, but not so bad that it's fun to make fun of them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I see what you mean. I don't know why they keep trying to do the grim dark stuff."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's because most Hollywood people think superheroes are stupid and childish, but if they can make a dark movie they can at least pretend they're making a deep movie."
"__MOVIES__ These movies are lovely dark and deep? Is this your Robert Frost theory of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think there's a psychological association there. If they make everything dark and broody they can say 'see, this isn't a kids movie, that would be bright and cheerful'."
"__MOVIES__ But kids movies aren't always bright and cheerful. Don't like half of Disney movies involve one or more dead parents?"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, I said there was psychology involved, not intelligence."
"__MOVIES__ OK, good point. But the Marvel movies tend to be more bright and fun. Why aren't they just copying that?"
"__MOVIES__ Because everyone went crazy for the Nolan Batman movies, and they're trying to catch that lightning in a bottle again."
"__MOVIES__ But that only works because he's Batman, you can't just do every superhero movie like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you know that, but that's because you understand superheroes. The Hollywood people don't."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, OK. But still, hasn't everyone been telling them that the movies are too dark and offputting?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it's the sunk cost fallacy, they've already spent millions on their current stupid vision, they'll maybe make minor tweaks, but I think it's a hard battleship to turn."
"__MOVIES__ From the trailer the Wonder Woman movie looked good, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that circles back to what I meant about hoping they get better, even the bad ones have the seeds of ideas that could work. A World War I period piece with Wonder Woman could be great."
"__MOVIES__ So you're getting hyped?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm trying not to, because even though it could be great, if we look at the track record the odds that it will be are low. And I don't want to get disappointed again."
