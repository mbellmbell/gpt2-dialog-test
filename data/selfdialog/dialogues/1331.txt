"__MUSIC__ The independent pop scene is getting pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ So there is actually an indie-pop movement, and in the UK?"
"__MUSIC__ Indie-pop actually originated in the UK."
"__MUSIC__ And is it pop music or alt-rock, in this case?"
"__MUSIC__ Indie pop actually combines alternative rock with pop."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. The alt-rock of the late 80s and early 90s started blending in pop music elements."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and the blending in of pop music increased over time."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Early 90s bands like Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains sounded more like hard rock compared to the later alternative rock."
"__MUSIC__ Going towards pop music seems like a natural evolution for rock. Pop has more mainstream appeal, anyways."
"__MUSIC__ And indie groups are getting more popular. I think people are disillusioned with 'rock stars'"
"__MUSIC__ Indie is where it's at."
"__MUSIC__ How does indie-pop sound compared to alt-rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it has less of that harsh sound and less of the angsty lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ That I like. I think too much punk rock/alternative rock is about rebellion and dischord."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Sometimes I just want music that makes me feel good to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. That's why I like classical music: not as much downing lyrics that I don't always jive with."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you have a listen right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. Go ahead and play it."
"__MUSIC__ So how much did you enjoy the music?"
"__MUSIC__ It sounds really nice. It does sound like softer rock, but it has an independent and British sound that gives it flavor."
