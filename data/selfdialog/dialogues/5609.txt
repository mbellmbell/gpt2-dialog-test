"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever seen The Empire Strikes Back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably, which one is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's the one where, Darth Vader says, 'Luke, I am your father'."
"__STAR_WARS__ Actually, that's not what he says."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course it is, everyone knows that line."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, it's wrong. He says 'No, I am your father.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well whatever, have you seen it or not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope, but I read about that quote."
