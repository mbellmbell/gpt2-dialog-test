"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, watching the Browns last year was rough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were just inept, weren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They just had no talent anywhere on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their QB play was horrendous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, didn't matter who they threw out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't they have the one guy from Washington?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean RG3?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's the guy I was thinking of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he played a few games for them.  I thought he got injured again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't surprise me.  Dude gets injured every game I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their other QB's were all garbage though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everything about them was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense was atrocious too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they've drafted a lot of new guys though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they have.  Their front office is all about analytics."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean finding guys who might not fit a profile but can ball?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  Might not be the right height or weight, but are good players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll have to see how that pans out for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, give them two or three more years before you proclaim judgment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That division's a tough one though."
