"__MOVIES__ What is the best movie you've seen lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw 'Hunt For The Wilder People.' Did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Sam Neil is in it. I think it takes place in New Zealand. It's kind of coming of age movie."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting..."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of those with this really off beat kid that ends up with Sam Neil and their relationship."
"__MOVIES__ There has to be more to it than that. Is it funny? Sad? What?"
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty funny. Sometimes it's dry humor. Maybe a little heart touching too. I don't want to give it away but you should see."
"__MOVIES__ You gotta give me more than that."
"__MOVIES__ The scenery is beautiful. The struggles the kid goes through are typical. It will remind you of being a kid."
"__MOVIES__ So thankful that I am grown up now..."
"__MOVIES__ No doubt. This kid, Ricky is so fun. He's an obese, off beat kid that you just like. He has aspects that are annoying and endearing."
"__MOVIES__ You know I think I saw the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, the great trailer....it just a series of kind of weird things that happen. It's hard to explain."
"__MOVIES__ But you really liked it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it reminded me of 'Son of Rambo.' Did you see that one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, is it similar?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, coming of age...2 friends....one is obsessed with Rambo. It's hysterical. Just feel good all around."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like that might be good too. I'll have to look for it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, while you're at it, look for 'Moonrise Kingdom.' I need the feel good escape and these are great."
