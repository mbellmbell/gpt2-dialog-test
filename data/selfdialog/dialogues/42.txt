"__MUSIC__ Hey, girl! I wanted to see if you wanted to go see Matchbox 20 and the Counting Crows in concert with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, those are two great band from our younger days! I would love to go, when is it?"
"__MUSIC__ They are coming to Nashville on August 12th. I think we should go ahead and get tickets now, so we can get good seats."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely, how much are the tickets?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, depends on how close you want to be. I know I would like to get great seats."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! So, near the stage, how much?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought that would be what you wanted too, so I already checked. They will be about 125.00 each, but we will be almost close enough to touch them!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, sounds good to me! Two great bands, so we can't beat it."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite song that Matchbox 20 sings? I have a couple."
"__MUSIC__ I love 3 AM, it really brings back memories. But, I also really love If You're gone."
"__MUSIC__ Those are my two top favorites too! I guess they were so popular back in those days."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but we can go back a little bit in time when we go see them. What about the Counting Crows, do you like them too?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yes! Not as much as Matchbox 20, but they are pretty close."
"__MUSIC__ I really like their song, A long December. It's one of their best."
"__MUSIC__ It is, but I think Mr. Jones is their best. It is so upbeat and lively."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you're right! I had forgotten they sang it but it's awesome."
"__MUSIC__ So, you want me to go ahead and grab the tickets while there are still some good seats?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, we better or we will be stuck so far back we won't know who is playing!"
"__MUSIC__ Girl, I'm excited, I can't wait for August to get here!"
"__MUSIC__ Me either! We can make a day of it, go shopping, eat a nice meal and finish it off with an awesome concert!"
