"__STAR_WARS__ Which movie did you like better, 'The Force Awakens' or 'The Last Jedi'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, they were both good, but I think that 'The Last Jedi' is really my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because it really explains the back story well, but does it in broad strokes"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean by broad strokes?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, for example, if you take the two not-so-good Star Wars flicks, you know, the prequels with Jar-Jar Binks"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yes, those were awful!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, one of the reasons they were awful (besides some horrible dialogue and insipid acting) was that they felt the need to explain everything to you."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't you want to know what actually happens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but not down to the tiniest detail.  I want to be able to use my imagination to fill in some stuff.  Those movies didn't let you.  'The Last Jedi', along with good actors (nobody's cousin got a job on this one) had a great story line."
