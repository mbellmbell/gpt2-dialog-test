"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Royals and Orioles game yesterday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, it was exciting the Orioles almost came back and won."
"__BASEBALL__ I just can't believe the Royals were losing 5-0 in the bottom of the 4th inning and then ended up tying by the end of the inning."
"__BASEBALL__ Really, they scored 5 runs in one inning?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, it was exciting to see especially the Moustakas homerun."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow! That is amazing, what is that number 9 so far this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I believe so, its either number 9 or 10."
"__BASEBALL__ I am really surprised the Orioles didn't come back to win it."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean, the Royals were winning for the most part after the 4th inning."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but in the top of the 9th the Orioles started to rally."
"__BASEBALL__ Ohhh you were talking about the 9th inning I thought you were talking about the rest of the game."
"__BASEBALL__ No, I was talking about the 9th, It seams that the Royals were playing strong until the 9th."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I am not too confident in the Royals bullpen after about inning number 7."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I have to agree it seams that the bullpen starts to fall apart."
"__BASEBALL__ Sometimes it get frustrating as the Royals will have the lead most of the game and then their bullpen will blow it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, your telling me.  They should have won all games last series, but their bullpen messed it up."
"__BASEBALL__ It also doesn't help that the bats for the Royals haven't been that strong."
"__BASEBALL__ It seams their offense is in a little bit of a slump, hopefully it ends soon."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I think it will."
"__BASEBALL__ Usually around the all star- break is when teams really start to pick it up as it is time for playoffs."
