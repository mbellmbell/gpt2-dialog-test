"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about the Dodgers this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I assume they'll be good. They have such a big payroll."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they're trying to spend less now."
"__BASEBALL__ It doesn't seem like it."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, a lot of their payroll is for players no longer with the team."
"__BASEBALL__ They do have some good young talent, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ They have good young players at several positions."
"__BASEBALL__ Like who?"
"__BASEBALL__ Corey Seager is a really good shortstop in his second year."
"__BASEBALL__ Who else?"
"__BASEBALL__ Cody Bellinger is a power hitter that just came up."
"__BASEBALL__ How's he doing?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's already hit a bunch of home runs in his first two weeks since being called up."
"__BASEBALL__ Where does he play?"
"__BASEBALL__ He can play first base and left or right field."
"__BASEBALL__ Any young pitchers?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, Julio Urias is only 20 and he's really good."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I heard about him."
"__BASEBALL__ They signed him when he was 16 so he already has a lot of experience in the system."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok, so the Dodgers will be good again, but can they win it all?"
