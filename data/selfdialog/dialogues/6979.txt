"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite character from the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love Rey's character."
"__STAR_WARS__ She seems like such a hero, so I get it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love Kylo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I thought he seemed whiny."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that's intentional, like it's going to be part of the plot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, you mean like it's supposed to be showing some sort of internal struggle, or like an actor acting like he's acting?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's a bit complicated but I do think it's intentional."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess we'll have to wait and see until the next movies come out."
