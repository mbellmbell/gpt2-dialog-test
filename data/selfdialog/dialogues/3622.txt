"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the The Heavy?"
"__MUSIC__ I have, but I'm not very familiar."
"__MUSIC__ Despite what the name implies, they're more of an alternative or indie-rock group."

"__MUSIC__ 'How You Like Me Now' got a lot of plays."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that song--they're got a pretty cool sound. Have they had anything come out recently?"
"__MUSIC__ They have!  Their most recent album came out last year."
"__MUSIC__ What is it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's 'Hurt & the Merciless'.  It's a funkier, more blues inspired album."
"__MUSIC__ So kind of in the same area as the Black Keys?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that's a fair way to describe the album."
"__MUSIC__ What about their older stuff, do you recommend I listen to that as well?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely.  'The House that Dirt Built' has a cool Indie/Garage Rock feel."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song from that album? I think I'll download it and give it a try."
"__MUSIC__ 'Short Change Hero' is not only my favorite song from that album, but it's probably my favorite song from The Heavy."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"

"__MUSIC__ It was the theme song to the game 'Borderlands 2'."
"__MUSIC__ I do remember that.  I am going to have to think about getting that album."
