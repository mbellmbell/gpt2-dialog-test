"__MUSIC__ What's the last song you heard in your car?"
"__MUSIC__ Why do you want to know?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just a question, honestly, what was it?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really want to say."
"__MUSIC__ Well now I have to know, spill it."
"__MUSIC__ Fine it was We Are Family by sister Sledge."
"__MUSIC__ Wow that was not was I was expecting."
"__MUSIC__ Well I like it ok, it's the reason I've seen Birdcage so many times."
"__MUSIC__ You watched a movie just for a song? You know they came out with things that will play music right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I am aware, but I never had the tape or CD to listen to so I had to watch the movie."
"__MUSIC__ Well anyway, why wouldn't you want to say you like listening to that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because, I sing along to it, and it's a little embarrassing."
"__MUSIC__ Like you're the first person to sing along to that song."
"__MUSIC__ No, but it's not something I like people knowing."
"__MUSIC__ Well how about this, I'll tell you what song I'm embarrassed to sing."
"__MUSIC__ Like it's any worse than mine?"
"__MUSIC__ You tell me, it's Macho Man."
"__MUSIC__ Fare enough, so are we talking lip sync or full on dance routine?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I never lip sync, full volume with dancing. Like I said you are not alone."
"__MUSIC__ I guess a catchy song is a catchy song, so Karaoke tonight then?"
