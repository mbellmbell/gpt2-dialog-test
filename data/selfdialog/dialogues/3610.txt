"__MUSIC__ Remember the Grunge Era?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, I definitely do. I was in my teens at the time."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, me too. There was a 3-4 year stretch where all I listened to was Grunge music."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking as someone who had Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, and Pearl Jam tshirts on heavy rotation, I'm right there with you."
"__MUSIC__ Nirvana is my favorite band of all time."
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty great. I think I actually liked Pearl Jam more when I was younger."
"__MUSIC__ Pearl Jam is really good too."
"__MUSIC__ It's sad how some of the great musicians from those bands have passed away."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Chris Cornell's death hit me hard. And of course, at the time Kurt Cobain."
"__MUSIC__ That lifestyle wasn't a healthy one, I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ No, but they made some incredible music."
"__MUSIC__ No question. I remember in high school I saw a show with Alice in Chains and Soundgarden."
"__MUSIC__ So lucky! I never saw any of the big grunge acts play live."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, my friend and I got a couple of tickets for our birthdays, which happened to be right around the same time."
"__MUSIC__ I'll always regret not being able to see Nirvana play live."
"__MUSIC__ The funny thing is that the show wasn't that great - it was outdoors and drizzling, and the sound quality was lousy."
"__MUSIC__ Still, you got to see Alice in Chains and Soundgarden live."
"__MUSIC__ True. I guess I can't complain."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to throw my Nevermind CD into the stereo."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I wouldn't mind hearing it again."
