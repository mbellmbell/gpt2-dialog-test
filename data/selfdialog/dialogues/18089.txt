"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure whether I like Jennifer Lawrence movies or not."
"__MOVIES__ She's been in a lot of movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know, and they're all really different. I'm just not sure what to think of them."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the Hunger Games series?"
"__MOVIES__ It was okay. I liked the books better."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like Silver Linings Playbook?"
"__MOVIES__ I never saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you should. I think you'd like her in that a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it might be worth a watch, but I never got around to it."
"__MOVIES__ How about Passengers? We saw that the other week."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of liked that movie. But I couldn't really tell who she was as a character in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know what you mean a little bit on that one. She spent half the movie really angry at Chris Pratt."
"__MOVIES__ She seems like a good actress. I just think the right movie needs to come along for her."
"__MOVIES__ She was great in Silver Linings Playbook. It was like it was written for her."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a funny movie? I don't like sad movies."
"__MOVIES__ It had funny moments definitely."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll have to see it then. I feel like I want to be a Jennifer Lawrence fan, but just haven't seen a really good movie with her in it yet."
"__MOVIES__ I think she's good in most movies she's in."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I won't like Silver Linings Playbook as much as I think then."
"__MOVIES__ I bet you will."
