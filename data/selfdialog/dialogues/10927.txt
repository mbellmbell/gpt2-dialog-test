"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about Colin Kaepernick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The quarterback who was always kneeling during the National Anthem? I don't know much else about him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that's him, but what do you think of him as a player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know he played really well with the team for a while before they started benching him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And for Blaine Gabbert of all people"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who in their right mind would think Gabbert was a better option than Colin Kaepernick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to understand what goes through the coaches' minds when they're losing so much in a season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, and I suppose I'd want to make a change too if my quarterback was throwing four interceptions in a game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what about all those players retiring from the 49ers? That probably made a huge impact on him as a player"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you're right, which is why I think Kaepernick gets unfairly criticized as a player"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Context is everything in the NFL, although overcoming adversity is a strong skill"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but there's no way that Kaepernick being overlooked by so many teams has to do with his skill as a player alone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like it when the NFL gets too political, it spoils the mood for me"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's such a popular sport that you can't blame players for being outspoken"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand that, but I wish teams would just look at Kaepernick as a player and leave his political views out of it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if Michael Vick can get a second chance, I suppose anyone can"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a bit different, though; Vick broke the law and did his time, and Kaepernick just silently protested something"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's a strange double standard when you think about it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Michael Vick was an elite quarterback, and Kaepernick never was"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but maybe all Kaepernick needs is a second chance to make a huge comeback!"
