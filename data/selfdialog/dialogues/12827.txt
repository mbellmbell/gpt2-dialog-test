"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, the NFL preseason starts up August 3rd"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right, Cowboys & Cardinals in the Hall of Fame game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you think is going to win it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the Patriots again; Tom Brady just seems so talented and the offense just clicks with him at the helm"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree. Anybody else have an outside shot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well not in the AFC, but in the NFC, I'd have to say the Cowboys or the Falcons could give the Patriots a good game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds about right. The Cowboys have great balance with Dak Prescott at QB and Ezekiel Elliott in the backfield."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true, they can go either run or pass on any snap and move the ball downfield with ease."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Cowboys defense is nothing to sneeze at either"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons have Matt Ryan at QB, and he's a very capable passer who doesn't throw many interceptions"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, considering he got sacked 37 times last year, I'm surprised he didn't panic pass more"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Outside of those two teams, I don't see anyone capable of challenging the Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the other end of the spectrum......who's going to have the worst record?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns almost went winless last year, upsetting the Chargers in game 15 and finishing the year at 1-15"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might improve by 2 wins this year. I don't see how the Rams managed 4 wins with the league's worst offense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the 49ers with the league's worst defense managed only 2 wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Bears and the Jaguars round out the bottom 5 with 3 wins apiece"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there could be a case made for the Jets to be this years worst, even going 0-16"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because there ain't no quarterback & a bunch off season trades puts them in even worse position than last year."
