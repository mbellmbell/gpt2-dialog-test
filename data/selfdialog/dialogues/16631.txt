"__MOVIES__ Do you like animated stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, movies? Disney?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, sure. There's other producers of animated films, though."
"__MOVIES__ They're few and far between."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, whatever. Do you like animated movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean... I remember loving Anastasia. I know that wasn't Disney."
"__MOVIES__ Anastasia was pretty good, too, I remember! Good recall."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks - what were you thinking?"
"__MOVIES__ Titan A.E. I feel like society has collectively forgotten that movie even though it was so awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely underrated. Especially for how shockingly star-studded the cast was."
"__MOVIES__ Drew Barrymore, Matt Damon, Bill Pullman... ah..."
"__MOVIES__ Janeane Garofalo!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! It was insane how many stars there were in it."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how that happened. Did they all just up and decide to try out voice acting together?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Maybe the writer or director had connections."
"__MOVIES__ We should look that up. Whatever connections they had, they probably had them for good reason."
"__MOVIES__ What, because the movie was awesome?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much. Oh and remember the soundtrack?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It was so weird but pretty cool there'd be like music video scenes inside the movie itself."
"__MOVIES__ To showcase the animation, I think. They nailed it."
