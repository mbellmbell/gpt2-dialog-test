"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think it's hard coaching in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. And for so many reasons too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What kind of reasons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're not coaching children, you're coaching grown men who sometimes act like children."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, that doesn't sound too hard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to defend all the plays you call to reporters who twist your words around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That doesn't sound very fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to take the blame sometimes for players just not performing how they should."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would they do that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because a coach is a leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought the quarterback was the leader?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're both leaders. The coach is just a more off screen leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sounds complicated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think I would want to be an NFL coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think I would want to either. It's a lot of work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happens if you can't do all the things expected of you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You get fired and they start over with a new coach and try again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds a little harsh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL coaching can be very harsh."
