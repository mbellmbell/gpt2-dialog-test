"__MUSIC__ Hey what kind of music are you into?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a really big pop fan. One of my favorite artists is Katy Perry."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I like her, she's cute. What's your favorite song by her?"
"__MUSIC__ It's going to sound silly, but I really like California girls. It resonates with me on a deep level."
"__MUSIC__ That's a pretty good song. I personally have always liked Hot n Cold myself."
"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to Lady Gaga?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard her a few times, and I liked her superbowl performance. She's always been a little out there for me."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, but I really like her originality with these things. It kind of sets her apart as an artist."
"__MUSIC__ You've got a good point. That's why I like Lindsey Stirling."
"__MUSIC__ Lindsey Stirling is amazing! She's such a great composer, and her collaborations are off the charts."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked that song she did with John Legend. What was it called?"
"__MUSIC__ I believe it was a collaboration of his song All Of me. That's one of the best songs of his I've ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of, John Legend sure has been busy lately hasn't he!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I believe he was just on The Beauty and The Beast soundtrack, as well as some other things."
"__MUSIC__ I also saw him on this really long Target Christmas commercial that was pretty cool. He actually did a little acting."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of instrumentalists, have you heard The Piano Guys?"
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't. Who's that?"
"__MUSIC__ They're this group that does really excellent covers of songs and they've got some original works and also some collaborations. It's worth looking into!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay then I'll have to do that. If you like Lindsey, you definitely have good taste in music."
"__MUSIC__ Why thanks, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. While you're at it, check out Two Cellos on YouTube."
