"__STAR_WARS__ I think Jar Jar Binks has got to be the worst character in the Star Wars franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ugh, totally.  The character itself could have been really interesting but the way they had him talk was just so annoying."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know! He came from an interesting world, an interesting culture and you don't care one thing about him because you just can't stand to hear him talk."
"__STAR_WARS__ The worst, the absolute worst was when Padme puts him in charge of being a senator for Naboo while she's away in Attack of the Clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed! It's like, 'Who's the dumbest guy I know from planet? Oh OK, I'll put him in charge while I'm busy!'"
"__STAR_WARS__ It just just so dumb.  Who would listen to him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Their planet is at risk, their whole republic is at risk and she puts a guy you couldn't trust to make a takeout order in charge of everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ And he's such a coward! He just gave up and surrendered in the big battle against the droid army in Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't blame the other Gungams for kicking him out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me either, he probably would have flipped the switch that flooded the whole city thinking he was turning the lights on."
