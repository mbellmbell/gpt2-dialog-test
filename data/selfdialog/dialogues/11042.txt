"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team do you think will have a breakout season this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to make a pick, I would say the Los Angeles Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting, why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm very excited for their new coaches, whether it be Sean McVay or Wade Phillips."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that Wade Phillips is great and what he did with Denver's defense in the 2015 season was amazing. I'm less sure about Sean McVay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it because he's still very young?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's part of it. Also, I don't think what he did with the Washington Redskins was that impressive when you consider the talented players he had and the fact that Jay Gruden is the head coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ While you are right about Gruden and the talent present in Washington last season, he helped turn Cousins from a mediocre backup to a Pro Bowl caliber quarterback. That's worth something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he'll be able to repeat that success with Jared Goff?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that he has as a decent chance to do so. If he can make Goff just average, the Rams will be a huge threat given their talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aside from Robert Quinn, what amazing players do they have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Todd Gurley had a great rookie season and is bound for a bounce back season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even if Gurley were to have a great season, which is not guaranteed, the Rams lack a solid wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Tavon Austin?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has speed, but he's not great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All he has to do is be decent and the Rams can copy the Seattle model of just relying on defense and a running game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You act as if that's easy. Seattle had a proven running back in Marshawn Lynch and the best defensive secondary in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not saying that it's easy, but Robert Quinn, Aaron Donald, and Alec Ogletree areas tough as they come."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that they could become more dominant under the direction of Wade Phillips. I just don't see a strong defensive secondary yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not overly concerned about that. Wade Phillips does a great job of getting the most out of his defensive secondaries."
