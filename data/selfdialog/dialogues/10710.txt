"__FASHION__ Hey, I love your shoes. Where did you get them?"
"__FASHION__ I got these from Ross."
"__FASHION__ How much did they cost?"
"__FASHION__ I believe I paid less than 20 dollars for them."
"__FASHION__ That's a great deal. Do you always get your shoes from Ross?"
"__FASHION__ No, I just saw that these were on sale, so I took advantage."
"__FASHION__ Where do you buy your shoes from?"
"__FASHION__ I really love this online store called 'Just Fab.' They have great deals."
"__FASHION__ What type of shoes do they have?"
"__FASHION__ They have all kinds, but they definitely have a great selection for heels."
"__FASHION__ I'm looking for some that have straps that go up to my knee. Do you think they have some?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, I'm sure they do. I just purchased some thigh high boots from them last week."
"__FASHION__ How much did you pay for those?"
"__FASHION__ I got a great deal, two for 35 dollars."
"__FASHION__ What kind did you get?"
"__FASHION__ I got the thigh high boots, and I got some clear pumps to go with my all white dress that I also purchased from them."
"__FASHION__ Clear pumps with a white dress, that sounds like it would look great together."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, the white dress comes to my knees, and its tight fitting, I love it."
"__FASHION__ Did you get that from Just Fab too?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, their dresses are just as great as their shoes."
