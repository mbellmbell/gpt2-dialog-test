"__STAR_WARS__ What was the best Star Wars movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say either Empire Strikes back or Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah definitely both awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm going to go with Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ As you should.  It was awesome and had the reveal about Vader being Luke's father."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus is is part of the main story.  Rogue One was great but more of an interest piece."
"__STAR_WARS__ And in Empire they showed that the bad guys can win."
"__STAR_WARS__ At least for a while.  Everything was bad for the Rebellion after Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ But they turned it around in the next movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, only because Luke finished his training."
