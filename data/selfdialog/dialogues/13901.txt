"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the game 3 between the Warriors and the Spurs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. The Spurs didn't stand a chance without Kawhi Leonard."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know but they still have Lamarcus Aldridge."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, but he is not as good as Kawhi."
"__BASKETBALL__ Aldridge did score 18 points in the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ The problem with that is that he only had 5 rebounds so that is not going to cut it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Danny Green and Patty Mills didn't shoot the ball well either."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, both of those players shot well below 50%."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Spurs also shot terrible from the 3 point line."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. A team that plays against the Warriors and shoots that poorly is probably not going to win the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ On the flip side, the Warriors got 33 points from their star player Durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, Curry also pitched in a respectable 21 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you know Durant also had 10 rebounds?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I didn't but I did notice that the Warriors turned the ball over 21 times."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, it was a strange game for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, but it appears that it didn't matter because they hit over 50% of their shots."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly, they still beat the Spurs by a respectable 12 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, if the Spurs do not win the next game, their season is finished."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is so true but what can they do with Kawhi Leonard."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know but they better figure something out very quickly."
