"__THRILLER__ I just saw a very scary movie!"
"__THRILLER__ What was it?"
"__THRILLER__ 'It Comes At Night.'"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, yeah! I wanted to see that? The one will Joel Edgerton, right?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, that's the one."
"__THRILLER__ He's a great actor. Is it scary? Is he good in it?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, it's definitely scary. Do NOT go alone. And yeah, Joel is excellent as usual."
"__THRILLER__ Nice. He's the man."
"__THRILLER__ I would say I'd see it again with you, but I'm too scared to do so."
"__THRILLER__ That's alright! I'll have to find someone else to take! I'll let you know what I think."
