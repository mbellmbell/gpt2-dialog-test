"__POP__ What's your favorite album from Avril Lavigne?"
"__POP__ Umm, it's a difficult question, I like a lot of her music. I like both The Best Damn Thing and Let Go"
"__POP__ why is that?"
"__POP__ because I feel her music has soul in it, and from song to song in an album, the overall feelings are the same, so I could listen to them all day long"
"__POP__ what are some of your favorite songs from those 2 albums then?"
"__POP__ to be honest, I like most of the music she published, but maybe Innocence and Complicated would stand out just a bit of more"
"__POP__ They were such a sensation back in high school, right?"
"__POP__ you bet, I feel the psychology in some of her music beats at the same rate as high school teenagers"
"__POP__ her later music has become more mature, I think she has moved on"
"__POP__ indeed, so did we"
