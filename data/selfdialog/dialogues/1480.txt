"__MUSIC__ So what's been in your music player lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of different stuff, but I'd say mostly country hits."
"__MUSIC__ Oh awesome!  Is LeAnn Rhymes still around?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, she released a new single in 2016 in the UK.  It was called The Story."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard of that one.  I know Blue was amazing when it came out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was her first album in 1996 right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and people compared her to Patsy Cline which was a pretty huge honor."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'll say.  I saw her as the opening act for Alan Jackson around that time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I bet that was pretty incredible!"
"__MUSIC__ It was, they both put on a great show."
"__MUSIC__ I remember One Way Ticket, didn't it come out around the same time?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think it was the same album."
"__MUSIC__ So what's her newer stuff like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's similar, but she crossed over a little bit more into pop along with country music."
"__MUSIC__ That tends to happen a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and she had one album that was mostly just a remake of Patsy Cline songs believe it or not."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, I never heard that!  I bet it sounded great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they do have a lot of similarities in their sound.  It was pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what she'll come out with next."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  I bet there will be something soon though."
