"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Steelers chances this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have a good shot at winning 10 or more games and making the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well one thing is that Martavis Bryant will be back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and also placing the franchise tag on Le'Veon Bell helps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Correct, if he had gone to another team that would be bad!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Ben Roethlisberger can stay healthy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at his age that is hard to say, but when he gets hurt he is often able to come back quickly, even playing injured."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And signing Antonio Brown to an extension is good since he's probably the best wide receiver in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right he's the highest paid receiver for a reason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you know about TJ Watt?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough to predict which college players will do well in the NFL especially towards the bottom of the 1st round but he has a pedigree through his brother."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you plan on watching the Steelers game again this year at the local Steelers bar?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It looks like the first game won't be on TV here in Philadelphia since the Eagles play at the same time on the same network."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok we will go to the bar then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think the score will be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well even with Myles Garrett the Browns are still pretty bad so even on the road I think the Steelers win by something like 28-17."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is what I thought too, a relatively easy Steelers win.  Talk to you later!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good talking to you."
