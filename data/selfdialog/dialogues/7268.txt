"__LADY_GAGA__ Kelly did Akon at one time signed Lady Gaga on his Konvict music label."
"__LADY_GAGA__ oh yes gaga started as a Konvict music artist before she was signed unto Sony music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ because a closer listen to her debut single 'poker face' has that Konvict signature tune at the beginning."
"__LADY_GAGA__ yes when she did 'poker face' she was still with Konvict Music hence the reason the Konvict signature tune was sampled."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Sony did a good job with her though."
"__LADY_GAGA__ well i would rather say lady gaga did a good job for Sony Music because she was dropping hit songs after hit songs and Sony don't need to promo much as songs are instant hot from first week."
"__LADY_GAGA__ my all time lady gaga song was 'alehandro' although the song had so many controversy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ lady gaga has  always been controversial, from her style of dressing, her videos, you name it lol"
"__LADY_GAGA__ that's true though there is always something to watch out for when she's performing."
