"__MUSIC__ I heard the new Miley Cyrus song today, it was shocking."
"__MUSIC__ Shocking? In what way?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it was more like her old stuff, I mean her stuff right after Disney but before Bangerz."
"__MUSIC__ So, like The Climb?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah kind of. It wasn't bad."
"__MUSIC__ What's it called."
"__MUSIC__ Malibu. It's kind of soft and romantic but summery."
"__MUSIC__ Nice. I really like her music, even the new stuff everyone hates."
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't bad, it just wasn't always my thing. I actually liked Wrecking Ball despite the weird video."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was a good one."
"__MUSIC__ Malibu is about her relationship with Liam Hemsworth. It's not my favourite song of the summer, but it's pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's promising. I'm glad she's still making music."
"__MUSIC__ I also really like the stuff I'm hearing from her younger sister, Noah."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard about her."
"__MUSIC__ If you like Miley's stuff, you'll probably like it. I was listening to I'm Stuck earlier, very catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to check that out, I like catchy!"
"__MUSIC__ It's good. I've been listening to it more and more."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think Miley is going to come out with more songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I bet she will, probably a new album soon."
"__MUSIC__ I hope so."
