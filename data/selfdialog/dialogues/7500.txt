"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga is pretty outrageous. Do you like her?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't think I really like her as a person. But I do like some of her songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I can see that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I would never go to one of her concerts. But I sometimes sing along it her songs come on."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah I don't understand her persona."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It makes me wonder if she is insecure deep down."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You mean because she doesn't show her real face?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly. It's probably a way to create mystery. It's just odd"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she also tries to make a statement about some aspects of society."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's a good point. Maybe I don't always understand her perspective."
