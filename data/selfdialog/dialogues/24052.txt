"__SUPERHERO__ I imagine you love Marvel movies the best."
"__SUPERHERO__ They've been doing a great job the past ten years.  Iron Man was such a good starter."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree.  The special effects were killer."
"__SUPERHERO__ And the casting was so perfect.  Robert Downey Jr. playing a recovering alcoholic!"
"__SUPERHERO__ They never mention him being an alcoholic in the movies though, do they?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, that's true.  I just mostly remember it from the comics."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, none of them are super faithful to the comics."
"__SUPERHERO__ True.  There's a lot of mixing and matching."
"__SUPERHERO__ And Civil War isn't exactly like the original Civil War plot."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's true, although it would have been in poor taste since I think a school in Connecticut got blown up."
