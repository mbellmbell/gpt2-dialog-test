"__HORROR__ Can you think of a really scary horror movie to watch tonight?"
"__HORROR__ How about watching a movie called Willow Creek?"
"__HORROR__ What kind of movie is it? What's the it's about?"
"__HORROR__ It is a found footage type of movie and it's about Bigfoot."
"__HORROR__ So they make a video of Bigfoot in the movie?"
"__HORROR__ Well you'll have to watch the movie to find that out. The main characters do bring a video camera with them on a camping trip."
"__HORROR__ Why do they have a video camera while camping. That sounds unrealistic."
"__HORROR__ The reason given in the movie is that the couple are actually making a documentary about Bigfoot sighting in the area they're camping in."
"__HORROR__ Oh cool. So it's just two people in the whole movie."
"__HORROR__ Well, there are a few other minor characters but yes, most of the movie is just about couple in their 30's making a Bigfoot documentary."
