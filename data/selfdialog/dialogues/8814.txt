"__BEATLES__ I met someone today who was so far out there I think he could've written songs for the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ What do you mean?"
"__BEATLES__ Well you know how some of the Beatles lyrics are hard to make sense of, or they don't seem to mean anything at all?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't think so. I thought mostly they did love songs and things like that."
"__BEATLES__ They've done love songs and they've done just some far out there songs."
"__BEATLES__ Examples?"
"__BEATLES__ Like Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octupus's Garden come to mind."
"__BEATLES__ I thought Maxwell's Silver Hammer was kind of morbid, didn't you?"
"__BEATLES__ Not especially. I always just found it amusing and lighthearted."
"__BEATLES__ It seems like just the kind of song you'd like."
