"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you think about Migos?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I like their song T-Shirt. Another one I like is One Time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think they play Bad and Boujee way too much!!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I agree. Just like Future and his song Mask Off."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They play Mask Off a lot but it's a hit. I think it was way better than Turn On the Lights."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Young Thug's album Jefferey sounds pretty good, but they don't play it much."

"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Young Thug is part of the new generation hip hop, like Lil Uzi Vert."
