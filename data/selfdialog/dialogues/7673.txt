"__LADY_GAGA__ I heard Lady GaGa is going on tour this year!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I guess that means she's not going to be on American Horror Story again."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, probably not, but I'd rather see her live."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Same here. I haven't seen her live since her debut."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What songs would you want to hear?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm hoping to hear some of the stuff off of Artpop."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Same! She ignores that album sometimes."
"__LADY_GAGA__ And I want some really crazy and cool costumes."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well she always brings really cool sets and costumes on tour."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You're definitely right about that!"
