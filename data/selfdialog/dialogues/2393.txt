"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Lindsey Stirling?"

"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! Wasn't she on the X Factor or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Lindsey was on America's Got Talent, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, so that wasn't what rocketed her to fame?"
"__MUSIC__ No, actually, she got voted out and the judge told her she wasn't good enough to fill a stage."
"__MUSIC__ Ouch, that had to hurt."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, but it sure motivated her--she's gone on to make several albums and toured around the world."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! But what's that got to do with YouTube?"
"__MUSIC__ She started posting videos on YouTube in 2007, but it wasn't until 2012 that she finally had a hit."
