"__MOVIES__ I went to see King Arthur this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ I heard it got mixed reviews."
"__MOVIES__ I left thinking about it for sure."
"__MOVIES__ So what did you think about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, first off you have to forget everything you know about the original King Arthur stories."
"__MOVIES__ I had heard it wasn't much like them."
"__MOVIES__ I would say the only thing similar is the name King Arthur and Excalliber."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that it had some pretty intense fight secenes."
"__MOVIES__ It did. They were well choreographed but almost seemed forced."
"__MOVIES__ I can't see that."
"__MOVIES__ I did like the music. It was gritty."
"__MOVIES__ I heard some of it during the trailers for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ There really wasn't a love interest but seemed to be like there would a glimmer of one but that never came to be."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was marketed as more action oriented."
"__MOVIES__ The other characters needed to be fleshed out more."
"__MOVIES__ Yes there is a fine line if you don't care about the characters you have nothing vested if they are injured or wronged."
"__MOVIES__ This is what I was thinking but I did leave wondering about the movie."
"__MOVIES__ This is what a good movie will do. It keeps you looking for more."
"__MOVIES__ The graphics were pretty cool too."
"__MOVIES__ It read that it was an expensive movie to make so I can see how the graphics would be amazing."
