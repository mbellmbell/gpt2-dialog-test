"__BASEBALL__ What do you think is an appropriate salary for baseball players?"
"__BASEBALL__ They are role models playing a childhood game, professionally. They should be thrilled to make more than $100,000."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm fine with them making a ton of money as long as they keep a small amount, like $500,000 a year, and give the rest to charity."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm the kind of person who would make that a law. You want a mansion on your $20 million/year salary, but won't give up a small amount of that to house the homeless?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, players who don't do that are selfish."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about pay-for-performance?"
"__BASEBALL__ What's that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, instead of giving a 30-yr-old a salary that INCREASES every year, they should be paid based on their performance."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not sure..."
"__BASEBALL__ So, someone who bats .225, hits 15 homeruns, and strikes out 200 times shouldn't make $10 million, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Right, that makes sense."
"__BASEBALL__ So why should that be the case, but then a new player gets paid the league minimum but wins the batting title?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that's super unfair."
"__BASEBALL__ I love performance-based pay (even a game-by-game method)."
"__BASEBALL__ But, that may have the manager NOT play certain people in order to make sure they don't get money. That's very unfair."
"__BASEBALL__ Right, so league minimums can remain. $250,000 to sit on your butt? Anyone will take that."
"__BASEBALL__ The other issue I see is attendance. How can they pay their players when they average 10,000 fans per game?"
"__BASEBALL__ There needs to be more oversight so the Marlins owner doesn't keep pulling the same crap on taxpayers and fans."
"__BASEBALL__ Either way, everyone makes far too much money for what they're doing."
"__BASEBALL__ Agreed."
