"__MOVIES__ You know the movie I'm looking forward to?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see National Treasure 3."
"__MOVIES__ You must be kidding, right?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I really liked the first two."
"__MOVIES__ I felt like the first one was good in a cheesy kind of way, but the second one was just awful."
"__MOVIES__ I think they're just fun movies. Nicolas Cage was made to play characters like that."
"__MOVIES__ Characters like what? Ones who have crazy conspiracy theories?"
"__MOVIES__ He just is good in action movies I think."
"__MOVIES__ You consider National Treasure an action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ To some extent, I suppose it is."
"__MOVIES__ I consider National Treasure a kid's movie. It's rated PG."
"__MOVIES__ That makes it fun for the whole family though! And you kind of learn history while watching."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't call what's in those movies history exactly."
"__MOVIES__ You know what I mean though. They go all over Washington DC and Philadelphia searching for cool history clues in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure how accurate the clues are though."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they're not accurate, but the movie sure is entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe to some people, but not to me."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I won't invite you when I see National Treasure 3 at midnight."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it probably wouldn't be a good idea."
