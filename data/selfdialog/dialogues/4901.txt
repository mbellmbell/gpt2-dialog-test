"__MUSIC__ Like which ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember Rick James and Eddie Murphy did that song Party All The Time?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah right.Eddie Murphy swore he could sing. Rick James probably just did it for the money."

"__MUSIC__ Man you crazy. How about all those parody songs that Weird Al used to make? That dude was crazy."
"__MUSIC__ I remember he had that one called Eat It."
"__MUSIC__ And he made the video mocking Michael Jackson's Beat It."
"__MUSIC__ Man, I remember almost every song on that Beat It album was the truth."
"__MUSIC__ That wasn't the Thriller album was it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it was after Thriller. Bad."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's right. Mike was that dude."
"__MUSIC__ I still got Mike music in my phone to this day. I like Rock My World."
"__MUSIC__ I like the video with him and Chris Tucker."
"__MUSIC__ I got a Remember The Time remix in my phone. I think I got it from soundcloud."
"__MUSIC__ Soundcloud be having all them live remixes though. Stuff folk ain't never heard of before."
