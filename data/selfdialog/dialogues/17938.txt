"__MOVIES__ Did you hear they are making a bio pic on the life of Qandeel Baloch?"
"__MOVIES__ Who in the world is Qandeel Baloch?"
"__MOVIES__ She was the Pakistani social media model whose brother killed her for 'bringing shame on their family.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes I heard of her. Didn't they call her the Kim Kardashian of Pakistan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes they did, but not many people in the West knew who she was until the Honor Killing."
"__MOVIES__ What did she do that brought shame on the family?"
"__MOVIES__ She made several videos and posted them on social media, dressed provocatively, doing suggestive things such as stripteasing and lying sprawled in bed, proposing to sports celebrities and even politicians."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't sound like something to be killed for."
"__MOVIES__ Not to us in the Western World, but in society there she was considered a shameful disgrace."
"__MOVIES__ That's horrible. Hopefully her death will shed light on these so called Honor Killings."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, hopefully. I believe Pakistan has now made these killings illegal, but it doesn't seem to be stopping people, especially in rural, poverty-stricken areas."
"__MOVIES__ What happened to her brother?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe he's in jail right now. We'll have to wait until the movie comes out to find out more."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think the movie will be released in the West?"
"__MOVIES__ I doubt it, but we'll be able to find it online or probably rent it through Amazon Prime or something."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully with English subtitles, otherwise what would be the point for us to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you're right. If the film makers are hoping to shine a light on this injustice, they need to make the movie accessible to everyone."
"__MOVIES__ I agree! Maybe some good civilian will upload a version of the movie with their own subtitles. What is the name of the film going to be?"
"__MOVIES__ It will be titled Bhaagi"
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to remember that."
