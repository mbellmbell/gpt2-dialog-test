"__STAR_WARS__ So what did you think of Attack of the Clones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm a little so so on it.  What about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was better than Episode I but still a bit behind the other movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I know.  Count Dukoo was cool though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Christopher Lee plays a good bad guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was awesome to see someone that was a Padiwan for Yoda himself."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was, that was a great display of Jedi heritage."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, Yoda trained Dukoo, who trained Qui Con, who trained Obi Wan, who trained Anikan."
"__STAR_WARS__ Obi Wan and Yoda also both trained Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but that breaks the chain a bit and was much later."
