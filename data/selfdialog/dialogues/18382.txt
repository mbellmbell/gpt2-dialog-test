"__MOVIES__ My girlfriend and I just saw Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was great, so much better than I thought it would be."
"__MOVIES__ Really, that good?"
"__MOVIES__ Indeed, the story was captivating and the acting was solid."
"__MOVIES__ Who all is in it again."
"__MOVIES__ Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman and is fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's pretty beautiful too. Who else?"
"__MOVIES__ Lets see, there's Danny Huston, Connie Nielsen and Chris Pine."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Pine the love interest?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much."
"__MOVIES__ I bet he's all macho at first and doesn't like Wonder Woman, typical man."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, quite the contrary, he knows she can hold her own from the start."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was really smart, which you don't get so much with superhero movies."
"__MOVIES__ No joke, just look at the Transformers movies."
"__MOVIES__ I'd rather not, I'd go see Wonder Woman again though."
"__MOVIES__ It's on my list now that's for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Great date movie too if you want to bring your partner."
"__MOVIES__ I might just do that, thanks for the info."
