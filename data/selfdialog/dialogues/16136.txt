"__ROCK__ Did you hear the Foo Fighters just announced a new album?"
"__ROCK__ I think I did see that. What is the album name again?"
"__ROCK__ Concrete and Gold."
"__ROCK__ Right. Yeah, I did hear about that and also the new tour too."
"__ROCK__ I'm excited. It seems like there just isn't much new rock music lately."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, they're definitely one of the few bands around right now to keep the genre alive."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, they're definitely the biggest rock band around currently, in my opinion."
"__ROCK__ I agree with that. Aside from maybe The Rolling Stones but the Stones don't really put out any new music."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, they just tour mostly."
"__ROCK__ At least they're all still iconic though!"
