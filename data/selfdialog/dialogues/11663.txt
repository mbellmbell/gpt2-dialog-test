"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that football games in the NFL are way too long, don't you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, definitely. I think it's due to all the time outs and commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what it is. There is just way too much commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's how the NFL make their money. So I'm not surprised."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just surprised that a game that is supposed to be an hour is now taking almost four hours to watch. That is ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and it's even worse when you live in the East Coast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I think the NFL has gotten too greedy with trying to squeeze in as much ad time as they can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. But I don't see them changing it anytime soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually think that fans have started to revolt against it. With the internet, more and more people are watching games by other means."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I heard. Wasn't footbball ratings down last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it was. And I think part of it was the fact that a lot of people are just tired of all the commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably. But do you actually see the NFL cutting down on commercials?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're gonna have to unless they want people to stop tuning in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If that's the case, then the NFL is going to have to figure out how to make money with less commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the things I heard was that they were considering putting sponsors on team jerseys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean like company logos on the team uniforms?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I think that's one way they can make money with less commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would actually be for that if it meant shorter NFL games with less commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would too. But it's going to be odd buying a jersey with a logo from a corporation on it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If it means I can go to bed at a reasonable time because I don't have to watch a four hour game, then it's fine with me."
