"__ROCK__ I love rock music!  I would love to live in a little pink house by John Mellencamp."
"__ROCK__ That would be very cool but what would the interior have?"
"__ROCK__ I think I would have 'a magic carpet ride' by Steppenwolf."
"__ROCK__ Magic carpet inside would be insane.  I wonder where this would be?"
"__ROCK__ If I had my choice it would be 'standing on the corner of Winslow Arizona' taking it easy by the Eagles."
"__ROCK__ Arizona is cool and I would live there.  Who are you living with?"
"__ROCK__ I am living with 'Jack and Diane'.  They are performed by John Cougar Mellencamp."
"__ROCK__ Jack and Diane, no way.  I bet they are crazy people!"
"__ROCK__ They are 'born to be wild'.  They get their motor running by steppenwolf."
"__ROCK__ For sure they are wild.  Very cool rock n roll conversation."
