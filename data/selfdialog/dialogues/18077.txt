"__MOVIES__ I'm kind of surprised DC Comics hasn't tried to make another Constantine film."
"__MOVIES__ It probably wouldn't fit in very well with the DC Cinematic Universe they're building."
"__MOVIES__ Please, if Doctor Strange can fit in with The Hulk and Spider-Man there's no reason Constantine can't join Batman and Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Who would even play him? Should Keanu Reeves back?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not like he's aged a ton. But no, I'm sure they'd want to start fresh."
"__MOVIES__ It's probably for the best, that Constantine movie wasn't that great anyway."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I actually kind of like it. It's not great, but it's not bad."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know what the deal with that film is. It's sort of like a cross between a gritty R-rated supernatural thriller and a big budget comic movie."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I suppose it sort of is a bit of both, but not really committed to either one."
"__MOVIES__ There are a few action scenes, but not too many. What's there is good, but it's short."
"__MOVIES__ Come to think of it, I think Ghost Rider actually had stronger action scenes than Constantine."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the first one anyway. Either way, Constantine is better than both Ghost Rider films."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not arguing. The second Ghost Rider was terrible."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe they got the guys behind the Crank films, and somehow managed to make a boring Ghost Rider movie. Crazy."
"__MOVIES__ Eh, it happens. Sometimes despite a director's best efforts, things just don't come together right."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, yeah, whatever. It doesn't excuse the film being boring."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, at least Constantine is entertaining all the way through."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely had interesting ideas if nothing else. The way they use water to travel to the other side was neat."
"__MOVIES__ I could definitely go for another Constantine film. A sequel or a reboot or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think it'll happen, but I never thought we'd see a movie where Batman and Superman fight each other, so anything is possible."
