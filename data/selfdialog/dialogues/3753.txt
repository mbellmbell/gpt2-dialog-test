"__MUSIC__ Did you do pep band just in high school, or in college too?"
"__MUSIC__ I was in it in college as a tuba player. Trumpet was for high school."
"__MUSIC__ Any super fun experiences with that?"
"__MUSIC__ Just one. Mostly it was just garbage playing in the gym and getting paid."
"__MUSIC__ You got paid for that? I figured it would be for a credit."
"__MUSIC__ No, no credits. We performed pre-game, post-game, and during time-outs."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ 80's and 90s, for the most part."
"__MUSIC__ So how'd they pay you super-rich musicians?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly as you'd expect: $15, pizza, and soda."
"__MUSIC__ Yay pizza!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it was early 2000s Dominos when there was even less flavor."
"__MUSIC__ Ha. So, your favorite part?"
"__MUSIC__ Our women's basketball team was 11-17 going into the tournament, and won the conference at 14-17."
"__MUSIC__ Nice! Sounds like a weak conference."
"__MUSIC__ Very. So they went to the NCAA tournament. The athletics team flew us to Knoxville, where we played the #1 seed."
"__MUSIC__ I figure they lost. How'd the band sound?"
"__MUSIC__ Surprisingly, our band got the #1 ranking in the NCAA tournament!"
"__MUSIC__ Really? Wow!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah ... all the university's top bands were sent to the men's tournament. Kind of sad, but we sounded great anyway."
