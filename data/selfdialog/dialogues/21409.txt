"__THRILLER__ Have you seen the movie The Witch that came out last year?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, I wanted to see it badly after I saw the trailer"
"__THRILLER__ so what do you think"
"__THRILLER__ I think it's scary in a total different way, and it has some religious implications to it"
"__THRILLER__ oh yeah, what was that?"
"__THRILLER__ I think the isolated environment may indicate what would happen to some very devoted religious people if they're separated from the rest of the society"
"__THRILLER__ what would happen?"
"__THRILLER__ it would drive them crazy"
"__THRILLER__ sounds depressing"
"__THRILLER__ yeah, that's the underlying tone, not many people noticing it anyway"
