"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that Bears have the worst font office in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh absolutely. Just take a look at their last draft and how they are getting ridiculed for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On ESPN they said that the Bears were 'fleeced' by San Francisco GM John Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lynch came out looking like a hero after his draft day trade with the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure did. Rumor has it that he got whomhe wanted anyways at the end of the first day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Meanwhile the Bears pay up for Trubisky who probably won't even play for a couple years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! The bears have so many holes at several positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tons of holes and little experience across the board."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The draft is supposed to be used to build a roster up, not to gamble on a high risk quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't call Trubisky high risk, but the bears don't have the right system to support his development."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, drafting a division II tight end in the second round didn't help either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's my point exactly. The Bears front office has no idea how to build a roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if these high risk drafts don't pan out, then I would expect Gates to be fired as Bears GM after this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I think he set the Bears organization backwards at least three years with this disaster of a draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have preferred they traded down and stockpiled draft picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, you build a team through defense and bodies on both lines."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell that to the Bears!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish I could. I think they are killing this team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least one good thing will come from this terrible season the Bears will have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh don't you dare say that a Bears front office gets another high draft pick! Haha."
