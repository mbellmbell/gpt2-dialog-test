"__MUSIC__ Hey man, have any good band recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally! What genre are you looking for?"
"__MUSIC__ Surprise me."
"__MUSIC__ Well if you're looking for something alternative I'd say Stone Sour, Foo Fighters, or Smashing Pumpkins."
"__MUSIC__ What about something pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ My girlfriend got me hooked."
"__MUSIC__ I can't blame you as mine did the same. The Chainsmokers, Katy Perry, and Bruno Mars is what I like."
"__MUSIC__ So what do you listen to most lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Lately... mostly a lot of Falling In Reverse. I've played their newest album, Coming Home, so much I've practically worn it out."
"__MUSIC__ Really? It's that good huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Speaking of new CDs, have you heard Linkin Park's latest album?"
"__MUSIC__ Man I haven't heard from them in years. Think the last one I heard was Minutes to Midnight."
"__MUSIC__ Oh dude, that's a great one but One More Light is just as good if not better."
"__MUSIC__ Personally my favorite has been and will always be Hybrid Theory."
"__MUSIC__ Classic - one of my top 5 albums of all times. What'd you think of their remix cd - Reanimation?"
"__MUSIC__ Think there's only one or two songs on their I truly liked, but my girlfriend at the time it came out frikkin loved it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it wasn't really my cup of tea. It's the only one of theirs I never really liked."
"__MUSIC__ Gotta hand it to Link Park though. I never expected them to last as long as they have."
"__MUSIC__ True, true. They've really evolved and grown as artists and keep coming out with great new stuff... except Reanimation of course."
