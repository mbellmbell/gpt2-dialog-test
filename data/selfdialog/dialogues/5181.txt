"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Paul Walker was so cute in Fast and Furious."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I like Vin Diesel better."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How many movies have they made now?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't know maybe like 8. Furious 8 I think is what they were working on when Paul Walker died."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought it was neat how they still kept him in the film"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, it was. Did I hear his brother was a stand in for some of the stuff that hadn't been filmed yet?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm not sure about that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me either, I sure hate to see it end though"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well I heard Liam Nesson was going to be in the next one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That might be an interesting character change"
