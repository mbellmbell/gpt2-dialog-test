"__MOVIES__ Which Rocky movie is the best, in your opinion?"
"__MOVIES__ Rocky V, hands down."
"__MOVIES__ Very funny, try again."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, sorry about that. I'd have to say either Rocky II, Rocky IV, or Creed."
"__MOVIES__ Saying IV surprises me, as all it does is bank off of the US-Russian conflicts in the late 80's."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, professor. I like it because it has the most action by far and the biggest villain to bring down, and he does suffer the consequences in the future."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but Paulie and his robot."
"__MOVIES__ Let's not talk about that. They're awful."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's pretty bad. Why don't you include the original Rocky?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's not a boxing movie. It's a movie about a guy wearing sweatpants that contains occasional boxing. Even when there IS boxing, it's not very much."
"__MOVIES__ True, but the drama is top-notch."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Creed because while Michael Jordan did a great job, Rocky as a mentor was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he really came through."
"__MOVIES__ So what's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Rocky III."
"__MOVIES__ That's such a bad choice. Why?"
"__MOVIES__ I mark out for Hulk Hogan any day, and Mr. T absolutely destroys Rocky."
"__MOVIES__ Hulk's movies were awful."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe so, but it had the fastest-paced action of all the movies."
"__MOVIES__ At least we agree that V should be removed from the Universe."
