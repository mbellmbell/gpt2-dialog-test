"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the original Blade Runner?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, many times. It's one of my all time favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I found it very slow and boring."
"__MOVIES__ Slow and boring? It's deliberate. There's a difference. Regardless, you have to admit the special FX are amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the movie does look beautiful. Ridley Scott and his team created such a believable futuristic world."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that Deckard is a replicant?"
"__MOVIES__ What? No way. Why do yo think."
"__MOVIES__ Remember when he had the dream about the unicorn?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I remember. But why does that make him a replicant."
"__MOVIES__ Well, at the end, do you remember the origami figure Gaff left at Deckard's apartment?"
"__MOVIES__ A unicorn, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. So how would Gaff know what Deckard's dreams are unless he knew that they were implanted, as they would be in a replicant."
"__MOVIES__ Whoah. Never thought about that."
"__MOVIES__ It's another reason I love the movie so much. So many layers. But make sure you're watching the final cut of the final and not the theatrical release."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've seen the theatrical release and it is not the same."
"__MOVIES__ Way more overt in it's themes -- and I don't even think it has the unicorn dream, which sort of destroys the whole film."
"__MOVIES__ Do you prefer the Final Cut or the Director's Cut?"
"__MOVIES__ The Final Cut for sure. It's the best version of the film. And make sure to watch Dangerous Days, if you get a chance."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a 4 or 5 part documentary about the making of Blade Runner. A must-see."
