"__STAR_WARS__ Did you ever wonder where the Rancor came from?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What is the Rancor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's the big beast that Jabba the Hutt would feed prisoners to."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, the one that Luke finally kills when he closes the gate on it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's the one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that thing was pretty gross"
"__STAR_WARS__ So where do you think it came from?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably some obscure alien planet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, maybe from the Dagoba system"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha! Yeah, where Yoda lived."
