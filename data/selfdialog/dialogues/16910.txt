"__MOVIES__ Yes. One with the chariots, and russell crowe was all 'hey let's form the line' blah blah."
"__MOVIES__ Yes... I guess that should describe it. Any way, remember that scene where the chariot flips over?"
"__MOVIES__ Mm Hm."
"__MOVIES__ See they can't really ensure a chariot flips over like that unless you rig soemthing"
"__MOVIES__ Rig something like an explosion?"
"__MOVIES__ Something like that, except not really an explosion, you don't want people to get hurt."
"__MOVIES__ Of course not. Who wants a lawsuit."
"__MOVIES__ No. So what they did is rigging up an air cannon that will shoot enough air the flip the chariot over, but still be safe for those who are on the set."
"__MOVIES__ ok, and?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the camera caught the air caanon in the back of the chariot."
"__MOVIES__ Get out. no way!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, way. and there really was no way to edit it out without ruining the continuity of the movie, and they left it in"
"__MOVIES__ No way,. Get out... Ok I'm going to que that up and take a look."
"__MOVIES__ Go ahead. It's the scene where..."
"__MOVIES__ This is it. Be quiet. Is it after this? No wait, this is too far. Go back."
"__MOVIES__ It's where the chariot bumps into the side and flips over"
"__MOVIES__ I know!. ok I found it."
"__MOVIES__ See that gas tank? Just at the chariot flips over and the guy's thrown to the side, you see this giant gas tank."
