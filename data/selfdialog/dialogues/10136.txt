"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Did you like Biggie or Tupac more?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I have to go with Tupac but honestly I don't listen to much of either."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I liked his west coast style a little bit more."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I have to give them both respect, though. They were ahead of their time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Definitely. They are legends now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wonder if a lot of the east coast versus west coast rap drama was real."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, they did made diss tracks about each other."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True, but I think some of that was for publicity."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I doubt people really cared that much which coast their rap music came from."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly, I think it was just the rappers involved."
