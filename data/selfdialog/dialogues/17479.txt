"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen The Mist?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think that I saw it about four years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it written by Stephen King?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and I think that it was directed by Frank Darabont as well."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it. I thought that it was more interesting than most movies out today."
"__MOVIES__ Did you read the book?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the book came out a long time ago. I read the book so many times I almost memorized it!"
"__MOVIES__ Was the movie faithful to the book?tt"
"__MOVIES__ For the most part, it did. There were a few changes."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ A lot of little changes, but the biggest one was the ending."
"__MOVIES__ How did it end in the book?"
"__MOVIES__ It was kind of an open ending, King himself called it 'hitchcockian.' You wer left to come up with your own conclusion."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is a lot different than that gut punch of an ending that was in the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I agree, but Stephen King said that he liked the movies ending."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I'm surprised!"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, he said he wished his book was as good as the movie! Why did you bring it up though?"
"__MOVIES__ They're coming up with a TV show based on the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Awesome! Would you like to watch the movie again to get ready for watching the show?"
