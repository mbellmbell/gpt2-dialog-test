"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite moment from Fantasia?"
"__DISNEY__ Cal me old fashioned but the Sorcerer's Apprentice part always gets me."
"__DISNEY__ Is that the one with Mickey and all the brooms?"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, I think it's a classic."
"__DISNEY__ Yea definitely. That part always stressed me out as a kid. I was always a big fan of the dancing hippos."
"__DISNEY__ In the pink ballerina outfits? I loved them."
"__DISNEY__ I cannot watch it and not laugh."
"__DISNEY__ Yea they were hilarious. They were big but they could definitely move."
"__DISNEY__ I wish I could stay on my tip toes like them."
"__DISNEY__ Yea I never thought I'd wish to be as graceful as a hippo."
