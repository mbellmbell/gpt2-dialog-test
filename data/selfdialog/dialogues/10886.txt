"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think are the best NFL quarterbacks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Tom Brady is very good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is but I feel he has a very good offense around him that helps him a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I've also always been a big fan of Drew Brees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's a great player and a great guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was glad to see that he plans to play another season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I saw some questions arising about his contract extension."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He mentioned that he wants to win another championship. Basically confirming he'll continue to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's good. He really is fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Andrew Luck is great, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always forget to consider him. He is very impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't talk quarterbacks without talking about Matt Ryan, also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His arm was so scary last year. He was throwing rockets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Precision rockets at that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers is really great too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's coming up on 300 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw that. He'll definitely hit it this coming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He'll be one of only 10 quarterbacks to do so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he'll be the only one to have done it with less than 100 interceptions thrown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? That's just shows how talented he is."
