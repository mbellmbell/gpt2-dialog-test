"__MUSIC__ Hey have you listened to Damn yet?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who's that by?"
"__MUSIC__ Kendrick Lamar"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love him, I didn't know he released a new album"
"__MUSIC__ It's so good, album of the year so far in my opinion"
"__MUSIC__ Really? Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ There's not a single bad song on the album, and the features are great"
"__MUSIC__ Who are the features?"
"__MUSIC__ U2, Rihanna, and Zacari"
"__MUSIC__ That's an interesting mix, I'll check it out"
"__MUSIC__ I think you'll love it"
"__MUSIC__ Is it anything like his past stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'd say it's less lyrical but the beats are much better"
"__MUSIC__ Better than 'To Pimp a Butterfly'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it's better but that's a great album too"
"__MUSIC__ How does it stack up against stuff like J. Cole's newest album?"
"__MUSIC__ I like it much better, but I also thought Cole's album was kinda boring"
"__MUSIC__ You know he wrote that album about his daughter, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I know, it just doesn't really do it for me"
"__MUSIC__ To each their own I guess"
