"__DISNEY__ Who do you think will play Mulan in the new live-action Mulan movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Gosh, I have no idea. How can that movie possibly live up to the original?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know. I have high hopes, though."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they cast Lucy Liu."
"__DISNEY__ No way, she's too old!"
"__DISNEY__ I hope they cast another unknown. That girl was so good in Moana!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I agree, although I can't remember her name."
"__DISNEY__ Me neither, I'll look it up later. She's so talented though."
"__DISNEY__ And she's only 14!"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, I wish I could sing like that when I was 14. Or now!"
