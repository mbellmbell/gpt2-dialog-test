"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was great. It fit really well into the over-arching Star Wars story."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. I thought it shoehorned very cleanly into the existing narrative."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like that Disney and LucasFilms has been incorporating strong female leads."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Jyn Erso was a great character in Rogue One and Rey was a great character in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm really interested to see where the story goes with Rey in the next saga movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I'm super excited for The Last Jedi to be released."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's so much speculation right now about what is going to happen in the next story."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I don't get too wrapped up in that as I don't want to know too much of the storyline going into the next movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I like to be surprised too."
