"__BEATLES__ Just sitting here listening to Breakfast with the Beatles..It's on on Sunday mornings on the local rock station. Good Stuff."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah, I don't know much about the Beatles. They're pretty old right."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, they've been around a long time, but their songs are so classic. Hey Jude is one of my favorites."
"__BEATLES__ I love the song Yesterday...that's them right?"
"__BEATLES__ Yep, they had a ton of good songs, although some times they got a little wierd."
"__BEATLES__ What do you mean?"
"__BEATLES__ Well there is one called 'I am the eggman' at least I think that's what it is, and it is strange. Literally they say 'I am the eggman, I am the walrus..coo coo coo choo'"
"__BEATLES__ WTH? Really? They must have been on some serious stuff."
"__BEATLES__ Maybe, it was the 60's after all. I know alot of people say John Lennon was a drug user."
"__BEATLES__ Didn't he get shot?"
