"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think that Seattle has enough to still be great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well they do if they can stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that is the case for every team. Health is always a major factor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it is and it becomes more of one as players get older."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. The Seahawks do have players that have been around a while, but they haven't had too many injuries"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but they play hard and as they get older, I'm not sure what will happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well if they can't make noise this year, plenty of other teams will."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if you're looking for good quarterback play, maybe the Packers have some magic in them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I thought they were slowing down last year until they turned it on late in the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they sure did. Its like Rodgers just flipped a switch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Rodgers can take it to another level and for that, you cannot count out the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I wouldn't count out Dallas either. They had a good team last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well that offensive line is fierce and they have a couple playmakers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. I'm just not sure whether or not they can take the next step."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, young quarterbacks these days have what it takes to win early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that puts the pressure on their young quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does, but I think he may be able to handle it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, especially with the help of Ezeqquial Elliott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it should be a wide open race in the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, lots of teams."
