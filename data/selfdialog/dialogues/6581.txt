"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars has created so much memorable things in pop culture."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. And not just characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's why I said so much memorable things. There's things like worlds, races, weapons, spacecraft, and so much more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't forget about the robots!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right. The robots are just as memorable as some of the other characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ R2-D2 is my younger cousin's favorite character in the entire film series."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I get that they're young, but why R2?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's just it. They're still young, and they find R2 to be funny."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I need to be a little more open minded."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't worry about it. You're fine."
