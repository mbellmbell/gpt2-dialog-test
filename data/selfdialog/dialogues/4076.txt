"__MUSIC__ I hated my undergrad concert band director."
"__MUSIC__ Adams?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, him."
"__MUSIC__ I never met him but heard great things about him."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's in the college band director hall of fame, but behind the scenes he was an awful director."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he was kind of creepy. The student helpers were always attractive girls and he was in his 70's."
"__MUSIC__ Did he hit on them?"
"__MUSIC__ A bit, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Gross."
"__MUSIC__ He also used the method of yelling to get results, instead of being calm."
"__MUSIC__ Did he ever yell at you?"
"__MUSIC__ Once, without calling me out. I played a wrong note completely out of character, and he lost his head."
"__MUSIC__ Sorry, but you should have played the right note."
"__MUSIC__ I played an A-natural instead of an A-flat."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, during a big moment?"
"__MUSIC__ Fortissimo, full band. Stuck out like crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Did the audience laugh?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it was during rehearsal."
"__MUSIC__ That's good, at least."
