"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! Are you going to watch the NFL this year? Are you excited for camp?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I don't know if I will watch much this year. I think it is not as entertaining as it used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Patriots will repeat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a strong chance too. The rest of the division is bad which means an automatic trip to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be awkward for the Raiders to keep playing in Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I don't think they'll play the full 3 years there. Maybe they'll play somewhere else or move early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least the Raiders are good though. And they have Marshawn Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Carr is getting paid a lot to play this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Chargers won't get any fans this year either. LA doesn't need or want a second bad team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Rams didn't get a ton of fans either, so I can't imagine this is a slam dunk investment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your favorite player to watch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like Julio Jones on Atlanta. He's huge and fast. Atlanta should have won the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that it's a good idea for Roger Goodell to stay in the commissioner's office with all of his controversies?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he knows what he's doing, and this Redskins problem isn't going away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you in favor of the team name changing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. It's pretty offensive and the history of how it came about is too. Snyder is a terrible owner and Cousins will probably leave after this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it that bad? Cousins has some talent but he is wild."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The team doesn't treat or engage with him like they should, and it shows. He requested a trade, it's only a matter of time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh well. At least the season starts soon! I'm excited for Marshawn to be back in my life!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be fun to watch at least. I probably won't play fantasy football though. Just enjoy it for what the NFL is."
