"__MUSIC__ Oh cool. You ever heard of Maps and Atlases?"
"__MUSIC__ No. Would I like them?"
"__MUSIC__ They're definitely an indie band."
"__MUSIC__ What genre are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they're pretty experimental."
"__MUSIC__ So like math rock?"
"__MUSIC__ You could call it that."
"__MUSIC__ You wouldn't?"
"__MUSIC__ They're more like alternative folk I guess."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ It is. Like I said, they're hard to pin down."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I can just give them a listen?"
"__MUSIC__ You definitely should. Their last one is called Beware and Be Grateful."

"__MUSIC__ Cool. I'll give it a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Come over sometime and I'll let you borrow the album."
