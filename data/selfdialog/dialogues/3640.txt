"__MUSIC__ So have you heard that The Killers are releasing their new album soon?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I hadn't....Do you know when?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure exactly but I think in the next month or so."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool.  How did you find out?"
"__MUSIC__ I read it online.  They had released a new video."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really?  What's the name of the song?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called 'The Man'."
"__MUSIC__ So what did you think of it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I've only heard it a couple times but I'm not so sure about it."
"__MUSIC__ Is it nothing special or just maybe a grower?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a little cheesy, to be frank about it.  I expected more."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, they have made some exceptional music.  What were you hoping for?"
"__MUSIC__ The thing is - I loved Battle Born, their last album.  I was hoping it would at least be up to those standards."
"__MUSIC__ Did you think it might be?"
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't optimistic because the lead singer, Brandon Flowers, said that Battle Born was an inconsistent record.  I thought it was outstanding so I couldn't see where his head was at."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I understand.  Well maybe the rest of the album will be better!"
"__MUSIC__ I sure hope so.  Someone has to keep the New Wave flag flying!"
"__MUSIC__ Why, is that your favorite type of music?"
"__MUSIC__ It sure is.  Music from the 80's is still the best."
"__MUSIC__ There certainly were some awesome tunes!"
