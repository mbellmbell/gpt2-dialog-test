"__MOVIES__ You know what movie was really sad?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure a lot of movies but which one do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean the movie Marley and Me."
"__MOVIES__ The one about that dog right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was based on a book."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that now. It came out when my son was a little baby."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it, very good movie but sad."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I agree. I loved Jennifer Aniston's character."
"__MOVIES__ She was an amazing mom in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I was afraid at one point they may get rid of Marley. Thankfully they didn't."
"__MOVIES__ I know, such a sweet and loyal dog."
"__MOVIES__ I just have a softness for animal movies."
"__MOVIES__ I really do too."
"__MOVIES__ What kills me is when she died at the end of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I wish dogs lived longer."
"__MOVIES__ If they could live as long as people that would be great."
"__MOVIES__ I know, like tortoises who seem to live long."
"__MOVIES__ It just seems sadder when an animal dies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Even more so than a human."
