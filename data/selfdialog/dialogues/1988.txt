"__MUSIC__ I just started listening to the Jonas Brothers again and it's so great."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I don't think I've listened to them since middle school."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither, until the other day and now I can't stop listening to them."
"__MUSIC__ I can't even remember what songs they sing."
"__MUSIC__ 'Burnin' Up,' 'When You Look Me in the Eyes', 'Year 3000.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right. That was them!"
"__MUSIC__ They're actually so good. I don't know why I ever stopped listening to them."
"__MUSIC__ I think I just stopped listening to them because my tastes changed as I grew older."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you should give them another try. They're so good."
"__MUSIC__ Are they even making new music anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they broke up in 2013."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't even know that happened."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they all kind of grew out of it."
"__MUSIC__ Do they still do anything individually?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of. Nick has a solo career and Joe joined DNCE."
"__MUSIC__ What about the other one?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you mean Kevin?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. What's he up to?"
"__MUSIC__ He's married with two daughters."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, they seemed to get old so fast."
