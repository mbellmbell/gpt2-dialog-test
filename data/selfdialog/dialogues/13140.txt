"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, we have an open spot in our fantasy football league this year, do you want in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks, but I'm already in three long running leagues. Who do you like at QB this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Russell Wilson. He needs to take it all the way this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sticking with Brady, I think he has one more ring in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In fantasy, I don't like to waste early picks on QB's. I also like Derek Carr and Jameis Winston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ QB's can rack up a lot of points, I also like Matt Ryan. What position do you pick first?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wide outs, they also rack up a lot of points and most people don't look at them in the first rounds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good point. Who is on top of your list list year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mike Evans and Antonio Brown. The Steelers are def contenders this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I like Odell and Julio Jones. Atlanta is looking good too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right about that. They have a great D and Ryan has some awesome targets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so stoked it's almost time for preseason.  Who is your favorite running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Le'Veon Bell. Another reason why the Steelers could take home a ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish the Pats had more strength on the ground."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ James White had better stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see. They got a couple of good backs in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Dak Presscot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm no Cowboys fan but that guy looks good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Prescott could be a real diamond in the rough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tyrod Taylor is also going to turn some heads this year."
