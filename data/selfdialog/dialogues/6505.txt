"__STAR_WARS__ I think the prequels are superior to the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Eat your words."
"__STAR_WARS__ No I mean seriously, the effects are far superior, better acting, directing, etc"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course the special effects are better. We have CGI on much faster computers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even accounting for that, the imagination is so much more involved in the prequels than the original."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't even know what that even means. For its day, the original trilogy was pretty good in terms of the storyline and imaginative uses of so many things"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Light saber for instance. Who wold've imagined a sword made of light?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Now that you put it like that..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep. It was pretty innovative thinking."
