"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you know which character I feel was underused in 'Fate of the Furious?'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Which character?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Ramsey."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ She was the character portrayed by Nathalie Emmanuel from 'Game of Thrones' right?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea that's her.  She barely did anything in the last movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I did notice that too.  She was almost just there for Tyrese and Tej to fight over."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Also, the fact that she is a super hacker is almost redundant."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea.  I mean why does the group need another hacker when Tej has already been doing everything else for them?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I understood Ramsey's role in Furious 7, but they sort of shoehorned her in."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I hope they utilize her character more in the next movie, as she is a phenomenal actress."
