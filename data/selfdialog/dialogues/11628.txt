"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you kept up with the NFL during the off season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not much. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I don't even know how the draft went."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either but I hope the Falcons have a good season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. That Matt Ryan is really something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he has another season like last season they'll be good again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he does but they need some defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got that right. But it was better than season before last."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what they say, offense brings in the fans..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But defense wins championships."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was sure true this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh huh. I still can't believe how the defense blew that lead in the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the worst collapses in the history of sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to bet against Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much longer can that guy go on?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's got to call it quits someday. But maybe it will be a Falcons-Patriots rematch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't mind seeing that at all. Especially if the Falcons could win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They deserve one, you know, after all this time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Never had one yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well maybe the 2018 Super Bowl will be theirs. Finally!"
