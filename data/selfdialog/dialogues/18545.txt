"__MOVIES__ Have you heard about that new movie with Scarlett Johansson?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so, what is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness it looks so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think Jillian Bell and a few others."
"__MOVIES__ I might have seen a trailer for it. Is it the movie about a bachelorette party?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! A group of friends get together for a bachelorette party and some crazy things happen. It looks so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ It's called 'Rough Night'. Do you know when it comes out?"
"__MOVIES__ I think sometime in June right before Father's Day."
"__MOVIES__ We will have to go see it, I wish Melissa McCarthy was in it though. She's my favorite, and her movie with Sandra Bullock was the best!"
"__MOVIES__ The Heat?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That's my absolute favorite movie of hers."
"__MOVIES__ That was a really great movie, but it almost seemed too far from reality."
"__MOVIES__ You think so? I thought it was great."
"__MOVIES__ I'll tell you a great movie. When they remade Ghostbusters!"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, yes! I completely agree."
"__MOVIES__ I think they did a really good job remaking it. I honestly wasn't excited to see it at first."
"__MOVIES__ I was the same way. I thought they couldn't ever make it even remotely close to the quality of the original."
"__MOVIES__ I just looked up Rough Night and it comes out June 16th."
"__MOVIES__ Let's plan on going!"
