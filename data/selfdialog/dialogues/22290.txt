"__DISNEY__ I can't remember-- which Disney movie did 'When You Wish Upon A Star' come from?"
"__DISNEY__ That's from Pinocchio."
"__DISNEY__ Thanks, I remember now! Jiminy Cricket was so cute."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and Pinocchio sure needed Jiminy Cricket to be his conscience."
"__DISNEY__ That movie had a good message for kids about lying and disobeying."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, and it was presented with the usual Disney magic."
"__DISNEY__ True, it taught kids a lesson without being too preachy."
"__DISNEY__ Looking at the state of the world today, some people really needed to see Pinocchio when they were kids."
"__DISNEY__ It's too bad real people's noses don't grow every time they lie."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. It would make my life easier if they did!"
