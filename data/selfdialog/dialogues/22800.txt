"__DISNEY__ We were watching a couple Disney movies on dvd at my aunt's house this weekend, and one of them was Moana. My aunt was telling me how this movie made people upset."
"__DISNEY__ It's a Disney movie, what could people be upset about?"
"__DISNEY__ Apparently, the character Maui is a big huge guy, and it upset people because they felt it was sterotyping Polynesians as fat."
"__DISNEY__ Well, some of them are really big."
"__DISNEY__ The character isn't meant really to even be so much as fat though, as he is just really big and strong."
"__DISNEY__ But so what if he is fat? Why do people have to look at fat as bad and sterotyping? That's like saying if you are fat, it's bad."
"__DISNEY__ Especially with it being a kid's movie, cause a lot of kids these days are overweight, so it's kind of indirectly shaming them if you say there's something bad about Disney making him so big."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly. And I don't think kids would even see it that way, without adults coloring their persception by pointing it out."
"__DISNEY__ It's like the adults are saying if you are big, you can't just blend in, you are noticable."
"__DISNEY__ It's a shame people have to ruin something innocent like a Disney movie by making a controversy about it."
