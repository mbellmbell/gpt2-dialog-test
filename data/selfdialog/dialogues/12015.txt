"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is Peyton Manning the greatest QB ever?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not enough Super Bowl wins"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So theres a set amount?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To be the greatest ever, yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So Brady eclipsed him by 2004?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It looks like that now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what about all the yards he racked up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just numbers at this point and not enough to grant him the best ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He still is a surefire Hall of Famer!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah thats true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think his Denver years were alright though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That last year wasnt all that good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady has been doing it consistently."
