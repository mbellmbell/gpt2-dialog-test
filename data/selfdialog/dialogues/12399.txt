"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much Fantasy Football are you doing this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going with 4 different leagues, what about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm down to one right now. I'm working on some other NFL projects instead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know - it's hard to keep track of all the teams and the players"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm starting to research the salary cap more and which teams are most affected."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are a lot of teams up against the cap?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say more half the teams including the Cowboys and Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Giants?  Are they going to have room to resign Eli to one more contract?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have the room, but I doubt they with that young kid in the wings"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought the same about Brady, with Garrapolo still on the roster"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jimmy G will have to be paid one way or another."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Brady has said he's playing till he's 45"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know he is good now but at some point father time will catch up"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, it's just hard to imagine given how well he's playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know - the drop off will be quick. Remember Peyton?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do - but he had all of those neck issues."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but all it takes is one wrong move, and there goes the know"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady takes care of himself, so I think it have to be some sort of freak injury"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why they are keeping Jimmy G around"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think its a good idea to be planning ahead like that"
