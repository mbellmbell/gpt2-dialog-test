"__STAR_WARS__ OK, so favorite Star Wars moment. Go!"
"__STAR_WARS__ OK. Wait, do you mean in the movie, or like, where we were at certain times?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Let's stick to movie moments."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, OK. I don't know if I have a favorite. There's so many. How about when Lando walks in on Darth and Darth says 'I am altering the arrangement. Pray that I do not alter it further.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha, yeah, that's a great one. How about when Han and Leia are on Hoth, and she calls him a scruffy, no good nerfherder."
"__STAR_WARS__ 'Who's scruffy looking?' Ha, classic."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know, I like to use the line 'Seems like I'm going nowhere' when someone asks me where I'm going."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha, yeah, Luke on Tatooine. Nice. 'But I was going to go to Tasha Station and pick up some power converters!'"
"__STAR_WARS__ The whole movie is just full of quotable moments."
"__STAR_WARS__ Just one long string of them!"
