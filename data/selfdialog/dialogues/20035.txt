"__MOVIES__ Did you watch the old Nightmare on Elm Street movies?"
"__MOVIES__ The Freddy movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes those ones."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen some of them why?"
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking for halloween we could watch them all together for a movie night."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds fun, but why that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's an old classic and in my opinion the best horror/thriller movies ever."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but being scary doesn't make them great."
"__MOVIES__ You're right it's also the humor and the hilarious scenes like the water bed scene."
"__MOVIES__ I do remember that one and yeah they're pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think the humor fits in them?"
"__MOVIES__ It does in this case but wouldn't in a Jason movie he's too serious."
"__MOVIES__ Freddy reminds me of Joker from Batman."
"__MOVIES__ That's a pretty good comparison I think."
"__MOVIES__ So you're game to watch them again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I also haven't seen them all how many are there."
"__MOVIES__ A lot."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it's going to be a long night should I bring food."
"__MOVIES__ Good Idea."
"__MOVIES__ Chips and burgers."
