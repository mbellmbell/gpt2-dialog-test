"__DISNEY__ I just saw 'Brave' on Netflix."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah? It's an interesting movie. Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ It's ok, it's like a different take on the classic 'Princess' storyline."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was interesting how her mother turned into a bear."
"__DISNEY__ Right?! That was weird. But why was I so ready for her to ride her 'Mother Bear' into battle."
"__DISNEY__ I thought the same thing, or at least use the mother in a fight."
"__DISNEY__ You know the princess, Merida, was played by Kelly Macdonald."
"__DISNEY__ Cool, I didn't know that."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she did a good job, you could really hear the emotion in her voice."
"__DISNEY__ I think all of the voice actors did a good job."
