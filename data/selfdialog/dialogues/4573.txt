"__MUSIC__ What do you think is the best guitar rock album?"
"__MUSIC__ It might be sacrilegious to not pick an album that is blues heavy, but the post-punk album 'Marquee Moon' by Television is the best."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ The band has two guitar players and their riffs connect, break apart, interrupt, rise, fall, build in ways that are so perfect."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really like the few songs I know by them. Marquee Moon, the title track, has one of my favorite solos of all time."
"__MUSIC__ At that time, I think their sound was with little precedent."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Marquee Moon is from 1977 if I'm not mistaken."
"__MUSIC__ Yup! It's so epic and fresh even to this day."
"__MUSIC__ And it's not super showy. They weren't like 'rock star' types."
"__MUSIC__ For sure, on the album cover for Marquee Moon they look emaciated and awkward."
"__MUSIC__ I won't put down their looks too much, but it suffices to say they don't look like showy rock stars."
"__MUSIC__ But they do play like rock stars. Such distinct style and flare."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, their influence crops up everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ I'm thinking of The Strokes, for sure, but their influence is generally all over alternative rock."
"__MUSIC__ Not Creed."
"__MUSIC__ That goes without saying! Their fingerprints are all over artsy, post-punk influence alternative rock."
"__MUSIC__ The Pixies too!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and The Pixies in turn influenced everyone, including Nirvana!"
"__MUSIC__ Right on. Do you have any suggestions for bands that I might like if I like Television."
"__MUSIC__ Check out Richard Hell."
