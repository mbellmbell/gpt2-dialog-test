"__STAR_WARS__ The Empire Strikes Back is not as good as the original Star Wars"
"__STAR_WARS__ How can you say that? Empire is awesome"
"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars had to create a universe people would be interested in. Empire just expanded it a bit and added a dumb twist"
"__STAR_WARS__ A dumb twist? it set up one of the best conflicts ever."
"__STAR_WARS__ They had to retcon all the Luke and Leia stuff to make it make sense.But its still creepy"
"__STAR_WARS__ Since they didnt know they were related the stuff in Star Wars comes off as harmless flirting."
"__STAR_WARS__ It still seems like they added that after the fact rather than having a master plan. Star Wars is a complete experience on its own"
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree that Star Wars built a great world but Empire gave it emotion."
"__STAR_WARS__ All the emotion was present in the first film to use. They didn't have to add a silly soap opera plot to expand it"
"__STAR_WARS__ It wouldn't be the Skywalker Saga without a bit of soap opera melodrama to it."
