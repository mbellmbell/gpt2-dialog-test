"__DISNEY__ I was so happy to see that they re-released Oliver!"
"__DISNEY__ Really?  Why?"
"__DISNEY__ I remember seeing it in the theatre as a kid but they didn't release it on tape back then."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that, I wonder why they didn't release it."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know why, but I know that we would have had it if they did.  My mom even loved that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Interesting.  Do you have it now?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but I'm planning on buying it next week."
"__DISNEY__ When you do, let's have a viewing party!"
"__DISNEY__ Ok, that sounds like fun.  You bring the popcorn!"
"__DISNEY__ Ok!  'You and me together, you'll see. Forever, we'll be.'"
