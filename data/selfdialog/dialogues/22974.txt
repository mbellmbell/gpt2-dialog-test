"__DISNEY__ I'm fostering another litter of orphaned bottle fed kittens for the cat rescue I volunteer for."
"__DISNEY__ Aw, you are so kind. I know it's got to be a lot of work. But I bet they are super cute."
"__DISNEY__ Oh they're adorable. They are a lot of work. One of the hardest parts is naming them, and thinking up something cute that will attract attention."
"__DISNEY__ So what did you name them?"
"__DISNEY__ I like to name them after characters from Disney movies, so hopefully they will attract families with kids who will play with them."
"__DISNEY__ That's a great idea. And it gives you lots of possibilities for names."
"__DISNEY__ Two of them are little grey tigers, a boy and girl, and I named them Kiara and Kovu, from The Lion King 2 Simba's pride."
"__DISNEY__ Those are really unique names, they are sure to get attention!"
"__DISNEY__ The other two are grey and white girls, I named them Elsa from Frozen and Ariel from The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure you'll find some little girls who want to adopt kittens with names like those!"
