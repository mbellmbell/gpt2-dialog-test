"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to Hank Williams, Jr.?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course!  I love the old country classics."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love the song Family Tradition."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!  I like to turn that one up and sing it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is great.  Patsy Cline is great, too."
"__MUSIC__ I love her music as well!  There's nothing like Stand By Your Man."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that's a great one.  It's so different from today's country music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's really changed.  There's great stuff out today, too though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I feel like it was better back in Hank's day, but who knows."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it's just a matter of opinion. There's a lot more diversity out there today."
"__MUSIC__ True, true."
"__MUSIC__ And Garth Brooks and Alan Jackson are really classics as well."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you could say that.  I do love Garth Brooks."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too."
"__MUSIC__ It's strange to think that Garth and Alan are almost becoming like oldies now."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  I hear them on the classic country station sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I do too.  That is odd to me because I can remember when they were new."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, we are getting old my friend."
"__MUSIC__ The music is dating us!"
"__MUSIC__ It really is."
