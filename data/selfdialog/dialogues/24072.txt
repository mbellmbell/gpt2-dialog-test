"__SUPERHERO__ Battle of the silly superhero movies: Ant-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I liked the action a lot more in Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too, but I liked Ant-Man a lot more."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why?"
"__SUPERHERO__ It had me cracking up a lot harder, and still had the villain to defeat and the origin story."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, there was a lot in a little bit of time."
"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think they're TOO goofy?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, but Guardians 2 for sure was bordering on insanely goofy to the point where I couldn't take it seriously."
"__SUPERHERO__ Favorite part of Ant-Man?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I was cracking up like a child when he was throwing all those toys out of the house and they were dodging huge cars. Hysterical!"
