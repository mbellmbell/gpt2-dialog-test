"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the trailer for the movie It?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Please don't remind me!"
"__MOVIES__ Why? Don't you like Stephen King?"
"__MOVIES__ I do. The problem is that it reminds me of how terrifying clowns can be."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know what you mean. How about when it runs through the water?"
"__MOVIES__ You're not helping!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sorry. I know lots of people are terrified by Pennywise."
"__MOVIES__ I hope it has an R rating. It really can be too scary for kids."
"__MOVIES__ True. The previous version came out all the way back when we were kids, and it was terrifying."
"__MOVIES__ There sure have been a lot of Stephen King movie adaptations over the years."
"__MOVIES__ Have there? What are some examples?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's easy. There's Cell, Carrie and Children of the Corn, just to name a few."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Carrie and Children of the Corn came out a very long time ago."
"__MOVIES__ They made new ones in 2011 and 2013."
"__MOVIES__ Were they remakes?"
"__MOVIES__ Carrie was a remake in 2013. Children of the Corn was a sequel in 2011."
"__MOVIES__ Were they any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Carrie got mixed reviews. I'm not sure about Children of the Corn."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Carrie?"
"__MOVIES__ I did. It was okay."
