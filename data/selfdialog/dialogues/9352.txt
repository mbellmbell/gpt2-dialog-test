"__BASEBALL__ Why are aluminum bats allowed in the MLB?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's just a regulation."
"__BASEBALL__ But it's a stupid regulation."
"__BASEBALL__ It's a tradition. Besides, wooden bats make so much better sound when it hits the ball. not like aluminum bat which that high pitched metallic sound"
"__BASEBALL__ So amateurs are allowed to use aluminum?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. Amateurs at collegiate and below can use either wooden or aluminum bats. Except in high school there is one more rule"
"__BASEBALL__ Like what?"
"__BASEBALL__ Hollowed out metal alloy bats can return the ball at a higher speed given the same power."
"__BASEBALL__ And...?"
"__BASEBALL__ They have a way to quantify that property of a hollow bat. It's called BBCOR"
"__BASEBALL__ BB what?"
"__BASEBALL__ BBCOR. Batted ball coefficient of restitution."
"__BASEBALL__ That can't be real"
"__BASEBALL__ oh, it's real alright. There's even a formula Mathematician came up with in order to characterize the bats."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, what the hell is the point of that?"
"__BASEBALL__ The point is that the wood, when it hit the ball, deforms, absorbign some of its energy, which decreases the speed at which the ball will be returned out"
"__BASEBALL__ And the BBCOR bats don't?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not that they don't, but it give them the way to control how fast the ball get returned after it's hit by the bat. hollow bats return the ball faster given the same power"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I see, so it's a safety thing"
"__BASEBALL__ yes,. By giving kids the aluminum bats, they can swing it, but still protect the pitchers and the infield because the speed at which the ball returns is limited by the bat."
