"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which NFL team do you think has the best defense in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After last season, it's really hard to choose between the Patriots, Broncos, and Vikings"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Vikings had kept going on their path, they could have swept the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had such a strong start, I wonder what happened to them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but they say defense wins championships, and they didn't even make the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Patriots defense was ranked much higher than the Falcons defense, so I suppose that makes sense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Texans had the best defense statistically, even though they played only average"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really depends on the strength of a team's schedule, otherwise the numbers don't mean a whole lot"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos did well enough considering they lost Peyton Manning"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He shouldn't have been that much of a factor since the defense carrie the team all the way to the Superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then what about the Seahawks defense? Better than the Broncos defense or not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're better as a whole, but both teams are lopsided on offense and defense that it doesn't matter"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Balance is definitely a huge factor in the league, which is why the Falcons lack of a strong defense cost them so dearly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think their defense was that bad, but then they did give up almost 30 points late in the game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So consistency is more important, since a lot of games are won and lost in the final minutes"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely like to see a game played at its fullest to the final whistle"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Andew Luck is a great quarterback who has a knack for making late game-winning comebacks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So is Matthew Stafford, although you wouldn't know it by the Lions' record the last few seasons"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember when they made the playoffs only to lose to the Cowboys in the first game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was one of the most disappointing games I've watched, and I hope Matthew Stafford takes the team all the way next season"
