"__SUPERHERO__ You know something funny about Superman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ What?"
"__SUPERHERO__ The fact that this superhuman hero is a dark haired male when the Nazis were coming into power in Germany."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did Germans have access to American comic books?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes and no. The Nazis banned comic books in 1933. And the SS took it very negatively that the creator of Superman was a jew."
"__SUPERHERO__ Superman was created by a jew? That makes sense that he has dark hair then."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, and quite ironic given the timing and what was going on in Germany"
"__SUPERHERO__ Indeed."
"__SUPERHERO__ The first Superman film was back in 1948, acted by an unknown actor at the time, Kirk Alyn."
"__SUPERHERO__ I wish I could see that movie."
