"__ACTION__ Dude, I wish Arnold was still making action movies. Nobody had lines like him."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, but wasn't he in one recently?"
"__ACTION__ I don't know, maybe they did some remake. Weren't they going to remake T2?"
"__ACTION__ How could they remake that? 'I cannot self-terminate.'"
"__ACTION__ That is the best line! That molten metal dude was pretty cool too."
"__ACTION__ That was the terminator sent to kill Arnold! They had some great effects for the time."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I remember that scene when the metal blobs join together and turn into the bad cop."
"__ACTION__ That cop had an evil look to him. I wonder what the real cops thought."
"__ACTION__ I bet all cops like Arnold."
"__ACTION__ They should make a film where he is now a police chief who gets down and dirty on the front lines."
