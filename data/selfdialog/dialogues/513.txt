"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite boy band?"
"__MUSIC__ Gosh, probably the Backstreet Boys but that's a tough call!"
"__MUSIC__ I love them too.  They have such a great classic sound to them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they do, and they are wholesome unlike so many bands today."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  Their first album was in 1996, but they released one just recently in 2013."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know they just released one!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was their 20th anniversary album.  It's hard to believe they've been around that long."
"__MUSIC__ I guess they're not boys anymore."
"__MUSIC__ No, but they're still making great music."
"__MUSIC__ They're the best selling boy band in history, aren't they?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I heard.  My favorite song is still I Want it That Way."
"__MUSIC__ I love that one, but I also really like The One."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have a greatest hits album that's pretty awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I can listen to that whole album without skipping a song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too."
"__MUSIC__ They actually had a joint tour with New Kids on the Block, which is kinda cool."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that is neat!  I would've loved to see that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and they've started filming some movies now."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really? I guess that was inevitable."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, music and film seems to cross so much lately."
