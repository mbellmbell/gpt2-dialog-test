"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you listen to very much rap that's political in nature?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not really—is there political rap?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Absolutely! Some of the earliest stuff that was commercially released has political messages."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Like what songs?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, 'The Message' by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. It came out in the early 80s."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Old school."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Totally. But it's really interesting—all about the plight of the inner cities in the early 1980s. Has a lot of really interesting social commentary, not just good rhymes."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Grandmaster Flash? Isn't he also a DJ?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yeah, he's awesome. So amazing at scratching and cutting and he wasn't even using a laptop of anything! You should check out the movie Wild Style for some of this old school style."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Will do!"
