"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will have the best defense in the NFL next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you have to start with the best defense in the league last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Houston Texans were the best last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?    They were better than the Arizona Cardinals?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cardinals were close, but ranked second."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought J.J. Watt being out would've hurt the Texans more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but the rise of Jedaveon Clowney helped out quite a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but the pass rush still wasn't as strong, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Clowney and Whitney Mercilus did a good job together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, I can see that    Is Watt healthy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has been working in the preseason workouts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, add the best defensive player in the league to the best defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, if everyone is healthy, it will be almost impossible to score on the Texans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't they change up some things on the coaching staff?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.     Romeo Crennel was promoted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will that hurt the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, Crennel is still present, and the new coordinator has been with the franchise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the name of the new Defensive Coordinator?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is Mike Vrabel."
