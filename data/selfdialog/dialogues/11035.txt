"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, which team is your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seattle Seahawks.  I have been a fan since childhood."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Seahawks can win the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely think they can if they stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite team is the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yuck, I hate the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, lots of people do, but I love that they are always good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess.  How long do you think Tom Brady can continue to play at a high level?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's nearly 40, but I think he may have 5 years left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that would really be impressive to play to 45."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Russell Wilson will have a good year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely.  I read he changed his diet this offseason in an effort to remain healthier than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Excellent.  He did have several injuries he played through last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, hip, knee, and chest injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Though I think that losing Earl Thomas was a worse situation for Seattle last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, the defense was just terrible after he went down with that broken leg."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he's healthy though, that Defense should still be pretty darn good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as the depth players we brought in from the outside perform, we should be a top 5 defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, good luck to your Seahawks this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same to you and your Patriots.  Later man."
