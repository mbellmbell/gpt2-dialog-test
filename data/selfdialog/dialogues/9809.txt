"__COMEDY__ Yeah. I took my boy to see it when it came out."
"__COMEDY__ Awesome show."
"__COMEDY__ I went just for my kid, but ended up really enjoying it."
"__COMEDY__ Me too! I thought it'd be a lot of CGI."
"__COMEDY__ It was!"
"__COMEDY__ Huh? It looks like stop motion."
"__COMEDY__ I thought so too. There must have been some though."
"__COMEDY__ I'll have to watch it again."
