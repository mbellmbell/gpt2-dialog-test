"__MUSIC__ how many groups or soloists have you seen live in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Only one; i saw Simon and Garfunkel in central park, new york once.  how about you?"
"__MUSIC__ well, my wife and I take our daughter to a concert every year as a treat.  we let her pick who she wants to see."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man that's cool! who have you seen?"
"__MUSIC__ the one that comes to mind first, is the first concert we took our daughter to.  it was approximately in 1997."
"__MUSIC__ wow that's a long time ago.  who was the performer?"
"__MUSIC__ believe it or not, my daughter, who was real young then, wanted to see the Spice Girls."
"__MUSIC__ the Spice GIrls! how cute! how was the show?"
"__MUSIC__ the show itself was good; they were down to four Spice Girls then after one had left the band."
"__MUSIC__ tell me more about the experience."
"__MUSIC__ well, for one thing, i had to drive quite far to get there, and the weather was lousy that night.  it was pouring rain."
"__MUSIC__ Did the rain interfere with the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No, the place was covered.  but we had to wait on line outside and let me tell you, we got drenched.  then after the show, we must have waited at least an hour to get out of the parking lot; what a mess."
"__MUSIC__ did any other group appear with the Spice Girls that night?"
"__MUSIC__ Now that you mention it, no other group performed.  the Spice Girls were on their own and they did real well, let me tell you."
"__MUSIC__ does your daughter have a favorite spice girl?"
"__MUSIC__ well, it's been a long time since we talked about them; i really don't remember.  for some reason i liked 'Sporty Spice,' i don't know why."
"__MUSIC__ LOL.  i was reading an article about concerts just the other day; i couldn't believe the ticket prices at some of these events."
"__MUSIC__ tell me about it.  you have to be reach to get good seats at some of these events."
"__MUSIC__ I know it.  well give my regards to your daughter and tell her to listen to an old spice girl CD just for the memory."
