"__MOVIES__ What's the best war film you've seen?"
"__MOVIES__ Recently or ever?  That's a big library."
"__MOVIES__ Let's just say ever and keep it easy."
"__MOVIES__ Man, that's tough.  I would say Saving Private Ryan."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, you read my mind.  That would be my choice as well."
"__MOVIES__ There's any number of films you could throw in there recently.  Even Hacksaw Ridge recently was spectacular."
"__MOVIES__ I remember watching Saving Private Ryan when it came out in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  I'll always remember the sound effects."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, especially the beginning on the beach.  Talk about thrilling."
"__MOVIES__ Probably one of the greatest sequences ever filmed in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  25 straight minutes of bullets, agony, just war itself."
"__MOVIES__ It put you right in the middle of it all too.  It was truly unflinching."
"__MOVIES__ The whole movie was good though.  I love Tom Hanks."
"__MOVIES__ He played the character pretty straight up.  No frills, just a guy who wants to get home."
"__MOVIES__ I pretty much knew he wasn't the guy who survived though."
"__MOVIES__ I figured that it was also Ryan at the beginning and end just because of age."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was totally robbed of Best Picture."
"__MOVIES__ It didn't win?  What did."
"__MOVIES__ Shakespeare in Love.  Can you believe that?"
"__MOVIES__ Seriously?  That's ridiculous!  What were they thinking?"
