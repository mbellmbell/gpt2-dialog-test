"__MOVIES__ What is your most underrated comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Hot Rod, it gets no love."
"__MOVIES__ Oh Hot Rod is a great choice, nobody I know has seen it."
"__MOVIES__ It's so quirky and dumb I can see why people might not like it, but I love it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Andy Samberg put together such a great cast for that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Ian McShane alone makes the whole movie worth it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah seeing Ian McShane wrestle Andy Samberg is worth the price of admission."
"__MOVIES__ Danny McBride was great in his role too, was the first time I've seen him actually."
"__MOVIES__ This was the Lonely Island's first big movie I think right?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know enough about that to answer but it seems like it."
"__MOVIES__ I wish Andy Samberg and the guys would do more movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah comedies are kind of lacking these days."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they like trying to capture the 21 Jump Street magic by making stuff like Baywatch."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah which looks really bad."
"__MOVIES__ Not even The Rock can save that one."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, we need more stuff like Hot Rod and Step Brothers."
"__MOVIES__ I can't remember a single good comedy in the last year or two."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of like the Vacation remake."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god are you serious?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was fun, I also liked We Are The Millers."
