"__MUSIC__ So, what do you think has changed with the widespread accessibility of music online?"
"__MUSIC__ You have to do a lot less legwork to find artists you're interested in."
"__MUSIC__ No more listening to the radio to hear your favorite song, or calling the station, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the direct channel to your content is right there now. You can just point and click and there it is."
"__MUSIC__ But are young music fans missing out on something now?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, because there's not as much ambient 'surfing' of the radio dial, or watching MTV the way Generation X did."
"__MUSIC__ And that can provide a musical education."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, in the sense of drawing connections between artists, and you know, things like Kurt Cobain wearing a Flipper T-shirt on SNL."
"__MUSIC__ And then the next day, you would go and scour your local record stores looking for Flipper, this mysterious band that had to be cool if Kurt dug them."
"__MUSIC__ Totally! Now you can just kind of Google them, and you're hearing their entire discography in 10 seconds."
"__MUSIC__ But that hasn't really gone away, the 'breadcrumb trail' sort of approach to music fandom, right?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it hasn't. I mean, you can spend hours on YouTube clicking on related videos, or you can see Kendrick Lamar giving a shout-out to Killer Mike on Twitter..."
"__MUSIC__ And then you can go buy a Killer Mike album on iTunes. Or visit a record label's website to learn about their roster of artists."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, and that's fun and exciting."
"__MUSIC__ The thing I think is interesting, though, is that this is all mediated in virtual space now, as opposed to at your local record store."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and I miss the experience of going to one, hearing what they were playing, and asking the clerk what it was."
"__MUSIC__ Or just hanging out with your friends and listening to records, hearing them say you had to hear this new one that came out today."
"__MUSIC__ It's true. Music listening is, I think, less social than it once was, and tastes are a lot more fragmented."
"__MUSIC__ We can all have these very separate media intakes, and curated experiences, versus a common ground we all agree one, like 'Sgt. Pepper.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think so. And so I feel a little nostalgic for those days, but hopeful for the kind of new music these plugged-in fans will make."
