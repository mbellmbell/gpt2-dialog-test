"__ROCK__ What do you think of The Killers' new stuff?"
"__ROCK__ You mean their new single The Man?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah precisely that one."
"__ROCK__ It's a bit different, more of a disco vibe than a synth rock vibe but I dig it."
"__ROCK__ I like it too, I was expecting a backlash against it but it's been pretty positive."
"__ROCK__ Yeah the YouTube comments are generally pretty positive."
"__ROCK__ Now that could just be because after five years we finally got a new Killers song."
"__ROCK__ Could be, but nothing stops YouTube commenters from being terrible if that's what they want to do."
"__ROCK__ Very true, I'm glad to see the reception the song is getting."
"__ROCK__ Same, I can't wait for the full album in September."
