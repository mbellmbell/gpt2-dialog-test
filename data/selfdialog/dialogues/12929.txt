"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team in the AFC can beat the Patriots this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In a playoff game, I don't see it happening."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On paper, that's probably the right answer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to pick a team, I'd go with the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do have a lot of nice pieces."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a little concerned about the running game, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have an elite offensive line, between Donald Penn, Kelechi Osemele, Rodney Hudson, and Gabe Jackson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, those guys can help open up holes for Marshawn Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The key will be to make sure Derek Carr is healthy for the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not going to the backup quaterback seems like a requirement for all teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's fair."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oakland's defense is improving too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It helps to have arguably the best defensive player in the game, Khalid Mack."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should theoretically improve too, since he's still so young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I'm still concerned about the rest of the pass rush."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oakland had the fewest sacks in the league last year, so I get the concern."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully one of their young players will step up, most likely Mario Edwards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The passing game should continue to grow, as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the additions of Cordarrelle Patterson - who will also help in the return game - and espeically Jared Cook."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm interested to see how the team does in 2017!"
