"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think would win, a young Rey or a young Leai?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that is hard. Leai was strong but raised a princess."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Rey was raised to be tuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, but Leia always ended up on top, in everything she did."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think she would be more mature, I mean come on she was a leader on Alderan before Luke even knew he was a jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ She is smarter, has wisdom."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Rey has street smarts, living alone in the desert."
"__STAR_WARS__ Scouring for food in old ruins and so on."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it may be a hard fight."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they would not fight, instead become a two woman team and defeat all the dark side."
