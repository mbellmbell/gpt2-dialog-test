"__DISNEY__ Wow, I just watched Tarzan. What a great movie!"
"__DISNEY__ You're going to have to be more specific. There's like at least a dozen different movie versions of Tarzan."
"__DISNEY__ I'm talking about the animated Disney version from the 90s."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that one. It was alright, I couldn't get over the gorilla with the Brooklyn accent though."
"__DISNEY__ Are you talking about Terk? I loved him in that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ I think you mean 'her.'"
"__DISNEY__ Wait, Terk was a girl? How do you know?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it was obvious if you were actually paying attention. Disney even got Rosie O'Donnell to voice her."
"__DISNEY__ I had no idea. I'm going to go re-watch it again, I probably missed some other obvious stuff."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, have fun with that."
