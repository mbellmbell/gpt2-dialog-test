"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you talking about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Arizona Cardinals are older than the state of Arizona."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh? How is that possible?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is it about? Or what team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Since 1971, the Dallas Cowboys haven’t had a game in Dallas. In fact, their stadium isn’t even in that city. It’s in Arlington, Texas!"
