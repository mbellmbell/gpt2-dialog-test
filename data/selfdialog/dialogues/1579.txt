"__MUSIC__ I just read an article about a new song by Prince's father being released this year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh? I didn't know Prince's dad was still alive."
"__MUSIC__ He's not. He passed away in 2001."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I see. What was his name? I don't recall hearing much about Prince's dad."
"__MUSIC__ His name was John L. Nelson. But his stage name was Prince Rogers. He was a jazz musician back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Music talent runs in the family."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like it."
"__MUSIC__ What's the name of the new song that's being released?"
"__MUSIC__ Heart of Mine. It's said to be the first single from the album, “Don’t Play With Love, The John L. Nelson Project,”"
"__MUSIC__ Who's releasing it?"
"__MUSIC__ Prince's half-sister, Sharon Nelson."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow. I never knew Prince had a half sister either."
"__MUSIC__ Neither did I until now."
"__MUSIC__ So, I'm guessing the album is jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's what the article said."
"__MUSIC__ When's it releasing?"
"__MUSIC__ October 27th of this year."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I've got to remember to pick it up."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to buy some of his dad's other albums. I don't think he was very famous though."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if it wasn't for Prince's father getting into music, we wouldn't have Purple Rain."
