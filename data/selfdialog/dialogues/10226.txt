"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you like rap music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, I don't listen to it very often, but some songs and artists I like."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which artists do you like?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nas, Jay Z, and Jadakiss."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh those are really great rappers.  Some of the best, actually."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I only like decent rap.  None of this Lil Wayne stuff."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why not Lil Wayne?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ His music, like a lot of others, is exploitative.  It doesn't say anything, it's just random garble about guns and women and weed.  It promotes a poor outlook for black culture."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, yeah I guess it does."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Rap should say something meaningful, not just talk about money all the time."
