"__THRILLER__ I think Alfred HItchcock was the greatest creator of thriller movies ever.  Were you a fan of HItchcock?"
"__THRILLER__ I'm not sure i'd call him the greatest, but I will say he is certainly among the best.  He was a genius, no doubt about it."
"__THRILLER__ I'll never forget the first time i saw 'the Birds.'  I've never been so frightened watching a movie."
"__THRILLER__ That was a great movie, but to me 'Psycho' was HItchcock's best.  That was incredibly scary."
"__THRILLER__ 'Pyscho' was scary, but i think i give the edge to 'the Birds' because it was in color.  I've always had a problem getting involved with black and white films."
"__THRILLER__ It's interesting you say that; i always thought the fact that 'Pyscho' was in black and white actually added to the tension."
"__THRILLER__ Do you remember any of the sequels to 'Psycho?' I think i saw one of them; it was awful."
"__THRILLER__ I think there were three 'Psycho' sequels and i saw all of them.  I'll tell you the truth...they were all terrible.  But i think everyone had false expectations in feelling they could be even half as good as the original."
"__THRILLER__ Did you know that when 'Psycho' first opened in the theatres in 1960, people were not allowed into the theatre after the film had started?"
"__THRILLER__ Now that you mention it, i did read that somewhere.  HItchcock got some good publicity out of that.  He wanted everyone to watch every second of it; once it started you couldn't get in.  great strategy !"
