"__SUPERHERO__ What did you think of that movie where Batman and Superman fought each other?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I didn't like that one.  It was too weird for me."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh.  Well, have you seen the new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Not yet, I think I'll wait until it's out to stream."
"__SUPERHERO__ Sounds like you are not in too much of a hurry to see it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm really not. I'm old school and this Wonder Woman is not going to be like the real one."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. The real Wonder Woman was great and she was really likeable.  This one doesn't seem that way."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know.  It's kind of a let down.  I think they just sexed her up to sell tickets."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think so too.  Oh well, at least there's a new Spiderman movie coming out. WIll you watch that one?  I'm looking forward to seeing it myself."
"__SUPERHERO__ I am going to see that, and at the movies! It looks really good!"
