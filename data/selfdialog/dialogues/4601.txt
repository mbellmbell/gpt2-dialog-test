"__MUSIC__ Do you like rap or hip hop?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to, but this new stuff sucks!"
"__MUSIC__ What about the new rap is bad?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't even understand them anymore!"
"__MUSIC__ But before it was a lot better? I've always had a hard time understanding"
"__MUSIC__ Well they used to be fast like Twista or Busta Rhymes, but that was okay"
"__MUSIC__ But now with XXXTentacion and Lil Uzi Vert it's gone too far?"
"__MUSIC__ oh yeah, way too far"
"__MUSIC__ They just mumble and use too much auto tune!"
"__MUSIC__ Autotune isnt a bad thing though!"
"__MUSIC__ Well if T-Pain uses a little bit it's okay but there's a point where its too much"
"__MUSIC__ Where can I get good rap then?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Hopsin?"
"__MUSIC__ Is he famous or is he new?"
"__MUSIC__ he is popular on Youtube but  not very mainstream yet"
"__MUSIC__ What's he rap about?"
"__MUSIC__ He raps about how rap sucks"
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty ironic!"
