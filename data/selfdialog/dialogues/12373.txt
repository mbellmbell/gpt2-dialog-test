"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite NFL rookie going into next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know all that much about any of them, but I'm excited to see how Myles Garrett does with the Browns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, as the first pick overall, all eyes are on him to succeed"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even if the Browns are the worst team in the league, one player isn't going to completely turn it around"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think the Browns need to really turn their luck around?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better coaching and better front office personnel, I would guess"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a decent quarterback who isn't always getting injured would probably help"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe how many quarterbacks they've gone through just over the past few seasons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And to think they could have drafted someone solid, like Dak Prescott, who no one expected to completely take off"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they'll have that kind of luck with DeShone Kizer"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know enough about him to know one way or the other, but I'm a bit surprised they even drafted a quarterback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're just full of surprises after picking up Brock Osweiler from the Texans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was one of the craziest trades I've seen in the NFL, and a pretty rare thing from what I hear"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if they'll use Osweiler as their starter this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of people were speculating that they would try to trade him away, but it hasn't happened yet"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also said the Browns might try to get Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots, but their asking price was just too high"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you don't get as many great players on one team without being a bit stingy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but Jimmy G hasn't had much time to prove himself, and might end up being as big a bust as Osweiler was"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then again, if he's being mentored by Tom Brady, he could end up being the next Brady himself"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a pretty big gamble to take, if you ask me, probably too high of a risk for most teams"
