"__BASEBALL__ Did they high school have their last ball game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I can't believe you missed it!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I totally forgot about it.  How did they do?"
"__BASEBALL__ We won.  By two points in the last inning."
"__BASEBALL__ In the last inning?  Was it tied until then?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, neither team had scored since the fifth.  We had been tied 4-4 for half the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, so what happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, the other team had used their pitcher all game, and I guess he was worn out."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, so that must have screwed them up."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, it ended up costed them the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, what happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, first he threw a ball and beaned the batter."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, that sucks.  Why didn't they take him out then?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know, but then he walked the next batter."
"__BASEBALL__ So there were two guys on base?"
"__BASEBALL__ Right.  Well, the pitcher lucked up and managed to strike out the next batter."
"__BASEBALL__ But there were still two on base with only one out, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly.  They could have still switched him out."
"__BASEBALL__ But they didn't."
"__BASEBALL__ Nope.  And the next guy hit in both runners."
