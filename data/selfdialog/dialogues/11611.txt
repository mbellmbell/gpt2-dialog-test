"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do think the Steelers will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty much the same as last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think they'll make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. Their offense is still one of the best in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they'll make it to the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not. New England is still in the AFC and they are well, good and lucky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they really have a difficult time with New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't remind me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think their defense has gotten any better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. Their secondary is still young and getting better all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought they improved a lot last year. I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They still have a long way to go on defense, but I'm happy with the progress."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think New England wins the AFC again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. Unless Tom Brady decides to retire mid season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's almost 40. He isn't slowing down any time soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately. We will still hear from Tom Brady for at least 2 to 3 more seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton Manning deteriorated when he got close to 40. Wonder why Brady hasn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably because he releases the ball so quickly and never gets hit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. He never gets hit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last time he got injured, they made a special rule about not hitting below the knees. He's too protected of a player."
