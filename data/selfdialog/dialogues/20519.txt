"__MOVIES__ Did you see the Disney movie Moana?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't yet, but I want to."
"__MOVIES__ It is the cutest movie. I just love it."
"__MOVIES__ Is that about the Hawaiian girl?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have watched it at least 30 times."
"__MOVIES__ Is it that good?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so.  It is absolutely the best one I have seen in a very long time."
"__MOVIES__ Well maybe I'll watch it tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Remember what my favorite animated movie of all time was?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I remember, it was A Bug's Life, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but Moana passed that up now."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, you really liked A bug's Life, you watched it over and over."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but Moana is the best now. Some movie had to be better sooner or later."
"__MOVIES__ True, but it's been years."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Promise me you'll watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Ok I'll watch it tonight."
"__MOVIES__ But you have to watch it at least three times."
"__MOVIES__ 3 times? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Not all the same night.  But 3 times will show you how good an idea it was, whoever thought of it."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, i sure will, I understand what your saying."
