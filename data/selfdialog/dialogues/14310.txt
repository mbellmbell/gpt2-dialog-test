"__HORROR__ What's your favorite zombie movie?"
"__HORROR__ Night of the Living Dead, the original one, hands down."
"__HORROR__ I knew you'd pick that cheesy movie."
"__HORROR__ Cheesy? It kicked off the zombie genre. It's the best."
"__HORROR__ Want to know which one is my favorite?"
"__HORROR__ What?"
"__HORROR__ 28 Weeks Later."
"__HORROR__ Oh, come on. There weren't any zombies in that movie."
"__HORROR__ Maybe not by definition, but they were still ravenous people eaters weren't they?"
"__HORROR__ No, they were a bunch of crazy cannibals. They weren't even reanimated."
