"__BEATLES__ How was your road trip?"
"__BEATLES__ Awful. My friends played The Beatles' Greatest Hits on repeat for the entire five hour drive!"
"__BEATLES__ How can you hate The Beatles? That's like hating American history."
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles are from Liverpool."
"__BEATLES__ You know what I mean. They became American Icons with the British Invasion."
"__BEATLES__ That's because they marked the beginning of Rock N' Roll. There weren't as many popular groups as there are now."
"__BEATLES__ So you have to admit they are one of the greatest bands in history."
"__BEATLES__ No I don't. They are one of the most overrated bands in history. They're songs are so simple, just like children's songs or like someone singing in the shower."
"__BEATLES__ They're alot better than today's modern day pop bands like The Backstreet Boys!"
"__BEATLES__ Please, my friend, they were the original Backstreet Boys!"
