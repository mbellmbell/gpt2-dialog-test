"__STAR_WARS__ I just learned a whole bunch about star wars movies!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah! What?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know they almost used a monkey to play Yoda?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I had never heard of that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also, the word 'Ewok' is never mentioned in the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you sure?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the name only appears in the script."
"__STAR_WARS__ Anything else?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The language the Ewoks speak is a combination of Tibetan and Nepalese."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow! I thought their language was just gibberish."
