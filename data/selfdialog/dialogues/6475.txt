"__STAR_WARS__ What's the best Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite has always been Return of the Jedi-- I loved Boba Fett and the Ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite is the Emprire Strikes Back, though the new Force Awakens was really good too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it was a lot more relatable, I thought.  A lot more contemporary."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think I'm with the general consensus that they were largely terrible."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, though I did love Watto."
"__STAR_WARS__ And, who can forget Darth Maul?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I'd love to see more with him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if they'll ever put him in another movie?"
