"__BASEBALL__ Have you heard about MLB agreement with Facebook?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, what is it?"
"__BASEBALL__ The MLB agrees to let facebook a game every Friday with no blackouts."
"__BASEBALL__ Sweet, I'm looking forward to those knowledgeable intelligent Facebook team fans commenting on the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, this is pretty cool. I like the gradual movement to actually streaming games."
"__BASEBALL__ No blackouts is nice too."
"__BASEBALL__ I wonder what the first game on Facebook will be"
"__BASEBALL__ Its like the free game of the day, but more people have facebook accounts then mlb.com ones"
"__BASEBALL__ I think this could work, we'll have to see though."
"__BASEBALL__ Good on MLB for making steps to modernity."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you need an account for the MLB free game?"
"__BASEBALL__ The free game of the day still has blackout restrictions. So, it's even more than that."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't have a Facebook account. I hope I don't need one."
"__BASEBALL__ You don't? Everyone is on Facebook."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not. I don't trust them."
"__BASEBALL__ But if I have to make an account just to watch a game, it won't happen."
"__BASEBALL__ Are you serious?"
"__BASEBALL__ I am dead serious. Facebook can't be trusted."
"__BASEBALL__ So how does this work? Is there a page I'm supposed to follow/like to see the games?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm sure if you follow the main MLB page they will provide a link to the game."
