"__BEATLES__ Do you listen to the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ They are one of my favorite groups!   I like how their music progresses and changes as they grow older."
"__BEATLES__ Me too!  Their music definitely evolved over the years.  You can tell that the most with the White Album."
"__BEATLES__ Yes!  What is your favorite song on that album?"
"__BEATLES__ Helter Skelter."
"__BEATLES__ That's a good one!  You know it's about a slide at a playground, right?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah.  It's got such a unique, hard rock sound to it."
"__BEATLES__ It does!  Then the album has a track the complete opposite like Mother Nature's Son."
"__BEATLES__ I used to listen to that song when I was ready to go to sleep."
"__BEATLES__ It's a good one for it!  Good Night is a good one, too."
