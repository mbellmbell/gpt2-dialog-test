"__MOVIES__ Have you heard they are remaking the movie 'IT?'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I hear it comes out in September!"
"__MOVIES__ I want to see it so bad, the original scared me so bad!"
"__MOVIES__ The clown was very creepy, I wonder what he will look like in the remake."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the trailers for the remake?"
"__MOVIES__ No I have not, does it seem like it follows the original?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh absolutely. It follows it very closely!"
"__MOVIES__ Do they show what Pennywise looks like?"
"__MOVIES__ They only show very small parts, and he looks so scary."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the original IT, I watched it so many times."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, such a long movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if the remake is just as long as the original?"
"__MOVIES__ I hope so! There is a lot to the original."
"__MOVIES__ I heard Steven King said they did a phenomenal job on the remake of IT."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that as well. I wonder who plays Pennywise in this new one?"
"__MOVIES__ I am unsure, but I know Tim Curry did an amazing job in the original."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we need to make plans to see it when it comes out!"
"__MOVIES__ Its a plan, September right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, September but I am unsure what date. I will look."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see it!"
