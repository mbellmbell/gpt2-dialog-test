"__ACTION__ How do you like action movies in general?"
"__ACTION__ oh yeah, I love them, time for some more explosions"
"__ACTION__ when it comes to visual effects, such as explosion, who comes to your mind first?"
"__ACTION__ it has to be Michael Bay, who's most famous for his Transformer movies, where mass destruction took place"
"__ACTION__ I agree, no matter how others judge the nature of his movies, you can't deny the explosions, haha"
"__ACTION__ so which transformer movie is your favorite?"
"__ACTION__ I believe it was the second one that draws most of my attention, the college kid one"
"__ACTION__ oh, I think I know what you talking about, it's a conspiracy theory about The Pyramid in Egypt, isn't it?"
"__ACTION__ yeah, in the movie, the pyramid has some hidden device that can be used to destroy our sun"
"__ACTION__ that sounds terrifying"
