"__MUSIC__ Have you seen the NBC musicals that they're reviving?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean all the live shows -- and some of them aren't live?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup."
"__MUSIC__ I've seen a few of them."
"__MUSIC__ Which?"
"__MUSIC__ The Sound of Music, The Wiz, The Sound of Music, Peter Pan, Hairspray."
"__MUSIC__ Not all of those are NBC. Anyway, what do you think about the celebrities in them?"
"__MUSIC__ Who were they again? Remind me."
"__MUSIC__ Ariana Grande was in Hairspray, and Carrie Underwood was in The Sound of Music."
"__MUSIC__ Ahh, right. Ariana wasn't very good."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, way too light in the voice."
"__MUSIC__ She was completely overshadowed by trained singers and they just gave her lots of throwaway jokes you couldn't hear."
"__MUSIC__ Her jokes were hilarious with her delivery, but yeah, she doesn't have the voice for live musicals."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like Carrie?"
"__MUSIC__ She was a lot better, but again, an untrained voice against trained never really works."
"__MUSIC__ She seemed a lot more comfortable, though."
"__MUSIC__ Are you looking forward to their next musical?"
"__MUSIC__ What is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Jesus Christ Superstar, on Easter Sunday of next year."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously? Crazy good music, but I hate the message and plot."
