"__MUSIC__ Hey are you watching the singing show that Alicia Keys is one of judges?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean The Voice?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes that's the one. I was so happy when she came on as a judge. That woman blows me away every time she sings!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Even when she just sings off the cuff during practice. She is stunning."
"__MUSIC__ When she first came out and she played that slow song on piano. I can't think of it right this second."
"__MUSIC__ The song is 'Fallin''."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Thanks! It was so different than all the other stuff on the radio at the time."
"__MUSIC__ She is and was so stunning to look at and listen to."
"__MUSIC__ What blew me away way the first time  heard her speak."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Her singing voice is so insanely beautiful and articulate and her speaking voice is so thuggish. Well at least at the time it was."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny that you got that impression!"
"__MUSIC__ She seems like a really sweet and kind person on the show. I have often wondered if she has kids."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah she does. Two as I recall. They have very unusual names."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to look that up. I am curious."
"__MUSIC__ She never ever mentions her kids or immediate family on the show. Some of the other judges do ."
"__MUSIC__ Well maybe she is just a super private person."
"__MUSIC__ Probably a good way to be so you can have a private life and it not be tainted in a bad way by being a celebrity."
"__MUSIC__ Well it's been swell talking to you!"
"__MUSIC__ 'Swell'?? You pulled that one out of the retro word vault! Bye."
