"__DISNEY__ Hey, the kids want to watch Moana."
"__DISNEY__ We just watched it yesterday and this morning."
"__DISNEY__ Well they really like it. Put it on?"
"__DISNEY__ I suppose so. It's not the worst one to watch over and over."
"__DISNEY__ You know it's cute and the kids love it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I know. I probably know every line verbatim."
"__DISNEY__ What can I say except you're welcome!"
"__DISNEY__ I'd rather be shiny! Love that crab song."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah me too. It is one of the cooler parts of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I think they did a really great job with the tribute to Bowie there."
