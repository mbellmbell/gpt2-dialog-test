"__DISNEY__ Do you ever watch Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I have seen quite a few of them."
"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite? I really like Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I do too!  I hope to see the live action version that came out in 2017."
"__DISNEY__ So do I.  I love the animated version, but I'm also a fan of Emma Watson and would love to see her play Belle."
"__DISNEY__ I am curious to see how the new one compares to the original."
"__DISNEY__ I think they have kept some of the same songs in but have also added new ones."
"__DISNEY__ I have heard that too.  I am also looking forward to seeing Dan Stevens play the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, so am I .  Did you know that Robbie Benson voiced the Beast in the animated version?"
"__DISNEY__ No I didn't.  That is a surprise; he doesn't strike me as someone who would voice the Beast."
