"__MOVIES__ What movie do you think did not really need a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ There are a lot that got a sequel any way."
"__MOVIES__ Which one would be at the top of the list for no sequel needed?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say Jaws."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Jaws Two had a lot going on."
"__MOVIES__ That is the issue."
"__MOVIES__ Why, it already told all it needed to."
"__MOVIES__ Right, there was nothing left to tell it just went in to like silly stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Like the shark beating the plane to the Bahamas."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, then the shark exploding like a grape."
"__MOVIES__ I think people were just wanting to see the suspense again."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe people just liked boats too much."
"__MOVIES__ That reminds me of Speed Two."
"__MOVIES__ They made a Speed Two?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, only this time it was with boats."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that was not needed."
"__MOVIES__ It was the same premise, just on boats."
"__MOVIES__ Did it have the same actors?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. Not unlike the Mask, Son of The Mask."
"__MOVIES__ With Jamie Kennedy, that one was awful."
