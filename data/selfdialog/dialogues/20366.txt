"__MOVIES__ I loved the Iron Man franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I liked it, but wasn't crazy about the third movie."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean? The third movie was the best one."
"__MOVIES__ You can not possibly think it was better than the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ But it was. It showed growth in the character."
"__MOVIES__ There was just too much stuff happening. Plus Tony was barely in the armor."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Tony Stark is more than just his armor. He's one of the smartest minds on the planet."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so, but it still wasn't my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ One thing I don't like about his series is that it seems the universe is against him."
"__MOVIES__ What are you talking about now?"
"__MOVIES__ He nearly died in Iron Man 1, 2, and the Avengers movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well it was necessary for the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. But what about all the others?"
"__MOVIES__ Well he doesn't nearly die in Iron Man 3."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he goes through PTSD after what happened during Avengers. The universe is against him."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I can see how you can think that."
"__MOVIES__ Plus they blamed him for all of Age of Ultron. Again, the universe is against him."
"__MOVIES__ But it was totally his fault. Ultron tried to kill humanity."
"__MOVIES__ That's because humans are dangerous to everything. Ultron was right."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god. I can't believe you just said that."
