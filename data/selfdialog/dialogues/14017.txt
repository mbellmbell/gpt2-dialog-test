"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Minnesota Lynx win last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I don't watch women's basketball.  It's boring."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you kidding me?  So have you ever even seen them play?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, why would I watch them?  Women are so much less aggressive and can't make shots"
"__BASKETBALL__ They are more skilled than you think.  You should give them a chance.  Watch a game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Meh.  Maybe I'll turn it on for a few minutes next time.  When's the next game."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not sure.  They don't always televise them.  Watching live in person is better anyway."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why is that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Lynx have an amazing fan base and the energy they bring to the court is fantastic."
"__BASKETBALL__ Where do they play?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They usually play at Target Center, but this year they are playing at Xcel because Target Center is being remodeled."
"__BASKETBALL__ Target Center is a way better place to watch a basketball game."
"__BASKETBALL__ I completely agree.  I can't wait until they're back there hitting threes!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think is their best player?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They've got so many great players it's hard to pick just one.  I'd probably say Maya Moore.  She's so talented."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah?  I think I've heard of her.  Who else?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Lindsey Whalen.  Simone Augustus.  Syliva Fowles."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why are the scores so low compared to men's basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the games are shorter, for one.  Also the women are a little shorter than a lot of male basketball players, so the men have it a little easier in that regard."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, I see.  I didn't know the games were shorter.  Good to know.  I may just have to check it out."
