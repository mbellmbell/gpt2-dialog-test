"__DISNEY__ Who do you think was the best Disney villain?"
"__DISNEY__ I personally think it was Queen Grimhilde."
"__DISNEY__ Which one was she again?"
"__DISNEY__ She was the one who poisoned Snow White because she was jealous of Snow White's looks."
"__DISNEY__ I remember now.  It's also extra evil that she poisoned someone who was her own stepdaughter."
"__DISNEY__ That's why she is my pick.  What about yours?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Ursula from 'The Little Mermaid' was way worse."
"__DISNEY__ What was her evil plan again?"
"__DISNEY__ She used blackmail and deceit to win King Tritonâ€™s throne."
