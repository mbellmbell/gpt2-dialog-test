"__MOVIES__ Do you like Godzilla movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it depends on what series we're talking about."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, first of all there's the original Godzilla movie that came out in 1954."
"__MOVIES__ That's the first Japanese one, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Right, and it's a lot different than the Japanese ones that came after."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the series started to become rather goofy soon after, almost like a kid's movie."
"__MOVIES__ A big difference from how it started, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but then in the 80's they started taking it seriously again."
"__MOVIES__ Some of my favorite Godzilla movies are from the 80's and 90's."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely a great time to be a Godzilla fan, but then the Americans got their hands on the series."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, are you talking about the 1998 American Godzilla movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah baby, that giant piece of crap."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think the Americans redeemed themselves with the new Godzilla movie that they just made?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but it's hard to forget Ferris Bueller petting Godzilla."
"__MOVIES__ So are the Japanese still making Godzilla movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the latest one brings the series full circle, and is very true to the spirit of the original 1954 movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's great to see that they still have it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm just hoping that Godzilla vs. King Kong doesn't ruin everything!"
