"__MUSIC__ If I hear one more person say the Beatles are overrated, I'm gonna lose it."
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles are overrated."
"__MUSIC__ I hate you."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously though, no. People who say that miss the whole point."
"__MUSIC__ Right. One time I heard this kid say 'blah blah blah they're overrated'."
"__MUSIC__ Go on..."
"__MUSIC__ So I asked him. I went up to him and said, 'hey, why do you think that exactly?'"
"__MUSIC__ Did he have any half way decent reason?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. He goes, 'their music was so simple. Psh. I could do that!'"
"__MUSIC__ Was it really? Then why aren't you a famous musician right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. It's that same way as any other kind of artist- when someone is so insanely talented, they make it look easy. That doesn't mean that it is actually easy."
"__MUSIC__ Did he have a comeback to that?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. He just said 'whatever, man.'"
"__MUSIC__ Wow."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. He probably loves Justin Beiber."
"__MUSIC__ Don't hate on the Beibs, man."
"__MUSIC__ C'mon now."
"__MUSIC__ No. Don't you dare say bad things about my Justin. Justin Beiber is the next Kurt Cobain, he said it himself!"
"__MUSIC__ I hate you."
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles are overrated."
