"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga's music has been a little disappointing lately."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like it, how do you mean disappointing?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, it's not that I don't like it, it's decent enough. But she used to feel more exciting and adventurous."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I guess I can see what you mean."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She started out as kind of generic dance-pop but then quickly took the genre into some new directions, likewise with her music videos."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah."
"__LADY_GAGA__ But now it seems like anyone could make the music she's making, production-wise at least. And the videos have gotten rather flat and boring too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She had a good video for John Wayne."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That one was weird again, but I don't think I would call it good. It was missing something that her earlier ones had."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I did sort of notice that."
