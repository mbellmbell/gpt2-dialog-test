"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about the new Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I loved that it had less of a focus on Jedi and more on normal people."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was pretty good. Seemed to kind of have an Ocean's Eleven feel."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep. I thought the same thing. I wish that they would show more of the real world in Star Wars instead of just the big events."
"__STAR_WARS__ I had heard that at one point there was a plan to do a tv. show for Star Wars that was kind of like Band of Brothers but takes place during the Clone Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be awesome. Rogue one introduced tons of character that could be used for something like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope the upcoming Han Solo movie has more of a Rogue One vibe than a prequel vibe."
"__STAR_WARS__ It has to, man. Han is after all the original Rogue!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have heard some bad rumors about it, but I am willing to reserve judgment."
