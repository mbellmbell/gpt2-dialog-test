"__BASEBALL__ By far, the strangest thing that has happened in baseball in recent history was White Sox pitcher Chris Sales going nuts with the scissors."
"__BASEBALL__ Why, was he running with scissors?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, seriously, he went nuts with a pari of scissors. It got him suspended."
"__BASEBALL__ How do you get suspended for a pair of scissors?"
"__BASEBALL__ He was pissed off because he thought the White Sox were way too focused on selling jerseys and other merchandise."
"__BASEBALL__ Was he mad they weren't focusing on him?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, sort of. He thought they would care more about the players than they did the sale of merhcandise."
"__BASEBALL__ So what happened with the scissors?"
"__BASEBALL__ He grabbed a pair and cut up a bunch of the throwback jerseys in the team's clubhouse."
"__BASEBALL__ You mean those jerseys displayed with great pride and highly valued?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, pretty much. He cut them to pieces."
"__BASEBALL__ And how did that go over with the team?"
"__BASEBALL__ He was suspended for 5 games."
"__BASEBALL__ Is there a specific rule about not cutting up jerseys that aren't yours?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but he destroyed team property or equipment, violated team rules, and was insubordinate."
"__BASEBALL__ Insubordination: that's code for 'you pissed off the wrong people', isn't it?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, pretty much."
"__BASEBALL__ Did they do anythng else to him."
"__BASEBALL__ Besides the suspension? No I don't guess so."
"__BASEBALL__ They should have given him a pair of those safety scissors with the round edges that can't cut anything."
