"__MOVIES__ Hey, who's your favorite director?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh gee, that's kind of a tough one. I'm such a movie fan and I definitely have a long list of directors I admire."
"__MOVIES__ I do too. But if you had to pick just one, who would it be?"
"__MOVIES__ OK let me think. I guess if I really had to pick one out of all the ones I like, it would probably have to be Steven Spielberg."
"__MOVIES__ Oh sure, he's one of my top favorites too. When you start thinking about his movies, there are just so many amazing iconic films."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. I go all the way back to Close Encounters as one of my first all time favorite films."
"__MOVIES__ That's an amazing movie. Really ahead of its time and really epic in scope."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it? Such an original idea back and then to do a movie about alien visitors who weren't evil or out to destroy us."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what blew me away. And he really got me with his misdirection in so many scenes where you believed the aliens were up to no good."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of think of that movie as the precursor to E.T. in a way. And then of course he turned it all around later on with War of the Worlds, which was visually amazing."
"__MOVIES__ All of his movies are amazing to look at, even the ones that aren't that great story wise. Like Hook, for instance. I know a lot of people like that one, but it's one of my least favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you and I agree on that one. I thought it was annoying, to be honest. And I really loved Robin Williams in almost everything I saw him in. But that one? No."
"__MOVIES__ Now on the other side of the coin, one of my all time favorite Spielberg movies is Empire of the Sun. I think it's an incredible film."
"__MOVIES__ It looks like we like the same ones. That's one of my big favorites. A beautiful movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was the first time I ever saw Christian Bale in anything and I thought his performance was so strong, especially for his age. He was just a kid at the time."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it's funny. Amazing that he's Batman now."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention the lunatic from American Psycho."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that was terrifying. In Empire, he was so cute. Even though his character was kind of a brat, you still fell in love with him."
"__MOVIES__ Because it wasn't his fault. He was brought up spoiled and privileged. But he learned a hard lesson, that's for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed. That was one of the first movies that ever made me cry. You know, the scene where he reunites with his parents."
