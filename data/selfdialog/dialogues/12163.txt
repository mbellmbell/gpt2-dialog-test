"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots are team to beat until someone actually does beat them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe the other 31 teams can't put something together to beat them when it matters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Falcons were close in Super Bowl, but imploded in second half."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I and half the audience can't believe that happened!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That pretty much cements Tom Brady's place in Canton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but he was already in before that game anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what kind of sucks, is there are a lot of great players who have never won a ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but it seems that what people/voters get caught up in today are numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I unfortunately agree.  Like receivers in today's game and probably in last 20 years are putting up outrageous numbers for stats because of the way the game has evolved."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to compare some of the greats of the 1960's & 1970's w/those of today because of those numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the Raiders and think it's too bad Cliff Branch is not in the Hall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really think he is worthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, he was a home run threat, has career TD numbers that rival many of those that came after him, and many TV experts agree that he is Hall-worthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That probably is true, just wrong era in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Cardinal great Jim Hart?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, he doesn't really have that 'wow' factor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I mean.  He played on very pedestrian teams in the same division as the Cowboys when they were perennial winners every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But did he ever do anything?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was one of main reasons they were probably a competitive team some years.  He did this for over a decade in St. Louis with very few players that anyone who was not a die hard Cardinal fan can even name more than five of his teammates.  He was a pillar in that organization."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously he was a little before my time.  I can respect his longetivity in an era when the NFL was much different than it is today."
