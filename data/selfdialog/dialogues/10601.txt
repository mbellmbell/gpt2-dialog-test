"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are you a fan of rap music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I used to be, but I don't really like many of the rappers of today."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who is your current favorite rapper."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would have to say Eminem, but he doesn't seem to come out with as much stuff as he used to."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How about the past? Who is your favorite rapper of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would have to say Tupac. He rarely made a song I didn't like."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can't believe he died, but it did seem like they released a lot of music from him even after he died."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Some people think that he isn't dead and lives in South America."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That seems a little ridiculous to me. It's a shame that the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac died too young."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They were definitely two of the best rappers of all time."
