"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey, have you heard Chance the Rapper's new song with DJ Khaled?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, the one called 'I Love You So Much'? Chance has a whole verse on it that is literally just the alphabet."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know! That's what I was going to say! It's crazy, but it sounds good. That man can make anything flow good."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I hear that! I've been so happy to watch his career grow! Especially after his latest album, Coloring Book. Have you listened to it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, I have. It's such a different sound than his earlier work. I can't decide whether I like it or not."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You mean all the gospel stuff?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, it reminds me of being in church when I was little"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think that's the point he's trying to make! Haha"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess so! His verses are still amazing though. And the features are great. I just kind of miss Acid Rap Chance."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Me too, but artists are humans too. They grow and evolve. Chance is a daddy now. He can't be doing acid all the time any more!"
