"__MOVIES__ I really want to watch some good mermaid movies this summer, but I can't think of any."
"__MOVIES__ Well, there's Splash. It's from the 80's but it's pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Splash? Didn't that have Tom Hanks in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot about Daryl Hannah! She was really beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ She was. And in Splash she's a mermaid who falls in love with a human man, Tom Hanks."
"__MOVIES__ Well of course Tom Hanks. Splash definitely goes on the list, what else?"
"__MOVIES__ What about Aquamarine. It's more geared to kids, but it's really cute and does have a mermaid."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that one."
"__MOVIES__ It's based, loosely, on a short story by Ann Hoffman. A mermaid is washed ashore during a storm and befriends two teenage girls."
"__MOVIES__ That's sounds pretty cute."
"__MOVIES__ It really is! The two girls are best friends, but one is moving away and the mermaid falls in love with the lifeguard at the beach."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, well that's two mermaid movies. Why aren't there more mermaid movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I think you should add Deeply starring Kirsten Dunst to the list."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I've ever heard of that one."
"__MOVIES__ It's definitely more obscure, and not exactly a mermaid story, but it is about an island cursed since the time of the Vikings."
"__MOVIES__ Ooh, that actually sounds pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Kirsten Dunst plays a teenager sent to this island to grieve the sudden death of her boyfriend when she hears the story of a girl named Silly and the curse that island has been under forever."
"__MOVIES__ Even if it's not technically a mermaid movie, it sounds like something that would be great to watch with mermaid movies."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, now all you need is some movie snacks. Maybe some seaweed?"
