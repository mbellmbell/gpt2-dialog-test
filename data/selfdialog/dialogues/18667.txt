"__MOVIES__ Any word on the next Blade movie?"
"__MOVIES__ They're making another one?"
"__MOVIES__ That's what I heard a year ago. I haven't heard any news about it since."
"__MOVIES__ Is Wesley Snipes starring in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. He said he had spoke to Marvel Studios about it last year."
"__MOVIES__ I hope Blade 4 is as good as the second movie. I didn't much care for the third one myself."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay. The story was just another rehash of the previous movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know. The bad guys always need Blade's blood for their evil plans."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget how Whistler ends up dead. I like how Blade was exposed in the last movie, though."
"__MOVIES__ The writers could have expanded on that angle. Maybe SHIELD could have recruited him at the end."
"__MOVIES__ That would have been cool. You know what else is cool?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ A crossover between Blade and Underworld."
"__MOVIES__ Or Twilight."
"__MOVIES__ That would definitely make a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Blade would have those vampires running for their lives. So when's Blade 4 coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Marvel hasn't made any official announcements yet."
"__MOVIES__ They're probably busy with all those Avengers movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm hyped. I'm going to go re-watch all three Blades."
"__MOVIES__ I'll join you when you get to Blade 2."
