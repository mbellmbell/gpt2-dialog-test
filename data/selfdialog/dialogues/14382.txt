"__HORROR__ Have you seen any good horror movies lately?"
"__HORROR__ No, not lately.  But I've been meaning to see the new Alien movie."
"__HORROR__ Oh yeah, I'm a little worried that they're going to mess up the franchise."
"__HORROR__ I think they're going to do a good job.  But I'm just holding out until It comes out later this year."
"__HORROR__ Oh yeah, It is going to be terrifying.  Do you think Skaarsgard is going to do a good job?"
"__HORROR__ Well, it will be hard to compete with Tim Curry, the original It.  But from the trailers, it looks really scary."
"__HORROR__ It definitely does. I'm glad they're remaking it.  I think it needed an update."
"__HORROR__ Well, the original was awesome.  But I'm curious to see if they might be more true to the book in this movie."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, in the book It was rarely a clown, he usually took the form of some horrible creature.  So I really hope they work with that."
"__HORROR__ Me too."
