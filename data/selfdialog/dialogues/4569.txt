"__MUSIC__ European polyphony arose out of early religious chants"
"__MUSIC__ But Other regions of the world also have polyphony."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but in other regions, it wasn't developed as a part of musical traditions, but as a part of defense mechanism during the human evolution."
"__MUSIC__ And in Europe?"
"__MUSIC__ it was explicitly developed out of the monophonic singing. The oldest examples of polyphony are from arond 900 AD."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty old."
"__MUSIC__ Scolica enchiriadis and Musica enchiriadis. They're music theory books basically."
"__MUSIC__ i guess if we're to find an example of polyphony, a theory book would do it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but note, the polyphony must have existed prior to writing of the theory books in order for the theory to be developed sufficiently to be discussed."
"__MUSIC__ The chants."
"__MUSIC__ Precisely, It was highly unusual to sing or make music about anything aother than God up until a certain time frame."
"__MUSIC__ Even then they called vulgar music"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Musica Vulgaris."
"__MUSIC__ So then this theory book, what's in it?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, The scolica is mainly a commentary on the content of Musica enchiriadis, while Musica has 19 chapters. and chapters 10-18 deals with making polyphony"
"__MUSIC__ What's in chapter 19?"
"__MUSIC__ Some stuff the legend of Orpheus. I don't know why."
"__MUSIC__ Because Orpheus is a musical genius according to the myth. ."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, how about that. Anyway the European polyphony began prior to the Western Schism. And Avignon which was the seat of the antipope was the center for musica vulagris which influenced religious music significantly."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting."
