"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I generally like to listen to everything, except lately I've really been into country."
"__MUSIC__ I used to like country but it seems like the recent stuff sounds more like pop than country."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, sometimes some artists pair with pop starts and it kind of takes away from the country feel."
"__MUSIC__ Who have you been listening to recently?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Luke Bryan right now! Have you heard of him?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I have heard of him. What songs does he sing?"
"__MUSIC__ One of my favorites is from a few years ago, it's called 'rain is a good thing'."
"__MUSIC__ Now that you mention it, I might have heard that one on the radio. Who is the artists that sings that song about growing up and being like their dad?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that sounds like the Zac Brown Band song, my old man."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's it!"
"__MUSIC__ You like Zac Brown Band?"
"__MUSIC__ I do. A few years ago they had a number of songs I really enjoyed."
"__MUSIC__ You know I saw them in concert two years ago?"
"__MUSIC__ Really?! Were they as good in concert as they are on the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ Seriously, it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome. I wonder if they have any upcoming concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, I think they do."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to look online and see if I can find any country music concerts later this summer."
"__MUSIC__ Great, let me know if you find any!"
