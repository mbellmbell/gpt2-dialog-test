"__FASHION__ What are you going to wear to the festival this year?"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure. I want to be fashion forward but..."
"__FASHION__ But what?"
"__FASHION__ I don't really like many of the new trends this Spring?"
"__FASHION__ What? I'm obsessed"
"__FASHION__ I'm a little more preppy, and this Spring's styles are a little too boho for my taste."
"__FASHION__ I'm obsessed with the lace and embroidery."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, that's not my thing."
"__FASHION__ Floral prints are in too! What about that?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, not my fave but that's probably my best option for the festival."
"__FASHION__ Flesh tones are in too."
"__FASHION__ Yeah that's cool as long as it's close to baby pink!"
"__FASHION__ I think I'm gonna wear a full length lace dress."
"__FASHION__ I think I'll wear a floral mini, but I have to see what's in stores."
"__FASHION__ Do you wanna go shopping this weekend?"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure if we like the same stores, but sure!"
"__FASHION__ We'll check out department stores, we'll both have options that way."
"__FASHION__ Ok, sounds like a plan. And Marshalls!"
"__FASHION__ Definitely!"
"__FASHION__ Cool I'll look up some ideas online first!"
