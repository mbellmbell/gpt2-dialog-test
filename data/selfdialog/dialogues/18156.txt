"__MOVIES__ Did you see Deadpool?"
"__MOVIES__ That was funny, one of the best comic movies I've ever seen."

"__MOVIES__ Then they showed the whole later haha."
"__MOVIES__ And when he cut off his own hand and it had a middle finger."
"__MOVIES__ Then when it was growing back and it was extra tiny."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and that was maybe the funniest one liner of the movie."

"__MOVIES__ The action was awesome too."
"__MOVIES__ Sure was.  Deadpool is one of my favorite heroes."

"__MOVIES__ I hope it's as good as the first but those are huge shoes to fill."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it.  They picked the right person to play him."
"__MOVIES__ I like when he was telling the cabby to kill that other guy."
"__MOVIES__ That was cracking me up."
