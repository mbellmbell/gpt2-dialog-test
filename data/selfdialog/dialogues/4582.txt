"__MUSIC__ My friend invited me to a Florida Georgia Line Concert."
"__MUSIC__ They are country right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm not really into country but she really wants me to go with her for her birthday. And I do like some country stuff."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sing?"
"__MUSIC__ They sing that song H.O.L.Y, which I kinda like."
"__MUSIC__ Do they sing 'Pontoon'?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love that one, but I don't think that's them. I think that's Little Big Town."
"__MUSIC__ Gotcha. They sing 'better man' too right."
"__MUSIC__ I think so. I'm more of a classic rock girl myself. I could listen to Led Zeppelin all day."
"__MUSIC__ Yasss and the Eagles!"
"__MUSIC__ I saw the Eagles in Concert in Clevleland back in the 90's. It was awesome."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Eagles song?"
"__MUSIC__ That's hard. I love Hotel California, Take it Easy and Desporado."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have a lot of good ones."
"__MUSIC__ Some of their stuff has a country sound to it I guess, so maybe I do like more Country than I think."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it depends."
"__MUSIC__ I just don't like sad mopey country songs."
"__MUSIC__ Lol, like 'There's a tear in my beer'?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, exactly. I want more upbeat stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. But I still don't like a alot of country."
