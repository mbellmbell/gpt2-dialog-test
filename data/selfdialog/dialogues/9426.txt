"__BASEBALL__ What are you doing tonight?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm watching the Royals game on TV. Are you watching it?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I'm afraid to, I heard that Chris Young is pitching, he's been so horrible this year, we should have traded him last year."
"__BASEBALL__ No, he's not pitching, Danny Duffy is, but yes I agree about Chris Young. I can't believe the one game we saw in person this year he was pitching. What a waste of money."
"__BASEBALL__ My Mom was asking me why I thought hewas doing so poorly this year, I said I thought it was that he's lost about 3-5 mph off of all his pitches."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, that, plus, I think his arm slot is different, it seems like his pitches don't have much rotation."
"__BASEBALL__ What is the score in the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's 3-3 in the 7th inning, they just put Al Albuquerque in. You should turn it on."
"__BASEBALL__ Albuquerque? When did we get him? How? I thought he was with the Tigers."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he's pitched for everybody. Typical fill in journeyman. Like we don't have enough of those already."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm turning it on now, I have a feeling this will end badly."
"__BASEBALL__ Probably. At least some of our hitters are finally hot, Hosmer and Cain have scored the runs."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know what we will do if they don't resign them. We will go back to being the worst team in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, they are going to be free agents soon, so it's better to get something for them than nothing."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, but it's like our entire World Series team has been totally dismantled. And not replaced with anyone good."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, that's not true, we still have our 18 million dollar man who's hitting .150. He probably has some other injuy, again."
"__BASEBALL__ Gordon is such a waste of payroll.  I can't believe they signed him to that huge contract when he's always injured. We could have spent that money better elsewhere."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. oh, geez, Royals are now behind 4-3. Only 6 outs left to go ahead. Yeah, I feel real good about this- I knew I shouldn't have turned it on."
"__BASEBALL__ These last 2 seasons have just been soul crushing.  Guess we're back to the team we've had for the last 20 years- a losing one! Ugh!"
"__BASEBALL__ I know. We may want to rethink going to see them play so many times when we go to California. It will probably be a real downer."
