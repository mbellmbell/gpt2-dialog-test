"__STAR_WARS__ I know there's a lot wrong with the Star Wars prequel trilogy--"
"__STAR_WARS__ You could do a whole college course on how not to do a sequel by studying those movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ But what do you think was the main problem? Was there one thing you could point to and fix, and the trilogy would get better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think one of the major flaws was the relationship between Amidala and Anakin. It wasn't credible."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know it was kind of weird that Amidala was so much older than Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Unfortunately, the age difference was compounded when they were both adults, because Amidala was so responsible and aware, and Anakin was a complainy mopey baby."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what George Lucas was thinking. Here was the future Darth Vader, and he needed all the positive lovable qualities he could get, to make his seduction by the Dark Side all the more tragic."
"__STAR_WARS__ You could say, but wait, Amidala fell in love with him, so that means he's wonderful! But if a relationship is not based in credible reality, the whole thing just feels contrived - which this did."
"__STAR_WARS__ I must admit, I'm hard pressed to list any quality of Anakin's that would compel a beautiful princess to fall in love with him."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the effectiveness of the whole trilogy, and the tragedy of Anakin becoming Darth, hinges on that relationship. So the trilogy was a total fail story-wise for me, because the love story was contrived and stupid and nonsense."
