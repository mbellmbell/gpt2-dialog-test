"__MUSIC__ Hey, is that Michael Jackson you're listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's Billie Jean!"
"__MUSIC__ That's a great song!  His music really makes me want to dance."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  I love this one, and I've always loved Don't Stop Til You Get Enough."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a great song, too.  I can still remember when the video for Thriller came out."
"__MUSIC__ I know, and his dancing is just unbelievable."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's really a shame.  He was a pop icon!"
"__MUSIC__ I know.  Tragic, really."
"__MUSIC__ Did you listen to his sister Janet, too?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I love Janet Jackson's music.  Escapade was a great single."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she had a lot of great ones."
"__MUSIC__ Rhythm Nation and That's the Way Love Goes were both great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they definitely had a very talented family."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if she and Michael ever did a duet?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really sure.  That definitely would've been interesting to hear."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it would've.  Is she still making music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, she's gotten a little old.  I guess it's possible."
"__MUSIC__ I thought I heard she released something in 2015."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think I heard that too.  So I guess she's still going strong."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I haven't heard it yet."
