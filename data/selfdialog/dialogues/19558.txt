"__MOVIES__ Do you think The Prestige or The Illusionist is a better movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Why those two?"
"__MOVIES__ They were magician movies that came out around the same time. I'm conducting a survey."
"__MOVIES__ An informal survey, then?"
"__MOVIES__ A very informal survey. So which?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think I've got to go with The Prestige."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, why The Prestige."
"__MOVIES__ I think the final trick is more surprising."
"__MOVIES__ Just that?"
"__MOVIES__ The technology is also more interesting. It's historical, but has elements of sci-fi."
"__MOVIES__ The twist at the end is really a head-scratcher."
"__MOVIES__ Right, and I respect that."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I think I like The Illusionist better."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, The Prestige is a brilliant movie, but it feels a little cold to me."
"__MOVIES__ Like it's all about the trick?"
"__MOVIES__ Right. And some academic, philosophical questions. But The Illusionist is different."
"__MOVIES__ How?"
"__MOVIES__ The Illusionist is really just about a forbidden romance overcoming the odds."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, that sounds sappy to me!"
