"__MUSIC__ I often think I was born in the wrong decade.  I really enjoy the music of groups like Simon and Garfunkel."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't their early stuff sort of more like a do-wap group?"
"__MUSIC__ I do think that is how they got their start."
"__MUSIC__ I've personally always thought that Art Garfunkel had the better voice."
"__MUSIC__ I agree but Paul Simon had the more successful solo career.  I don't know if he is more marketable or perhaps it is his song writing ability."
"__MUSIC__ He is an amazing song writer.  What is your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ From when they were together or solo?"
"__MUSIC__ When they were together but you can tell me both actually."
"__MUSIC__ I know it's cliche but I really like Sounds of Silence.  There is something haunting about it."
"__MUSIC__ I don't disagree but I really like the Boxer.  I remember being scared of the song when I was little because it had these really loud parts in it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh you mean the drums.  Did you know they set them up in front of an elevator shaft to get that sound out of them?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I had heard that before.  I also read that they recorded part of it in a church."
"__MUSIC__ The chorus is strange though.  They say Lie la Lie over and over again like they couldn't think of anything better."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I read about that in an interview Paul Simon did once.  It was a placeholder so that he could think of something better."
"__MUSIC__ I guess he didn't come up with anything?"
"__MUSIC__ No and I think the producers liked the sound.  I heard some people thought it was intentional - talking about how life can be a lie."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that happens all the time."
"__MUSIC__ True but Simon said it was just something he said as he was writing the song and then it stuck."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder how many times something like that happens."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we could look it up.  I'm sure lots of song writers use place holders but never think of anything."
