"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard of Twenty One Pilots?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think I heard them on the radio a few weeks ago."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, not really. Like I said, I just hear them on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, gotcha. Well, you should check out their older stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Car radio is really good, as well as House of Gold."
"__MUSIC__ Are those their most popular songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, but they are really good. their older is stuff is a lot more introspective."
"__MUSIC__ Is their newer stuff not like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. It's a lot more poppy, and thus appealing to a broader audience."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound like a bad thing."
"__MUSIC__ It's not, but they lost their original sound."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just too generic now."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's fair. how long have you been listening to them?"
"__MUSIC__ For about 5 years."
"__MUSIC__ Dang, that's a pretty long time. Especially considering I just heard them on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I went to one of their concerts too. Best one I've ever been to."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds awesome!"
