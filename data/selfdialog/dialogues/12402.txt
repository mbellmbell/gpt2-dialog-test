"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough to be a football fan in the bay area."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? Didn't the 49ers do okay last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. But I mean, it's more because there are two teams out here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders and the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. And I feel like all of my friends are fans of one but not the other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they play in different conferences? I feel like this shouldn't be a problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not a huge problem or anything, but it's difficult to get people excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's like they have a rivalry but never play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm. I understand that, I think. I really do"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just a little bit uncomfortable. Not a whole lot though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe we should find a weekend when they both play at different times, and have a big party."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could get into that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know who to invite?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kevin is really excited about the new season for the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then he should come."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Molly and her dad both really like the 49ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should come too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. This should be fun!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it will be!"
