"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Beauty and The Beast film yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I have not was it as good as the old one."
"__MOVIES__ It was live action, so not really comparable to the animation but it was pretty close, better than the Cinderella remake,"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I hated that one. Did you see they are making a remake movie of the Lion King, live action?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I did not. Why do the make so many remake movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, like the 20 Fast and The Furious movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they are at nine and I like them. Better than the Little Mermaid remake movie that is in the works."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, I know! But I did like Ghost-busters, the new one, talking about remakes."
"__MOVIES__ With the all female cast, yeah it was a novel idea, poor execution. There are remaking an all Female Ocean's Eleven too,"
"__MOVIES__ I did not hear about that one, is it the same movie or what?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, just female cast. Maybe they will make an Ocean's 11,12 and 13 like the other one."
"__MOVIES__ I thought there were only twelve of them?"
"__MOVIES__ No, thirteen but only actually three."
"__MOVIES__ That gets a little confusing, like the star wars movies, the first one is actually the third one and so on."
"__MOVIES__ Episode one, chronologically the first movie, is the fourth to be released."
"__MOVIES__ So confusing, like Fast and The Furious, sort of prequels then sequels all jumbled in there."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah,I have never quite placed Tokyo Drift, in the timeline."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that movie though , great racing scenes."
"__MOVIES__ The acting was good too, nothing like Paul Walker era Furious."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, I stopped liking those films after he passed away."
