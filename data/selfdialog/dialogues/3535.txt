"__MUSIC__ I'm looking for some new music, I feel like I've been listening to the same stuff lately."
"__MUSIC__ I can help with that, I've discovered a few great artists recently and added them to my playlists."
"__MUSIC__ Great! Do you know of any local artists, I want to be more involved in the local music scene."
"__MUSIC__ I saw a lot of great artists in the city recently. My favorite so far is Ayron Jones, have you heard of him?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't! What kind of music does he play?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a guitar player, who also performs with a bass player and a drummer. You should check out their website, they just released a new album a couple weeks ago!"
"__MUSIC__ I will definitely check that out. What other local bands do you suggest?"
"__MUSIC__ So TacoCat is great for alternative music, they play a lot locally. They also usually have the band Boyfriends open for them, because the members of boyfriends are the actual boyfriends of the girls in TacoCat."
"__MUSIC__ That's so funny! I'll be sure to look them up."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they play a lot of cheap local shows. Another great local band is Eldridge Gravy and the Court Supreme."
"__MUSIC__ what a funny name, are they like a big country group?"
"__MUSIC__ They play good folk music, but they are so fun to watch on stage, and they have like 15 band members."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! These all sound like great suggestions for local music. What else you got?"
"__MUSIC__ So there's a band that was called The West, and now they are called Killer Workout, but they play new disco and dance music, their shows are amazing, they are so good live."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, all these local artists I've never heard of, I'll have to get out to some more live music shows."
"__MUSIC__ There's every kind of music every weekend. If you are looking for something softer like Jazz music, there's The Apollo Trio, and they are amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that sounds great! Do you know of any good local country bands, my boyfriend loves going to country shows."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely, I saw Steel Grit and they totally rocked it. It's a weird match up when you see the band onstage, but the music is absolutely on point."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, thanks so much for your recommendations. I have quite a few bands to look up now."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, and as always, if you are not yet a Pearl Jam fan, they are my favorite Seattle band, and I still listen to them all the time!"
