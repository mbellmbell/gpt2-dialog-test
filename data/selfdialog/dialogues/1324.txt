"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Cane Brown?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know who that is. Is he a music artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's a younger artist but up and coming."
"__MUSIC__ Oh ok. What kind of music does he sing?"
"__MUSIC__ It's mostly country, but it kind of has a pop feel to it too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that sounds like something I would like."
"__MUSIC__ You should try to search for some of his songs. He has a really deep and rustic voice."
"__MUSIC__ I just looked him up. Is he really only 23?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! He's really young but has a lot of talent."
"__MUSIC__ He must be good because it looks like he has his own tour."
"__MUSIC__ I really think in a few years he is going to be the next George Strait. His voice is so unique."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure if anyone can come close to George Strait. He is a classic!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, but give one of his albums a chance. My favorite is his Chapter 1 album."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe he is 23 and already has albums out. That's great."
"__MUSIC__ I'm telling you, he's a really great artist!"
"__MUSIC__ I believe you. I'm looking for his album right now so I can download it."
"__MUSIC__ When do you, check out his song titled Excuses."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good. It does help that he's a really good looking guy too!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know! He is so popular with the early 20s crowd. He's easy on the eyes."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the heads up, I'm excited to give his music a listen."
