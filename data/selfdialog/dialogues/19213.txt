"__MOVIES__ Hey, I am looking for some good romantic comedies to watch. Do you happen to know of any?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, do you have any favorite actors or actresses?"
"__MOVIES__ I love Ryan Reynolds as far as actors. I like quite a few actresses, but I really like Sandra Bullock."
"__MOVIES__ Well then I have the perfect movie for you."
"__MOVIES__ What is that?"
"__MOVIES__ The Proposal. It is so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Is it a super mushy movie? It sounds like it with a name like that."
"__MOVIES__ No, really through most of the movie they cannot stand one another."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting. I really like Sandra Bullock movies."
"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I have to go with the classic-While You Were Sleeping."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love that one too! I like a lot of the older romantic comedies."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is your all-time favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh tough choice! I would have to go with either Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness. Those are such good movies!"
"__MOVIES__ What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if it really fits the bill exactly, but have always loved Grease."
"__MOVIES__ Who doesn't love Grease! I would say that it most definitely fits the bill of romantic comedy."
"__MOVIES__ John Travolta has changed so much since then though."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I really miss his older movies."
