"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite charater in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Princess Leia of course."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love her too."
"__STAR_WARS__ She's amazing, but now that Carrie Fisher is dead, I'm sad her character is gone."
"__STAR_WARS__ So true, though she finished filming the next film before her death."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so thankful for that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus, I guess editors could use previously recorded footage of her like they did in Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they could, but it would be so weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. I mean, she is dead."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. Hopefully, they'll find a great way to edit the story so her death makes sense, even if that's not what I want."
