"__MUSIC__ When did you start listening to the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I was in junior high school."
"__MUSIC__ Did your parents have records or tapes of them?"
"__MUSIC__ No, there was an oldies station in the area where I lived.  They would play a syndicated Beatles show every week and I would listen to it faithfully."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, you were really dedicated."
"__MUSIC__ I was.  In fact, sometimes I would tape the show so that I had some of the songs."
"__MUSIC__ You had a tape cassette in your radio?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup.  Remember those?"
"__MUSIC__ People say that tapes are coming back.  And so are mix tapes."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I loved making mix tapes."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if the movie Guardians of the Galaxy played a role in making mix tapes popular."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  But making mix tapes are fun because you can also add your own vocalizations much more easily than with a CD."
"__MUSIC__ I don't even have any burnable CDs anymore.  I mainly listen to music on my phone."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think that impacts the quality of the music?"
"__MUSIC__ People say it does, but I think they just say that to sound discerning."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if it makes a difference the type of music you listen to."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well now, there is so much synthesized sound vs real instruments I doubt that it would make a difference."
"__MUSIC__ People also say that the headphones you use makes a difference too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the people who sell the headphones."
