"__DISNEY__ I just love the Little Mermaid, it's my favorite Disney movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too!"
"__DISNEY__ Growing up I always wanted to be Ariel and find my Prince Eric."
"__DISNEY__ I just wanted to have a dad that could control the weather!"
"__DISNEY__ Haha that would have been a good trait to have, especially on those days when a snow day could have really come in handy!"
"__DISNEY__ When I was a kid, I had a Sebastian stuffed animal that I carried everywhere. I could never decide whether he was a crab or a lobster though!"
"__DISNEY__ I think he was a lobster. I had a Ariel barbie doll that I took with me to the pool every summer."
"__DISNEY__ The one with the clip on tail?"
"__DISNEY__ That's the one! She swam with me and we sang 'Part of Your World,' my mom thought it was hilarious!"
"__DISNEY__ I had the same doll! I always pretended I was diving in the shipwreck like she did at the beginning of the movie!"
