"__HORROR__ Have you seen 'Paranormal Activity'?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I didn't care for it though."
"__HORROR__ Neither did I. I'd heard such good reviews."
"__HORROR__ It just didn't scare me. The acting in the normal scenes was so corny."
"__HORROR__ I thought so too - they were kind of bad at normal acting, which made the hysterical acting just seem ridiculous."
"__HORROR__ It didn't even creep me out. I was pretty disappointed."
"__HORROR__ And there's so many sequels!"
"__HORROR__ Exactly! I'm sick of Hollywood not making any original horror movies."
"__HORROR__ It's all just remake after remake. I liked the English language remake of 'Let The Right One In', though."
"__HORROR__ I haven't seen it - I've only seen the original."
