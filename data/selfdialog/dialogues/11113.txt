"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite NFL team for the coming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. I haven't been keeping up with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What, really? Well, who do you like in terms of players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about Kirk Cousins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kirk Cousins is good, he played for Michigan State University."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is he doing now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's still the quarterback with the Washington Redskins..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that sounds right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And, he is doing really well these days!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? That's cool!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They didn't want to play him much at first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why wouldn't they do that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Apparently, the team thought a lot of other guys were better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't he end up playing after a couple of the main quarterbacks got injured or sidelined?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that sounds about right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Kirk Cousins definitely showed the fans that he's got it going on!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's so true, they didn't know how good he was until he finally got his foot in the door."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That just goes to show that stats aren't always the best predictor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, if more teams gave the back-up quarterbacks a chance, there would be more diamonds in the rough!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then again, when you are at the level of the NFL, you're already the top of the top, so being able to get the foot in the door is the most important thing!"
