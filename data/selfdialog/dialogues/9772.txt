"__COMEDY__ You need to catch Office Christmas Party, it's hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ Is that the one with Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston, TJ Miller, and Olivia Munn?"
"__COMEDY__ That's the movie. I watched it this past weekend with my girlfriend and we laughed so hard. It was really funny."
"__COMEDY__ What did you really enjoy about it? From the trailers I saw it looked pretty dumb."
"__COMEDY__ Well it is really silly, but if you're in that mood you'd enjoy it. It's basically about an Office Christmas Party being thrown one last time before the company supposedly goes under."
"__COMEDY__ Is Jason Bateman the main star? He's usually really sarcastic and dry with his humor. I'm not really a huge fan of that."
"__COMEDY__ Yes, he's the main star. He plays the company's CEO's best friend and long time associate. TJ Miller is the CEO, Jennifer Aniston plays TJ's mean spirited domineering sister and Olivia Munn is the company tech genius."
"__COMEDY__ Was it just physical humor or were there a lot of actual crazy moments and funny lines?"
"__COMEDY__ It was a little to a lot of everything. You had some really funny moments in the action sequences, you had the recreational drug usage, and you also had funny physical humor moments with TJ. I really enjoyed the movie and think if you're in a mood to laugh it hits the spot."
"__COMEDY__ I'll think about it, I'm not too sold on the cast, and the movie really does seem a bit too silly for me. I'm more into the Anna Kendrick type of comedies."
