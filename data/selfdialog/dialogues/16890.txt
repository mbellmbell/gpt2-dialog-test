"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest Disney movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Beauty and the Beast? I watched that last night!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay, what did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed the animations and thought Emma Watson was great."
"__MOVIES__ I think for me, I had a more enjoyable experience with Cinderella, but that's not to say Beauty and the Beast was bad in any way."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed Beauty and the Beast more, it was fun, light, it had great musical pieces too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I agree the musical pieces were well executed but I'm not really a big musical type of person, but I did enjoy the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Which scene did you think was the best in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the best scene in the movie for me was the action sequence in the final act, which scene was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved the ballroom scene as well as the set up before with all the castle decor pieces helping them set up along with the musical piece."
"__MOVIES__ I do have to admit the animation was top notch, seeing all those things turn into real life action, compared to the previous animated version."
"__MOVIES__ I thought they did an exceptional job with it, especially with the candle and clocks movements, and their actions, I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think Emma did a good job in her role as Belle?"
"__MOVIES__ I found her charming, she was cute, and a very believable Belle."
"__MOVIES__ She definitely nailed the role, but I found her excuses on skipping past movies presented to her and accepting Beauty and the Beast, a bit off putting."
"__MOVIES__ Which other movies did she turn down to take this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, she turned down Cinderella, stating she couldn't relate to the main character, also turned down La La Land."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I didn't know she did that. I guess she really wanted the part that she felt fit her best."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she probably did, and it seem to be a great decision as Beauty and the Beast definitely was a winner for audiences."
"__MOVIES__ No doubt! I'll probably watch it again sometime soon, one of the best Disney movies, they've really been putting out great movies of late."
