"__DISNEY__ My kids were watching Cinderella a few days ago, and now I've got the songs stuck in my head."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah? Which ones?"
"__DISNEY__ The one sung by the mice when they're making her dress. 'Cinderelly, Cinderelly, night and day it's Cinderelly.'"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that's a cute song."
"__DISNEY__ And the song by the fairy godmother, 'Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo!'"
"__DISNEY__ That one would probably get on my nerves if it was stuck in my head."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly. At least it's not the off-key song by the evil stepsister."
"__DISNEY__ Well, now that you mention it, that song will probably be stuck in my head!"
"__DISNEY__ Oops, sorry about that!"
"__DISNEY__ It's fine. I'll just think about Moana songs instead to get rid of it."
