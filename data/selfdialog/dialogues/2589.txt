"__MUSIC__ What TV show do you think as the best music?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean throughout, or a general soundtrack?"
"__MUSIC__ Surprise me!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, for the opening, it's got to be between Attack on Titan and Family Guy."
"__MUSIC__ I thought you'd say The Simpsons; I know you love your Danny Elfman."
"__MUSIC__ Family Guy has the same feel and energy but is much more on the self-parody. Have you heard Attack on Titan's?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a Japanese anim√© show, and the them song is perfect for the high-intensity action."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good. Would you like to hear my choice?"
"__MUSIC__ No thanks."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Fine, go ahead, you know I'm kidding."
"__MUSIC__ I love the music for Lost. Remember that?"
"__MUSIC__ I loved Lost! I watched every episode. What part of the music struck you so much?"
"__MUSIC__ When they got off the plane after their rescue; it was so beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ You know the composer had themes for each person?"
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, just like in most movies. Composers give each character their own theme."
"__MUSIC__ Sweet!"
"__MUSIC__ I have the sheet music, if you'd like. I got it illegally, of course."
