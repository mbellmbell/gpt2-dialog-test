"__DISNEY__ How did you feel about moana?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked that she was a modern day girl but the story was still in the past."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, she didn't even have a love interest in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I wish the pig was the main sidekick instead of Hei Hei."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I loved the music in it. I think Lin Manuel Miranda did really good with the songs."
"__DISNEY__ Yea. Did you hear he was going to be in the new Mary poppins movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yea. I wonder if he is helping with the soundtrack again or just acting."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that he's helping with that soundtrack and acting."
"__DISNEY__ I think he signed a deal with Disney to work on multiple soundtracks in the future."
"__DISNEY__ I guess kind of like Phil Collins did Tarzan and brother bear."
