"__MUSIC__ Are you going to Taste Of Chicago this year?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, I go every year.It's the best food festival anywhere. There are so many venders, and so many different things to try."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Taste Of Chicago is about food of course, but they also have bands playing every day so you have something to do while you're sitting down eating all the food items you bought."
"__MUSIC__ Oh sure, I like going to watch the bands. I usually get three or four plates from different venders and grab a beverage and eat while I watch a band."
"__MUSIC__ They usually have seven to ten bands a day playing, and July seventh there's a band I want to see- Ben Harper and the Criminals."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I remember Ben Harper. He was really popular about fifteen years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Ben Harper is a fabulous guitar player. He's a terrific singer, and his live shows are always amazing."
"__MUSIC__ He plays such a wide variety of genres, it keeps it from being boring. He can switch back and forth from a blues song to a rock song to a reggae song, and it all seems to blend together perfectly."
"__MUSIC__ That's why I was asking if you were going to the Taste, I want to go on the seventh and see Ben Harper, but I need a ride because my husband's going to be out of town with our car."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, I can go on the seventh. Hey, I have a Ben Harper cd I can bring to play in the cd player on the way there."
"__MUSIC__ What cd do you have?"
"__MUSIC__ I have the cd he put out in 2003 or 4, Diamonds I think it's called."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, Diamonds On The Inside. I used to have it, but I let a coworker borrow it and they never gave it back."
"__MUSIC__ Don't you hate when people do that? It makes you want to never be nice and let anyone borrow anything ever again."
"__MUSIC__ YES. And unfortunately, it's happened to me twice."
"__MUSIC__ What was the other cd that wasn't given back?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the first time a coworker borrowed my Ben Harper cd AND my Pearl Jam single cd, and then said she wasn't giving them back because she loved them. Later, a best friend borrowed my Sublime cd, and said she couldn't give it back because she loved it so much. I tried arguing, demanding, nothing worked, neither of them returned my cds."
"__MUSIC__ That is just insanely rude! I feel so bad for you. Tell you what- I don't listen to the Ben Harper cd that much and I have a ton of cds. I'll let you have it to keep when we go to the Taste to make up for those creeps."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that is really nice of you! Thank you very much!"
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome, and don't worry- July seventh, we're going to rock!"
