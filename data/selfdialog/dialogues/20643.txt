"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen Curve?"
"__THRILLER__ No, what's that about?"
"__THRILLER__ It's a movie about a woman who gives a hitchhiker a ride and ends up driving off a cliff."
"__THRILLER__ Why did she do that?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, he took out a knife and she started freaking out, so she figured, I'll either get raped or I'll drive off this cliff."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, and she chose the cliff."
"__THRILLER__ Yep, and then she gets stuck in her car for days at the bottom of the cliff."
"__THRILLER__ Wow, does she die."
"__THRILLER__ No, she is quite the warrior in the movie. She gets out and gets revenge."
"__THRILLER__ Very cool."
