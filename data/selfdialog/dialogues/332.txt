"__MUSIC__ Alright, here's a question. If you were on a desert island and could only bring one CD, what would you bring?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a ridiculous question."
"__MUSIC__ Nope, you have to answer."
"__MUSIC__ I will if you do first."
"__MUSIC__ Easy. White Album by the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, that's a good one. But I still can't answer."
"__MUSIC__ Not fair. I just answered it so quickly."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but. Admit it. You only listen to Rock."
"__MUSIC__ So what?"
"__MUSIC__ So I like way too many Genres. There isn't a single album that has all of that on it."
"__MUSIC__ The White Album has such a crazy spread of styles though. It's got folk, it's got rock-"
"__MUSIC__ -Nope, it's all still rock."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever."
"__MUSIC__ No really, I would need a little bit of hip-hop, a little bit of Funk, some R&B."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. Actually yeah... I'd bring Talking Book by Stevie Wonder."
"__MUSIC__ What? You barely to Stevie Wonder."
"__MUSIC__ Actually... I love Superstitious more than any song."
"__MUSIC__ See? Your question was dumb."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not the one who couldn't answer a simple question."
"__MUSIC__ FINE. I would also choose the White Album."
