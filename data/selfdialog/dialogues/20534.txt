"__MOVIES__ Yeah, definitely."
"__MOVIES__ You can't be serious."
"__MOVIES__ I'm totally serious!"
"__MOVIES__ How could you possibly think that it's a better film than Pulp Fiction?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I just liked the characters and lot a lot more."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like about the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess the setting just worked for me."
"__MOVIES__ What, because it's like a Western?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's probably it. And there was a much better plot."
"__MOVIES__ No way!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes way. I thought that the story was more cohesive."
"__MOVIES__ That's not true whatsoever. Pulp Fiction's story and dialogue is legendary"
"__MOVIES__ It's just okay."
"__MOVIES__ What? Just okay? Pulp Fiction is infinitely better than Hateful 8."
"__MOVIES__ Well why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ For starters, the scenery and story are more interesting."
"__MOVIES__ What parts are you talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, the 'Say what again!' scene. That's a classic! There's no 'classic' scenes to be found in Hateful 8."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess we have to disagree to disagree."
"__MOVIES__ I guess."
