"__MOVIES__ Hey.  What have you been up to?"
"__MOVIES__ I've been watching some older comedies."
"__MOVIES__ Anything good in particular?"
"__MOVIES__ I just saw the three 'Rush Hour' movies."
"__MOVIES__ I always enjoyed those movies.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan were a great comedic duo."
"__MOVIES__ I think the second one was the best.  Three was probably the weakest."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that.  Paris was a cool setting for the third film, but the writing wasn't as good."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have any suggestions for other comedies?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'Tropic Thunder?'  I personally enjoy satire movies like that, more so than Buddy-cop movies like 'Rush Hour.'"
"__MOVIES__ I actually never got around to watching that movie.  What are some of the satirical elements?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the movie really skewers Hollywood and the Entertainment Industry."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting.  Anything more specific about it?"
"__MOVIES__ So for instance, it makes fun of the degree to how seriously actors take their roles."
"__MOVIES__ Was there anyone in it that I'd know?"
"__MOVIES__ You would know most of the cast.  The cast includes, Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, and Matthew McConaughey."
"__MOVIES__ That's a star-studded cast."
"__MOVIES__ Additionally, Downey and Cruise both received nominations at the Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actor."
"__MOVIES__ That's impressive.  I think it's cool that a comedy has a message and is also that funny."
"__MOVIES__ You will really enjoy it.  Don't forget to watch the faux trailers in the beginning of the movie as well."
"__MOVIES__ I will be sure not to miss them.  Thank you for the movie suggestion."
