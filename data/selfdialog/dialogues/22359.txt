"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty & the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No I haven't! It was my favorite growing up. Did you have a favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I can say, without a doubt, that it is Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ That is my daughters favorite also! I am also a huge fan of Sleeping Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ We love that one around here too!"
"__DISNEY__ We have been trying to decide which Classic to pick up next for the kids. Any suggestions?"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe Bambi? Or Dumbo? Do they like movies that revolve around animals?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes they do! The animals ones are my youngest sons favorite. We have dumbo already and Bambi is definitely going on my list!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad I could help! Disney movies are my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Thank you so much! They are my favorite too."
