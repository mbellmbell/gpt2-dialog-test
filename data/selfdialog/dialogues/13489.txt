"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hi! Are you excited for the next Green Bay Packers season??"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it! I can't wait! Do you have access to your dad's season tickets again this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, are you interested in going to a game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely would be. I can't wait to see what Rodgers can do this season. How do you think the season will start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully we get 'em right out of the gate & it's not like last season. What game would you be interested in going to?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd love to see the Packers play the Vikings - what a rivalry! Do you think I can get tickets to that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll check and see. You like a good rivalry, maybe you'd want to see the Packers and Bears play -- would that be okay for a backup game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure! That'd be cool. Do you think that's the better battle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'd pick a game between the Packers and Bears any time - but maybe it's because I'm from Chicago. Where are you from again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I grew up in Minneapolis! I am a Packer fan and got a lot of heck for it as a kid growing up in Minnesota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet you did! That must have been tough. What was the worse thing someone said to you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, people have always been really nice. Do you go around talking smack to someone wearing something other than a Packers' jersey?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, no... but my mom went to a game once at Lambeau with her Bears shirt on and people were really rude to her."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In Lambeau? They have some of the most welcoming fans in the league!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I was surprised too. She probably won't be going back there again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good news for me, so that I can get a chance at another set of tickets. :)"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. If you got them, who would you take with you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You, friend! That'd be so fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't want to go, bring someone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That'd be fine too."
