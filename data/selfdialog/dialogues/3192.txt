"__MUSIC__ Hey man, do you ever listen to Dio?"
"__MUSIC__ What is a Dio?"
"__MUSIC__ Dio is not a what!  I am talking about Ronnie James Dio."
"__MUSIC__ I never heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?  He was the lead singer in Black Sabbath for a time."
"__MUSIC__ Black Sabbath?  Is that Ozzy Osbourne's group?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but Ozzy left the group back in the 80's for a time.  Dio took over the singing for two albums."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I could give those a try as I like heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome!  Go out and buy 'Heaven and Hell' and 'Mob Rules'."
"__MUSIC__ I will do that.  Is that the only two albums I should buy?"
"__MUSIC__ That's just a start.  Dio was in a number of groups."
"__MUSIC__ What groups was Dio in?"
"__MUSIC__ Well there is Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio and Heaven & Hell."
"__MUSIC__ That is a lot of groups.  Are they all good?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I don't really care for Elf.  They did not really have any popular songs."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I will not check into Elf.  What about the others?"
"__MUSIC__ Rainbow had a few songs that really rocked.  Not sure if you really want to buy the albums."
"__MUSIC__ Well I will keep that in mind."
"__MUSIC__ If you want to hear Dio at his best just stick with his Black Sabbath years, any Dio album and the one studio album from Heaven & Hell."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the info man.  I will do that!"
