"__MUSIC__ Do you know that Marron 5 just realeased a new song?"
"__MUSIC__ No I didn't know. Does that mean that there is a new album on the way?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. The song actually came out like 4 months ago."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, ok. Well, it's been a while since their last album."
"__MUSIC__ It has been a while since. I don't really know how music is working these days now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Everything comes and goes so fast that you can't even catch up with anything."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they released this song called 'Cold' a few months ago, and it is great. It made me want to get back together and jam with it."
"__MUSIC__ Well I have to hear it. But we can jam anyhow."
"__MUSIC__ I hope my voice can still go as high as Adam Levine`s."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure man. It hasn't been that long ago since you sung some high pitch songs."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'll practice a bit before and then we can set a date."
"__MUSIC__ Perfect. And you should practice some old Maroon 5 songs also since we are on that mood."
"__MUSIC__ I will. I really hope they come out with a great new album soon."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. They are a very trustworthy band."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right? Their studio work is always impeccable."
"__MUSIC__ It is. I think it has to do a lot with their producers."
"__MUSIC__ I hope they work again with the producer from 'Overexposed'."
"__MUSIC__ There were many producers working in that album, but the main one was Max Martin."
"__MUSIC__ Well he is the guy they should go for again to set up a great album again."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. They made a great team and they should try it again."
