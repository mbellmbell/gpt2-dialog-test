"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is more than a rookie, he is a monster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. He seems alright."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been following since he started at LSU; trust me on this."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, but don't forget that this is not college football anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but his dad played in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but his dad was a running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is correct but his dad has the ability to share his experiences and give him tips."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but only to an extent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right but we will have to wait and see how he applies everything when he plays."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How does he do that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ By watching football film and knowing the patterns of specific players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, okay. I wish he were faster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same. I have seeing him get beat on deep routes by extremely fast receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is the name of the game; you can't be good at everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but if I were in that position, I would be embarrassed"
