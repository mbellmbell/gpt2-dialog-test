"__MUSIC__ So I just got this new Alice in Chains album and I'm actually quite impressed."
"__MUSIC__ Did you think it was going to be bad?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I just thought that with the absence of their original singer the music would sound different."
"__MUSIC__ Like what happened with AC/DC?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly.  Alice in Chains basically sounds the same as they did before though."
"__MUSIC__ I guess they chose their new singer very carefully then."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, I think its because the chorus style of singing they use."
"__MUSIC__ That's right, they usually had two people singing at once."
"__MUSIC__ And one of those two people is still in the band, so I guess his voice in the chorus makes it sound just like it used to."
"__MUSIC__ That's great.  What's the name of the album?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard of that one."
"__MUSIC__ They also have another album with the new singer called Black Gives Way to Blue."
"__MUSIC__ They've been busy haven't they?"
"__MUSIC__ They definitely have."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe the fact that their new music sounds so similar created a lot of desire for it."
"__MUSIC__ I think it did.  At least, I'm impressed by it as I said."
"__MUSIC__ What's the name of their new singer?"
"__MUSIC__ His name is William DuVall."
"__MUSIC__ Haven't heard of him.  He must be new to the scene."
