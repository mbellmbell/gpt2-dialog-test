"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like the Pro Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think it is a joke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that it's all for show and irrelevant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I somewhat agree, although I think those players deserve recognition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but an All-NFL team would be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can agree with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just seems that the Pro Bowl game is for revenue, not rewarding success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's good that the fans are involved, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that is a plus, but it's almost unnecessary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if there are other ways to get fans involved like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, but maybe scheduling the Pro Bowl at a different date."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perhaps that would work - obviously the Super Bowl is the prime event."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Super Bowl is one of the best events in the world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you, but generally only Americans play the sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, this is true, and likely for good reasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well football is harder to play in areas with few resources."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is definitely true - not enough resources for pads and the like."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I agree - which is why soccer is the world sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not a huge soccer fan, but I agree."
