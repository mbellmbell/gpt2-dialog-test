"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, which of the two new Star Wars fillms out do you like better? Force Awakens or Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue One, definitely"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Becuase it's closer to the Stars Wars I grew up with and fills in a fairly unexplored part of the Star Wars universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I mean the capture of the Second Death Star plans was expanded upon with SHadows of the Empire, but not the frist Death Star plans."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and I liked the fact that the thermal exhaust port vulnerability wasn't an oversite, but a subtle piece of sabotage."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a nice touch."
"__STAR_WARS__ Truly it was a very nice touch."
"__STAR_WARS__ Force Awakens is still very good, though"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not saying it was bad, just that I liked Rogue One better."
