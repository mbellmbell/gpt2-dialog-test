"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the game between the Braves and Marlins last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ I meant to but forgot to turn it on. Did I miss anything?"
"__BASEBALL__ Just one of the best pitched games I have ever seen!"
"__BASEBALL__ Really.. what happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Braves started Julio Teheran as starting pitcher."
"__BASEBALL__ He has had some rough games lately. Only pitched 3 innings last week ."
"__BASEBALL__ Not last night.. it was a stellar performance. They played him 7 straight innings before letting him rest his arm!"
"__BASEBALL__ Did he walk anyone?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not only did he not walk anyone, he had a no hitter!"
"__BASEBALL__ Are you serious? I haven't seen the Braves do that in ages!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. Teheran had an awesome night. They even clocked his fast ball at over 90 mph. And not only was he fast.. he was accurate!"
"__BASEBALL__ I am pretty impressed. He really isn't one of my favorite Braves pitchers, but it sounds like he had an awesome night."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. a few batters got a piece of the ball, but they were fouls."
"__BASEBALL__ Who did they bring in for the 8th?"
"__BASEBALL__ Jim Johnson. Poor guy had been warming up all night waiting for his chance to pitch."
"__BASEBALL__ How did he do?"
"__BASEBALL__ They let him finish the game. He was pretty good, but not as good as Teheran. Johnson gave up two hits in the bottom of the ninth"
"__BASEBALL__ Did anyone score on him?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, he left both batters stuck on base."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, remind me to watch next time Teheran pitches."
