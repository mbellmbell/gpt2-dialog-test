"__POP__ Do you love Barenaked Ladies?"
"__POP__ Who doesn't? They're awesome."
"__POP__ You know I'm talking about the pop band, right?"
"__POP__ Of course. What else do you mean?"
"__POP__ Nevermind. But good for you, I guess."
"__POP__ My favorite is Grade 9, for some reason."
"__POP__ Why is that odd?"

"__POP__ Sounds like something you'd like since you're super nostalgaic."
"__POP__ Yeah, but they're a good decade older than me. Yet I still got the references."
