"__MOVIES__ I rented Arrival from the Redbox last night."
"__MOVIES__ How was it."
"__MOVIES__ Not what I expected, but overall good."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part."
"__MOVIES__ It was actually pretty sad, so no favorite parts."
"__MOVIES__ It was sad, but I liked how she told Shang his wife's dying words and he called off the Chinese attack."
"__MOVIES__ It was a great story, and I liked the movie, but I kept trying to understand what that whole thing with the kid was."
"__MOVIES__ It was her daughter."
"__MOVIES__ I know it was her daughter."
"__MOVIES__ And her daughter died."
"__MOVIES__ I understand that. I just didn't understand why it was interwoven with flashbacks."
"__MOVIES__ They were flashforwards."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean."
"__MOVIES__ She hadn't had a daughter at the time of the aliens, she was seeing her future."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wow. I misunderstood that."
"__MOVIES__ After the aliens left that when she married Ian, and they have a daughter who dies."
"__MOVIES__ I get it now. She saw ahead because of the 'tool'."
"__MOVIES__ Right, the alien language let her see the future."
"__MOVIES__ Well it's a way better movie than I thought it was."
"__MOVIES__ It was deep."
