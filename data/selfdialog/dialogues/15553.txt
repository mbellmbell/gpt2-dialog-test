"__HARRY_POTTER__ What was your favorite part about Order of the Phenix?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked the scenes practicing in the room or requirement."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was pretty cool, and seeing all the different Petronus."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also liked how Harry finally got the girl."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah that was great.  At least for a couple seconds it was."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ We got a good look at Luna too, she's quite the character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Tell me about it, she's a little strange but adds depth to the show."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, not everyone is big family somewhat normal Rob, or perfect little Harmine."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also liked Dumpledore's escape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yep, that one guy was right.  He sure knows how to make an exit."
