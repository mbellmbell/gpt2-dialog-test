"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So do you think Ice Cube and Ice T are sellouts?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nah, just because they like money and acting doesn't make them sellouts."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I suppose you're right, if their acting careers totally sucked they'd be sellouts I suppose."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Of course I'm right."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ All right, if they're not sellouts who is?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's easy, Flavor Flave."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh wow you're right, between the roast and Flavor of Love it doesn't get much worse than that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Again, of course I'm right."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He may have been a sellout, but he is still a living legend."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, you can't argue that."
