"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of the movie The Fifth Wave?"
"__MOVIES__ I even read the book."
"__MOVIES__ It was a book? I didn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ The 5th Wave is a young adult, science fiction novel."
"__MOVIES__ When was it published?"
"__MOVIES__ The novel was published in 2013 and is the first installment in The 5th Wave trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Well I just watched the movie on cable a few hours ago."
"__MOVIES__ How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the book was was better than the movie."
"__MOVIES__ It being a book is probably why I didn't like it too tough."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ The movie felt rushed and like it was missing something."
"__MOVIES__ I think a lot of people didn't like it when it first came out. They felt the story line was generic apocalyptic science fiction."
"__MOVIES__ It felt a lot like an uninspired fusion of Independence Day and the TV mini-series 'V'."
"__MOVIES__ But with a bad twist, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. The 5th Wave felt more as if it were cobbled together from a host of other, better science fiction stories."
"__MOVIES__ I think it could have been done better."
"__MOVIES__ That is what happens when Hollywood doesn't follow a book exactly as it was written."
"__MOVIES__ I hate it when they do that. Just follow the book and it will be good."
"__MOVIES__ They don't know how."
