"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which NFL teams do you think will make it to the Super Bowl in 2018?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. I hadn't thought about that yet. I guess I can see the Patriots making it again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about them. Last year was kind of a fluke for that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I wouldn't call it a fluke. More like a Cindarella story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kind of like the Cubs making it to the World Series."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not quite that dramatic, but it was a surprise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see the Falcons making it all the way again this coming year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll see. What about the Broncos?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not without Manning. Probably not, anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the Seahawks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe. They're a great team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They won the Super Bowl a few years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did they beat in that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Denver. The Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, right! They stomped them. I think a lot of people lost money betting on the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So true. Everyone was surprised, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Except maybe hardcord Seattle fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of which I am one. I love the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe a Seahawks/Patriots matchup will be in store for us in 2018."
