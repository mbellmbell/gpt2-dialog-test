"__MOVIES__ I'm in the mood for a comedy, something familiar, you know? maybe one with Bill Murray..."
"__MOVIES__ Uhm, the first one that comes to mind is 'Ghostbusters'! It's a total classic."
"__MOVIES__ Who else was in it? I think I remember Sigorney Weaver, and Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, he's totally dreamy. Didn't he write and direct it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, along with Murray, but...what was the other guy's name, who played Ray? Did he help write it too?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that was Dan Aykroyd. You know most everybody who was in it was either from Saturday Night Live or Second City."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, those were the golden days of live television comedy. I loved SNL back then."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, they reall could make you laugh! And what about Slimer, the green slime ghost?!"
"__MOVIES__ HAH, drinking wine, eating hot dogs and sliming Murray! That was awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ I never told you, but I had a secret crush on Jeanine, the secretary. Annie Potts was the actress."
"__MOVIES__ Ooh heh, how about that scene where Egon is under her desk connecting the monitor? 'I can see you're a very haaaandy person.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, 'I collect spores, mold and fungus!' Where si they come up with the lines?"
"__MOVIES__ It's sheer genius. I can hear the soundtrack as the movie opens with that ghostly Theramin making all that eery music!"
"__MOVIES__ What's a Theramin? Some kind of haprsichord?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. It's a box with two antennas like rabbit ears, and it makes creept music when you wave your hands around the aerials."
"__MOVIES__ Well whatever it is, it makes the opening for me! That librarian in the New York Public Library getting her skirt scared off was intense."
"__MOVIES__ Naw, Rick Moranis getting chased around by the minion of Zul was even better! 'Okay who brought the dog?'"
"__MOVIES__ No, what about the twinkie? 'What's all this about the twinkie, Ray?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite part is when Ray thinks of the Stay-Puff marshmallow man!"
"__MOVIES__ Makes you want to watch it, right? I could use some of that Gozer the Gozarian right now!"
