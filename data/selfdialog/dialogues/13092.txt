"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it may be time to change the rules in NFL Football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? Why? I think things are going pretty well these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are, but having some new rules and scoring opportunities may put some more excitement into the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In what way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, they got rid of tie games a few years back, but I think there could be a better way to score points in field goals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, I'll bite.  How would you change it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, since it's a lot harder to hit a field goal from further back in the field, I think it would be cool to add in more points on longer field goals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That might be interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, for instance, field goal points could start at the 30 yard line with 1 point, then 40 yards with 2 points, 50 with 3 points and so on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, in the new point system, there could be a lot more field goal kicking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, this would definitely change the game from a ground game (pass or running play) to more of a skill game for the kickers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see the kickers becoming as important as the quarterbacks in your scenario."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, can you imagine if a game came down to a field goal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I can see it now.  Time running out on the clock and the team has to make a choice as to how to handle it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And because it's a close game, the offensive team might opt to kick a field goal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Versus doing a Hail Mary pass, that might make a lot of sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you imagine the pressure on the kicker if the team runs a field goal play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Scoring might be a big pain, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I do think that it would lend a lot of subtle strategy... Maybe, someday, the NFL will make the change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Until then, the teams should continue to practice a Hail Mary pass."
