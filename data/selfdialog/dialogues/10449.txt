"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey man, I heard you like rap, do you listen to Eminem?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey, well of course I listen to him, The Eminem Show is one of my favorite albums."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh for sure, Hailey's Song is definitely one of my top favorite songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a good one, he actually sings in that one. But I also like to listen to Atmosphere, you heard of him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Slug? Well duh, you're speaking my language brother. Yesterday really hits home for me, the twist at the end really blew me away the first time I heard it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh ya, I heard about what happened about your dad, I'm sorry brother. Atmosphere really knows how to articulate life."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That is so true, Trying to Find a Balance used to be something I told myself all the time, that song really kept me stable, pun intended."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yep, Slug has kept me from falling over myself, too. But you can't forget about Del the Funky Homosapien, he keeps you moving and grooving."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh Ya, Del! Isn't that Ice Cube's Cousin?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You are correct sir, I feel Del is less ganster rap, but I can respect what Ice Cube puts down."
