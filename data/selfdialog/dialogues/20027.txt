"__MOVIES__ What are your thoughts on David O. Russell?"
"__MOVIES__ I really loved The Fighter, and I thought Silver Linings Playbook was excellent."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, but if I'm being honest, I think that both those movies are buoyed by the performances."
"__MOVIES__ Christian Bale gives an amazing performance in The Fighter."
"__MOVIES__ Melissa Leo also gives a great performance!"
"__MOVIES__ Who plays Micky Ward's girlfriend in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Amy Adams; she's a little out of her comfort zone as an actress, and she does great."
"__MOVIES__ Right, well, Silver Linings Playbook is also really well acted."
"__MOVIES__ Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in that!"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, I liked Bradley Cooper's performance a little better, I thought it was more nuanced."
"__MOVIES__ But I mean, what do you think of O. Russell as a director?"
"__MOVIES__ Really, I think he's just okay cinematically, but as we were saying he draws out really great performances."
"__MOVIES__ He was sort of the darling of Hollywood for a while, it felt like everything he did was nominated for Oscars."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, even his bad stuff, Joy was pretty awful."
"__MOVIES__ I thought Jennifer Lawrence was okay, but I didn't think she deserved the nomination."
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely not her best performance, and I thought the script wasn't too great."
"__MOVIES__ What's that other movie he did with Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence?"
"__MOVIES__ American Hustle!"
"__MOVIES__ Christian Bale gained all the weight for that role, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Right, and it got him an Oscar nomination!"
