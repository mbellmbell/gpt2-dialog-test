"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen the Iron Man Franchise?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I have."
"__SUPERHERO__ What's your favorite part of the franchise?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Probably when that Russian guy builds his own suit but it's not some big bulky machine like Iron Mans."
"__SUPERHERO__ Interesting, care to elaborate a big more."
"__SUPERHERO__ Sure, well at the race track the guy had two electric laser type whips and that's pretty much it.  He whipped those things around slicing cars in half and doing some serious damage."
"__SUPERHERO__ I rather enjoyed that as well."
"__SUPERHERO__ I also liked it when Iron Man had a suitcase that put his suit on rather quickly."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah that was awesome."
"__SUPERHERO__ We should watch it together soon."
