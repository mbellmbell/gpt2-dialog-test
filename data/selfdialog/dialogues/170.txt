"__MUSIC__ I was just thinking about the music from when we were in high school."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was the best era for music."
"__MUSIC__ We would listen to the radio while we did our homework."
"__MUSIC__ Right, but couldn't concentrate much with the Temptations blasting on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I would wind up singing My Girl instead of doing my history homework."
"__MUSIC__ HAHA who could concentrate on history when Mary Wells was singing The One Who Really Loves You."
"__MUSIC__ Or Smoky and the Miracles doing Shop Around."
"__MUSIC__ Or the Coasters singing T'aint Nothin' to Me"
"__MUSIC__ That song was a real riot."
"__MUSIC__ How about when they did Along Came John"
"__MUSIC__ That record was too funny."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it was."
"__MUSIC__ What about Kill that Roach?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, squish, squash kill that roach."
"__MUSIC__ We would be stomping on the floor like we were actually killing roaches."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean, sometimes we would be killing them....haaahaaa"
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget Madison Time"
"__MUSIC__ I never could get the steps right to that"
"__MUSIC__ Me either. But that didn't stop me from trying"
"__MUSIC__ We had some great music when we were coming up.  They don't make music like that anymore."
