"__MOVIES__ I want to take my niece to a movie, any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Take her to see Boss Baby. It was cute."
"__MOVIES__ We saw that it was really cute and funny. The chase scene made us laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I think the new Diary of a Winpy Kid movie just came out."
"__MOVIES__ That series is great. We love the books and the movies but I hear the new movie isn't great."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, I read the reviews and they were definitely lackluster."
"__MOVIES__ When does the Captain Underpants movie come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Next month, I can't wait to bring my daughter to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I hope another great kid's movie like Trolls comes out soon."
"__MOVIES__ We loved Trolls. The music was fantastic and the message was important."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Moana?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the music in that movie was even better than Trolls!"
"__MOVIES__ I loved how Disney was able to show so much authentic ancient Polynesian culture."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed that the heroine of this Disney movie wasn't technically a princess for once."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that too. The humor was also perfectly timed."
"__MOVIES__ The landscapes were gorgeous."
"__MOVIES__ They were the narration was of the highest level as usual. I also liked how young girls can related to Moana as a strong family oriented character."
"__MOVIES__ Her character was very well written."
"__MOVIES__ I hope Disney pursues more projects like Moana in the future."
