"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Proposal?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, who is in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ The main characters are Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock."
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen that one. Can you tell me more about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Ryan Reynolds work for Sandra Bullock who is going to be deported. She kind of forces him to marry her so she can stay in the country."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it has a good plot. Any other characters I would know?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe I forgot this, Betty White plays Ryan Reynolds grandma."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I bet that is hillarious!"
"__MOVIES__ I honestly cannot think of a time that Betty White was not hillarious, but she is so so funny in this."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like a movie I may life. I doubt my husband would though."
"__MOVIES__ There is actually a lot of non-romantic comedy in it. He may like it."
"__MOVIES__ Does your husband like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh he loves it. He usually likes movies more along the lines of Gladiator."
"__MOVIES__ Gladiator, with Russel Crow?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one. It is a few years old now, but still a very good movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is. My husband also likes Braveheart."
"__MOVIES__ Mel Gibson is so good in Braveheart. Have you heard much about his work recently?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard too much. I think he has had some movies, but nothing iconic like Lethal Weapon or Braveheart."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked him in The Patriot and We Were Soldier as well."
"__MOVIES__ Those are both great movies."
