"__SUPERHERO__ Hey did you see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I seen it the first day it came out."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did you catch Howard the Duck lurking in the back round in one scene?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah i almost missed it though since it was so brief?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think they will ever make a new Howard the Duck film that's incorporated in the Marvel universe?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't think so considering the first film was horrible."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah but keep in mind that it was 1986 when Howard the Duck came out."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well if Marvel can make Rocket Raccoon one of the best characters in Guardians of the Galaxy, i guess anything is possible."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh what a match up that would be!"
"__SUPERHERO__ When you put it in that perspective, i guess i would actually pay to see a Howard the Duck meets the Guardians of the Galaxy movie."
