"__MUSIC__ Ah, nothing like unwinding to some sweet sweet tunes."
"__MUSIC__ These are what you call sweet tunes? I feel like robots are trying to get into my head!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh come now, its just dubstep. All the kids are into it."
"__MUSIC__ I think you're too old for this racket."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, its a legitimate genre!"
"__MUSIC__ Its legitimately trash."
"__MUSIC__ Ok mister high and mighty, what do YOU listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a blues man myself."
"__MUSIC__ Tortured soul?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I am deep down sad all the time, and the music just gets me."
"__MUSIC__ Thats dark. I bet I could find some blues dubstep covers."
"__MUSIC__ Please don't."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I'm so doing this."
"__MUSIC__ I will tear off my ears before I listen to dubstep blues remixes."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, ok, fine. No need to be so dramatic."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I don't think I could take it."
"__MUSIC__ What about techno, can we at least agree EDM is pretty great?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, sometimes. Its usually at least danceable."
"__MUSIC__ Now we can see eye to eye!"
"__MUSIC__ More like ear to ear."
