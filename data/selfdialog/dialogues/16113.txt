"__ROCK__ Random question, greatest rock guitarist in history?"
"__ROCK__ Jimi Hendrix."
"__ROCK__ Meh."
"__ROCK__ You don't like Hendrix. He pretty much started the rock guitar solo."
"__ROCK__ Granted. He was a good guitar player. Maybe I'll give you that one but he wasn't much of a performer."
"__ROCK__ So who are you thinking of?"
"__ROCK__ Eddie Van Halen. Eric Clapton."
"__ROCK__ Clapton is good. Possibly one of the best ever but he learned everything he knows from Hendrix."
"__ROCK__ And Van Halen?"
"__ROCK__ Learned everything he knows from Clapton. HA!"
