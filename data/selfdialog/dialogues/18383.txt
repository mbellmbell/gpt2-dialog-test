"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Hangover movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Only the first one. I thought it was kind of dumb."
"__MOVIES__ How could you think it was dumb? That movie was hysterical!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, a tiger in the bathroom is pretty far-fetched."
"__MOVIES__ You know it is a movie right? It doesn't have to be realistic."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know. I guess if I want to see something that far out, just give me a fantasy movie."
"__MOVIES__ What about Superbad?"
"__MOVIES__ Saw it, hated it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have a no sense of humor?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course I do, I just didn't like that one."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, then you tell me. What funny movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I laugh hysterically to this day at Napolean Dynamite."
"__MOVIES__ You have to be kidding me. You thought The Hangover was stupid yet you like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Sadly yes. Borat too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh. You have terrible taste in movies."
"__MOVIES__ Borat was so funny though! The concept was genious."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I'd go that far."
"__MOVIES__ Setting unsuspecting people up to make a film about it just worked."
"__MOVIES__ Well, not as well for Bruno."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, you got me there."
