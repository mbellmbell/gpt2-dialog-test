"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite soundtrack?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. What made you ask me that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I am listening to the soundtrack from Belly."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that thing was hot. Which song are you listening to."
"__MUSIC__ That joint Hard White with DMX and the LOX."
"__MUSIC__ That's not Hard White."
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was. My bad, that's not even DMX."
"__MUSIC__ You listening to Tommy's Theme."
"__MUSIC__ What you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Tommy's Theme...that's the name of the song. It has the LOX and Made Men on their together."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's right. Remember big head dude Benzito?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's one of Made Men."
"__MUSIC__ He was on Love and Hip Hop for a while."
"__MUSIC__ I guess so, his rap career wasn't too tight."
"__MUSIC__ But he spit fire in his verse on this track though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he was hot but remember, that was over twenty years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah you right."
"__MUSIC__ Play that joint with DMX and Method Man, The Grand Finale."
"__MUSIC__ I listened to it already but I'll play it again for you."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks. Put the phone near the speaker and turn it up a little bit."
