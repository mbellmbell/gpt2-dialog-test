"__MOVIES__ What is the last movie that you saw?"
"__MOVIES__ I rented Lady in the Van last week.  How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Beauty and the Beast in the theater when it came out."
"__MOVIES__ That was a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Would you rather go to the movies or rent a movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I prefer renting because going to the theater gets really expensive.  How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I like going to the theater but I try to go during the week when it isn't so full."
"__MOVIES__ If I could go during the week, I might enjoy it more.  I always get next to the person who talks during the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I use Red Box to rent movies since I don't want to pay to see every movie."
"__MOVIES__ Right!  Some moives I just don't need to see on the big screen.  Most animated movies I watch at home."
"__MOVIES__ And then there are movies that I have to see in the theaters like Guardians of the Galaxy."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Fantastic Beasts in the theater and it was amazing on the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ There are just some movie that have to be seen in a theater."
"__MOVIES__ I agree but most I am content watching at home."
"__MOVIES__ Between Red Box, Netflix, and Amazon, I can see just about any movie that I wish at home."
"__MOVIES__ There are so many movies out there but  very few really quality movie."
"__MOVIES__ I would go with half and half.  There have been a few movies that I start watching and just turn off because I am wasting my time."
"__MOVIES__ At home it is easy to stop watching at any time but not easy at the theater.  I mean I paid good money to see the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Batman v Superman in the movie and I wish that I had not paid to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it at home and stopped part way through.  It just wasn't very good."
