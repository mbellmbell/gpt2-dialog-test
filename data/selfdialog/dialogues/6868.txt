"__STAR_WARS__ Have you heard about the drama surrounding the new Han Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No I haven't. What happened?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The orignal directors left the project with only a few weeks of prodcution remaining."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, why did that happen?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently the directors and Lawrence Kasdan kept clashing over the direction of the film."
"__STAR_WARS__ So now what are they going to do?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the studio brought in Ron Howard to finish directing the film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ron Howard? I guess he would be a pretty good fit."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he's all class, and he obviously has a proven record as a good director."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just hope the movie turns out okay in the end."
