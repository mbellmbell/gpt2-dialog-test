"__STAR_WARS__ What's the best scene in any Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The best character moment is the dinner scene in Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ With Han and Leia on Cloud City?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep. Han sees Vader at the table and immediately draws his baster and stars firing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha yeah, pretty good. No preamble, no witty dialogue."
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope. Just immediately tries to ice the baddest dude in the galaxy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like when he shot Greedo under the table in the cantina."
"__STAR_WARS__ RIght! And that was why the Special Edition was terrible; it changed him to shooting second."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it really undermined Han's character."
"__STAR_WARS__ They didn't need to! We like him *because* he's a scoundrel!"
