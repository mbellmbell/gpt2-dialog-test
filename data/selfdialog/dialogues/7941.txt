"__POP__ I love the new Despacito song featuring Justin Beiber!"
"__POP__ I agree!  He was surprisingly good at speaking in Spanish."
"__POP__ I heard that he won't perform the song in public anymore."
"__POP__ Why is that?"
"__POP__ He tried to once and couldn't remember the words so he started making up fake Spanish words."
"__POP__ Ouch, that is pretty embarrassing!"
"__POP__ I'm pretty sure he got booed off of the stage."
"__POP__ I wouldn't sing it in public again either if that happened to me."
"__POP__ I still think he is great in the song though."
"__POP__ Me too! It's one of my favorites right now!"
