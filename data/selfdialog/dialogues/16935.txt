"__MOVIES__ I just started watching the Fast and the Furious movies."
"__MOVIES__ How do you like them so far?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I've only watched the first four. I'm kind of confused."
"__MOVIES__ By what?"
"__MOVIES__ A couple of things seem to be happening out of order."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right. You should watch them in chronological order."
"__MOVIES__ What does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, Tokyo Drift is the third movie but in the story it doesn't happen until the sixth part."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ It just the way the movies are. Like Stars Wars."
"__MOVIES__ No it's not. There was thirty or so years between those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well. It's similar."
"__MOVIES__ So which Fast and the Furious movie should I watch first?"
"__MOVIES__ The first movie is the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ And then?"
"__MOVIES__ The next one is 2 Fast 2 Furious."
"__MOVIES__ You said Tokyo Drift is the sixth part?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. So watch Fast & Furious instead."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. This is confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Only a little bit."
