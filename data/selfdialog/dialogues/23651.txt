"__DISNEY__ I love the song 'How Far I'll Go' from Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I've heard the song before. It's sung by Alessia Cara?"
"__DISNEY__ In the Moana it's sung by Auli'i Cravalho."
"__DISNEY__ What Moana about?"
"__DISNEY__ It's about a Polynesian girl who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with a goddess."
"__DISNEY__ Is there anyone famous in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson plays Maui a Demi-god that helps Moana save her island from dying."
"__DISNEY__ Cool. Is it a typical 'the heroine falls in love and lives happily ever after' story?"
"__DISNEY__ No way! It's about a strong independent girl who risks her life to save her people."
"__DISNEY__ That's great! I hate it when Disney makes movies about a girl's happiness is dependent on romance."
