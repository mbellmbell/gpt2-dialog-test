"__MUSIC__ Who do you feel made the biggest impact on music?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a question that could be answered in many ways. Do you mean in development like way back beginning of man?"
"__MUSIC__ I had not meant that far, more like on modern day music. Say elvis vs michael jackson."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I see. I would have to say michael Jackson because he really was the king of pop."
"__MUSIC__ But what about elvis king of rock? Would there have even been a king of pop without the king of rock?"
"__MUSIC__ This is almost like the chicken or egg question, which came first?"
"__MUSIC__ Except here we know elvis and the rock and roll style was born far before pop came into the world."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough, but I still feel jackson because the current music is pop mainly and so many of the artist now were directly influenced by him."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose many are, I think of bruno mars and just how much he has bored or been influenced."
"__MUSIC__ Ya I mean bruno mars is a great example or even beyonce. Look at some of their costumes or dance moves even sound."
"__MUSIC__ I think Bruno mars started out as an elvis impersonator funnily enough."
"__MUSIC__ Well that may be true but he has much more of michael jackson's style than elvis."
"__MUSIC__ I agree to some degree. But then I wonder was michael not influenced by elvis himself?"
"__MUSIC__ How so , there music sounds so different."
"__MUSIC__ But think of some of the dance moves, I see similarity in some leg shakes and hip gyrations."
"__MUSIC__ I do know elvis was considered very scandalous at first with his hip thrusts."
"__MUSIC__ Funny how times have changed. Now we have twerking."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know who wants credit for that. certainly no either king."
"__MUSIC__ Probably not. I will stick with the moon walk thanks."
"__MUSIC__ Ya  me too, maybe one or two crotch grabs for good measure."
