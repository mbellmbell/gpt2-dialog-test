"__BASEBALL__ Will any pitcher come near Nolan Ryan's record for no hitters?"
"__BASEBALL__ No way its untouchable."
"__BASEBALL__ We have seen an uptick in No Hitters lately."
"__BASEBALL__ But those are just isolated starts. Guys dont come near them."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I think its tough to throw them nowadays"
"__BASEBALL__ Plus guys are singles hitters now"
"__BASEBALL__ So you think the hitters have evolved?"
"__BASEBALL__ Its just that theres more contact going on in baseball"
"__BASEBALL__ But the power numbers are down."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah and if pitchers dealt with that it means more flyouts."
"__BASEBALL__ So no one will break this record?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, not in my mind. Just like DiMaggio's record."
"__BASEBALL__ It is amazing that no one has even come close to it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah its just too hard as well."
"__BASEBALL__ we are in a pitching era right now."
"__BASEBALL__ And that will end eventually because everything is cyclical"
"__BASEBALL__ I think that we will see it turn quicker but who knows."
"__BASEBALL__ It goes without saying in my opinion"
"__BASEBALL__ Its such a great sport with so many records."
"__BASEBALL__ But you do want to see them get broken"
