"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the game last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Which one?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The only one that was on"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh the Ducks and Predators?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Thats it"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah I saw. Ducks looked good."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They did but obviously the Predator were better."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I cant see them being able to win the entire series."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Why not?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Because the Ducks are on fire with no one right now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No one? Kessler, Perry, and Getzlaf are pretty good."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Perry is a shell of himself anymore."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ This is true. Rinne is on fire though."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well he has the best defense in the league in front of him."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ This is true."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And thats why I think they win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Laviolette is a hell of a coach to be honest."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That he is, gonna take his third team to the Cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hopefully it works out better than it did in Philly."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well he had Leighton there. Rinne is slightly better."
