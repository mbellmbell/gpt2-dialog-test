"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey how do you think the Texans will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are going to be pretty good since they got rid of Oswyler and drafted DeShawn Watson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I think the defense will be better since JJ Watt is healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wade Phillips taking full control of the defense should definitely help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well what do you think it will take for the offense to get better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Fuller can just not drop so many passes and if Watson starts I think that would help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yea and if Lamar Miller can actually find a hole to run through!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, since they upgraded the O-line this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Oakland relocating out to Las Vegas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I wonder how being in Vegas will affect betting on the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Oakland will get another NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so since San Diego just went to LA so now there are 2 teams in that area."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think will end up in the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it will be the Patriots and the Falcons again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you think the Falcons would choke again and blow a 2nd half lead?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think they win this year because Matt Ryan is a more confident player now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, the Patriots did lose some good players and Brady is getting older."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and Atlanta picked up a lot of good players this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think the final score will be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 27-14 Atlanta!"
