"__MUSIC__ Do you have a background in music?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, have you ever gotten musical training by a professional?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I've played piano for 8 years when I was a kid. But I'm no good now."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool. I played piano too."
"__MUSIC__ Nice."
"__MUSIC__ When you took piano lessons, did you also have to learn piano theory?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I was tested on it every year. California has a kind of yearly testing thing where you advance levels."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I'm familiar. Certificate of merit right?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool you did that too? What did you think of it."
"__MUSIC__ It was kind of a chore. The stakes seemed high but the reward wasn't really there."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like it was more a 'for yourself' kind of thing."
"__MUSIC__ Well actually, aside from just getting to certain levels. Certificate of merit will recommend you for piano competitions and recitals."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I wouldn't know I sucked haha."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah not to brag or anything, but I was invited to a lot of the end of the year ceremonies."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, nice. Were you ever contacted by a professional."
"__MUSIC__ No I wasn't that good! But I got a couple of trophies."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I guess it is kind of an engine for future professional piano players"
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right. I was never meant for it though!"
"__MUSIC__ Me neither, clearly."
