"__MOVIES__ What do you feel like watching tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's see, I've got a backlog of movies about a mile long."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Did you see John Wick 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I did, it was awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ I want to see that one. The first one was so good."
"__MOVIES__ If you liked the first one, you'll like the second one."
"__MOVIES__ OK, so we won't watch that one. What about 'Logan'?"
"__MOVIES__ Sorry, I've seen that one too."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really solid too. You should watch it - it's really violent."
"__MOVIES__ OK, so Logan is out too."
"__MOVIES__ Sorry man. What about The Witch?"
"__MOVIES__ The Witch? Never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a horror suspense movie. I've been wanting to see it for a while."
"__MOVIES__ Is it gory?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know; I've heard it's more of a slow burn."
"__MOVIES__ OK, let's give it a shot."
"__MOVIES__ Nice! Are you a fan of scary movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I dig them."
"__MOVIES__ Let's go!"
