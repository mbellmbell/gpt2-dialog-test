"__MUSIC__ Music these days is not what it used to be."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! Most of what i hear on the radio is rap and hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ Drake, Wiz , Lil' Wayne, Rick Ross, Future seem to dominate the airwaves."
"__MUSIC__ I have to admit that I like alot of hip-hop. Alot of the music is pretty good and has a catchy beat!"
"__MUSIC__ Music???? All the rap artists do these days is take old songs from the 70's and 80's, add a heavier bass line, and profane lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ C'mon.....really? You gotta give the rappers some type of credit."
"__MUSIC__ Credit for what??? Most of these rappers have no creativity musically. How hard is it to take someone else's music and add your own lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ If it was that simple, everyone would be rappers making millions of dollars."
"__MUSIC__ Who are some of your favorite rappers?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Drake, Lil' Wayne, Rick Ross, Jay Z, and a bunch of other rappers."
"__MUSIC__ OK. Let's take Drake for instance. If you by one of his CD's, look at the linear notes and read the fine print for each of his songs."
"__MUSIC__ O.K.???? What will I find?"
"__MUSIC__ You will find that for alot of his songs, Drake has used samples from old songs in his music."
"__MUSIC__ I never really paid attention to that. Sometimes I do recognize music that a rapper may use in their song."
"__MUSIC__ Earth Wind and Fire, and the Isley Brothers are two of the most sampled groups when it comes to hip-hop music."
"__MUSIC__ That's interestering! I just thought that alot of the rappers created the music and wrote the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Don't get me wrong, even though I'm not a rap fan, I don't totally dislike all rap music. I'm just an old school guy who remembers when musical artists created the music and wrote the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I can see how alot of people may dislike rap, because of the appearance that rappers are 'borrowing' other artists music and making tons of money."
"__MUSIC__ How would you feel if I took something you created, changed somthing small about the creation, then passed it off as my own work?"
"__MUSIC__ I would be upset........VERY UPSET."
