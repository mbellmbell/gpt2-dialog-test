"__DISNEY__ Have you seen that Cars 3 is coming out??"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! My son is so excited for it to start!"
"__DISNEY__ Mine too! It's all he can talk about."
"__DISNEY__ I'm a little worried though. He's still young and Cars 2 wasn't that great."
"__DISNEY__ True, I haven't let mine see 2 yet, but the reviews for 3 are great!"
"__DISNEY__ I've seen that too!"
"__DISNEY__ Do you want to go together when it comes out?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure!  When does it release?"
"__DISNEY__ 3 days from now."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, want to go on Saturday?"
