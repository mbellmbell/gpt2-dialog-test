"__DISNEY__ I think it's so strange that Star Wars movies are considered Disney movies now."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I think Star Wars should be its own thing."
"__DISNEY__ I know! I just associate Disney movies with kids."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Star Wars movies are more for adults. I guess kids like them too though."
"__DISNEY__ Most of the Star Wars movies these days are rated PG-13."
"__DISNEY__ I think they're geared more towards teenagers and adults then with that rating."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I never associated Disney movies with movies for teenagers and adults."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe Disney is going in a new direction."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe they are. I guess the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies are geared towards teens and adults."
"__DISNEY__ True, but I'm still not quite sure what to think."
