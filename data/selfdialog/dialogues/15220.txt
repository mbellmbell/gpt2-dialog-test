"__HARRY_POTTER__ I was watching HP series. Do you really think Snape is good guy or bad guy?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Everyone thinks he's a good guy. What do you mean?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know, he's always riding Harry and he's kind of a butt head to everyone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But he always seems to be helping Harry inadvertently."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Only because Dumbledore told him to and he felt guilty about Lilly."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, maybe but he was in love with her too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sure, maybe Snape could see her in Harry. They always talk about his green eyes and how he looks like his mother."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, see it could be that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It would make a great twist if he's really bad to the core."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, guess you will have to finish the series to find out. I'm not spilling the beans."
