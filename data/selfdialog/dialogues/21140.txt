"__THRILLER__ Can you believe it has been 25 years?"
"__THRILLER__ Twenty five years for what?"
"__THRILLER__ Since Silence of the Lambs was first released, of course."
"__THRILLER__ Wow.  I cannot believe it has been that long.  Anthony Hopkins was so good in that movie.  Didn't he win an Oscar?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes.  For Best Actor.   No wins for Hannibal or Red Dragon though."
"__THRILLER__ Well they were not nearly as good."
"__THRILLER__ Do you think he regrets doing them?"
"__THRILLER__ He might regret playing the same character but I doubt he regrets the money."
"__THRILLER__ No kidding.  Did you know the author of the screenplay never even watched the film?  And then he wrote both sequels."
"__THRILLER__ No, I did not know that but I am thinking that maybe he should have watched.  Anthony Hopkins was brilliant."
