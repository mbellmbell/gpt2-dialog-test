"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, are you excited that it is finally the weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes! This has felt like a really long week."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you have any exciting plans?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not by normal standards, but I am excited about!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Okay, now you have me curious, what are you doing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I am going to binge watch all four seasons of Orphan Black on Amazon Prime."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Why are you doing that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Because the final season starts on June 10th."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What is the show about?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It is about a girl who find out she is a clone."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, so like science-fiction?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah - but there is so much more to it than that. Lots of rich characters, the actress is amazing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Actress? So like one person does all the characters?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, all of the clones, yes."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How many clones are there?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Loads of them, but there are four main ones that are in almost all the episodes. A science geek, a soccer mom, and the main character who is just like a strong, ballsy woman."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That is only three. I thought you said four?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well that one is hard to explain without giving mega spoilers. Season one she is attempting to kill all the clones because she has been brainwashed."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ This show seems really complicated."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It really isn't once you start watching it."
