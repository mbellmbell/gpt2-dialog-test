"__THRILLER__ Hey, me too! What's your favorite?"
"__THRILLER__ I really like The Sixth Sense."
"__THRILLER__ You mean the one with the kid who could see dead people? With Bruce Willis?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I love Bruce Willis in that movie. And it gets better every time I watch it."
"__THRILLER__ M. Night Shamalan is a great director. You can watch that movie over and over and see how careful a director he is."
"__THRILLER__ The Sixth Sense is his best, though. I didn't like Signs as much."
