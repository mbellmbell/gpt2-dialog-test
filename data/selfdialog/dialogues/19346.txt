"__MOVIES__ What are some movies that would blow my mind?"
"__MOVIES__ What are you trying to do?"
"__MOVIES__ I am trying to start thinking a different way."
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the Matrix."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have already seen that."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen all three of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have seen the whole trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what about the Animatrix?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't even heard of that!"
"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of anime?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I love that art style!"
"__MOVIES__ You should check out the Animatrix then."
"__MOVIES__ What exactly is it?"
"__MOVIES__ A bunch of anime directors each did their take on the matrix. There are a bunch of different short movies within the one movie."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds so awesome! So how does it expand on Matrix?"
"__MOVIES__ It tells you a bunch of things that the other movies don't."
"__MOVIES__ What sort of stuff is left out of the trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ They don't really say too much about what happened before the events of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I see. So all the plot holes get filled."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much. Go check out the movie and you will never see things the same again."
