"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, only a few more weeks until the NFL is on again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know, I can't wait."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite team again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Atlanta Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right.  They had a great year last year, but it's too bad they couldn't hold on to the lead in the Super Bowl last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right?! I thought we had it in the bag."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should have run the ball more to control the clock instead of throwing so much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree completely.  It seems we kept going 3 and out and giving the ball right back to the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you can't give Tom Brady the ball back.  He'll make you pay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it.  He definitely made us pay.  But, I'm looking forward to this season.  I think we had a good draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really, who did you pick up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Our first pick was a defensive end from UCLA.  His name is McKinley.  He'll help us pick up and play opposite Vic Beasley who's a beast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Beasley is awesome. Didn't he lead the league in sacks last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did.  He had 15 and a half.  I hope he can do it again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that'd be cool.  I like the Falcons too.  I really like Julio Jones because I'm a big Alabama fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, we all knew he'd be really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got to meet him one time and he's actually a really cool guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's great.  The NFL could use some guys that help clean up their image."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, as opposed to guys that hit their girlfriends and wives and get away with it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Totally!  The league needs to get guys like that out of the league!"
