"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever watched the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course.  Who hasn't?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll admit that I liked the first batch that were made.  I think the stories were easier to follow?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know.  I liked the characters.  I especially liked Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  He was cool and crazy all at the same time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also thought Darth Vader was scarier.  The new ones seem to have too many bad guys that you don't focus just on the one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  He was pretty creepy.  I thought he was particularly creepy when he took his mask off."
"__STAR_WARS__ It wasn't at all what I expected when I saw that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those really were some great characters and story lines."
