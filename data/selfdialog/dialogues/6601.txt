"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think is the worst character in all of the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar Binks is obviously the worst.  He character was so cheesy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I definitely disliked his whole storyline. It could have been handled much differently."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that Michael Jackson was originally supposed to play Jar Jar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No way! That would have been creepy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it would have made it better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nothing could have made that character better in my opinion."
"__STAR_WARS__ What if he didn't talk in that crazy voice?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That would have definitely helped, I was kind of annoyed with how all of the Gungans talked."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe its that whole species that just needed to be redone."
