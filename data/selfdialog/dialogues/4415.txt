"__MUSIC__ Hey, what's your favorite genre of music in rock sub-categories?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough one. I'd have to say altern-rock or 90's rock."
"__MUSIC__ Both are such awesome genres. I think I like nu-metal as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really liked Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park in their good years."
"__MUSIC__ So did I! I have missed bands like that a lot. I can't find any new music that compares to them."
"__MUSIC__ Story of The Year was okay, but still nothing compared to the early 2000's stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're alright. I feel like after the emo era, rock music really changed."
"__MUSIC__ It did, but we still have some good new groups. Have you heard of the American Authors?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't. What songs do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely recommend their song, 'Born to Run'. The song is so inspiring."
"__MUSIC__ What is it about?"
"__MUSIC__ The song is about basically being born to be free and to live your life the way you want."
"__MUSIC__ I can definitely see how that is inspiring. My favorite inspirational song is, 'Fast Car' by Tracy Chapman."
"__MUSIC__ That's an old one but a good one at that. It is kind of sad, though."
"__MUSIC__ It sure is, but it really inspires me to do what I love and just go for it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can see how you would get that out of the song."
"__MUSIC__ I also love the song, 'Shake it Off'. I know it's more pop than rock, but it's really inspiring since we were on the topic."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, for sure, that is one of the most inspirational songs about being yourself."
"__MUSIC__ I know Taylor Swift and Katy are having a feud lately, which team are you on?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm Team Taylor for sure! I love her music!"
