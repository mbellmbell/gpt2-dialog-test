"__DISNEY__ Hey, I was wondering if you've seen the new Beauty and the Beast movie yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No! I've been meaning to check it out, but the timing hasn't been right. Have you?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! It was amazing and beautiful. I couldn't believe how much better it was than the original."
"__DISNEY__ What was so different about it? I haven't even seen any ads for it, to be honest."
"__DISNEY__ The Beast actually sings in this one. And the graphics are incredible!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm going to have to go see it in the theaters then, before they stop playing it."
"__DISNEY__ I hope you do! It would be a shame not to."
"__DISNEY__ It sounds like it. I did hear that Emma Watson made the perfect Beauty for the film."
"__DISNEY__ She and Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Kevin Kline all did spectacular work on the film."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, you've convinced me! I will see it this weekend, and if they're lucky, maybe I'll take the kids!"
