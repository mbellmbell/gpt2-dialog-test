"__MUSIC__ Hey! What have you been listening to lately? I need recommendations."
"__MUSIC__ Well, really just only Sufjan Stevens. It's kind of sad."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ You don't know Sufjan? He's maybe my favorite artist right now."
"__MUSIC__ Please tell me he's not another sad folk artist."
"__MUSIC__ Well... I can't say that."
"__MUSIC__ This is so bad! You need to listen to more happy music."
"__MUSIC__ But Sufjan is a literal genius. His last album was incredible. I've listened to it maybe 50 times by now."
"__MUSIC__ That seems unhealthy. What's it about?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's an album about the death of his mother."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, are you okay?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm fine I swear! Sometimes you just need to cry to sad, beautiful songs, okay."
"__MUSIC__ I can't relate to that, but all right."
"__MUSIC__ You should give some of his earlier stuff a look. He's done a huge range of things."
"__MUSIC__ Did he write an album about the death of his father, too?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, but he did write a concept album about the state of Illinois."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, boy."
"__MUSIC__ It's seriously very good. I'm going to force you to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ I should have learned by now not to come to you when I need music..."
"__MUSIC__ Let me live! You'll love him eventually."
