"__DISNEY__ So I heard something yesterday, not sure if it's true."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, explain more."
"__DISNEY__ They are apparently remaking Peter Pan."
"__DISNEY__ But they've remade that film tons of times already!"
"__DISNEY__ I know, but this one is actually being done by Disney."
"__DISNEY__ Live-action or animation?"
"__DISNEY__ Live-action.  It will be totally different from the other recent Peter Pan movies."
"__DISNEY__ Wow.  They are really re-doing everything, aren't they?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, the movies are popular and make tons of money."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that's my answer as to why!"
