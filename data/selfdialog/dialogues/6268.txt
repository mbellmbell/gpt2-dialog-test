"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite moment where someone uses The Force?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love in Episode III when Yoda throws his lightsaber into a clone trooper."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, we've never seen that before--their hands had to always be on the button."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yours?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably when Kylo Ren stops a blaster bullet in mid-air."
"__STAR_WARS__ More than Vader stopping them in Empire?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Far more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Vader let them hit his hand. Kylo caught it, had a conversation, kept it steady, and released it when he wanted to."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was pretty sweet."
