"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like how C3PO was used in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure I mean he was a side piece."
"__STAR_WARS__ But dont you think he deserved more attention"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like his own spin off?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah because of his characterization"
"__STAR_WARS__ No I think that would have not been believable."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think things would have tidied up nicely with him at the helm."
"__STAR_WARS__ So at the beginning of Empire Strikes back you wanted him to hit someone?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I didnt say he had to be violent."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I dont know what you would have him do."
