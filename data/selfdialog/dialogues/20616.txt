"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen the movie 'The Shining'?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh that old movie that is set in a hotel with Jack Nicholson?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, that one.  It's so strange but really good and scary."
"__THRILLER__ I always think of the scene with the bloody twins standing at the end of the hallway every time I'm in a hotel with a long hallway."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, and the scene with the blood coming out of the elevators!"
"__THRILLER__ Yes!  That movie was great.  There are a lot of conspiracy theories about that movie you know..."
"__THRILLER__ I know.  Have you seen the movie 'Room 237' that was made about all the conspiracy theories?"
"__THRILLER__ I have heard of it but I haven't seen it."
"__THRILLER__ It's great.  I saw it on Netflix and it explains a lot of strange things that are in the movie."
