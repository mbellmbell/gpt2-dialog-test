"__STAR_WARS__ I've been watching Chasing Amy too much. I can't get the Star Wars scene out of my mind."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha.  Darth Vader, Nubian God."
"__STAR_WARS__ Obviously, that makes Luke mixed race."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would have been cool if they had James Earl Jones in that armor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, yes.  Certainly."
"__STAR_WARS__ We wouldn't have had to endure Hayden Christensen's acting, either."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't knock Hayden.  He's done some good work.  I just don't think he was ready for something like Star Wars.  And I think Lucas's directing wasn't the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lucas should have gotten Spielberg to do it."
"__STAR_WARS__ He tried, from what I understand. Spielberg convinced him to do it."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a mistake."
