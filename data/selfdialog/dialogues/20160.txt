"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite film with an alien in? And you can't say Alien."
"__MOVIES__ Probably Arrival."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Forest Whitaker too. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet...what do you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's quite a slow moving film, some suspense but definitely not an action movie. Emotionally charged too."
"__MOVIES__ What's it actually about?"
"__MOVIES__ Some aliens arrive and try to communicate with us, but no-one can understand them, so a specialist translator is brought in. That's Amy Adams's character."
"__MOVIES__ How does she work out what the aliens are saying?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, she starts off by getting them to write things."
"__MOVIES__ So they have hands and can hold things? Why are aliens always humanistic?"
"__MOVIES__ That's where you're wrong. They don't really have hands and they kind of spray the ink like an octopus to form sentences."
"__MOVIES__ What does the writing look like?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not really formed of letters as such, I won't spoil the film but they write in circles that look a bit like coffee mug stains on a table, but each bit of imperfection in the circle has meaning."
"__MOVIES__ And Amy Adams works it all out?"
"__MOVIES__ Slowly but surely, yes."
"__MOVIES__ And do the aliens come in peace?"
"__MOVIES__ That'd be telling. You should watch it and find out."
"__MOVIES__ OK. Tell me one more fact about the film."
"__MOVIES__ The writing structure created for the film actually 'works' linguistically. With enough effort anyone could learn it and form sentences and write conversations."
