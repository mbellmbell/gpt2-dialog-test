"__BASKETBALL__ Who's your top 5 NBA players right now?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I got LeBron, KD, Kawai, Curry and Westbrook"
"__BASKETBALL__ What about Harden? He's the MVP and he can't make your top 5?"
"__BASKETBALL__ First, he's not the MVP, it's Westbrook. Second, his stats are inflated because of the system."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's getting triple doubles left and right and he led his team to the third seed. It doesn't matter the system those are MVP credentials."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you kidding me the Rockets just let him the hog the ball every possession. It's easy to get stats like that."
"__BASKETBALL__ You are crazy trying to tell me that Harden isn't the MVP because he's a ball hog then turn around and say the ultimate ball hog, Westbrook, is the MVP!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Westbrook has to do it because his team sucks, there's no one else who they can rely on to get a shot on offense."
"__BASKETBALL__ What about Kanter and Olidipo"
"__BASKETBALL__ Olidipo is inconsistent at best and Kanter doesn't even start."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who does Harden have then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Gordon, Lou Williams, Ariza, Ryan Anderson"
"__BASKETBALL__ Ok fine but Harden beats Westbrook in win shares, points per game and is more efficient on offense."
"__BASKETBALL__ Westbrook is averaging a triple double and Harden is not. Case closed."
"__BASKETBALL__ Look Harden's the MVP because he's the best player in a contender and Westbrook is the best player on an average team."
"__BASKETBALL__ The MVP should be the best player on any team, Not the best player on the top teams, it's not very fair."
"__BASKETBALL__ You sound crazy, you shouldn't even be allowed to talk about basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Really? Ok who is your top 5 then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ LeBron, KD, Kawai, Curry and Westbrook"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's the same as mine. I hate you."
