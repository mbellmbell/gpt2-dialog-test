"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the new fan theories about Rey from Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've seen some really good ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ So who do you think her father is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Personally, I'm betting it's Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, and Kylo Ren is her brother?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. Who do you think her father is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm thinking it's Obi-Wan Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh really? Why him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the ages could work and they both have that accent..."
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes sense if the accents are purposefully kept to show familial relations. We'll have to wait to find out though."
