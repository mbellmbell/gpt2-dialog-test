"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the Wild game last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea, season over."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, they can't score goals when they need to."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Wild came back but overtime was killer in that series."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea, and Dubnyk didn't play well either. How do you give up 4 goals a game in the playoffs?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ We should have put Kuemper in instead."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think we will have Suter and Parise again next year?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hope so. Both can score goals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They sure can, hopefully they can so do in the playoffs again next year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea, getting tired of saying next year though."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ironic how our season was ended by our former head coach too, right? Yeo!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea, I bet that revenge felt sweet."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yep, his team is built to be bigger and beat ours."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think the Blues will go far?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If their goalie stays hot, sure."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, I want them to win since they beat us."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sounds good. Should be an interesting series."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yup. Next year though for the Wild."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ As always!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Get better goalkeeping!"
