"__STAR_WARS__ I just heard that george lucas's inspiration for darth vader came to him out of nowhere."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The name for the character just came to him, out of thin air."
"__STAR_WARS__ I find that surprising because it has so much meaning."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now I ask what do you mean by meaning?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well Darth is a way of saying of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it's Dark Father."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is crazy accurate for the role!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it seems like a lot of research and thought would have gone into that name."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well apparently not at all!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes me love star wars franchise even more! The force is strong!"
