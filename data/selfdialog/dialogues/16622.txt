"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Life?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the space movie with the alien?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, there was a ton of ads for it pretty recently."
"__MOVIES__ I have not, but it looked interesting, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I just watched it last night."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was fine, there was some silly stuff but it is pretty action packed."
"__MOVIES__ How well did they do the aliens, that is usually the deal breaker for me."
"__MOVIES__ It was actually done pretty well, it was kind of like an octopus or something?"
"__MOVIES__ With tentacles?  Like in Arrival?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of like that but you could actually see its physical body."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds alright to me."
"__MOVIES__ You should check it out, it is not a great movie but I think you will enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ I plan on it, just too many movies in the queue."
"__MOVIES__ What else are you trying to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ I still haven't seen either of the new Star Wars, or Logan."
"__MOVIES__ All those are great, I would recommend those more."
"__MOVIES__ Which of the three should I watch next?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say Logan."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, thanks for the recommendations."
