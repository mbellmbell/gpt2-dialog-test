"__BASEBALL__ Hey, how's it going? Did you happen to see the last Pirate's game?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh hey! I'm doing good! And yeah, I finally caught a game; their last one."
"__BASEBALL__ They didn't play very well, did they? That was a pretty solid loss to the Phillie's huh?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, you're right. They really seem to be having a hard time gaining any momentum this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I think you're right. It looked like they would be able to start the season off fairly strong too."
"__BASEBALL__ For sure. But then they lost like 6 or 7 games in a row. You just can't do that in their division."
"__BASEBALL__ You are so right. Their division is just too competitive to allow for a losing streak like that."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I guess the only good news is that pretty every team in the division isn't necessarily playing their best right now."
"__BASEBALL__ That's too. Even with those losses the Pirates are only 8 or 9 games out of first place, which is at least something."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah, for sure. They just need to really start picking up games that they shouldn't be losing."
"__BASEBALL__ I know exactly what you mean! They seem to have this terrible habit of dropping games to certain teams that just always have their number."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, totally! Like the Brewers! The Pirates are a way more talented club right now. No way they should be dropping games to the Brewers."
"__BASEBALL__ Or teams like the Dodgers. I know the Dodgers are a better team, but still, they seem to always consistently give the Pirates a hard time."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right! There just always seem to be those teams that the Pirates just can't beat no matter what!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that is just it. Well at least they picked up a few wins against the Nationals. DC is a pretty good team; that might be a good sign for the rest of the season."
"__BASEBALL__ You could be right, there. The other good thing is that it is still pretty early in the season; they have plenty of time to turn things around."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope so. And you're right about time; I don't think I will really get worried about the season until after the All-Star game."
"__BASEBALL__ Let's just hope they can build a little momentum before then!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, for sure. I am pretty confident they will."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope you're right! Let's go Bucs!"
