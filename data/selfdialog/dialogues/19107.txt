"__MOVIES__ What kind of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like many different kinds of movies, but I hate horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ So, I guess you haven't seen any horror movies, then."
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't, but I did see a funny movie with my kids."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was called Boss Baby,"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I heard that wasn't so good, but you liked it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I loved it; the baby was voiced by Alec Baldwin."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, he must have been funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yes; I hope he does a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know he was a voice actor."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't either; the last movie I saw him in was Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was depressing."
"__MOVIES__ I did see that, and I agree; the main character suffered from an awful mental illness."
"__MOVIES__ Most of Woody Allen's movies entertain me more than that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes,  he's always been one of my favorite directors."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, but I liked his earlier work a lot more."
"__MOVIES__ Which movies did you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the classics, like Hannah and her Sisters, and Manhattan."
"__MOVIES__ Those are great, but my favorite was actually Radio Days."
