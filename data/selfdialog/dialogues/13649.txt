"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the worst team in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Browns. The Cleveland Browns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets are right up there with them in being awful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean being down there. There is no up with the Browns nor the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha! Ain't that the truth"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets have no QB, the browns have no QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is hard to judge which team is worse at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Browns have Osweiler"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They only traded for him because the Texans gave them a pick to take his contract."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was a dumb move by the Texans to pay him that much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Osweiler should of stayed with the Broncos. Everyone knew Peyton Manning was leaving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was about the money and the Broncos shorted him in offers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would of rather took less money then go play for the Texans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he was rewarded by being traded to one of the worst teams, if not the worst."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't remember the last time the Browns were good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it was in the 1990's when the Patriots current coach was their head coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't the team get sold when he was the Browns coach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, tough luck because the Ravens who the Browns became have won two superbowls"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah tough luck for Browns fans. Not sure how many there really are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I knew one Browns fan, maybe."
