"__THRILLER__ How many Halloween movies are there?"
"__THRILLER__ Many, I just saw on t.v. the one about 20 years later."
"__THRILLER__ Was it as good as the first one I saw in college?"
"__THRILLER__ No, none of the followup ones were ever as good as the first."
"__THRILLER__ I bet lots of people got murdered, though."
"__THRILLER__ Yes they did and Jamie Leigh Curtis looked just as good now as she did then."
"__THRILLER__ Did she get killed this time?"
"__THRILLER__ I won't tell you because I don't want to spoit it for you."
"__THRILLER__ Well, do you think there will be more Halloween movies?"
"__THRILLER__ Of course."
