"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear that the Chargers are moving to Los Angeles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's really crazy. It must suck for San Diego fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I don't even know why Los Angeles would need two teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's one of the biggest cities in America. You don't think they can handle two professional NFL teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. I just don't really see LA being that big of a football city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they did have the Rams and Raiders before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and look what happened. Both teams moved out of the city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think that could happen again in the future?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, definitely. I think LA fans get bored of football and would rather watch baseball or basketball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe the franchises see a new popularity for footbball in the city. That's why they relocating there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that the ticket sales for the Rams first season in LA didn't really go that well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe it was because they weren't very good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. But you would think, if there was a strong need for football, the fans would support a new team there regardless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that people need to give it a few years before they determine that the poor ticket sales are going to be a constant thing for the Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just see it being a disaster. And with the Charger moving there, it's going to be even worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do wonder how the fans are going to decide which team to be a fan of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably going to depend on which team is better. I just feel bad for San Diego fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, must be horrible to realize that your team is moving away after decades of support."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why I can't stand sports sometimes. No loyalty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Making money sometimes isn't about loyalty."
