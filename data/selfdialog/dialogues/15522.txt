"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think I have watched all the Harry Potter films at least ten times each."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is your favorite one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like all of them but I have to say Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is my favorite."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why do you like that one so much?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry is so young and naive in it, yet he still knows what he wants in life."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you like the way he shows up Malfoy, when he tries to get Harry to join the Slytherin House?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, and I love when the Sorting Hat is not sure what house to put Harry into."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ In the later episodes, Dumbledore does tell Harry that it could have gone either way?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know. I think it shows that if Harry had wanted to be evil instead of good, it was that moment that the choice was made"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ One seemingly small choice at the time. It kind of was what started Harry on the path he took."
