"__SUPERHERO__ Did you get a chance to watch the flash on netflix yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yup. I watched a few episodes the other day when I was hungover."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did you like it? I watched the entire first season a couple weeks ago."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah it was alright. I thought the show's story line was really good but it seemed a little cliche."
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean by cliche? I thought the show was fantastic."
"__SUPERHERO__ I dont know, it seemed like Marvel was trying to hard to piece together each episode if that makes sense?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm still not following you dude, explain."
"__SUPERHERO__ It justt seemed like the different villians in each episode came into the story really fast and left the story line too quick, Idk just didn't feel much of an attachment to the charchters."
"__SUPERHERO__ I didn't get that vibe at all. The series really made me feel a connection between everything that took place."
"__SUPERHERO__ I guess I'll agree to disagree with you on this one my man!"
