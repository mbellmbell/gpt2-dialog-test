"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, have you done anything fun in the past few months?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, although this past November I went to a New York Jets game finally."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool! Was that the first one that you have went to before?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure was; living so far away from there makes it really difficult to go to the games in person."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am sure your work schedule makes it tough as well, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt about it, I am a true fan though, so I always make time to watch their games on television."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think their chances are for this upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am really excited with the direction the Jets are headed right now actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a different tone than most Jet fans that I talk to. I am impressed!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I think the coaching staff has been vastly improved over what it used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does that mean that you were not a fan of Rex Ryan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really; I thought he should have done a lot better than what he did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did take them to two straight AFC championship games in a row with Mark Sanchez."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but it was all down hill from there. Let's just say, I was glad when he was let go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about Todd Bowles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he got off to a great start, winning ten games in his first season.  The next year was not so great though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you still optimistic about him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really am! I feel that he will have a great season this upcoming year. Plus, we have a new offensive coordinator that I am excited about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did not know that, who is the new coordinator?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His name is John Morton and I think he will be really successful."
