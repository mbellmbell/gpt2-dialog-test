"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about Rey being a feminist hero?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love her but they went overboard."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't be misogynist. Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I love strong women. But they force-fed it and it wasn't natural."
"__STAR_WARS__ Example?"
"__STAR_WARS__ 'Stop taking my hand!' while letting him take her hand and not letting go."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, go on."
"__STAR_WARS__ 'Get off!' when he climbs on her. Why did Finn climb on her to get a view in a plane?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a bit forced, I'll admit."
"__STAR_WARS__ Told you. I'm right."
