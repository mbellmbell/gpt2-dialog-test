"__STAR_WARS__ Do you prefer the original trilogy or the prequel movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the original trilogy best. I grew up watching A New Hope and waiting for the others to come out."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Empire Strikes Back was awesome, including the soundtrack. I can still hum The Imperial March!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't forget the wampa cave, Yoda training Luke, and the lightsaber battle on Bespin."
"__STAR_WARS__ That movie had some of the best scenes!"
"__STAR_WARS__ So do you like the original trilogy best too?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but I also love the prequel trilogy. I know some scenes were cheesy, but the arena battle in Attack of the Clones was unbeatable."
"__STAR_WARS__ That, and the duel with Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was such an iconic scene. It made everyone who watched the movie want a double-sided lightsaber."
"__STAR_WARS__ And they wanted a podracer after the race at the beginning of episode one too!"
