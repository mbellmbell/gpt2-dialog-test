"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The first NFL preseason game is going to be in less than a month!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I can't believe it's that time of year again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems just a few weeks ago that the Falcons lost to the Patriots in that epic comeback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think both teams will do well this season. Pretty much all of the players from last year are intact."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan will be a man on a mission this year...if he's healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys should get far too. Prescott will be more mature and just as athletic as last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Cowboys should win the NFC East without a doubt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think some other teams that were good the past few years will be going downhill though....The Packers and the Saints won't make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, both Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees are getting old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am looking forward to what Derek Carr is going to do in Oakland. If he didn't get injured late in the season, they could have gone deep into the playoffs last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the AFC is going to be pretty competitve, with 5 mediocre teams battling it out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will make it to the SuperBowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think both the Patriots and the Falcons can return to the Super Bowl again, although Patriots and Cowboys is also probable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots and Cowboys would be a really good game to watch.  All of the good teams are heavily dependent on their quarterbacks being healthy, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady always has a great offensive line protecting him. That's why he's still able to play so well. He's going to be 40 this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yikes. He's one sack and one bad injury away from retirement then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of teams have no hope from the beginning this season, because they don't have a quarterback!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Cleveland again, and the Jets!  Both of these teams will be lucky if they win 5 games the entire season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's surprising no one signed Colin Kapernick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he has major image issues outside his playing ability. I don't think teams would want to deal with that when they are having a losing record."
