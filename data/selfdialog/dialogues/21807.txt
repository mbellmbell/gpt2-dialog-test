"__DISNEY__ so what did you think about the live action remake of the beauty and the beast?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it was great...simply phenomenal. How about you?"
"__DISNEY__ oh i am a huge fan of Emma Watson, i had to go see it in the first week of its release, movie was awesome"
"__DISNEY__ yeah and i loved the special effects and the songs."
"__DISNEY__ oh and the acting and direction too, they did a good job!"
"__DISNEY__ i feel that they should start bringing to life more of the old disney classic animated movies."
"__DISNEY__ yeah that seems like the trend. I think it all started with the live action movie of cinderella, then came the jungle book."
"__DISNEY__ ya and they were great too. i am really looking forward to them coming out with a live action alladin movie."
"__DISNEY__ oh yeah that would be cool, with the genie and all. oh how i love all disney movies!"
"__DISNEY__ yeah me too!"
