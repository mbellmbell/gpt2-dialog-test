"__MOVIES__ You ever watch the First Hulk Movie from the early 2000's."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the one with the different actor as hulk?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one."
"__MOVIES__ I liked him better than the one that plays in the Avengers."
"__MOVIES__ Me too not sure why they changed it."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you ask?"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the story of hulk?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's much deeper and beautiful than people think."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well he's a terrified man who loses control and then doesn't want to do any harm but he is hunted like an animal and provoked so he retaliates."
"__MOVIES__ That's a fair point."
"__MOVIES__ I think he's like a big teddy bear that's just different in every way you can think of."
"__MOVIES__ Sadly people don't like change."
"__MOVIES__ I love how the girl isn't afraid."
"__MOVIES__ It's a classic love story but more action oriented."
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't have said it better."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think there will be more Hulk movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably not any movies with just Hulk but more Avengers for sure."
"__MOVIES__ That's unfortunate but understood."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah sadly I don't think the movies were that well liked."
