"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Night of The Living Dead?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't but have always wanted to."
"__MOVIES__ You should really check it out."
"__MOVIES__ It's George Romero right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the first of Romero's original dead trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen both Day and Dawn, how does Night compare?"
"__MOVIES__ Personally Dawn is my favorite, but Night is a close second, it's a definite classic."
"__MOVIES__ It's black and white correct?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes as it's an older movie, there's a remake that was decent as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I've heard about the remake, how does Night compare to newer zombie flicks?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Romero is known as long of the zombies for a reason, newer ones often lack the suspense."
"__MOVIES__ Good point while the newer faster moving zombies may be scarier, something about the slow lumbering ones are nice."
"__MOVIES__ I agree it's hard for me go get into zombies that run like track athletes."
"__MOVIES__ Ha! Yeah if you've been dead, don't think you're going to run a 4.4 40 yard dash."
"__MOVIES__ It's been awhile for me and would be willing to watch it again,  would you be game?"
"__MOVIES__ Would depend on the day."
"__MOVIES__ Well I could do Friday or Saturday"
"__MOVIES__ I work this weekend, but how about next Friday?"
"__MOVIES__ That would work for me, see you then."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great, can't wait!"
