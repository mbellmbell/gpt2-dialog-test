"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many NFL teams are there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a pretty basic question. I take it you aren't much of a fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. I'll watch occassionally but I don't know much about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are 32 teams split between two conferences and eight divisions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds complicated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. Each division has four teams and the Super Bowl is played by the two conference champions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes sense I guess. So do the teams in the conference just play each other?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. They all play across conferences, but each team plays the other three in their division twice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many games do they play in a season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The regular season before playoffs is 16 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, so six of the sixteen are from the same division, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and the other ten are set by the NFL. There is a formula they follow to make sure each team plays every other at least once every four years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is really impressive. What does the formula look at?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a lot things. Way too hard to explain succinctly, but it ends up being 12 conference games and 4 non-conference games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is too bad they can't all play each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that would double the season. I don't think that would work well for anyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fans might like year round football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In theory. But it would cause so many more injuries and players would burn out a lot faster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I guess it wouldn't work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As much as I love football, it is nice to have something to look forward to in August rather than watching all the time."
