"__ROCK__ What movie do you want to watch?"
"__ROCK__ I rented a couple movies this morning. I have one called The Runaways. It has Kristen Stewart in it, and it's about the 70s girl rock band."
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah, I like that movie. I always liked Joan Jett, she had a really powerful voice. I used to have that album with the song Cherry Bomb."
"__ROCK__ They were one of the beginning girl bands that really rocked. I like the movie because it tells what life was really like for them."
"__ROCK__ It must have been hard being girls and being rockers back in the 70s when it was mostly guys."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, life was a lot different back then, especially for women."
"__ROCK__ She's still making music, she put out  a song in 2013 she wrote with Dave Grohl from Nirvana and Foo FIghters."
"__ROCK__ That's kind of weird to think of isn't it? A 70s rocker and a Nirvana band member writing together in 2013."
"__ROCK__ It just goes to show how they are both still such good musicians."
