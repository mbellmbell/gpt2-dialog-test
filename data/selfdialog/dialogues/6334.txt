"__STAR_WARS__ I really thought I couldn't like any other Star Wars droids as much as R2-D2 and C-3PO but I was wrong!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, which new droid are you talking about?"
"__STAR_WARS__ BB-8 of course! I loved him in 'The Force Awakens' and he's one of the main reasons I'm looking forward to 'The Last Jedi.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they did a really good job with him. The dynamics of his relationship with Poe was endearing to say the least."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know right! I was in tears when BB-8 saw Poe again for the first time after he thought he was dead."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, haha, he pushed Finn out of the way and there was no stopping him from reaching Poe!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was so cool, one of my favorite scenes in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's amazing how much personality and depth they gave his characters, especially when he doesn't even speak."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, reminds me of R2-D2, just speaks in random beeps, but still so lovable."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wish I had a robot like that in real life!"
