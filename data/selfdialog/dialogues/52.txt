"__MUSIC__ I wish Nirvana was still around."
"__MUSIC__ Ya me too, but how could it go on with Kurt?"
"__MUSIC__ Well i meant that he was still around too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh ya totally, i mean it wouldn't be nirvana without him."
"__MUSIC__ you know a lot of people just didn't get him."
"__MUSIC__ what do you mean, like his lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ ya people would put a lot of thought into the lyrics, but he himself said sometime they were just nonsensical."
"__MUSIC__ no way, his lyrics had a lot of meaning, i dont think thats true. just because we didn't understand them. i think to him they meant something really deep."
"__MUSIC__ I'm just telling you what i read he said."
"__MUSIC__ kurt was the voice of my generation. he spoke about the anguish we all feel at some time."
"__MUSIC__ ya who am i fooling, he sounded like that to me too."
"__MUSIC__ he was a popular kid who moved and then became one of the unpopular kids at his new school."
"__MUSIC__ that must have been rough for him."
"__MUSIC__ i read somewhere that he hated the rich kids that could afford the front row tickets while poorer kids were way in the back."
"__MUSIC__ oh ya i think i read that too. he said that the kids up front were the kind of kids that picked on him."
"__MUSIC__ he was a very deep person"
"__MUSIC__ he really was, there was nothing shallow about that guy."
"__MUSIC__ courtney love, i blame her. i think she ruined him."
"__MUSIC__ she certainly took over his life it seems."
"__MUSIC__ i wish he'd never met that crazy chick."
