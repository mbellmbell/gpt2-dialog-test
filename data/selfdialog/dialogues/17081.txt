"__MOVIES__ Did you see any of the animated films that got nominated for Oscars this year?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh... maybe, what were they?"
"__MOVIES__ Zootopia, Moana, Kubo and the Two Strings and... two others I don't remember."
"__MOVIES__ I saw all of those!"
"__MOVIES__ Nice, I've only seen Zootopia and Kubo."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know which movie won?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was Zootopia, to no one's surprise, I think."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense, they tend to really like movies with a social justice bent."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed. I really enjoyed Zootopia, though."
"__MOVIES__ It was fun, but I thought Kubo and the Two Strings was better."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought that movie was super dark."
"__MOVIES__ It was, but I thought it addressed some really great themes that aren't always in kids movies."
"__MOVIES__ Such as?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for one thing, that while family is important and all, sometimes family is also cruel, and it's not wrong to try to escape that."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's true, there are a lot of movies that have a very 'family before all else' kind of vibe."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, and when you come from a broken or abuse home, sometimes it's just not true that family is always there for you."
"__MOVIES__ What else did you think Kubo offered?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, themes aside, that animation was absolutely amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, I loved watching all the folding origami!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, see, and that's why I think that movie was fantastic"
