"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you say is the best player in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can I pick a non-Quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, if you think that's truly the best player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then I'm picking J.J. Watt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a down year last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, he battled an injury. But I think he's the most dominant force in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a game changer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about you? Who would you pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For me, it has to be a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's the most important position, but I don't think it necessarily means the best player plays there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see your argument, but I'm going with Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady is great, but I think he benefits greatly from scheme and overall talent around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm, I'm not sure I agree about the talent. The Patriots tend to mix and match a lot of teams' rejects on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gronkowski isn't anyone's reject!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gronk was hurt a lot last year, and the Patriots still rolled."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look, I'm not saying Brady isn't an elite QB, just that I'd take Rodgers over him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd take either Brady OR Rodgers over J.J. Watt, but I think Watt is the superior player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh? How does that make sense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He plays a less important position."
