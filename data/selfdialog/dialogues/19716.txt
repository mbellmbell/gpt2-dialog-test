"__MOVIES__ I like foreign movies."
"__MOVIES__ I don't like to read subtitles."
"__MOVIES__ I keep subtitles on whenever I can, even for movies in English."
"__MOVIES__ That would drive me crazy!"
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes I have trouble he aring the dialogue in English movies."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you like foreign movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I am finding the quality much better, and always improving,"
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the stories are less formulaic, and underscore social issues Americans normally wouldn't be aware of."
"__MOVIES__ But they must be lower budget than American movies."
"__MOVIES__ Surprisingly not. There are excellent special effects and great music in movies even from developing countries."
"__MOVIES__ What countries?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Thailand for one. The quality of production is excellent and the writing and acting is superb."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't have expected that."
"__MOVIES__ South Korea is also producing good films."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose they are about martial arts, mostly."
"__MOVIES__ No, actually. The are some, but many more are moving dramas that are also quite educational about the kinds of lives people live in other countries."
"__MOVIES__ That sound boring."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all. In fact, some are very gripping tear-jerkers, often about generational differences as times rapidly change as countries develop."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll check some out sometime, but I really hate reading subtitles."
