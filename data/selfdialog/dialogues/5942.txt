"__STAR_WARS__ So, would you prefer a blaster or a saber?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm a Hon Solo kind of a guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ A blaster then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course. I'll bet you're more of a Luke kinda fellow."
"__STAR_WARS__ Guilty as charged!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What's so great about the saber>"
"__STAR_WARS__ 'It's an elegant weapon, meant for a more civilized time.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Settle down Obi-Wan"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha! Blasters are so boring."
"__STAR_WARS__ But you can't beat the range!"
