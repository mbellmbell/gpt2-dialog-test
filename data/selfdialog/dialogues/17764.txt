"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen The Notebook"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I have."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was good but sad at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh I know. My boyfriend and I cried like babies."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah we did"
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Because we love each other and could totally picture dying like that together."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, you guys must really love each other."
"__MOVIES__ We really do."
"__MOVIES__ I wish I had that kind of love."
"__MOVIES__ Well I hope one day you do."
"__MOVIES__ How do you think you will die. Really old like in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I hope so. Hope we both have a simultaneous massive heart attack."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, can you imagine."
"__MOVIES__ I hope it doesn't hurt and that we both die at the same second."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think that's rare?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think it's pretty rare. Though I have heard of it before."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of that, except in the Notebook!"
