"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hey friend! Do you think the Harry Potter movies are as good as the books?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ At times, sure. My favorite movie was the fourth one, because of the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the visiting wizarding schools."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I enjoyed that one, too! If you could go to one of the schools, which would you pick?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'd probably choose Durmstrang. It seems a little darker than the others, a little like wizarding school in Russia."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Plus the name is a smart pun on the 'sturm und drang' music and literary aesthetic. Which school uniforms were your favorite in the films?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I enjoyed the Beauxbatons blue uniforms, but it's hard to go wrong with the classic Hogwarts robes with house crests."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think about the last book being split into two movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I partly thought it was a little opportunistic, but for me the last movies were the most emotionally intense because I never finished the book so all the action was actually a surprise."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wow, you really never finished the book? So what was the most emotional part of the final films?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it had already been spoiled, but Dobby's death was definitely the toughest part."
