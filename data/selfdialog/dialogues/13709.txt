"__BASKETBALL__ Hey man, did you check out that Warriors vs Spurs game earlier today?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I sure did, it was game 1 of the Western Conference Finals and that crowd was going crazy!"
"__BASKETBALL__ The warriors were down big time in the first half. In fact, I think they actually fell behind by like twenty five points."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, I could not believe that the warriors were able to come back and win the game!"
"__BASKETBALL__ It did not really surprise me to be honest with you. I mean, they do have Steph Curry and Kevin Durant at their disposal so anything is possible for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true, but I was still very surprised. It sure did not help things when Kawhi Leonard went down with that ankle injury though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea Kawhi is gonna have to get that ankle taken care of, the spurs have no chance without him!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I dont know dude, the spurs have some other really good players. I think they could still give Golden State a run for their money."
"__BASKETBALL__ I feel ultimatley the warriors will just be to much and beat the spurs in five games. Mark my words, they will not need six games to end this series."
"__BASKETBALL__ You may be right, but I still do not think it's wise to doubt the spurs. After all, they are a great organization that knows what it takes to be champions."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is going to be the warriors and cavs in the finals; I can not wait for that one!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea me either, Lebron will be going for his second straight NBA championship. I think he will get it but it is going to be a battle."
"__BASKETBALL__ There is no question about that, I think that series will go seven for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ It should be the best finals we have ever seen, who do you have winning it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That is a very hard question, I could really see this one going back and forth! I just do not know who will take home the trophy,"
"__BASKETBALL__ Come on man, you have to pick a winner! Who ya got?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Alright I will pick a winner, it is just really hard! I think I am going to go with the Warriors, they just have to many weapons for anyone to deal with."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea having just Durant and Curry would make any team special. However, adding Draymond Green and Klay Thompson makes them almost unbeatable!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Either way it is going to be a fun series to watch. I am sure looking forward to it!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Me and you both buddy, we will just have to set back and see what happens."
