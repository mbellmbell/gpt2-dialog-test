"__DISNEY__ I used to collect Disney movies. I wish I had kept ahold of them."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really? What was your favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I think Beauty and the Beast will always be my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new one yet."
"__DISNEY__ Yes and it's ok, I just preferred the animated version. I'm old school I guess."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, we grew up in the era of Disney movies like Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ That was one of my favorites too! Robin Williams was awesome in that one."
"__DISNEY__ I used to love one about a girl who got kidnapped and some mice who saved her....I can't remember the name."
"__DISNEY__ Oh! The Rescuers!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! That's it!"
