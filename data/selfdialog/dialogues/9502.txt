"__BASEBALL__ I used to have such a crush on Catfish Hunter."
"__BASEBALL__ On who?"
"__BASEBALL__ James Augustus Hunter. A Kansas baseball team gave him the nickname, to increase his folksy allure."
"__BASEBALL__ So he was a Kansas sensation."
"__BASEBALL__ Actually, he moved with the team to Oakland California, where they became the Oakland Athletics."
"__BASEBALL__ Ah. I've heard of the Oakland A's."
"__BASEBALL__ Of course you have. I'm surprised you haven't heard of Catfish, a creature of grace and beauty, I'll tell you."
"__BASEBALL__ So he had a long and sucessful career with the A's."
"__BASEBALL__ Sucessful. Maybe not so long."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh? What happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ After nine years with the A's, I think, he did about five years with the Yankees. I still watched him when I could."
"__BASEBALL__ And then he retired, rich and happy?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, not quite. This isn't one of those happy baseball stories."
"__BASEBALL__ What happened, a scandal?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, a disease or two. First, diabetes."
"__BASEBALL__ So he had to quit?"
"__BASEBALL__ Retire, you mean. Yes, he did. A sad day."
"__BASEBALL__ And then he got to watch his grandchildren grow up."
"__BASEBALL__ No, then he died of ALS. At about 53, I think."
"__BASEBALL__ Huh. Lou Gerig's disease. How sad."
