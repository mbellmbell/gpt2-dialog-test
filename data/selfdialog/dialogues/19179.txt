"__MOVIES__ I can't believe they just showed Dirty Grandpa on the bus."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously. Not quite a bus-appropriate movie!"
"__MOVIES__ You're so right. But that doesn't stop it from being hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Like the funniest. Zac Efron is the man."
"__MOVIES__ You can't forget Robert De Niro."
"__MOVIES__ All things considered, it's a horrible movie. If we're being critics."
"__MOVIES__ It only got 11% on Rotten Tomatoes."
"__MOVIES__ But are we movie critics? Noooope. Can't we just enjoy a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Depends on where we are! Film class, not quite. Long range Greyhound, yes. Definitely."
"__MOVIES__ One review even called it 'a new low' for Robert De Niro."
"__MOVIES__ But I bet that reviewer was still laughing!"
"__MOVIES__ Obviously. Also it had Aubrey Plaza. That's a good sign for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so we're agreed it's a movie you can't think too much about."
