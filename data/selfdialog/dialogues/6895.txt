"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite bad guy in the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Boba Fett, like there any other choice."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to agree. What he lacks in screen time, he makes up for in awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never understood why they limited his on screen time so much."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't either. You would think they would have really utilized this guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the way he got killed, come on. That was just sad, lack of any vision."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a terrible way to kill off someone so popular."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be like if Han Solo just ran into a asteroid and no one said anything else about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, probably not quite that bad, but I do get your point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was a little over board."
