"__MUSIC__ Not really.  They aren't like that really."
"__MUSIC__ Is there an album you'd recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I like all of them but I think my favorite is Sky Blue Sky."
"__MUSIC__ I'll get it and take a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Impossible Germany, Hate it Here are two of my favorite songs on that album."
"__MUSIC__ I'll see if I agree."

"__MUSIC__ We'll see."
