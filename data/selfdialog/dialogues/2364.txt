"__MUSIC__ There's a video on youtube that knocks me out."
"__MUSIC__ How to make a bump key that opens any door?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think they took that down after your little adventure. It's Peggy Lee singing while Benny Goodman plays the clarinet."
"__MUSIC__ Who are these people?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he was a clarinetist, duh. He found fame as a bandleader."
"__MUSIC__ And her?"
"__MUSIC__ She developed this sophisticated voice, but she was a prairie girl from North Dakota."
"__MUSIC__ When did they make this tape you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, the fifties I guess. It's jazz, which I know nothing about."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, then why do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's because they're playing together."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? I don't understand you. It's music, so of course they're playing together."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but they're playing playfully."
"__MUSIC__ Huh?"
"__MUSIC__ It seems to me that she is somehow imitating a clarinet, that tone or timbre, or whatever you call it."
"__MUSIC__ That's nice."
"__MUSIC__ And he's imitating that slinky tone she puts in her voice. And they toss it back and forth."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I'd get it."
"__MUSIC__ I dont know if you would. I may be imagining the whole thing."
"__MUSIC__ I'll listen, just to see if I get it. If it's even there."
