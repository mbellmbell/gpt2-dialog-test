"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Lil Yachty?"
"__MUSIC__ Is he one of those mumble rappers?"
"__MUSIC__ What is a mumble rapper?"
"__MUSIC__ You know, mumble rap. These guys who rap about nothing and all sound the same."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think I know what you mean. With that autotune, I can't tell Lil Yachty apart from any of the rest of them."
"__MUSIC__ He has maybe one song that is catchy, but his lyrics are so juvenile."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! Just mumbling nonsense right?"
"__MUSIC__ Right. What's the one song he has that sounds like a playground song?"
"__MUSIC__ I Spy with my little eye?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the one. I think it is so ridiculous."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you mean you don't like rap songs that sound like nursery rhymes?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it is a cute song for kids in middle school maybe."
"__MUSIC__ I think elementary school is more like it."
"__MUSIC__ Well I've never listened to much to the lyrics, but I think maybe there is some PG-13 content."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it might have some explicit lyrics, but the content is very immature."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I don't understand this type of music. And what is up with his voice?"
"__MUSIC__ Lil' Yachty does sound kind of slow."
"__MUSIC__ That's the way you rap when your rhymes are so simplistic."
"__MUSIC__ He makes feel-good music. Music you can just dance to without thinking."
"__MUSIC__ I think his songs are funny."
