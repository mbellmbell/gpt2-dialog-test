"__THRILLER__ I think one of my favourite Stephen King book adaptations is Pet Sematery."
"__THRILLER__ Is that why your pet graveyard in the backyard is called that?"
"__THRILLER__ That's where I got the inspiration, yep. And I named my grey cat Church just like the cat in the story."
"__THRILLER__ No kidding! Was he grey just like that cat?"
"__THRILLER__ He was indeed, though that's as far as the resemblance goes. He never came back more viscious than before."
"__THRILLER__ Hmm, I never read that book. I usually prefer the movie adaptations anyway. Especially in the thriller genre."
"__THRILLER__ Why's that?"
"__THRILLER__ Well I'm just not as easily scared when I read something versus when I see it, you know?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah. As great as Stephen King is at giving imagery there are some things in movies you just can't get from books."
"__THRILLER__ Like the creep factor in a person's voice, and the selection of music! I think Pet Sematery, Misery and Children of the Corn are good examples."
