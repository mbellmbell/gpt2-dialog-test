"__BEATLES__ I'm putting together a Beatles playlist to listen to with my kids. Do have any suggestions of Beatles songs that are good for kids?"
"__BEATLES__ Definitely Octopus's Garden. And Yellow Submarine."
"__BEATLES__ Yup, I 've got them, and Twist and Shout. What else?"
"__BEATLES__ Haha my Aunt used to sing 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' to me every time we crossed the street."
"__BEATLES__ Aw, that's sweet, Okay, I guess I have to add that one."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, and wasn't 'Hey Jude' written for one of their kids? Add that one."
"__BEATLES__ Okay. Any others?"
"__BEATLES__ 'Julia' is a nice, mellow one. It reminds me of going to the beach."
"__BEATLES__ Huh, I don't know that one."
"__BEATLES__ It was on the White Album."
