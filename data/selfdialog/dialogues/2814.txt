"__MUSIC__ You don't listen to a lot of music, do you?"
"__MUSIC__ What makes you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ I just notice that when you listen to the radio, it's usually comedy programs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I tend to do that at work. If I listen to music, it's much more distracting for some reason."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see. That makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ But I do love music, too. What I love most, in fact, are comedy songs."
"__MUSIC__ Comedy songs? Like who, for instance?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you know, someone like Weird Al Yankovic. He's hilarious."
"__MUSIC__ Is he the guy that does all the parody songs? Like doing Eat It as a parody for Michael Jackson's Beat It?"
"__MUSIC__ That's him. I just think he's so clever. The way he can find the perfect word or phrase to totally send up of popular song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he is funny. And the videos he does are great. I loved the one he did that spoofed Nirvana."
"__MUSIC__ I know, wasn't that great? I never thought he'd be able to make himself look like Kurt Cobain, but he did."
"__MUSIC__ OK, so who else?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like Monty Python in general, and they do a lot of funny songs."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Like the Spam song."
"__MUSIC__ That's a classic. My favorite is Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that one. From their last movie."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I also like a guy named Richard Cheese. He takes rock and roll songs, punk songs, hip hop, and reworks them to be Sinatra-style songs."
"__MUSIC__ Richard Cheese? Oh my gosh, what a name."
"__MUSIC__ You should hear some of his songs. You would crack up, I guarantee."
