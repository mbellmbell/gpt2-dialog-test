"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see the Disney movie Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I've seen it many times. It's one of my favorites."
"__DISNEY__ One of the first to feature a strong female lead that stands up for herself."
"__DISNEY__ I think that was part of the appeal with Frozen. That whole independence theme."
"__DISNEY__ Right and it was the same way with Brave. I loved her hair in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ I saw a special where they did a behind the scenes and each strand of her hair was meticulously done."
"__DISNEY__ You can tell. Pocahontas was a great movie too although I disagree with the historical accuracy."
"__DISNEY__ Right you just have to view it as it is, a kids movie."
"__DISNEY__ I grew up on Disney though. I love looking for the little easter eggs, the references to other Disney movies."
