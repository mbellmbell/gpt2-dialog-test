"__BASEBALL__ Is it true that Derek Jeter and Jeb Bush are buying the Miami Marlins?"
"__BASEBALL__ I thought this was joke at first but wow haha."
"__BASEBALL__ Right? That seems like strange bedfellows, no?"
"__BASEBALL__ Money brings people together I guess. It says their is other bidders too."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I'm reading Tom Glavine is involved in one of the groups that are bidding."
"__BASEBALL__ They have that new ballpark already, you'd think that new ownership would have a clear path to make their investment back quickly."
"__BASEBALL__ It's Miami though...they have a hard time getting fans in the park on a regular basis for those Florida teams."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but it isn't as bad as Tampa. Winning helps a lot."
"__BASEBALL__ Agree, but it's hard not root against Jeb Bush."
"__BASEBALL__ LOL the Bushes already owned the Rangers, we saw how that worked out."
"__BASEBALL__ For 1.3 Billion they better win something."
"__BASEBALL__ Fun fact: the Marlins haven't lost a playoff series."
"__BASEBALL__ Gotta get them there again to put that to the test."
"__BASEBALL__ I like a lot of their players, still such a shame about Jose Fernandez."
"__BASEBALL__ Aw man, yeah, He was supposed to be their anchor for years."
"__BASEBALL__ Poor choice of words."
"__BASEBALL__ You know what I mean LOL"
"__BASEBALL__ Gotcha. Still have Stanton though."
"__BASEBALL__ They win when he's on the field but he's a little injury prone."
"__BASEBALL__ The knee, the wrist, it's always something."
