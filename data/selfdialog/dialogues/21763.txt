"__DISNEY__ Did you know they Snow White was Disney's first feature film?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh wow! No, I didn't know that."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah,Walt was really proud of his accomplishment."
"__DISNEY__ I can't say I blame him! I'd be proud if I ever made a movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too! Though I'd rather be a Disney Princess."
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha! Now that would be something!"
"__DISNEY__ Wouldn't it? Could you imagine being a mermaid like Ariel?"
"__DISNEY__ I think I'd rather be like Belle from Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that Beast was kind of rugged and dreamy."
"__DISNEY__ Sure, but I was dreaming of the dress and having talking objects that cooked and cleaned for me!"
