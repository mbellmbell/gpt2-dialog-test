"__DISNEY__ What Disney movie are you looking forward to?"
"__DISNEY__ Big Hero 7"
"__DISNEY__ Really? They're making a sequel to Big Hero 6. That would be awesome"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, apparantly they don't have a definitive release date yet though."
"__DISNEY__ Bummer, guess something I will have to keep an eye out for. Any idea of the details?"
"__DISNEY__ I read that Tadashi apparantly makes a miraculous comeback as a villan"
"__DISNEY__ That's absurd! First off he is dead, and secondly he's the creator of Beymax, who was designed to help people."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, although didn't Tadashi's brother, Hiro have a stent in the first movie where he became a bit of a villan himself?"
"__DISNEY__ Well sort of, it was more 'vigilante justice' but not 'villan' as in harming innocent people."
"__DISNEY__ Sometimes they are classified one in the same, not sure how Tadashi will be classified in this."
