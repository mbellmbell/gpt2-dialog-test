"__MOVIES__ I can't wait for the summer movie season to begin."
"__MOVIES__ I think it already has."
"__MOVIES__ I meant, I'm waiting for the real big movies."
"__MOVIES__ What, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 doesn't count?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it does. You're right, the summer movie season has begun."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. When King Arthur bombed I knew it had officially begun."
"__MOVIES__ Haha. But I heard from a friend that it's really good, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Rotten Tomatoes disagrees, but maybe you can see for yourself when it hits Netflix or whatever."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. I'm actually sort of looking forward to the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the last one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I actually don't know what's going on in the series anymore. But for some reason I want to see the new one."
"__MOVIES__ Guess you'd better catch up on them, then."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't know when I'll see it. Someday, but probably not in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anything you will see in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'd like to see the new Transformers movie, but I'll wait on that too."
"__MOVIES__ You haven't answered my question."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, well, I might see The Hitman's Bodyguard in theaters. I think it'll come down to reviews."
"__MOVIES__ Do reviews really matter that much? You wanted to see King Arthur even though it got bad reviews."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, but seeing a movie in the theater is a different experience. I'd like to see a good movie if I go."
"__MOVIES__ I understand. It costs more, so you want to get the best value and experience you can."
