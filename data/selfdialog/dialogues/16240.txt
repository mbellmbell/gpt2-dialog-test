"__ROCK__ What do you think about Queen touring with Adam Lambert?"
"__ROCK__ I'm all for it honestly."
"__ROCK__ Really, I'm surprised I thought for sure you'd be against it."
"__ROCK__ You'd think that but there's nothing wrong with those guys getting out there with someone else."
"__ROCK__ So would you be against them putting out a record with Adam?"
"__ROCK__ Now that I might be iffy on, especially dependent on how they label it."
"__ROCK__ You mean like what they did with Paul Rodgers?"
"__ROCK__ Exactly what I mean, if they label on the box that it's with Adam Lambert then okay."
"__ROCK__ But isn't that a bit tacky?"
"__ROCK__ There exists no other Queen besides the one with Freddy."
