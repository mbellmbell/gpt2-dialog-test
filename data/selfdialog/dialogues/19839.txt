"__MOVIES__ Are there any good movies out right now?"
"__MOVIES__ I just saw Wonder Woman and it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm not really into super hero movies."
"__MOVIES__ Okay then, how about Pirates of the Caribbean?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard the reviews weren't that good."
"__MOVIES__ You can't always rely on the reviews. I don't always agree with the critics."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but I don't have a lot of money to throw away on a disappointing movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Wonder Woman got good reviews and I definitely recommend it. Even if you don't like superhero movies, I still think it was good."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'll check it out. It's gotta be better than Transformers."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not this one, but I saw the last one with my friend. I have no interest in this one."
"__MOVIES__ It's just your typical summer movie. Entertaining but over the top."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like they're trying to appeal to a mass audience of teenage boys."
"__MOVIES__ I think Wonder Woman appeals to a wider variety of people."
"__MOVIES__ I just hope it's not a waste of my time and money."
"__MOVIES__ Stay away from the movie theater popcorn and soda if you want to save money."
"__MOVIES__ I know right! It's brutal!"
"__MOVIES__ Have fun at the movies. I hope you like it."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks!"
"__MOVIES__ You're welcome."
