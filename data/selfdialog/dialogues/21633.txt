"__DISNEY__ Did you hear they're finally making a new 'Incredibles' movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, great!  I love that one.  It's a long time between the original and the sequel."
"__DISNEY__ I know.  Hopefully it will be worth the wait."
"__DISNEY__ Mr. Incredible is the best."
"__DISNEY__ What about Frozone?  That scene where he says 'Honey, where's my super suit'?"
"__DISNEY__ Hysterical.  The way his wife answers is the super funny."
"__DISNEY__ Is Syndrome going to be the villain?"
"__DISNEY__ I have no idea.  Wasn't he killed in the first movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Will the kids be the same age do you think, or grown up?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know.  Maybe Jack-Jack will be in high school or something."
