"__BASKETBALL__ So it does seem like we will get the Warriors and Cavaliers in the Finals again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  This would be three straight years."
"__BASKETBALL__ Which team do you think is the favorite?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Honestly, it's really hard to say.  I mean everyone is leaning towards the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true.  But how can you really bet against LeBron James, especially after last year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  And I think there is an argument that the Cavaliers are a deeper team than the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree.  I think the Cavaliers quietly did a good job upgrading their roster this season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  Everyone talks about the Warriors adding Durant, but the Cavaliers added a number of good players."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the addition of Kyle Korver is a huge advantage for the Cavaliers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  They are able to surround LeBron or Irving with shooters at all times."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly.  Very good shooters at that."
"__BASKETBALL__ And Deron Williams playing the point guard position off the bench is a huge benefit for them as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well we are discussing the Cavaliers right now, but what about the Warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well to be fair, the Warriors would probably have won last season if Draymond Green had not gotten suspended."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true.  They were up three games to one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  But I think even with the addition of Kevin Durant, this team overall might not be as good as last year's team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Interesting.  They did win less games than last season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  And I don't think their roster is as deep."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is fair, but I still think the Warriors will win the Championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, I'd agree.  I'm leaning that way as well."
