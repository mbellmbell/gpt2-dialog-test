"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know, people are really hard on Snape for the way he treated Neville Longbottom."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, he was kind of a jerk."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but have you ever thought about why?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Not really. I just figured he hated him because he wasn't good at magic."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it's a bit more complicated than that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How so?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ According to the prophecy, 'the chosen one' was supposed to be born at the end of July. Neville was born around the same time as Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So as far as Voldemort knew, it could've been either of them?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yep, only he chose to go after Harry. If he'd chosen Neville instead, Lily would still be alive."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh! Well, I guess that explains it."
