"__BASKETBALL__ Man, I wish the Rockets could pull out this series."
"__BASKETBALL__ There still is a chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I guess it is not totally over."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is not, but Harden is looking really run down."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly, that is the problem with not closing out series earlier."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well that and him clearly being on an MVP campaign this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he just looks exhausted out there."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is odd though since his teammates are not that bad."
"__BASKETBALL__ They are not but the way they run their offense he has to be involved in each play."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true, his usage rate is off the charts."
"__BASKETBALL__ Second only to Westbrook."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who was rigging the system to get triple doubles."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly! Which was the NBA's most overrated storyline this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Could not agree more.  Triple-Doubles are a totally made up stat."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed.  I don't know why people clung to that so quickly."
"__BASKETBALL__ Because ESPN repeated it a million times this year and made it seem like a thing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but really it was just ball hogging and terrible basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, hero ball is not fun to watch."
"__BASKETBALL__ Unless it is Jordan."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah and Westbrook is no Jordan."
