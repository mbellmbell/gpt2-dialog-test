"__BASKETBALL__ What did you think about that Wizards game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Nice to finally get a competitive game in that series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but I wish John Wall had hit a regular shot at the end instead of a three-pointer. We could have had overtime."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm just glad the Wizards won so we get a seventh game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think will win that one?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Isaiah Thomas will have a huge performance at home. I see the Celtics taking it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't you think the Wizards could have another huge run like they have been having in every game in this series?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think the Celtics will let that happen at this point. They closed the Bulls out pretty convincingly."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wizards are a better team than Chicago though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes but Thomas is not as distracted in this series. He might be the best player in the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ So you think Thomas is better than Wall?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Wall is a better passer. Thomas is a better scorer."
"__BASKETBALL__ Either one of them can take over a game though. I don't think either is better than the other."
"__BASKETBALL__ Both of them play better at home. Since this one is in Boston I think Isaiah will be the better player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think either of them has a chance against Cleveland."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not a chance! Cleveland is resting while these two are killing each other."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and Cleveland was better to begin with. The regular season record doesn't mean much."
"__BASKETBALL__ Right. Lebron takes it to another level in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ So then you think the Finals are set? A rematch between Cleveland and Golden State?"
"__BASKETBALL__ This past year has proven anything is possible so maybe not. But I'd be shocked if you see the Spurs, Wizards or Celtics in the Finals."
