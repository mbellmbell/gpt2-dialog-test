"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Redskins are going to own this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a bold statement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just a fact.  This is their year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Explain what leads you to believe this."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For one, they've got the best QB in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're a funny guy, aren't you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm telling you, Kirk Cousins is the future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a decent QB, but the best?  You're crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Name three quarterbacks better than him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Three?  I'll give you five.  Rogers, Brady, Prescott, Ryan, Wilson..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those guys are all overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, okay.  You're being such a homer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at what Cousins did last year with nothing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean nothing?  Their OL was okay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they had no receiving help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they had some.  They went and drafted a billion this year I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's because guys like Crowder are good, but not #1's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but not sure if they've got anybody that puts fear in defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, just saying, they are going to surprise this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe.  I would be surprised if they surprise me!"
