"__MOVIES__ I've been watching so much TV recently, haven't seen a movie in a long while. Is there anything good out right now?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I'm the same way. The only time I really go to the movies is when there's something that you need to see on a big screen."
"__MOVIES__ Like big blockbuster stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. That method hasn't really let me down. So I saw a couple of movies in the last month, and they were dope."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones?"
"__MOVIES__ First I saw the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! How was that?"
"__MOVIES__ It was sweet."
"__MOVIES__ How'd it compare to the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Eh, it wasn't quite as good. But it was still really entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely liked how the first one didn't take itself too seriously."
"__MOVIES__ This one's the same way. But yeah, not exactly as good as the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Okay I'll check that one out. What was the other one you saw?"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ People keep raving about that. How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I don't know. I'm really sick of superhero movies to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ Same. But was it worth watching though?"
"__MOVIES__ If you don't care that it's a superhero movie, it's one of the best ones I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ It's cool too that it's pretty feminist. Okay, I'll check those two out. Thanks for the recommendations."
"__MOVIES__ No problem. I'll let you know what else I see."
