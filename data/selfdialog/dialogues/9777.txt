"__COMEDY__ What was that movie with Emma Stone in it?"
"__COMEDY__ La La Land?"
"__COMEDY__ Oh no.  The one where she was a teenager in high school."
"__COMEDY__ I think you mean Easy A."
"__COMEDY__ Yes!  That's the one!"
"__COMEDY__ It was pretty darn underrated and funny."
"__COMEDY__ It kind of put her on the map a bit as well."
"__COMEDY__ She definitely elevated her status in that movie.  It was a cut above the other teen movies."
"__COMEDY__ Too bad she's like 40 years old now."
"__COMEDY__ Wow, you are way offbase."
