"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, are you looking forward to the NFL season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely! Let's see if the Pats can repeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they can. My money's on the Bucs this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bucs!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Bucs, I think Mike Evans is going to have a big year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, plus they picked up Desean Jackson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See, They've got a lot of talent!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At receiver maybe..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And quarterback.. Winston is coming into his own"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he's not even in the top five quarterbacks in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's better besides Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Rogers, Matt Ryan, Big Ben, Russel Wilson, just to name a few."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I take issue with Matt Ryan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bucs usually beat the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, I think they beat them twice last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, maybe the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why the Steelers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Rothlesburger wants to retire and go out on a bang."
