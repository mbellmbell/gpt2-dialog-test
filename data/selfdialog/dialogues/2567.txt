"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Katy Perry's new songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think I've heard two of them."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think about them?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm still undecided about whether I'm into them or not. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel the same way! Like, when I first heard her three new singles, I didn't think I liked them, but now a couple of them keep getting stuck in my head."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of felt the same way when I heard Bon Appetite and Chained to the Rhythm. Was uncertain at first but now they're always stuck in my head."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can definitely see how those two songs would get stuck in your head."
"__MUSIC__ They're just so dang catchy!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Have you heard the other single she released recently."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. What is it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Swish Swish."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that one! Yeah, wasn't that the one that she performed on Saturday Night Live last week?"
"__MUSIC__ It was! That performance was entertaining, I think, but also kind of weird and crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I agree! I don't know if I like that song yet. I heard it for the first time when she performed it on SNL."
"__MUSIC__ I had heard it once before then, but I feel the same way. I'm undecided."
"__MUSIC__ What was up with that kid dancing in her Saturday Night Live performance?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but that was funny! Actually, my girlfriend told me that he is some sort of Instagram star or something."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that makes sense! It seemed so random to me! Maybe I'll look that kid up and see what that was about."
"__MUSIC__ You should! Let me know what you find out!"
"__MUSIC__ I will!"
