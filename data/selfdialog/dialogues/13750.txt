"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see what the Boston Celtics wore before the game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, wearing all black like going to a funeral"
"__BASKETBALL__ That was pretty messed up, even more since isaiah thomas' sister just passed away"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I thought that was weird too."
"__BASKETBALL__ I love how John wall buried the other team with that 3 pointer"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah me too, he definitely showed them up for wearing all black"
"__BASKETBALL__ I also loved how he responded about his city"
"__BASKETBALL__ yeah you don't go out and do that in another mans city"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am looking forward to game 7 though, who do you think will win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well with the way things are going i'd say celtics but I want the wizards to win"
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, I prefer the wizards to the celtics, I think celtics have won enough already lol."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, most championships ever is enough for a while I think"
"__BASKETBALL__ So who you got in the spurs vs warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's really hard to chose against the warriors, but I think that the spurs have a good chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I agree, especially with the size advantage the spurs have."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they defenitely have that, and also a better defensive team"
"__BASKETBALL__ True that, I just hope whoever gets through is tired when facing the cavs"
"__BASKETBALL__ So you dont think either wizards or celtics have a chance against the cavs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No I don't see it going past 5 games"
"__BASKETBALL__ Bold prediction but the way the cavs are playing it's totally possible."
