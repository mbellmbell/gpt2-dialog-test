"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Dallas Cowboys will do this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Based on their 13-3 record last season, I think that they have the best odds of making the Super Bowl of any team in the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously? Have you seen their playoff record over the past 20 years?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Playoff games are always funny things and they should have won that 2015 game in Green Bay. Moreover, this is a much more experienced team than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This season will only be Dak Prescott's second season. He's bound to regress."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sometimes happens with sophomore quarterbacks, but not always. Ben Roethlisberger and Russell Wilson both won Super Bowls during their sophomore seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but more often than not, opposing teams learn how to better plan for quarterbacks after their rookie seasons, which leads to regression."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ While this may be the case, Dallas's offensive advantage largely stems not from the quarterback position, but from their running game and their amazing offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't argue with you on their offensive line. However, their leading rusher is still under investigation from the NFL and could be suspended for part of next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ While I remain concerned regarding the Ezekiel Elliott situation, I doubt that he will be suspended for more than 4 games, if that. Also, their offensive line is so strong that it won't matter much who runs the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think that a 29-year old Darren McFadden could be their leading rusher?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Darren McFadden would probably not be a great leading rusher. However, they have Alfred Morris, who was amazing in Washington during his early career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally forgot about him. However, he went from Pro Bowl to back up in less than two seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Morris was overworked and under protected in Washington. The situation in Dallas is much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll have to see. Also, I'm very concerned about Dallas's defense this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Sean Lee continues to be one of the most underrated defensive players in the league and should lead an effective defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lee is great when he's healthy, which is not often."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that between Lee's leadership and some promising players in the defensive secondary, defense should not be a major issue for Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All I know is that they were ranked 26th against the pass last year. I would be more concerned about their defense if I were you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Between Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, and Dez Bryant, they can easily score enough points per game to overcome any defensive issues."
