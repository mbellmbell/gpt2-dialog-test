"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard the new song by the Foo Fighters?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure that I have, what's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Run."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm...I don't think I have heard it yet.  When did it come out?"
"__MUSIC__ A couple of weeks ago, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, then I definitely haven't heard it yet."
"__MUSIC__ You should listen to it, it's really good."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, does it sound like anything else that they have done?"
"__MUSIC__ It definitely has the Foo Fighters' sound, but I wouldn't compare it to anything else that they've done."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, I love cutting edge music."
"__MUSIC__ Same here, it seems that the Foo Fighters try new things out a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, they have done quite a variety of music!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's amazing to think that Dave Grohl was the only musician on their first album."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ You really didn't know that?"
"__MUSIC__ Honest!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, well he played all the instruments on the recording, and then decided to form an actual band."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and to think he was 'only' the drummer in Nirvana!"
"__MUSIC__ Dave and the Foo Fighters rock!"
