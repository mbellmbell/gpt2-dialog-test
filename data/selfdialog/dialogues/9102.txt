"__BASEBALL__ Are you a big fan of the Twins?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I'm actually more of an Orioles fan."
"__BASEBALL__ I didn't know that! What inning is this?"
"__BASEBALL__ Looks like the top of the third."
"__BASEBALL__ Orioles are killing it -- six runs already."
"__BASEBALL__ They usually do well at the beginning and then flunk at the end."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, the Twins have been terrible this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Have you gone to many games this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Only two. I've been too busy. What about you?"
"__BASEBALL__ Three or four."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you have season tickets?"
"__BASEBALL__ No. This is my first year I didn't buy season tickets. I kind of wish I had, now."
"__BASEBALL__ This pitcher isn't doing so well. He's walked everyone so far."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know if I trust this ump's calls."
"__BASEBALL__ The Twins will probably get a run by getting walked in."
"__BASEBALL__ See that one? That was clearly a strike. The ump didn't call it."
"__BASEBALL__ Eh, it was little out of bounds. Maybe."
"__BASEBALL__ You're probably right. Ugh! The Orioles just get cocky. And then they lose."
"__BASEBALL__ One run for the Twins! Can't believe they walked a guy in."
"__BASEBALL__ Typical."
