"__LADY_GAGA__ Who do you think is better: Katy Perry or Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga, for sure."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Why is that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, Lady Gaga is not afraid to be herself and she knows how to sing really well."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. Personally, I think Artpop was a flop, but I still listened to a few of the songs from there."
"__LADY_GAGA__ There weren't good ones on that album, but her other albums were amazing."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Born This Way was the best song she's made."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think Poker Face was good, but that might just be because I like to gamble."
"__LADY_GAGA__ True. Does she have new music coming out?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm not sure! She might, but she hasn't promoted it."
