"__DISNEY__ I was complaining last week to my husband that we never do anything romantic together anymore."
"__DISNEY__ I know a lot of married couples feel they get stuck in a rut of working and just being at home."
"__DISNEY__ He suggested we go out to a movie for a date night."
"__DISNEY__ Well, that sounds romantic! What did you go see?"
"__DISNEY__ The new Disney movie- Pirates of the Carribean- Dead Men Tell No Tales!"
"__DISNEY__ Well. that doesn't sound really romantic after all."
"__DISNEY__ Of course, Johny Depp is still pretty cute, and I like his Jack Sparrow character that reminds me of Keith Richards, but no, it's not really romantic."
"__DISNEY__ Unless if you act really scared during the scary parts, so you can snuggle up to your husband or hold his hand."
"__DISNEY__ My husband's hands were full of popcorn and soda the whole time, so there was no hand holding."
"__DISNEY__ Well, at least there was Johnny Depp to look at."
