"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have to watch the Star Wars movies in order?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure. I've only seen the first one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think I'm going to start from the beginning."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't get into the older ones. The special effects are so bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe I should watch a new one first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue Wars was great! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is that your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, for sure. It was really amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I'll start with that one. If I can't get into it, I quit!"
"__STAR_WARS__ You will love it!"
