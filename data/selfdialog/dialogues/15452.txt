"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, in Harry Potter, Trewlaney was usually pretty spot on."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sometimes, others she was just nuts."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But, that is the thing. She is a great-great granddaughter of the seer Cassandra."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, what has that to do with her crazy side."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Cassandra, in old myth, was a seer, always right, who was cursed to be seen as insane, even when people saw she was right."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What? Oh, wow , just like her!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes. She predicated the whole movie, in a convoluted way."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And no one believed her predictions."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, just like the myth! See, she was right the whole time!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wow, that makes a lot of sense."
