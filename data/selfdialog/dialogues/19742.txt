"__MOVIES__ You know what I was wondering?"
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ How come they never show that movie that Robert Dinero made with Wesley Snipes?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you're talking about The Fan?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it when it first came out."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. That was over twenty, maybe twenty-five years ago."
"__MOVIES__ And don't nobody ever show it."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's the only movie those two have made together."
"__MOVIES__ I know right. After that Dinero had a bigger career."
"__MOVIES__ He did what, Heat, Casino, and a whole lot more."
"__MOVIES__ And Wesley did maybe Blade and then virtually fell off the map."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that Blade was corny. I didn't see it but it just looks corny."
"__MOVIES__ I liked Wesley when he did that Spike Lee Joint Mo' Betta Blues."
"__MOVIES__ Can you imagine? Wesley and Denzell both in the same flick."
"__MOVIES__ You know that was back in the day. Won't happen nowadays in this economy."
"__MOVIES__ Spike Lee had that pull. I like his version of Malcolm X."
"__MOVIES__ His version? Ain't nobody else do Malcolm X."
"__MOVIES__ I'm talking about Denzell's portrayal of him."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay."
