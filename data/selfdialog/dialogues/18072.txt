"__MOVIES__ Can you help me find a movie? I can't seem to find 'Kill Bill'."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes m'am. It's right over here in the Action section."
"__MOVIES__ Can you tell me anything about it? One of my friends recommended it."
"__MOVIES__ Of course! It's of my favorites, mainly because Uma Thurman is so amazing in it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a Quentin Tarantino film, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It's full of his signature style: Great music, crazy samurai fights, and funny dialog."
"__MOVIES__ So what' so great about Uma Thurman? I mean other than she's a beautiful blonde?"
"__MOVIES__ She's a very strong actress, and her stunts are just about unbelievable in this. She really worked hard to make it exciting."
"__MOVIES__ Does she do sword fighting in this? How did her character learn how to do it?"
"__MOVIES__ She's one of a group of new-age samurai, that all work for this guy named Bill. he's played by none other than David Carradine!"
"__MOVIES__ The name sounds familiar, but Ican;t place him. What else was he in?"
"__MOVIES__ He played Quai Chang Kane in the old series, 'Kung Fu'!"
"__MOVIES__ Huh, oh,yeah. I remember that. 'Grasshopper!'"
"__MOVIES__ Hehe, yeah, but in this he's an older American dude who loves to train gall and guys to be mercenaries."
"__MOVIES__ Does he do any Kung Fu in this?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's mostly Uma who does the fighting, along with a lot of other characters."
"__MOVIES__ So what's the storyline? I really can't seem to get it from this DVD cover."
"__MOVIES__ Uma's character is a mercenary who defects from the group and decides to get married and raise a kid. Bill doesn't like that, because he's in love with her, so he has his bunch kill her off."
"__MOVIES__ But...how does she survive? I don't get it."
"__MOVIES__ She goes into a coma for years, and when she wakes up, she gets revenge upon Bill's group by killing them off, one-by-one. Enjoy!"
