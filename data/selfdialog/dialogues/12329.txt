"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, do you think Colin Kapernick is done with football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's a free agent and no team has picked him up so far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think with a month left it would be hard to just 'show up and play'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus i think he does not want to play anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's off to 'go find himself'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It too bad, he had talent, i can see him getting forgotten real quick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HA! That's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's happened before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's funny i was thinking about that 49'ers/Rams game where he ran the 2 pt conversion in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, that was great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He kept looking like he was gonna pass it and just leaped it in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and the 49'ers interception right after that play won the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, i just can't see why kapernick would walk away from all of that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, like i said he wants to go find himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully if he returns it will be like Dave Chappell... just slide back in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think it will be that easy for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One can always hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed."
