"__MOVIES__ Have you seen a movie on Netflix called The Curve?"
"__MOVIES__ I do not believe so, who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Julianne Hough and only a few other people."
"__MOVIES__ Why so little actors?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is based out in the country and a woman wrecks her car and there is a crazy man trying to kill her."
"__MOVIES__ Wrecks her car? So is it a survival type of movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes somewhat, she does some crazy stuff to survive though."
"__MOVIES__ I may have heard of it, isn't that the lady who is a dancer normally?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but she is not a bad actress actually . I really liked the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know if it is still on Netflix now?"
"__MOVIES__ It has to be, I just watched it again not too long ago."
"__MOVIES__ For not having many people in it, does the movie keep your attention?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh absolutely, there are some great parts in it that make you saw WOW."
"__MOVIES__ I like those type of movies that are based in the middle of nowhere."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, it makes you think about what you would do in those situations as well."
"__MOVIES__ I would like to star in movies like that, but I am not a actor."
"__MOVIES__ I think those movies can teach you something if that were to ever happen in real life."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I would imagine so, does this actress take some crazy steps to survive?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's just say she tries to cut off one of her own limbs."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, you have my attention now. I am going to have to find it!"
