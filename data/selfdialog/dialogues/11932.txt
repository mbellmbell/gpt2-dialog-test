"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to win the NFC this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's a toss up between the Seahawks and Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you heard about all the offseason drama with Seattle though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I thought they had a great offseason. What happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Apparently the locker room is pretty divided. The defense thinks Russell Wilson is getting special treatment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that, he is definitely treated like the golden child over there. Who do you think is behind the rumors?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Richard Sherman came out and made a statement in the media."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, and he is definitely the emotional leader of that team. Which team might step up if the Seahawks dissapoints?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Cardinals as a sleeper pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, even with an aging Carson Palmer and the loss of Calais Campbell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya they have the best linebacking core in the NFC with the addition of Riddick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the honey badger is going to stay healthy this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to say. I think if he makes it through the whole season, the Cardinals might have one of the better defenses in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that coming to fruition. Plus they have Bruce Arians who for my money might be the second best coach behind Bill Belicheck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya I really like how outspoken he is. Speaking of Belicheck, is anyone going to be able to take down the Patriots in the AFC this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't bet on it but I do like the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ya the one-two punch of La'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown is pretty unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are always on my radar for first round picks in my fantasy football league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely. I'm not sure Big Ben Rothelisberger can handle too many more seasons though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He takes a beating every year but somehow manages to play almost every game, it's incredible."
