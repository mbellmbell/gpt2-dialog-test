"__BASEBALL__ Do you think the Yankees will make it to the post-season this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I hope so. Last year was a huge disappointment."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, this year they seem to be doing better."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, absolutely. The Yankees have some younger players on the roster."
"__BASEBALL__ Some of the new players are excellent. The Yankees appear to be doing pretty well this year, in general."
"__BASEBALL__ I'd be willing to bet that they'll probably make it to the post-season."
"__BASEBALL__ They've been leading the AL East."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm really happy to see that. They should be leading it all the time with the size of their payroll."
"__BASEBALL__ True. But there are a lot of factors involved with their performance on the field."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't think Joe Girardi is a very good manager, though. That's just my opinion."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. He's certainly no Joe Torre."
"__BASEBALL__ Those were the glory days when Joe Torre was manager and they had Derek Jeter on the roster."
"__BASEBALL__ They just haven't reached that level since then. Not consistently, anyway."
"__BASEBALL__ But it does seem like they're getting their act together this year."
"__BASEBALL__ I sure hope it continues."
"__BASEBALL__ I think it will. They've taken a risk with some younger players this year, and it's paying off."
"__BASEBALL__ It is. Aaron Judge is amazing."
"__BASEBALL__ Totally! Where'd he come from?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees actually drafted him four years ago out of college in California."
"__BASEBALL__ He's the one to watch. I think he could be a Jeter-level superstar."
