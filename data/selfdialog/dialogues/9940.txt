"__COMEDY__ Do you have a favorite Woody Allen comedy?"
"__COMEDY__ That's a tough one. 'Play It Again, Sam,' I guess."
"__COMEDY__ I liked that, too. But my favorite is 'Annie Hall.'"
"__COMEDY__ Why 'Annie Hall'?"
"__COMEDY__ I think it's a really good story, with some serious elements, but also with a lot of comedy."
"__COMEDY__ The part I remember best is when they tried to cook the lobsters."
"__COMEDY__ Yes, that was good. I liked when they were standing in line at the movies and Woody's character was rolling his eyes at some of the pretentious moviegoers."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, and then he pulled in Marshall McLuhan to set them straight?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes. Very funny. I also like his old school comedies, like 'Bananas'."
"__COMEDY__ That was with the actress from 'Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,' right?"
