"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, whose your favorite Jedi character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to say Mace Windu."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, nay particular reasons?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, first he is a badass character, tough and battle ready."
"__STAR_WARS__ Basically, a tough guy's kind of Jedi, any other reason's"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he also is the only Jedi Master able to go toe to toe with Palpatine and survive."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, until Anakin turns on him and slices his arm off."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but Palpatine couldn't defeat him by himself, he needed Anakin to distract and injure him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, you don't think he was faking weakness to force Anakin to his side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Would you take that chance with a comabt as skilled and determined as Mace WIndu?"
