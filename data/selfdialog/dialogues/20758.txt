"__THRILLER__ Have you seen both Prisoners and the prestige?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, both are great thrillers with Hugh Jackman."
"__THRILLER__ That brings me to my question, which is a better performance by him?"
"__THRILLER__ Hard call. he is so great in both."
"__THRILLER__ But if you had to pick."
"__THRILLER__ I think prisoners because it is such a dark role. I think it took a lot."
"__THRILLER__ I think he may have more screen time in prisoners , but not really sure."
"__THRILLER__ Like I said hard call overall. I enjoy both films and both of his performances."
"__THRILLER__ I think I would rather rewatch prestige to prisoners."
