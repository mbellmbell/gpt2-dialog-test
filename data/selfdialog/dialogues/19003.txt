"__MOVIES__ Hey do you like movies based on books?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, definitely.  Why do you ask?"
"__MOVIES__ Just wondering.  Some people don't like it.  What's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series, and American Psycho."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really?  I've heard mixed things about American Psycho."
"__MOVIES__ No way, Christian Bale did an awesome job as Patrick Bateman."
"__MOVIES__ I heard the acting was good but the ending was confusing."
"__MOVIES__ It was supposed to be that way.  You were supposed to interpret it yourself instead of giving a concrete ending."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, cool.  I haven't seen it so maybe I should check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You should.  It's one of my favorite movies.  And I think it stayed true to the book."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool, I'll definitely see it.  I really enjoyed Gone Girl myself."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that was an awesome movie.  They did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought that Ben Affleck did a really impressive job."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was definitely better in Gone Girl than he was in Batman Vs. Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, yeah.  That movie was terrible.  The plot, the acting, everything."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I had a hard time watching it.  I was mad that I paid for it after I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I actually drove to the theater to see it.  I could barely follow along what was going on."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Ben Affleck couldn't have saved that movie, even if he was a decent Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Well, not to bring up Christian Bale again, but HE was a great batman."
"__MOVIES__ No doubt!"
