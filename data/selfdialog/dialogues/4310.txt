"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the latin music movement in America right now?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well popular music is incorporating Latin base lines and even latin rap"
"__MUSIC__ You mean like Justin Beiber's Despacito?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. And Pitbull, and that latin base line you hear in Despacito is becoming more popular."
"__MUSIC__ Huh.  I didn't realize that was Latin."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, it's interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think it's happening?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, latin music is by nature easy to dance to and good for parties."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I've heard a lot of these songs in dance settings. But America has always liked to dance."
"__MUSIC__ That you are right. The Latin movement has always been around, take Enrique Iglesias as asn example."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! I love his song Bailando."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was a great song. It was popular like 5 years ago. But now we're seeing latin hits every year."
"__MUSIC__ Intersting. You think this trend will continue"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I think as American radio becomes more supportive of all cultures, latin music will make it to the top?"
"__MUSIC__ You think latin music is the best music--"
"__MUSIC__ DESPACITOOOOO."
"__MUSIC__ I'll take that as a yes."
"__MUSIC__ I love it man. I hope it continues."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, sure."
