"__MUSIC__ Do you like Indie type rap?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean like stuff that isn't all the same thing about money and women?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like do you think you would like Atmosphere?"
"__MUSIC__ What kind of songs do they have?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite album is called God Loves Ugly."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a great name for an album. When was it made?"
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of old. It was made in 2002, but I think the music is really great, kind of timeless if you like their style."
"__MUSIC__ Is there more than one person in this group?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but the singer is Slug. He has a great voice and his lyrics are unique."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like something I might like.  I'm kind of tired of the same old 'bling' and put women down kind of stuff."
"__MUSIC__ If you want to check out the group, you can just do a search on YouTube and find plenty of samples."
"__MUSIC__ Great, I'll do that. It sounds like I might have something new to listen to now!"
"__MUSIC__ Some of the songs are kind of weird, so I'd recommend starting with something like God Loves Ugly or One of a Kind."
"__MUSIC__ Those are the older ones, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I am pretty partial to the God Loves Ugly album, ha ha."
"__MUSIC__ Is the band still around?"
"__MUSIC__ They released new songs last year, but I haven't really listened to those. Definitely still around."
"__MUSIC__ I am going to check out some of the music now. Thanks!"
"__MUSIC__ No problem. I think you'll really get a kick out of some of the lyrics too."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'll talk to you later."
