"__STAR_WARS__ You know who I didn't expect to see in Revenge of the Sith?  Chewy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I didn't know Wookies lived that long."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I hear they live a very long time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I felt so bad for Chewy when Han died."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, that was almost the saddest thing I've seen in a movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ It almost sent me into tears.  Him and Han are the best bromance of all time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah they are.  You know a franchise is good when you have feelings for the characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and it's not like we can understand Chewy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Shows how good that acting is."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the acting around him.  He's a great character."
