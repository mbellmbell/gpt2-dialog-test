"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who do you think will win the Stanley Cup this year? Is your team still in the playoffs?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Absolutely!  My Penguins are going to take the whole thing!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ As long as it is an Original Six team, I don't care who wins now that my Canadiens are out! I'm so mad that they choked again."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, I think Carey Price is overrated. He's not that great of a goalie."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But have you seen all of the trophies he's won? He's also a finalist for the Venza again this year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Kind of ridiculous, because he gets hurt all of the time. He's not that consistent."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, but that's also because he has no defensive line to help him out.  He lost PK when they traded him to the Predators and now look what's happened!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Predators are STILL alive! And against the Ducks who are really strong this year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I can't stand the West Coast teams though."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Agree. My dad always said that they should never have an NHL team where they don't have ice outside."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The only Original 6 team left are the Pens.  And that makes me nervous!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, don't be. Crosby is hot and Fleury is amazing in the net."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ At least there's still a Canadian team left in the final four."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's funny. Most of the players here in the States ARE Canadian."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, it always bothered me when I saw players from Quebec playing for teams like Boston or Detroit. I feel like they are being traitors to the Candiens."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Canadiens are washed up. They're not consistent enough to win like they did in the early days."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ We STILL have the most cups, though.  24 is a long way from the second place Maple Leafs at 13."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah but the game has changed since the old days.  The Canadiens haven't figured that out yet."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well maybe with Claude Julien that will change. He always hired thugs for Boston."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Not this year, though. Too little, too late. Go Pens!"
