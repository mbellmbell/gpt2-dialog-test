"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you think was the best era for rap/hip hop music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'd probably have to say mid 90's."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, good choice."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yea. I feel like during that era was really a golden age for rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Totally. It's like rap was so new and amateur in the 80's, but during the 90's rappers were really perfecting and modernizing hip hop to what it is today."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yea, I think that probably some of the most influential rap artists came about in the 90's."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh for sure. Tupac, Biggie, Redman, Lauryn Hill, Snoop Dog and Nas to name a few."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yea, those artists totally paved the way for what hip hop is today."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They owe a lot to those 'forefathers' of hip hop."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's for sure. Such a good era...I wish I could go back and relive those days."
