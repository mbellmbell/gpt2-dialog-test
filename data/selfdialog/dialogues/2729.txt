"__MUSIC__ So, I was just listening to BabyMetal."
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ BabyMetal, it's a group from Japan.  It combines these three girls singing J-Pop with heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ That is... bizarre, but considering some of the stuff that comes out of Japan, not altogether unexpected."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but their music is pretty cool.  I mean, of course, I don't know what they're saying, but I get that with a lot of American music"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, especially Death Metal."
"__MUSIC__ Hahah!  But yeah, they're a pretty awesome group, you should check them out if you get a chance."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll look into it."
"__MUSIC__ Anyone good one to look up is Rob Dougan."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I think I've heard of him from somewhere..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he did this album Furious Angels and a lot of his pieces were featured in the Matrix movies."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds familiar..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, in the first film he did a piece called 'Clubbed To Death' which is done in that scene with the girl in the red dress."
"__MUSIC__ Red dress?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you know, when Morpheus is telling Neo how anyone still plugged into the Matrix can be taken over by an agent."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that scene, but I don't remember the song that was playing."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you should Youtube it, it's pretty awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Okay."
"__MUSIC__ Another good one he did was 'I'm not driving anymore', the instrumental appeared in the DVD menu on the second film.  Course, I prefer the original with the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Have to check it out."
