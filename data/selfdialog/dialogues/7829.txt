"__POP__ Sia or Adele?"
"__POP__ Who am I more in love with?"
"__POP__ No, who is the better singer-songwriter?"
"__POP__ Sia, for sure."
"__POP__ Why? Adele has so much soul"
"__POP__ Yes, but Sia has maturity. She's far older and more experienced."
"__POP__ Adele is writing about her live evolving, though."
"__POP__ Yes, but her style is so one-note. Plus she only knows two dynamics."
"__POP__ Which two?"
"__POP__ Piano and FORTISSIMO. There's no middleground. Sia is balanced."
