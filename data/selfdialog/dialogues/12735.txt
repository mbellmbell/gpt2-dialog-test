"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey what do you think the 49ers will do to get their franchise quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will stick it out with hotter and reassess next off season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any names you think will be in the conversation?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The obvious one is Kirk cousins because of his past with Kyle shanahan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else? Any college abs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sam darnold from USC is widely considered the best qb prospect for next years draft. And their will always be a couple new names that you will hear about come April."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Back to cousins, is that a real possibility in your opinion?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely. If he had it his way he would have been here back in march but the redskins are making things very difficult."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For starters they keep using the franchise tag on him not allowing him to find a new team. And if that's not bad enough they can't agree to a new deal and refuse to trade him. It's a mess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've also heard that Dan Snyder won't trade him to sf out of spite of the shannahans when they coached there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I heard the same thing and it wouldn't surprise me at all if he was that petty. Either pay him or let him walk or trade him!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My thoughts exactly. What are your expectations for Hoyer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not much honestly, but he did win like 7 games with the browns..THE BROWNS..of all teams so who knows. I think he can win us 4-5 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think cj beatherd is gonna make some noise in training camp and win the job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way. Hoyer knows the offense very well and was brought here for that reason he's the starter week 1 and his job to lose. If he gets injured  that's when you see beatherd"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Given his injury history it's almost guaranteed we see beatherd then!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It give you that. O line needs to step up keep Hoyer on his feet or we're done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One name to watch for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ RUEBEN FOSTER! He's a beast and will be D.R.O.Y. I can't believe we got him at the end of round 1. By the end of the season you will see a lot of foster jerseys around Levi's guaranteed!"
