"__MOVIES__ Hey. Any new movies coming out you're interested in?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm hearing great things about Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ That stars Gal Gadot, right? She looks like a great choice for the role."
"__MOVIES__ She does! Chris Pine is in the movie too; I love him."
"__MOVIES__ There's that kid's movie Captain Underpants coming out too."
"__MOVIES__ I remember reading the Captain Underpants books. The animation of the movie looks very stylish!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. It looks different from stuff you'd see from Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks. I hope it does well."
"__MOVIES__ Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales just came out recently too."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard OK things about it. I think I'm a little tired of the Pirate movies in general, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, hopefully this movie wraps things up and they move on to something else."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the previews for the new The Mummy movie? The one with Tom Cruise?"
"__MOVIES__ I have. I think it looks awful."
"__MOVIES__ I much prefer the 1932 version with Boris Karloff. Classic."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is the 1999 version with Brendan Fraser. Great movie with great comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. The sequels and prequels to that one got pretty bad, but the 1999 one is top notch."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new King Arthur movie?"
"__MOVIES__ King Arthur: Legend of the Sword? No; I've heard mixed things."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen it! I thought it was actually a lot better than I had been expecting."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really? Maybe I'll have to go see it."
"__MOVIES__ Charlie Hunnam plays Arthur, and he was a good choice, in my opinion. I think you'll enjoy it!"
