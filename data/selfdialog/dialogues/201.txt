"__MUSIC__ What are your go-to karaoke songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, we're renting a machine, and I want to make sure everyone has something they can sing."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Well, I like to sing Simon and Garfunkle. But that doesn't always make for great party music."
"__MUSIC__ Got a favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ The Sound of Silence."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. That might be a little strange for a karaoke night."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what's your go-to?"
"__MUSIC__ I like to sing Sweet Home Alabama."
"__MUSIC__ You are a Southern boy at heart."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. And it's the kind of thing everyone in the room can get really into."
"__MUSIC__ Well maybe I'll do Rolling Stones or Aerosmith then."
"__MUSIC__ I can make sure the machine has at least one option then."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really like to sing karaoke much, though."
"__MUSIC__ You don't?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I get stage fright."
"__MUSIC__ Well, why don't you sing Sweet Home Alabama with me then?"
"__MUSIC__ You sure?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. We'll just make it a duet!"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good!"
