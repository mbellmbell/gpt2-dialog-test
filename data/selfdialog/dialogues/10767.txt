"__FASHION__ My grandmother is 67, and she still cares about fashion."
"__FASHION__ Why not?"
"__FASHION__ I agree. She spends a half hour on her make-up, faithfully, though she's retired and doesn't go out much. And shops every season."
"__FASHION__ What does she wear?"
"__FASHION__ Coldwater Creek styles mostly. Nothing bare, nothing revealing, though. Soft, drapey clothes."
"__FASHION__ I like their clothes too. Sort of an arty feel."
"__FASHION__ Yes, she's pretty arty. And she believes certain colors and shapes flatter her, and is careful to choose them."
"__FASHION__ I should do that. I just grab what I need for whatever occasion, whatever's new and stylish."
"__FASHION__ She's pretty stylish, actually, in her own way."
"__FASHION__ I bet you wouldn't see her in Topshop or Modcloth."
"__FASHION__ Well no. But she appreciates that kind of thing though. She enjoys fashion in all its forms."
"__FASHION__ That's so sweet."
"__FASHION__ She's pretty sharp, actually. And she feels free to comment on other people's clothes, too."
"__FASHION__ She complements them."
"__FASHION__ Not always. She doesn't like underwear to show, for example, and she'll tell a grandchild so  directly."
"__FASHION__ You mean like bra straps."
"__FASHION__ Or boys' underwear that shows above their pants. That wasn't her idea of style!"
"__FASHION__ I think showing your underwear is out of fashion anyway."
"__FASHION__ Around her it always was."
"__FASHION__ I don't know. If it's summer, and you're wearing a pretty camisole..."
