"__STAR_WARS__ How do you think Kylo Ren and Rey are related?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I think it's obvious that they have some sort of connection. Maybe they're brother and sister."
"__STAR_WARS__ If they were, do you think that might soften Kylo's outlook a bit?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really... I mean look what he did to his own father!"
"__STAR_WARS__ You've got a good point there. I kind of feel like that symbolized the last of the good that was him leaving and him turning totally to the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm still wondering who this Snoke character actually is."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard a quote from the director that said he isn't any sort of sith or character we've seen before."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is that so? Well that's a bit disappointing. I kind of liked the fan theory that said he might be Grand Moff Tarkin."
"__STAR_WARS__ But didn't Moff get blown up with the death star?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean you never know man. In this universe, characters always some back."
