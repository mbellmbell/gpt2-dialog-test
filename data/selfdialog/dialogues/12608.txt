"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you watch the Fox pregame show?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I love it, Terri and Howie crack me up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wasn't Terry a quarter back for the Steelers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That he was, and Howie was a defensive end for the Oakland Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the rest of the cast, who did they used to play for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's see, Michael Strahan, defensive lineman for new york giants"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's right, it is really hard to remember who everyone played for"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ sure is, I now Jimmy Johnson was  coach for Cowboys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What kind of coach"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sorry, he was head coach for Cowboys from 1989 - 1993 and then went to Dolphins as head coach from 1996 - 1999"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I didn't know he went to Dolphins"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup he sure was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what did he do between 1993 and 1996?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't know"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what about Curt Menefee, what team did he play for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't believe he played for any team, I think he is just a sports broadcaster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OH okay, So I heard Brett Favre wants to come back in some way to the Packers. Obviously he is too old to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I heard that, maybe as a quarterback coach? I wonder if he would be any good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah just because you were a good quarterback, doesn't mean you would be a good coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got that right."
