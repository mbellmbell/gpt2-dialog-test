"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I just could never get into hip hop because I couldn't get past the sound itself."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you mean?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well it's like, not really music. It's a bunch of random sounds thrown together on a loop, I don't hear any skill in it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I feel differently about that. I feel like that just allows for the skill they do have to be focused more on the lyrics, the construction of them and such."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Then why don't they drop the background noise altogether?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well there is skill involved in creating a track besides just playing instruments, you know."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And where do they get all their samples anyway?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ James Brown, The Temptations, others.. I like hearing black artists represented, you don't see enough of that these days."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I still don't think I could get into it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well you don't have to, but you're missing out man."
