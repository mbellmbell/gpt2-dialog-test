"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe Dak Prescott supposedly doesn't provide real autographs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where did you hear that I think that's absurd?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was said on ESPN, Bleacherreport, and NFL.com so I would believe it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if ESPN told you to jump off a bridge would you believe it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No that's beside the point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So if he isn't using his real autograph then what is he using instead?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ESPN said that he's using a machine to do his autographs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well how did they find out this is true?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the grading workers were able to tell that his autograph did not look authentic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What???  I find that crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm wondering how this is going to effect Dak Prescotts image?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if it will actually make him look any different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yet Dak is a great quarterback and everyone makes mistakes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah maybe he was busy and just didn't have the time to sign all the autographs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah working under Jerry Jones probably would be a great challenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Jerry Jones probably keeps his workers pretty busy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm wondering how the card companies are going to fix this problem with Prescott?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alot of people who bought the card received autograph cards from Dak Prescott because they got redemptions in the pack of cards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know if I received an autograph that wasn't real I wouldn't be happy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that is pretty messed up."
