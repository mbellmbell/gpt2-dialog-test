"__MUSIC__ How long have you been playing guitar?"
"__MUSIC__ About four years. I started on my own,  I took a couple of classes later, now I'm practicing on my own again."
"__MUSIC__ Did you use a particular method of learning like watching videos or reading books?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to the bookstore and then to Guitar Center and browsed through several books and then I decided to buy two of them."
"__MUSIC__ So by the time you started taking classes you were a decent guitar player?"
"__MUSIC__ Hardly! Even though the beginning exercises looked easy in reality it takes a few weeks to go through them."
"__MUSIC__ Did you finish both books?"
"__MUSIC__ Not yet. One of them shows how to play the rhythm part of songs that use three cords at the most. That's the one I'm enjoying the most."
"__MUSIC__ How many chords do you know now?"
"__MUSIC__ I know all the major chords, which are the ones most of the books recommend you learn first. I also know a few minor chords."
"__MUSIC__ Are  any of the songs you play famous songs, something I would recognize?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I can play 'Bye bye love' by the Everly Brothers and 'Love me do' by the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know them."
"__MUSIC__ You don't know the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ No I mean I don't know that song, and I definitely don't know the Everly Brothers."
"__MUSIC__ You must know 'Hurts so good' by John Cougar."
"__MUSIC__ Uh, yes I know that one. It's been a long time since I heard it though. It looks like they're all old songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yes they're old, but the reason they're in the book is because they are easy to play."
"__MUSIC__ Can you play one those songs for me the next time I go to your house?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure."
