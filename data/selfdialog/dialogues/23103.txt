"__DISNEY__ Have you or your kids seen the Disney movie Finding Nemo?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure we have. Me and the kids watch it all the time."
"__DISNEY__ It's a classic in our house. We love to watch all our favorite characters."
"__DISNEY__ We do, too. Did you know that Ellen Degeneres was the voice of Dory?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I knew that. She did a great job didn't she. Dory was a great character."
"__DISNEY__ You know who was my favorite character? It was Crush the sea turtle."
"__DISNEY__ I know, right? He had like a cool surfer dude personality. I loved it."
"__DISNEY__ So did I. All the animation in the film was really neat. Especially when they showed the schools of fish."
"__DISNEY__ I think I'm going to buy the kids the sequel, Finding Dory. I'm sure they will love it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think it will probably do as well as the original Finding Nemo did."
