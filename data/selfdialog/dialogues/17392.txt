"__MOVIES__ What kinds of movies have you been in to lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I've been watching some foreign films."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Leon the Professional."
"__MOVIES__ Is that movie foreign?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it is, I think it's originally French or done by a French director."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't be able to tell you."
"__MOVIES__ You should see it, it's very well done."
"__MOVIES__ What's good about it?"
"__MOVIES__ The characters are really interesting, especially the main guy and the villain."
"__MOVIES__ What's the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a mercenary who is kind of lonely and doesn't know how to live well."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting, what else?"
"__MOVIES__ He meets this spunky little girl who's had a tough life and takes her in."
"__MOVIES__ That's an interesting idea."
"__MOVIES__ It's very interesting, though there's some controversial stuff that happens between them."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the girl thinks she's in love with the mercenary, who is much older than her."
"__MOVIES__ That's very strange, especially for a more modern movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's more of a movie about their mental age, but it's pretty respectful at least of what would be inappropriate."
