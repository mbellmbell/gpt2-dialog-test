"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the movie 'Beetlejuice'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  That was one of my favorites growing up."
"__MOVIES__ It was awesome.  Have you seen it lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I watch it every couple of years when I think of it."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't watched it in a while.  I need to find my DVD."
"__MOVIES__ If you can't find it, I'm sure I can find mine somewhere."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ Gosh, it was all so good!"
"__MOVIES__ I know.  The dinner scene was awesome though, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course.  Who can hear the Banana Boat song without thinking of that scene?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly!  I liked the miniature town in the attic too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was cool.  As a kid, I always wanted one of those."
"__MOVIES__ Did the guy's character make that, or was it in the house when they bought it?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember.  I think it was already there though."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear they were making a sequel or something?"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that, but I don't know how much of it is true."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they would."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the movie is great.  I wouldn't want a sequel to ruin it."
