"__POP__ What do you think of the new stuff by Lady Gaga?"
"__POP__ I do not like the sort of added country feel to some of the songs."
"__POP__ The one about the mirror you mean?"
"__POP__ Yes, it was not pop enough for her. She is a pop star not a country one."
"__POP__ I like the change of pace of her stuff."
"__POP__ It may be a change, but I like her older stuff."
"__POP__ What is her best song in your opinion?"
"__POP__ I would have to say Poker Face."
"__POP__ Good dance song, I do not think it is her best."
"__POP__ I like that is had meaning, but was also just there, all pop and all happy."
