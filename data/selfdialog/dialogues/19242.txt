"__MOVIES__ I'm going to a movie this afternoon."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure yet. I usually like to see independent films."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too."
"__MOVIES__ The blockbuster ones seem to all be special effects and fighting and no real story anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I used to see a lot of movies, but I don't go so much anymore for that same reason."
"__MOVIES__ I've noticed the same thing lately. It's like they've run out of ideas."
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha. Yes, it seems all they release lately are sequels to older movies."
"__MOVIES__ It gets old after a while. Have you seen any good independent type films this year?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I liked Norman a lot."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that. Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Richard Gere."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I love him. What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It was about a man who is all about connections and doing favors for people so that he can get favors back."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of like Kramer from Seinfeld?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, except he lied a lot to keep up this fake front of being successful, but he was basically homeless."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting."
"__MOVIES__ It was interesting since the movie really developed the character."
"__MOVIES__ I love movies like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, a lot better than the typical superhero movie."
