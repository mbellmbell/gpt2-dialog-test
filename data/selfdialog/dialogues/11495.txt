"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be the best NFL running back this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ezekiel Elliott will be the best running back for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, he is too young and inexperienced, maybe in a few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may be young, but I think even though he is young he still has a lot of talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are just saying that because you went to Ohio State and are loyal to their football players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, I am loyal, but I honestly think that he is one of the best out there. His abilities are second to none."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Leâ€™Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, he has the most average yards per carry, but he doesn't have the skills that Elliott has. Plus he's been injured recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What skills does Elliott have that are so impressive?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ezekiel Elliott is fast, no one can catch him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it takes more than that, you have to be strong, and have experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Elliott is also very quick, have you seen how he can navigate through a tiny opening right down the middle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has a good team backing him up, so it is not all of his ability."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eliott can jump over players, even when they are standing up. That is all his own ability."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will admit that he has some incredible ups, but jumping alone won't do it, this isn't basketball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but it makes him exciting to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't win football games just by being exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not, but the crowd loves it, and the energy helps them to win, so maybe it helps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well we'll just have to see, my money is on Bell, you keep rooting for your Buckeye guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will, and my guy will jump right over your guy for the win."
