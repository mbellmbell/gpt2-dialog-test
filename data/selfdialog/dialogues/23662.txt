"__DISNEY__ What should we do tonight?"
"__DISNEY__ Hey, let's watch Tangled!"
"__DISNEY__ Tangled, Tangled... that's the Disney Rapunzel movie, right?"
"__DISNEY__ I mean, yes, sort of? But it's a lot more than that. There's a handsome rogue, a heroic horse. An evil witch."
"__DISNEY__ You're describing every Disney movie ever made."
"__DISNEY__ No, this one is different. It's funny and clever, and there's some amazing stuff about healthy parental relationships."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, so the main character isn't an orphan? Maybe this ISN'T a typical Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Don't be a jerk. These things are stereotypes because they have emotional resonance. Anyway, I'm telling you, especially with your relationship with your mom, you'd like this movie a lot."
"__DISNEY__ Yeesh. I trust you, I guess. Let's watch Tangled."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! You're going to love it."
