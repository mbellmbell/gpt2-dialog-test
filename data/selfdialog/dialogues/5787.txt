"__STAR_WARS__ Was the original Star Wars called A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not at first, but later on yes."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean he added it after he released it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. It originally was just Star Wars"
"__STAR_WARS__ I prefer that actually"
"__STAR_WARS__ Many people do"
"__STAR_WARS__ When did he rename it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think before the second one came out. But, I'm not sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if there are many other things he changed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, where do I start?"
