"__MUSIC__ If you were stuck on a desert island with a stereo and only one music album to listen to, what would it be?"
"__MUSIC__ Would I get unlimited batteries for the stereo?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's say yes. You can listen all you want, but only to one album."
"__MUSIC__ Then I'd take Kanye West's College Dropout."
"__MUSIC__ That's a really good pop album. But I'm not sure it's the best choice here."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure it's rich enough musically."
"__MUSIC__ The songs have pretty disparate sounds to them. Think about 'Slow Jams' vs. 'Jesus Walks'."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I agree there's some variation. But in the end, it's all the same kinds of Soul beats."
"__MUSIC__ OK, if Kanye isn't the best pick, what would you take?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd take Animals, by Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ Yuck, no thanks. 20 minute guitar solos and weird lyrics about sadness."
"__MUSIC__ I could mischaracterize Kanye's music simiarly. Cmon, admit that Pink Floyd is good."
"__MUSIC__ Pink Floyd made good music that I have no interest in listening to."
"__MUSIC__ Your loss. You want to talk about complex music, talk about Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ Boring and sad, though. If I'm stuck on a desert island, I need something with more pep to it."
"__MUSIC__ Eh, I think you'd be better off with some ruminative, deep music to get lost within."
"__MUSIC__ Kanye explores some fairly deep concepts on College Dropout."
"__MUSIC__ Deep is a relative term, then, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ You might want to give College Dropout another try."
