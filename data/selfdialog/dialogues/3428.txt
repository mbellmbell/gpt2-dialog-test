"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any good music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, actually I just got spotify, so I've been listening to a lot of new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I've been thinking about getting it, so what have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't stop listening to the new Kendrick Lamar album."
"__MUSIC__ I've only heard one song, I think it was called Humble, is the rest of the CD good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man!  Humble is probably my favorite but DNA is a close second."
"__MUSIC__ I'm definitely going to have to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah you are, I think spotify has a free trial if you want to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I will, I think I'm just going to check it out on Youtube after we're done talking though."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, but back to Kendrick, I can't stop listening to the album!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think it's as good as his last album?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, that one was one of my favorite albums of all time, but this one is catching up to it."
"__MUSIC__ Man, I know how much you love his last one, so now you've got me excited to listen to this one."
"__MUSIC__ I highly recommend it, he has a song on there with Rihanna too that's really good."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I've never been a huge Rihanna fan, but I guess I'll give it a shot."
"__MUSIC__ It's not one of the best songs ever, but it's still good."
"__MUSIC__ Anyone else collaborate on it with him?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he did a song with U2, but I'm not a huge fan of it.  You just have to listen to the whole album."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, you've convinced me, I'm gonna go check it out.  Thanks man!"
"__MUSIC__ No problem, let me know what you think!"
