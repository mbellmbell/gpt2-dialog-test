"__BASEBALL__ Hey you see the Cubs at the Reds the other night?"
"__BASEBALL__ I didn't, but I can imagine how that one turned out..."
"__BASEBALL__ 7-5 Cubs baby! What it is that you like about Cincinatti again?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well it's not their starting pitchers, that's for sure"
"__BASEBALL__ Joey Votto still drawing the big bucks?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but is he turning out the numbers?"
"__BASEBALL__ Eleven homers so far this year, not the worst."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but I'd like to see more.  Cozart on the other hand..."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, there you go.  Batting what like .400 these days?"
"__BASEBALL__ Eh, more like .350.  But I got no complaints."
"__BASEBALL__ So what do you like best about the team?"
"__BASEBALL__ The bullpen, these days.  Those guys are all that's saving that pitching staff"
"__BASEBALL__ Like who are you thinking of?"
"__BASEBALL__ Iglesias, Brice, Peralta.  Those guys can hold a close game if they're given the chance"
"__BASEBALL__ But starting wise?"
"__BASEBALL__ They can't keep an ERA under 4.0.  Which is no way to win games"
"__BASEBALL__ Arroyo?"
"__BASEBALL__ He gets the strikeouts, but if you give a hitter a piece of that slow moving train..."
"__BASEBALL__ Its outta the park."
"__BASEBALL__ That's what I'm sayin.  Forget the Reds, I don't wanna get bummed out here. You wanna go get a beer?"
