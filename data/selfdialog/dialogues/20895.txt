"__THRILLER__ Did you see Heat?"
"__THRILLER__ You mean with Al Pacino and Robert Dinero?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, that's the one."
"__THRILLER__ I saw it. That was a good movie."
"__THRILLER__ They say it's a drama but I think it's a thriller because of the bank robbery plots and the plot to catch the crew."
"__THRILLER__ I would call it a thriller as well."
"__THRILLER__ Did you know that Dinero and Pacino did not film the movie together?"
"__THRILLER__ What are you talking about?"
"__THRILLER__ They were never on the set at the same time. Every scene together one is facing another, never side by side or touching."
"__THRILLER__ I think I do remember hearing something like that. It's still a good movie though."
