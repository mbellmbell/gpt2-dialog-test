"__MUSIC__ Schonberg devised a method for composing called 12 tone method."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a school of thought from the 20s led by Schonberg. Basically they used all 12 notes on the chromatic scale without any preference of one single note"
"__MUSIC__ That's so bizarre."
"__MUSIC__ And every difficult to do. It's easy just playing all 12 notes. But which one do you play to make it musical?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I'm asking you! How do they do it?"
"__MUSIC__ if all the notes in the chromatic scales are played equally, you can ensure not being in any key. Thus you're officially atonal"
"__MUSIC__ That seems like cheating."
"__MUSIC__ Not really, because it is really difficult to make music doing it"
"__MUSIC__ it can't just all be random trial and error."
"__MUSIC__ They have certain ways to arrange the notes, like using serialism"
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Serialism is where you do things in series or serially. Liek arrange the note lengths from the whole note as 1, then a half note as 2, a dotted quyarter as 3 and move down in lengths like that"
"__MUSIC__ Can the note lengths go up?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course as long as it's done serially."
"__MUSIC__ So as long as some things are in a series it's serialism"
"__MUSIC__ Um yes. The way schonberg did it is to used a thematic element that recurrs."
"__MUSIC__ Why repeat?"
"__MUSIC__ Even the atonal music has structure. Music is a rule. A symmetry,, howver disorganized the individual parts are, is still symmetric"
"__MUSIC__ And the atonal music has a symmetry?"
