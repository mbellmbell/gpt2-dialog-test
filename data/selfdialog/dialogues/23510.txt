"__DISNEY__ Have you heard that the Incredibles 2 is coming out next year?"
"__DISNEY__ I did not, I wonder what they are planning to do.  Do you think they will have the characters age?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure, many of the Disney movies do have characters that seem to progress in life, but the Incredibles already was at a good age for all the characters."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder how older Jak will look and act!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too.  I really liked his animated short 'Jak Attack' with the babysitter."
"__DISNEY__ That was definitely one of my favorites too."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe they will age him, but get a famous actor to do the voiceover."
"__DISNEY__ That would be a good opportunity to do that."
"__DISNEY__ I personally really like the villains in movies like this."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, the movie really only does well if you have a good antagonist!"
