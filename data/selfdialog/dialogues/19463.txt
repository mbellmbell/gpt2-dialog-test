"__MOVIES__ What is your very favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked Green Card the best of anything ever. Have you seen it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I wasn't that impressed by it. What did you find so impressive?"
"__MOVIES__ When I went to see it, I almost walked out after the first 10 minutes.  It seemed so banal. Andie MacDowell was very shallow at first."
"__MOVIES__ So why did you stay? What happened?"
"__MOVIES__ There was a scene with Depardieu pretending to carry 'parcels' and he called her 'cherie' in a tone of voice that took my breath away."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I remember the 'parcels.' Weren't they trying to convince someone that they had a real relationship?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. It's an old movie and I don't remember everything. But the music was wonderful."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Good old Hans Zimmer. He has done so many great scores."
"__MOVIES__ It was actually a deep movie. There was this deep seriousness overlaid with comedy. The music, I would say was seriously beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't there a lot of reference to wildness?  The jungle, the greenhouse, even Central Park. The penthouse trees and how much they were valued by the well to do people at the party."
"__MOVIES__ The jungle theme was in the music as well, subtly. Remember Depardieu was supposed to have just returned from safari."
"__MOVIES__ And there was the night scene where Bronte hears drums."
"__MOVIES__ Beautiful stuff. It's true. Peter Weir was the director so you know this had to be serious art."
"__MOVIES__ The thing that really got me about this movie was the ending. When Andie realizes that she loves him and she goes to the cafe to wait for him. When she sees him she runs out and into his arms. This stunned me."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  It was just an ordinary romance, I thought"
"__MOVIES__ No. This was so much more. And right after that, he has to get in the police car."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. That was seriously sad. Wasn't there a beautiful gospel song in the background?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Beyond beautiful. A cappella, as I recall , and piercing. And you don't know if they will ever meet again. I walked around in a daze for 2 hours after I left the theater."
"__MOVIES__ What a great experience for you. Those things don't happen often."
