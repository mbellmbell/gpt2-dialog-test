"__MOVIES__ Do you like science fiction films?"
"__MOVIES__ Very much! I have a collection of them at home, from the 40s onward to the present day."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you love them so much?"
"__MOVIES__ Science fiction in general is a great mechanism to comment on human nature. I learned to see the world from a different perspective when I started reading sci-fi."
"__MOVIES__ Do sci-fi movies do the same thing for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure. Take for example the Planet of the Apes films - the original series that started in the 60s, those are the ones I mean."
"__MOVIES__ I remember Charlton Heston in the first one - 'It's a madhouse! A madhouse!'"
"__MOVIES__ I think using intelligent apes to comment on humanity was brilliant. With sci fi, you have license to say anything."
"__MOVIES__ What are some of your favorite sci-fi films?"
"__MOVIES__ Of the Alien franchise, I liked the second one, Aliens, the best, hands down."
"__MOVIES__ James Cameron did a good job with that one. Great cast and story, lots of wonderful action."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's one of Sigourney Weaver's best movies."
"__MOVIES__ What about more modern sci fi? How about Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing the trailer for that one before it was released, and I was so underwhelmed. I had no desire to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you change your mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, my husband wanted to see it, so I was like, Ohhh kaaay, I'll give it 15 minutes, then I'm outta there."
"__MOVIES__ Was it as bad as you expected, or better?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually enjoyed it very much. The wisecracking transgenic raccoon was my favorite character, I think."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that goes to show how important a good trailer is."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Or a significant other who makes you watch a movie, ha."
