"__MUSIC__ I'm thinking of making a mixtape to listen to as I exercise."
"__MUSIC__ Good plan - Music makes exercise less boring and tedious."
"__MUSIC__ Got any recommendations for songs to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. One song that always gets me fired up when working out is 'No Handlebars' by Flobots."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you played me that song once. Yeah, I could see that being good."
"__MUSIC__ Another one that gets me going is 'Sleepyhead', by Passion Pit."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not familar with the song, or the artist."
"__MUSIC__ It's kind of Electronica music, I think. The song has this massive chorus that's really good."
"__MUSIC__ OK, sounds good. I want to put a really good song at the end, sort of a reward for finishing the workout."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Etta James, 'At Last'?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, that might work. But I was thinking of something a little more modern."
"__MUSIC__ I was just kidding. Do you like Pharell?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's alright."
"__MUSIC__ He used to be in a band called N.E.R.D. There's a song they did, 'She Wants to Move'."
"__MUSIC__ Not one I'm familiar with. It's a candidate for the mix tape?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd definitely suggest it. It's a favorite of mine."
"__MUSIC__ But do you think it would fit an exercise mix tape?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. I would suggest it for the last song, even."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's got a joyous energy to it, and it will give you that last little spark of energy to finish the workout."
