"__MOVIES__ What are the worst Marvel movies to you?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they're all overdone to some extreme.  Give me a specific character."
"__MOVIES__ Sure.  What do you think of Iron Man?"
"__MOVIES__ Hate Iron Man.  Hate all of the films really."
"__MOVIES__ Hate or dislike?"
"__MOVIES__ Both I guess. The first one was tolerable, but the last two were awful."
"__MOVIES__ And why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ Because Iron Man is completely unlikable.  He's a rich jerk who never learns anything."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you have me there.  He doesn't really have much character building."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  The Marvel universe doesn't seem interested in changing him."
"__MOVIES__ What made the first movie different from the rest?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one was kind of the start of the new Marvel movies so it was unique."
"__MOVIES__ They were kind of feeling their way into the universe."
"__MOVIES__ It was a good origin story.  I like the whole desert part."
"__MOVIES__ Where he was held hostage and eventually got out?"
"__MOVIES__ Right.  It was a solid setup and origin story."
"__MOVIES__ So what was different about the last two movies?"
"__MOVIES__ He was no longer a sympathetic character.  He was rude to everyone."
"__MOVIES__ Including his assistant.  Pepper I think her name was."
"__MOVIES__ Correct.  He gave her crap all the time and it wasn't welcome hence why the last few movies were garbage."
