"__MUSIC__ Did you see Miley Cyrus on Jimmy Fallon the other night?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I did. What did you think of the new singles she performed?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought they were really good. What did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I agree. It's interesting how much her sound has evolved over the years"
"__MUSIC__ For real. I'm excited for her new album."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Judging by the singles I've heard so far, her new music feels a lot more authentic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think that's true. She seems to be returning more to her authentic self lately."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really like how she's been so dismissive and critical of rap and hip hop in her interviews lately though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, just because it wasn't the right genre for her to perform in doesn't mean the genre itself is a problem."
"__MUSIC__ Totally. There are a lot of really talented artists in hip hop and rap right now."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what the critical reception will be for Miley's new album."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine it'll be pretty good judging by what she's released so far."
"__MUSIC__ How do you think her album will do commercially?"
"__MUSIC__ It might not produce quite as many hits as her albums previously have but I bet it'll sell alright."
"__MUSIC__ She definitely has produced quite a lot of hits in her time."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously! I still get 'Party in the U.S.A.' stuck in my head from time to time."
"__MUSIC__ That was such a fun song! I hope her new album still has some of that pop sensibility to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I hope so too."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know when the album is set to be released?"
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea but I think we still have a few months of waiting left."
