"__MUSIC__ What do you listen to when you work out?"
"__MUSIC__ That depends! I always listen to something when I run, but it changes with how far I'm running."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ For my long runs I tend to listen to podcasts, but I listen to some interesting music for my track workouts."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting, eh? What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely music people don't expect me to listen to - a lot of EDM, hip hop, rap, sometimes metal and punk too."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, yeah, I can picture you listening to metal and punk, but not EDM, hip hop or rap. Do you have any favorite artists?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I've been listening to a lot of Tyga when I run."
"__MUSIC__ That's so interesting! I like his song Switch Lanes."
"__MUSIC__ I listen to that all the time when I run! I've also been listening to some EDM like Darude."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, like Sandstorm? That's such a great dance song."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! I could dance all night to it, and it's long too, so it gets me through some tough track sessions."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I'll bet! Do you know the song Tsunami?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's by DVBBS and Borgeous right?"
"__MUSIC__ That's the one! I bet that gets you pumped for a workout too."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely! Sometimes I'll stick that song in between podcasts when I'm on a long run to sort of wake myself up and get a jolt of speed."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds awesome. I bet you would like Steve Aoki if you don't listen to him already."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I saw a documentary on him recently, but I haven't actually listened to his music! What would you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ You should definitely check out his 2014-2015 albums Neon Future I and II. You'll probably really like them for workouts."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! I'll definitely check them out."
