"__MUSIC__ What do you consider the best genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really know, that's a tough one to narrow down them all to just one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but if you only could pick one what would you choose?"
"__MUSIC__ I would probably do 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Why? Such a weird time."
"__MUSIC__ It's such a fun time you mean."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I guess so. I would prefer the 90's."
"__MUSIC__ How can you go wrong with Queen and Michael Jackson?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, just not my cup of tea."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. So many one hit wonders in the 80's too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess you're right. But the 90's had gangster rap, boy bands, and amazing R&B."
"__MUSIC__ True that, Boyz II Men, All 4 One, Shai, amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, best decade of music for me, I'd never get tired of 90's."
"__MUSIC__ There was a lot more to choose from."
"__MUSIC__ Crazy that most of those songs are 'oldies' now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, we're getting old but I can't ever get enough of the sound."
"__MUSIC__ Something about analog versus digital, you just can't replicate it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not so sure, I'm okay with it. I can't really tell the difference."
"__MUSIC__ It is nice that you can have thousands of CDs in one iPhone."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that is true."
