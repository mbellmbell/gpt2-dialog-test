"__MUSIC__ Do you like any of the artists that have made it big because of music talent shows?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. There are some who are really good?"
"__MUSIC__ But most don't really do much after the show is over."
"__MUSIC__ Well, for some that might be true, but Carrie Underwood and Kelly Clarkson both started with American Idol."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I do like both of them. Is there anyone else even worth listening to though?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think so. I really like Kelly Pickler and Chris Daughtry."
"__MUSIC__ They didn't win though."
"__MUSIC__ No, they didn't, but they still got their start on the show."
"__MUSIC__ I wish the winners of the Voice would do more."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I think that Jordan Smith and Alisan Porter have extraordinary talent."
"__MUSIC__ I think so too. Jordan singing Chandelier by Sia was jaw-dropping."
"__MUSIC__ It was definitely a surprise. He has shifted more into the Gospel genre I think."
"__MUSIC__ I think he has his roots in Gospel so that wouldn't surprise me."
"__MUSIC__ Taking on a Sia song is no joke. She has quite the power and voice herself."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I don't think I've heard anything she sings that isn't impressive."
"__MUSIC__ I do think that some of her more recent songs, like The Greatest, don't show off her talent as much."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that. But it is really hard to top Chandelier."
"__MUSIC__ True. That was such a powerful song with a huge range."
"__MUSIC__ I'd be interested to see some of the American Idol or Voice stars that on that."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm sure at least some of them would do it justice!"
