"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, who do you think will meet in the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this is the Raider's year to finally breakthrough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't see how to Patriots lose in the playoffs as long as Brady is their quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree he is a special player, but the Raiders are just too young and talented. This is their year to breakthrough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In terms of the NFC, I think the Cowboys are a team that can make a deep playoff run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like watching the Cowboys play, but they are just a little young for me to get behind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, their prime may be a few years out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Packers will end up winning the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is not a bad choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers is my primary motivation for that pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So then, who wins a Packers/Raiders Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to put money on it, I would say the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you. Aaron Rodgers is too talented to lose on that stage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also has experience that a lot of Raiders don't have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you're right. That is crucial in games like the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now that the Super Bowl is settled, what teams do you think will take a big step forward?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Panthers will rebound from last year and have a great year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely have all the tools and pieces needed to rebound."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am looking forward to this year to see who all can challenge the Raiders and the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So am I. This should be an exciting year to be an NFL fan."
