"__MOVIES__ I finally watched 10 Cloverfield lane!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness yes! It was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I loved it so much. I've seen it like 5 times."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really cool how it was kind of like a horror movie inside another horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean."
"__MOVIES__ You know how it was telling the story of the girl's abduction but outside the world had been taken over by aliens?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ I thought John Goodman was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was weird to see him play an evil character."
"__MOVIES__ I know I always think of him as the dad from Roseanne."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of like when the dad from Malcolm in the Middle played Walter White."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's weird, but he did a great job."
"__MOVIES__ What's the name of the actress that plays the girl in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The one who plays Michelle?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah her."
"__MOVIES__ I think her name is Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She was in the Die Hard Movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I knew I recognized her from somewhere. I just couldn't place her."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she's been in a lot of horror movies too."
