"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite Fast and the Furious movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, that's a tough one.  How many have they made now?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the one that came out earlier in the spring was number eight."
"__MOVIES__ Can't believe there's been that many now."
"__MOVIES__ So going back to my question, what's your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I would probably say Fast Five.  I thought that was the best setup to moving the series to be one not dependent on street racing."
"__MOVIES__ I get that.  It was definitely a great example of a heist movie."
"__MOVIES__ It also had the best villain of the series."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't agree with that.  He was good, but not better than some of the other ones."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the ending?"
"__MOVIES__ Where they were going through the streets with the bank vault?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep - pretty crazy, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely nuts.  Not exactly realistic, but awesome to see."
"__MOVIES__ There's no way those cars could drag that heavy thing like a ragdoll."
"__MOVIES__ The series isn't exactly known for being realistic though."
"__MOVIES__ True.  They all should have died about 50 times by now."
"__MOVIES__ They could have just ended the series on that high note, don't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they all had riches, were basically free of the authorities likely finding them."
"__MOVIES__ In the end, it made too much money so they had to make more."
"__MOVIES__ Which I'm fine with.  Why change what's working?"
