"__STAR_WARS__ What character did you identify with more, Han or Luke?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely Han"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I feel the same way too"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he was more of a man's man"
"__STAR_WARS__ And Luke was a pretty boy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No i just dont think he was relatable"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah Han was a better person"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish he was the star of the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ We would say the same thing I am sure"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like reverse our feelings? I agree, Luke was not a character we could fully embrace"
