"__STAR_WARS__ Do Wookies and Ewoks come from the same evolutionary background?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have no idea. They are both furry and can speak. They're both intelligent creatures."
"__STAR_WARS__ If you shrunk a wookie and made him a little pudgy, he'd look just like an ewok."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I guess you're right."
"__STAR_WARS__ They both live up in the trees don't they?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, they share that characteristic."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do wookies worship all things golden like ewoks?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think so. They are definitely smarter creatures."
"__STAR_WARS__ They are both mild tempered in most ways and can be a little vicious."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right, I bet they do share the same origins."
