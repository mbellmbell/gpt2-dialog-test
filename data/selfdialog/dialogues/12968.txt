"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons are definitely making it back to the Super Bowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think so? I don't know if they did enough in the offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dontari Poe and Takkarist McKinley are enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think that's enough to beat the Patriots? They added a lot more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady's not playing a full season. He won't make it past the Falcons week seven."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons D-line is good, but I don't know, man. Sounds like wishful thinking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all. They will break Brady, and I will laugh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even so, the Pats still have Jimmy Garoppolo. He can ball out, and he's young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then they'll break him too. You're not going to reason me out of this."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't reason a man out of what he wasn't reasoned into, said, uh, somebody."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah. Think the Cowboys will be back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, who are they losing? One D-line guy got suspended, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Zeke Elliot might miss some weeks on suspension."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did he do? I missed that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he beat up his girlfriend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lot of that going around! Someone needs to get punished bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, until someone really loses their livelihood, it won't change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they have enough. Severe O-line issues, and their secondary is suspect."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they addressed a lot of that in free agency and the draft. We'll see, I guess."
