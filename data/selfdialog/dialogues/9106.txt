"__BASEBALL__ What is your favorite baseball club?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Boston Red Sox, what is your favorite?"
"__BASEBALL__ I love the Red Sox too! Who is your favorite player on the team?"
"__BASEBALL__ Pedroia, he's been so loyal to the team and he's hard not to love as a player, how about you?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm a former college pitcher, so I'd go with Price."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, but he's really struggled in the playoffs in his career."
"__BASEBALL__ I think that's mostly just statistical variance, baseball has so much randomness and chance in it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I feel like ESPN and other sports publications try to make narratives and stories whether they exist or not."
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely, Price is a very skilled pitcher, and those skills will translate into playoff wins if he's given chances."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think the Sox have what it takes to go all the way this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Haha, it's hard to say no. They were one of the favorites in the pre-season."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I wonder if their relative youth will make a big playoff run harder."
"__BASEBALL__ Hopefully the guys with experience like my boy Pedroia will show them how it's done and be strong leaders."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it's hard to underestimate the value of guys like that in the locker room."
"__BASEBALL__ What about Xander Bogaerts?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh man, he is awesome. I love watching him play."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he really shows why the Red Sox have been so successful in the past 15 years."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, after so many issues for 70+ years, the front office and scouting teams really have stepped up their game!"
"__BASEBALL__ Well here's to the Sox winning it all this year!"
"__BASEBALL__ Hear hear! I hope Price will be the World Series MVP!"
