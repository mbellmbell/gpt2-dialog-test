"__SUPERHERO__ Can we talk about Will smith as deadshot in suicide squad?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Sure, I thought this was an interesting move for smith, not to be the starring role."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ya, I think he was just so wanting to be a superhero in some movie, or maybe he really loved the script and role. But I did not care for it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I didn't love him in this role either. Hard to admit because I have loved him for years."
"__SUPERHERO__ I feel lately he has come across badly on screen and off."
"__SUPERHERO__ how so exactly?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well recall the whole boycott of the oscars?... I feel this was him throwing a tantrum for not getting a nomination,"
"__SUPERHERO__ I can see that. I myself thought oscars are given to films they cannot control what films are being made that past year to award."
"__SUPERHERO__ Exactly, Smith could not  just accept that his performance was not deserving... certainly not in suicide squad either."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think moonlight winning goes to show it is not an academy issue with race, I think it is more what films are being made in general. They are more than ready to award a good performance from anyone."
