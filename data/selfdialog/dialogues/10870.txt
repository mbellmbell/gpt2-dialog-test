"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think was the better Packers Quarterback Brett Favre or Aaron Rogers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd take Favre for the longevity and being an Iron Man."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was prone to throw many interceptions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he always made the game interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And he does have Super Bowl victories."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think Rogers is a better quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His accuracy is deadly and he has mobility too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I would take Rogers if they both played at the same time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Farve is the Iron Man but Rogers in just unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Having Rogers on the team turns that team into a different team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When he gets hurt they usually miss the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But when he is in they always go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to get him more help on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, with defense this becomes a Super Bowl team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they are always in it as long as they have Rogers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Rogers alone keeps them very competitive and in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately they often have bad defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it just hasn't been a priority."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well teams do what they can with the salary cap and Rogers demands the big bucks."
