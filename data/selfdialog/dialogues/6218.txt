"__STAR_WARS__ No he didn't."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Death Star was being rebuilt."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but it was full of bad guys."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way they have that many storm troopers that are master builders, building the Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ They had to have a few."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Empire had to call in every contractor in the galaxy for something that big and Luke killed them."
