"__MUSIC__ You're a big Lady Antebellum fan, aren't you?"
"__MUSIC__ I am, why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ I just heard their new-ish song, 'You Look Good' and I thought of you."
"__MUSIC__ It's a fun song, isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Makes me want to take the boat out and soak up the sun!"
"__MUSIC__ It's the perfect summer song."
"__MUSIC__ What other country songs would you recommend for Summer 2017?"

"__MUSIC__ Nothing since last August. But I think you can play 'Summerland' a few more times this year."
"__MUSIC__ Most country music is so silly--beer, girls, dirt roads, and church. But that's what summer calls for."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. I don't want to be thinking too deeply when I'm at the Outer Banks for the week."
"__MUSIC__ There are so many great Carolina songs for that mood!"
"__MUSIC__ Eric Church's 'Carolina'?"
"__MUSIC__ Or 'Feels like Carolina' by Parmalee?"
"__MUSIC__ One hit wonder, but also a good song."
"__MUSIC__ What's your number one summer country song of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ It's gotta be 'Toes' by Zac Brown Band. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Barefoot Blue Jean Summer' by Jake Owen, no question!"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's time to go to the beach and blast some country tunes!"
