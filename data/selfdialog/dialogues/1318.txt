"__MUSIC__ There should be a place where we can learn new music and listen before we buy."
"__MUSIC__ Why would we need to be in a place? We can do that from our phones."
"__MUSIC__ How is that the same thing? I mean people being together learning about new sounds."
"__MUSIC__ You mean you wish record shops were still a place to go? You want to flip through albums?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'm too old to know where this goes on. There might be kids doing it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they share music with each other. They listen to the same radio stations."
"__MUSIC__ I meant a common ground to be fed music and enjoy it like a good steak."
"__MUSIC__ You want to go to a jukebox diner? I'll give you all of my quarters."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know what I mean exactly, but I guess MTV showed us new music all at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but those artists went through a lot to finally be shown on MTV. But I guess I understand more."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if anyone else feels that's missing? How can I share music, if I'm not an artist?"
"__MUSIC__ You can have a YouTube channel and showcase songs you'd like to share with others."
"__MUSIC__ That is an excellent idea. But how will I find new music? Who will share with me?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess you could ask viewers for music suggestions. That would be a start."
"__MUSIC__ Would you be the first person to suggest some good music?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. Let's see. I'd suggest Solange's last album."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome. Do you have a song you'd suggest first? I've always liked her."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say 'Cranes In The Sky' is my favorite. She's a talented songwriter."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's for the first insert. I will definitely listen. She's deep."
"__MUSIC__ She is. She's a Cancer, you know. She did it her way. Proud of her work."
