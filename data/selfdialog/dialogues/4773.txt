"__MUSIC__ You know who I loved when I was younger?"
"__MUSIC__ Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Madonna!  I don't ever hear about her anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I used to love her too.  She was my idol back then."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too!  I had every album."
"__MUSIC__ Remember the Immaculate Collection?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course!  And they would have Madonnathons on MTv."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I would always tape those."
"__MUSIC__ Me too!  I also had all her movies."
"__MUSIC__ She was great.  Some of her later music got a little weird."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Justify My Love, Music, things like that.  It got a little electronic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I remember that.  I still liked it though."
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was allright it just wasn't as good as her original pop stuff."
"__MUSIC__ No, it really wasn't.  I wonder how old she is now."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, she's gotta be pretty old.  We were listening to her back in the eighties."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, true.  What was your all time favorite song of hers?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Get Into the Groove.  What was yours?"
"__MUSIC__ That's really hard to say.  Maybe Cherish?"
"__MUSIC__ I loved that song, too."
