"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Which Fast and the Furious did you think had the best car chases or races?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think the original The Fast and The Furious had the best. It was actually a racing movie with a heist background."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's true, the original had I think three actual races. The first street race at night, the desert race battles, and then there was that race with the Ferrari guy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That guy had one of the best lines in the series, 'More than you can afford pal, Ferrari.'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Then Dom tells Brian to smoke him in that legendary orange Toyota Supra."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ If you go back to watch the original The Fast and The Furious, you'd be surprise at how many great one liners you'll be able to recite."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Nobody comes here for the tuna! I kind of miss those early characters, Vince and Jesse."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well Vince made a return and redeemed himself later in the series which was cool, but Jesse died! He got shot up at the end remember?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's right how could I forget about Jesse's unfortunate murder."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They need to keep the core characters that are there now, people need Dom obviously, but now you can't take away the Rock from us."
