"__MOVIES__ Kurt Russell? As in Snake Plisskin, Wyatt Earp Kurt Russell?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and alongside him is Pulp Fiction, Snakes on a Plane Samuel L. Jackson."
"__MOVIES__ So what is his character like?"
"__MOVIES__ Whose character? Jackson's or Russell's?"
"__MOVIES__ Russell's, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Well, in this movie, he's a bounty hunter."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, wait! Tarantino made another movie about Bounty Hunting!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but this one is a far cry from Django Unchained."
"__MOVIES__ Samuel L Jackson isn't a head house slave, I take it."
"__MOVIES__ No, the movie is set not long after the Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so is he hunting for a bounty in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, this time Russell's character is taking a bounty in to be hanged."
"__MOVIES__ What about Jackson? Where does he fit in?"
"__MOVIES__ He's also a bounty hunter, but he just kills his bounties, so he's more hauling them back."
"__MOVIES__ You're not spoiling something that we're supposed to discover mid-film, are you?"
"__MOVIES__ No, for a Tarantino movie, this one follows a surprising chronological order."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so this is established at the beginning, I take it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Now, they each have sort of quirks."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what's Jackson's main 'quirk?'"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Jackson's character has this letter that he says Lincoln wrote him."
