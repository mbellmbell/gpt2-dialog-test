"__HORROR__ Is Crimson Peak a horror movie or something else?"
"__HORROR__ That depends. I think it is classified as horror, but it is also a kind of gothic drama."
"__HORROR__ Guillermo del Toro's movies always creep me out. Is Crimson Peak like his others?"
"__HORROR__ Yes. Beautiful and stylistic, with insane practical effects. The special effects makeup for the ghosts is incredible."
"__HORROR__ Also it has Tom Hiddleston, who played Loki in the Avengers. How is he in the movie?"
"__HORROR__ He's all right. He isn't the main character, but if you like him, there is a lot of him."
"__HORROR__ One thing I love about Guillermo del Toro is even his darkest movies are hopeful."
"__HORROR__ That is what makes me unsure if Crimson Peak is horror. It is atmospheric, and tense sometimes, but never truly horrific."
"__HORROR__ What about the ghosts?"
"__HORROR__ They are definitely spooky!"
