"__DISNEY__ Did you know that in Frozen there's an Easter egg where you can see Rapunzel and Flynn?"
"__DISNEY__ Really? When?"
"__DISNEY__ During Elsa's coronation. You only see them for a moment and it's mostly the back of their heads."
"__DISNEY__ That's so crazy. I wonder how they're related."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, there's other Easter eggs and theories about Frozen too."
"__DISNEY__ Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Well one of the theories is that Elsa and Anna's parents were shipwrecked and basically became part of the Tarzan storyline."
"__DISNEY__ Like they were Tarzan's parents?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeap."
"__DISNEY__ That's so crazy! But I guess it would make sense."
