"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Patriots will repeat as Super Bowls winners this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As a Patriots fan, I'd like to think so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But in your unbiased opinion?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we will have to see. They play some good teams this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they don't have that hard of a schedule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their strength of schedule is twelfth, but that doesn't really mean much before the season starts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair, but who are they playing that you are worried about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Worried may not be the right word. Apprehensive though; the Chiefs, Texans, Falcons, Broncos, and Steelers for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. Texans still don't have their quarterback situation figured out. Maybe the Falcons only because they have something to prove."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. And the Steelers game is away and it isn't easy to play in Pittsburgh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As much as I hate to admit it, I just don't see anyone in the league who will be able to touch them this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Once we get to post season though, I imagine we will face the Raiders and they will be tough this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's right. They got Marshawn Lynch didn't they."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And I can't imagine they will throw the ball on the one yard line if they can run it with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That couldn't be a reference to Super Bowl 49 could it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think? It should be a good year all around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I'm excited for it. I think the Eagles may be able to step it up this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe for the first four or five games just to give their fans some hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then go back to being the Eagles and crush all hope for the remainder of the season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly! August just needs to get here."
