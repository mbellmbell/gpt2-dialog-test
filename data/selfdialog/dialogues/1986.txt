"__MUSIC__ What musical has the best soundtrack of all time, would you say?"
"__MUSIC__ Les Miserables, hands down!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that was a quick answer."
"__MUSIC__ I just really like the music. Both lyrically and the melodies behind it."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song from it?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, that's a tough thing to try to answer. There are so many great ones."
"__MUSIC__ I have always been fond of 'On my Own'."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think for a lot of people that's their favorite."
"__MUSIC__ But not you?"
"__MUSIC__ For a while it was, but I kind of moved on. It got a bit overplayed."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's sad when that happens to music you like a lot. You end up ruining it by listening to too much of it."
"__MUSIC__ I think maybe my favorite song is 'Empty Chairs and Empty Tables'."
"__MUSIC__ That song is so sad!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's not a cheerful song. But it's very beautiful, and I can relate to the sentiment."
"__MUSIC__ What is the sentiment."
"__MUSIC__ It's a person who is alive mourning those who have died and wondering why he is alive while they are not."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty morbid."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. But again, I can relate to it."
"__MUSIC__ I prrefer happier music, generally."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but for some reason that song really works for me."
