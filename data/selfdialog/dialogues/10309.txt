"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I honestly feel like Eminem is a walking symbol of drama."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why do you say that?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's always writing about how much he loves his daughters, but goes off to abuse his wife and take sleeping pills."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are you aware that he's been sober for a long time now?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What? When did that happen?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He has a song called 'Not Afraid' where he tells all of his fans how thankful he is for them, and tells them that he vows to break that dangerous lifestyle."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow. That's admirable."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You're probably thinking about his earlier work."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Maybe. I'm just so used to him being profane and lambasting his wife and mother."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's all part of his 'Slim Shady' persona."
