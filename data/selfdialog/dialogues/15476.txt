"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm going to be watching all of the Harry Potter movies at my place today."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? That sounds fun."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Did you want to join me? It's going to be pretty laid back."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sounds great, thanks!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which movie is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really like The Half Blood Prince as far as the books go, but The Prisoner of Azkaban has to be my favorite movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, wow, cool. My favorite movie is definitely The Goblet of Fire, but I think the book is absolutely better than the movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, for sure. They left out so many details in the movies that would have been awesome to include."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really hope that someday they make the books into a television show and put in all the details."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'd watch that for sure!"
