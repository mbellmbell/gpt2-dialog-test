"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe the Patriots won another Superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know- I'm so tired of them. I'm not a big fan of sports dynasties."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Tom Brady is too old to be an elite quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If it was anyone else, I would say yes. But Tom Brady is super human."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Though I really don't like him or Belichek"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I like the underdog- I wish Matt Ryan won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan is a really under-rated quarterback. I think he will be good in the years to come."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Tony Romo? Do you think he still has a chance in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may, if his age and injuries don't get in the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of people outside of Dallas don't like him, but his stats don't lie. He is an elite quarterback as well"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed- he was- but I think he is too old. What team would pick him up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe a team that has a young quaterback draft pick that needs a veteran presence for a couple years?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea that could be a lot of teams this upcoming year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it would be weird to see Tony Romo in another jersey besides the Cowboys though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true- I felt the same way when McNabb left the eagles for the redskins- so weird"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or how about when Bret Farve left Green Bay for Minnosota?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yea- that was weird too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear about that Oakland Raiders QB that is trying for a comeback at 48?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 48? That is WAY to old to play professional football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed"
