"__MOVIES__ Have you seen all of the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! My husband and I actually watched all of them recently."
"__MOVIES__ Which one did you like the most?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the first one. It had all the original characters in it."
"__MOVIES__ I think you're right, I especially like that one."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen the most recent one yet, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ No but I have been meaning to."
"__MOVIES__ I think it may be sad though since Paul Walker's death."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I'm not sure if it will be good since he won't be in it."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but I do love Vin Diesel as an actor so maybe it will be okay."
"__MOVIES__ I sure hope it will be. I will still give it a chance."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that the story line though was not that great."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that too. Maybe people are just getting tired of so many of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ I think you could be right. It should still be given a chance though."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Most of the original characters are still there."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and I do like some of the newer characters, like Tyrese and Ludacris."
"__MOVIES__ I do too! They are part of the story now."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and fit in well with the team."
"__MOVIES__ When did the most recent Fast and Furious come out?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was maybe this year."
