"__DISNEY__ What's the most unusual place you've ever seen a Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ For me, that's easy. At DisneyWorld."
"__DISNEY__ What movie did you see at DisneyWorld?"
"__DISNEY__ 'The Lion King.'"
"__DISNEY__ Was this in the park, or what?"
"__DISNEY__ No, at the hotel. We were staying in a Disney hotel and they had a small cafeteria area and there was a big screen TV in there and they were just starting Lion King when I got there. Sat there and watched the whole thing."
"__DISNEY__ That's kind of cool."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it was. It's one of my better stories about Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ Got another one?"
"__DISNEY__ Honestly, no. Guess it's my only story."
