"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, what's you favorite Star Wars scene?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well. mine would have to be the fight over the Sarlacc pit in Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, that's a good one, my favorite part is is when R2 zapps Salacious Crumb."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, because he was eating 3PO's eyes."
"__STAR_WARS__ And my next favorite part is when Han Solo accidently activated Boba Fett's jetpack."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and he falls into the Sarlacc Pit and it belches after it swallows him."
"__STAR_WARS__ But of course, we can't forget Princess Leia and the golden bikini."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course not, that's the ultimate in nerd fan service."
"__STAR_WARS__ Though, Carrie FIsher managed to make the look kind of tough, when she strangles Jabba."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, old Jabba should have kept a closer eye on her."
