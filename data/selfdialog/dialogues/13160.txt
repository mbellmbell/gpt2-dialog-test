"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, are you a fan of the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. I love watching football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a Vikings fan. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I watch the Seahawks mostly. Do you think the Vikings are going to win this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I kind of doubt it. Our quarterback is injured."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His knee got hurt two years ago and he is still recovering from surgery."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is crazy. Those guys really do take a ton of abuse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true. So many talented players have shorter careers because of injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the NFL needs to do a better job protecting players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure you can. Football is a very physical sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree. Who did you think is the best rookie this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He got drafted later, but I really like Leonard Fournette out of LSU."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I watched him play. He is a really physical running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. He reminds me of Reggie Bush."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is Reggie Bush still playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe? Last I checked, he played for the Lions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Amazing how a guy can be that good and then gone in a few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you never know who will last and who won't."
