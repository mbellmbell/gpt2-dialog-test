"__DISNEY__ I know, when they were lost in the lawn that was scary"
"__DISNEY__ I thought they would never get bigger again"
"__DISNEY__ same here, he was always making things"
"__DISNEY__ well the Dad was an inventor, that is what they do!"
"__DISNEY__ that is true , remember that cookie they found and ate pieces of?"
"__DISNEY__ wasn't there a part when they also ate the icing or filing"
"__DISNEY__ I think so, I bet that was good!"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe if we were smaller food would last longer"
"__DISNEY__ that is an interesting thought, being smaller so we have more food and eat less but it seems like more !"
