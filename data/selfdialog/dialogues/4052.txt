"__MUSIC__ You will never guess who I am listening to these days?"
"__MUSIC__ No idea who?"
"__MUSIC__ Nirvana...I started with Teen Spirit and then had to watch all the documentaries on Curt Cobain."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, those are pretty good. He was a genius in his way."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the music just speaks to me. I know everyone says that about the music of the their time."
"__MUSIC__ Look at the Beatles. I hate them. With their sing song music....they were not that great."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed! Give me Queen any day any hour!"
"__MUSIC__ Now, that's some music. So much depth and creativity. We are the Champions, We will Rock You, not to mention the soundtrack to the Higlander!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! And Fat Bottomed Girls...who else could get away with that! It probably made people who had no interest in opera think twice."
"__MUSIC__ Freddie Mercury's voice was incredible. I could only imagine what he could do today."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Another great lost. Still not a fan when Niravana was big. I am now."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny you're so late to the game."
"__MUSIC__ I know that's me! I went through a summer listening to the Byrds and bunch of 70's bands in the late 80's."
"__MUSIC__ There's some good stuff in there. I like it too. It's all ballad-y and chill."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I just go through these phases of music. I also like this group called Hammock."
"__MUSIC__ What do they do?"
"__MUSIC__ Hammock is a two member ambient-rock band from Nashville. I kid you not there is description for that."
"__MUSIC__ There are so many sub-groups to describe bands and their music. That's a new one on me."
"__MUSIC__ These guys are really good. Kind of mellow when you want something in the background."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good to me I'll have to see if I can find them."
