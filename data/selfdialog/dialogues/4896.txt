"__MUSIC__ So, what David Bowie albums do you think are the best?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a difficult question because his discography has no real obvious high point."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, well, let's go chronologically, starting with the first best one."
"__MUSIC__ Well, a lot of people like 'Hunky Dory,' which has these sort of charming and whimsical pop songs on it, released in 1971."
"__MUSIC__ What about when the Bowie we think of today really emerged, or came into being?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, 'The Man Who Sold the World' actually came out the previous year, but it's a much harder rock album with sci-fi themes."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like Bowie was getting into the Ziggy Stardust character with that one..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Bowie embodied the Ziggy Stardust character on the album of that name, and 'Aladdin Sane,' both of which have awesome guitar work by Mick Ronson."
"__MUSIC__ Then Bowie went and did a 180 and put out a soul album, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the 1974 'Young Americans,' which I'm not overly fond of aside from the title track."
"__MUSIC__ And I heard there is something called the Berlin Trilogy -- what is that?"
"__MUSIC__ A series of three albums -- 'Low,' 'Heroes,' and 'Lodger' -- that Bowie recorded with Brian Eno between 1977 and 1979."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard a lot about those albums; do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they would be my favorite of Bowie's because they mix pop music, electronic instrumentation, ambient soundscapes, and other cool things very creatively."
"__MUSIC__ So when do we get that '80s Bowie that I remember seeing on MTV as a child?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be circa 'Let's Dance,' which came out in 1983. A lot of people think his career kind of tanked by that point, but I find it very enjoyable."
"__MUSIC__ But I know Bowie himself has said he's kind of embarrassed of his 1980s attempt to be a big pop star in the MTV/New Romantic era."
"__MUSIC__ Well, for someone who made such difficult art, to suddenly take a swing towards accessibility maybe felt like a step backwards."
"__MUSIC__ So which one is your favorite, out of them all?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to go with 'Low,' from 1977, because it's so well-crafted and immersive."
