"__BEATLES__ So who is your favorite Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ I'd say Paul is."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I think I'm with you there.  John made some good songs but Paul is a genius."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, Sgt. Pepper was pretty much all his idea.  John knew the vibe of what Paul was going for and made some good ones too though."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah that's true.  Really though, George Martin played a huge part in all that as well."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, his work in the studio was unbelievable."
"__BEATLES__ I don't think the Beatles could have made it to where they got without Martin.  That guy knew some serious tricks."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah it was crazy.  I'm sure what Brian Wilson did with Pet Sounds gave them a lot of ideas as well.  I think that's why Paul wanted to do Sgt. Pepper in the first place."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah I do believe that's right.  Pet Sounds in phenomenal as well but I think Sgt. Pepper is still better."
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles really did everything better.  They were just musical geniuses."
