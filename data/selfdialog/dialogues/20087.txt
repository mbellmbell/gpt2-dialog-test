"__MOVIES__ Did you see the reboot of the Mummy?"
"__MOVIES__ Tom Cruse's new movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that one. The start of the Dark universe."
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't. Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Overall?.....No. It was not good at all."
"__MOVIES__ What was wrong with it?"
"__MOVIES__ The story itself was very weak. Poorly developed."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What about the acting?"
"__MOVIES__ Tom Cruse except for a few movies is the same in everything he does. No different here. Russell Crow though was as good as always."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know he was in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. And I wish they would have focused more on him. I think the other movies if they ever get done will have more of him."
"__MOVIES__ What about the effects? Trailers made those look pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Some were. Some weren't. There was nothing that really blowed me away. It is stuff you have basically seen before."
"__MOVIES__ What about the Mummy?"
"__MOVIES__ She looked pretty cool and I like the actress who played her. But like Crow I felt they didn't use her enough."
"__MOVIES__ Wow for a movie called the Mummy you think they would have."
"__MOVIES__ And maybe they did. They just didn't do it right. There were moments."
"__MOVIES__ So should I see it or not?"
"__MOVIES__ If you really want to see it on the big screen then go ahead but catch a cheap showing. Otherwise wait."
"__MOVIES__ Cool! Thanks."
