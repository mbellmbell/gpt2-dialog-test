"__STAR_WARS__ How old were you when you first started watching Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't see the first one until two years ago."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow! I've been watching then over and over again since I was 6 years old."
"__STAR_WARS__ My boyfriend is a real Star Wars geek. He's been educating me on the movies lately."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I know he's having fun with that. You know they've been running a marathon on TNT."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes that's how we've been watching them. We don't actually own any of them yet."
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved Revenge of the Sith. That's my favorite of the first three episodes."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's mine too. I loved watching Anakin Skywalker's evolution."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hayden Christensen did an excellent job I think, embodying Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. Natalie Portman did an awersome job as well."
