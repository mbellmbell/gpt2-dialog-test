"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So where do you find the hip hop artists you listen to?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well it depends. The first PE song I heard was in a movie."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which one?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The movie was something with Adam Sandler. The song was Give it Up."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And you liked it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I thought it wasn't bad, so I wanted to check out their other stuff. If I'd never seen that movie I still might not know who they are today."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Awesome! And from there?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ From there I see who they've been affiliated with. I've also discovered new artists just by doing a vague youtube search."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Find any good ones that way?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I've found a handful, two of which have become some of my favourites. Terawrizt and Trigger."
