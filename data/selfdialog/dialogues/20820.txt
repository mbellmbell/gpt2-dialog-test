"__THRILLER__ Hey! I'm really keen to see a thriller movie this week. Is anything playing that you'd recommend?"
"__THRILLER__ Hm, well I absolutely loved Atomic Blonde, with Charlize Theron. Have you seen that yet?"
"__THRILLER__ No, I haven't! Why'd you like it so much? What's it about?"
"__THRILLER__ Theron plays a character called Agent Lorraine Broughton, a British spy during the Cold War. The movie is set just before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and Agent Broughton has to team up with a German agent to take on a threat to Western Intelligence."
"__THRILLER__ Sounds really cool, though I'm not much of a history buff. Do you think I'd still enjoy it even if I don't know much about the Cold War?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, definitely. I mean, it's an intelligent movie, based on the graphic novel  The Coldest City, but it's entertainment, not a documentary."
"__THRILLER__ Excellent. Sounds good, and I do love Charlize Theron. Anyone else in the movie who I'd recognize?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes! James McAvoy is in it, playing one David Percival, and he's absolutely excellent. Do you like him?"
"__THRILLER__ Are you kidding? I LOVE James McAvoy. Okay, I'm sold, I'm going to get a ticket and check this out. Cold War spy thriller, here I come!"
"__THRILLER__ Excellent, I hope you enjoy it - let me know! Who knows, you might just wind up a bit more of a history buff, too!"
