"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you like better, R2D2 or C3PO?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know if that is a fair comparison.  I mean, R2D2 never speaks English."
"__STAR_WARS__ But he's so cute!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, by never speaking English, he can't be as annoying at C3PO."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think C3PO is annoying?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he's pompous.  I don't even care when they take him apart."
"__STAR_WARS__ The only thing I don't like is how he doesn't know who Luke is in the first movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that just shows it wasn't well planned."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also don't like how they don't explain what happened to his arm in the new movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I read that was just to show that time had passed."
