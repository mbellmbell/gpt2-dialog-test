"__POP__ Let's talk about pop music. Who is your favorite pop group?"
"__POP__ I used to really like One Direction, but they haven't been the same since Zayn Malik left the group?"
"__POP__ I know. I like the music that Zayn has done as a solo artist, but I can't remember anything from One Direction lately that has been good."
"__POP__ Same thing with Fifth Harmony. I think Camila Cabello leaving has destroyed the group."
"__POP__ It's weird for them to still be called Fifth Harmony with only four people in the group. Did you hear their latest song?"
"__POP__ No, I haven't heard it. What is it called?"
"__POP__ It's called Down and it has a feature by Gucci Mane. You should look it up. It is a great dance record."
"__POP__ I have been hearing Camila Cabello's song almost non-stop. I'm glad she proved she can be successful on her own."
"__POP__ I think it is hard for pop artists to get along in a group. All the good groups break up."
"__POP__ I think for girl groups it is especially hard because they all have diva attitudes, and everyone wants to be the star. It's sad because I really liked their music."
