"__MOVIES__ oh really and you never say mate lol"
"__MOVIES__ oh well wanted to do it as a couple reason why i never told you."
"__MOVIES__ oh well understandable, so how was the movie, worth it?"
"__MOVIES__ mate its worth every bit is about a story of a homeless man (jackman) acting as a guardian angel for a very rich professor who never treat hugh (jackman) nicely."
"__MOVIES__ hmm that sound like so intriguing movie"
"__MOVIES__ it is don't let me spoil the fun by narrating it,i think you should rather see it."
