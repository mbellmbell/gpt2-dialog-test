"__MUSIC__ Just listening to my favorite classical."
"__MUSIC__ It's not my genre, but okay."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I know, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but really it's genius and the roots of a lot of modern music."
"__MUSIC__ So what's this?"
"__MUSIC__ Handel's Water Music. It's been my fave for years - I can pretty much whistle the whole album."
"__MUSIC__ It is pretty catchy and happy."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I love all the composers who wrote mostly major-note, happy music"
"__MUSIC__ Who else did stuff like that?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not expert, but Haydn is another one - Mozart, Bach and Beethoven all have uplifting pieces I like."
"__MUSIC__ Name some and I will listen to some YouTube videos."
"__MUSIC__ Beethoven Ode to Joy, Bach Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, anything by Haydn."
"__MUSIC__ And Handel? What besudes Water Music?"
"__MUSIC__ The Royal Fireworks are great too and often in the same recording as Water Music."
"__MUSIC__ When you say 'same recording?'"
"__MUSIC__ Classical works are multi-part affairs. Just Google Handel St. Martin in the Fields and you will get both works. Great orchestra."
"__MUSIC__ How do you know so much about this stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Mmom sent me to summer music school for guitar and I took a Composers class. Dad tortured me with it as a child."
"__MUSIC__ And now you love it?"
"__MUSIC__ Just like Brussels Sprouts and coffee - two great things you hate as a kid and love as an adult. hehe"
"__MUSIC__ I'll take Handel you take the Brussels Sprouts. hahaha"
