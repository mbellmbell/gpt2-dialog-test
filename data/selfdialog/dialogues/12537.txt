"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many NFL teams have not won a Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are thirteen actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't realize it was that many!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. The Browns, Lions, Texans, and Jaguars have never even been to a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do they still have fans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. But what is worse is that the Bills and Vikings have been there four times and never won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch. Yes, I definitely think that is worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, so that is six of them. What about the others?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The others are the Titans, Chargers, Eagles, Bengals, Panthers, Falcons, and Cardinals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm surprised the Cardinals haven't ever won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've had a few good years, but never sealed the deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons were close last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it. That may be the most heartbreaking loss!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. I wouldn't want to be one of the two who went to four and never won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's even worse for Buffalo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They went four years in a row and lost them all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ouch! Was the the early '90s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. '91-'94. They lost to Dallas twice, Washington, and the Giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFC East can be a bear!"
