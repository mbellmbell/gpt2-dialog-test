"__STAR_WARS__ I think A New Hope might not be quite as good as Empire, but it's top three and definite more important."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed all the way.  Star Wars changed the way we see movies forever."
"__STAR_WARS__ A New Hope also had the second best story line, maybe Rougue One could give it a run for it's money.  But it's a long shot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, Especially when you look to old copies when Han shot first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Totally important.  It changes the character a little.   Now he has a little more goodness he didn't have and his turn around isn't has exciting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han has always been one of my favorites."
"__STAR_WARS__ Him and Chewy, the ultimate bromance.  I love those guys."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I was sad when he died.  But when I heard Chewy cry it almost made me cry.  They've been together so long."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what will happen to Chewy now?  He's one of those long time characters that just means so much."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm looking forward to seeing how they met in the Han Solo movie."
