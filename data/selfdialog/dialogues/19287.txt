"__MOVIES__ Did you finally see the Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightly?"
"__MOVIES__ I did. I ddin't like it as much as I thought I would."
"__MOVIES__ I think you need to watch it again as crazy as that sounds. It's better if you have seen in more than once?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I had trouble following the characters and the mom was annoying."
"__MOVIES__ I used to think she was annoying also, but after seeing it a few times I think she was just doing what she thought was best for her daughters."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm... I guess that makes since. I did like the love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that is one of my favorite parts. I think it's actually the main theme of the movie that people may not be as they seem at first."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting. So maybe the whole movie isn't how it appears at first?"
"__MOVIES__ That was exactly my thought. I didn't really like the movie the first time either, but now that I have seen it a few times I love it."
"__MOVIES__ Well maybe I will watch it again then."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and keep in mind what I said about the mother. I mean even Mr. Darcy seems nicer when you realize he is just protective."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and like with what Mr. Bingley thinks that Jane doesn't really like him."
"__MOVIES__ Yes but she does and she is just too shy to say anything."
"__MOVIES__ Ya that's a good point. Elizabeth is kind of the same as Mr. Darcy but we know why she is acting the way she does."
"__MOVIES__ Ya that's another good point about the movie. I think one of my favorite things is how much depth each character has."
"__MOVIES__ Ya and it took a few years for the whole story to take place I think."
"__MOVIES__ Ya I think you are right. Can you imagine having feelings for someone but then you can't see them again for a few months and you can't even call on a phone?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that would be rough."
"__MOVIES__ Well maybe I will watch the movie again then."
"__MOVIES__ yes please do and tell me what you think the second time."
