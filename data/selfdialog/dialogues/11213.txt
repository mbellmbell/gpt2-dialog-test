"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I certainly miss the old coach post game meltdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. They made for good entertainment. Seems like a coach hasn't melted down for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. The last big one was the Dennis Green meltdown and that was nearly a decade ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bears are who we thought they were. Oh, that was grand."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It definitely was. Sorry to see Dennis Green pass away. Guy was really a good guy who will always be remembered by that meltdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, unfortunate. He seemed like a good man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody was better than Jim Mora."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jim Mora was the king of the meltdown. I miss him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Coaches don't have diddly poo on Jim Mora in terms of postgame interviews."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely don't. Everyone always think the Playoff one was the best, but I'm more of a diddly poo fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy ripped his players, coaching staff, and threw everyone including himself under the bus in that rant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He said, 'we sucked'. You never hear a coach say that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guy was definitely honest. He was a good coach and will always be overshadowed by his rants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good to be remembered by something, I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not as brutally honest as that coach for the Buccaneers back in the 1970's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who was that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ John McKay. A reporter asked about his teams execution and he said he was all for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, no way. That's crazy and hilarious at the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Buccaneers were historically bad back in the 1970's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were bad."
