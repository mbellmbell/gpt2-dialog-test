"__MOVIES__ So did you see Logan yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet but the trailer looked awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ It was!  It was easily the best Wolverine movie so far..."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it had a dark tone like the Batman Begins movies did...It's gritty and emotional..."
"__MOVIES__ Dang - that does sound good.  Why was it emotional?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't want to give anything away but it's said to the last Wolverine movie..."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, don't spoil it!"
"__MOVIES__ I won't.  I will say that the action sequences were incredible as well!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, you're really making me want to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ You should!  I'm not sure if it's still playing at the movies though."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I might have missed my chance on that one."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it's still playing at IMAX?  I would check online."
"__MOVIES__ OK, I'll check it out when we get off the phone.  Would you go with me if it's still playing?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely!  I would have no problem seeing it again."
"__MOVIES__ OK, cool!  Maybe I'll watch some interviews with the cast online."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good idea.  There's an insightful interview with Hugh Jackman about it but I forget where it was at..."
"__MOVIES__ No problem - I'll just do some surfing!"
"__MOVIES__ Alright, glad you're excited about it!  Just let me know if you want to go!"
"__MOVIES__ I will!  Thanks man!"
