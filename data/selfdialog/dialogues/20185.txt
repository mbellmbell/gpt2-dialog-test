"__MOVIES__ Did you see Beauty and Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ The live action film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It was just released on video."
"__MOVIES__ No. I saw the original cartoon version."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it in theaters and I loved it. Emma Watson played a great Belle."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the Cinderella remake and I wasn't too impressed."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. But Beauty and the Beast is much better."
"__MOVIES__ Is it still a musical?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. And the songs are some of my favorite scenes."
"__MOVIES__ The tavern scene with Gaston in the cartoon was so funny."
"__MOVIES__ You should really see this one then. Gaston and Lefou were cast perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ What about the Be Our Guest song? Was that in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. The whole movie stayed pretty true to the original."
"__MOVIES__ That's good to hear. I hate when remakes take a classic movie and ruin it."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. So are you gonna check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I hope you like it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. But even if I don't I'm sure my daughter will."
"__MOVIES__ True, my daughter even liked the new Cinderella. Girls love princesses!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes they do!"
