"__MOVIES__ What was the last mongol movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ You've watched it. Why are you asking me?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember, it was so boring. I think I felt asleep on my couch"
"__MOVIES__ You 'think' you felt asleep?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think it's pretty safe to say you've fallen asleep during the movie. That explains why you don't remember the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I said! So what was that about. i want to remake that but with more blood, more head chopping, more mutilation."
"__MOVIES__ Well now, ain't that just lovely."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, smart ass. i remember it was more like about his development as a person which is kinda weird. Why would you make a movie about the greatest land empire ever, and focus on one dude?"
"__MOVIES__ Um. The greatest land empire IS the reason they focused on that one DUDE, because he IS the guy who did it."
"__MOVIES__ But I mean why not focus more on his mad intentions, his evil plans, his pension for violence, and genocide. Victims need to be heard"
"__MOVIES__ Victims? What are they victims of? History?"
"__MOVIES__ Um hello. Are we victims of Hitler? Are millions of people victims of World war 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, fine. 'victims' it is."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, so an epic film about the victims of the greatest land empire the mankind has every known!"
"__MOVIES__ Funded by whom?"
"__MOVIES__ The wall st."
"__MOVIES__ How are you getting this money?"
"__MOVIES__ By convincing them they will make money! Gah, why are you being stupid?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not being stupid. I;'m just inquiring about the plans, the details, the actual funding amount etc."
