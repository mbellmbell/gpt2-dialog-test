"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What a crazy off-season its been in the AFC East!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! As usual the patriots got stronger and the Jets didn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The patriots did have some great signings and trades, but you can't deny that Tom Brady is getting old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, he's over 40 but he had one of his best season's last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But no quarterback has ever done this well at his age, he's due for regression."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still disagree - he's got the best coach in the game that knows how to call plays to ensure he's not getting hit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was impressed with them getting Brandin Cooks - great trade!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's going to be amazing with Brady - finally the weapon that Brady needs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Dwayne allen will do well in this offense too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that seems like a underappreciated trade."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Jets - do you think they'll improve on last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! They are a mess - and they don't have a starting caliber quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't think Petty or Heckenberg can have a decent season? I think the defense will be strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No - neither of them is an NFL starting quarterback. They drafted well though - they're going to have two great safeties in Adams and Maye."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah - they're going to be great in a few years, the issue is the jets got weaker at Cornerback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed - they should have signed someone reliable other than Claiborne - he's good but injured too often."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if Claiborne has a good season - the secondary will be a strength of the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget the defensive line - thats the real strength."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true - but Mo Wilkerson needs to have a bounce back season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure he will - and Leonard Williams is a beast who will only get better!"
