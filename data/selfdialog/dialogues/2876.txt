"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you ever listen to Jazz music? I just started to and I'm amazed I like it,"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I'm not such a fan. It feels like old people music."
"__MUSIC__ No, it's not.  There is really a lot going on in it."
"__MUSIC__ Is it like what the guy in the movie La La Land was talking about when he was trying to explain jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! That is exactly what I'm talking about. It can be complex but also amazingly melodic."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I haven't really thought about it like that. Maybe we could go to a Jazz concert and decide if we do like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm not sure about that.  A concert could be a little long if we hate it."
"__MUSIC__ You may be right. That might be a little to much for an intro education."
"__MUSIC__ How about I buy a couple of CD's of jazz that are a contemporary Jazz style and one that is more a Blues style."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. We can listen to them and see which style we really prefer."
"__MUSIC__ I have to say I think I'm going to lean to the more Contemporary side. I heard Mindi Abair play the saxophone and I was so impressed."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I'd say the saxophone and the trombone are my favorite instruments for this type of music."
"__MUSIC__ I heard on the radio this kid play the trombone and then the piano and I was blown away."
"__MUSIC__ I agree I like that but when it goes back and forth sometimes and they riff off of each other it gets a little boring for me."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I am not a real traditional jazz fan but maybe if we educate ourselves we can appreciate the music more."
"__MUSIC__ It could be interesting.  I really however am a country western music fan so this could be difficult."
"__MUSIC__ Yuk. I hate country western music. It is so hokey with ridiculous lyrics and stories."
"__MUSIC__ But that is the whole point. Country music is telling a story. Sometimes, the stories are sad and a little ridiculous."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds so twangy. I think I'll keep my music lessons to the jazz right now.  Since, I'm a rock fan I think I can only take it one step at a time."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. I'm with you. We will just start with the jazz. Maybe, we could go to a jazz club and see what we think."
