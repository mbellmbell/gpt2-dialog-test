"__MOVIES__ Have you noticed all of the remakes of older movies lately."
"__MOVIES__ I  have, I wonder if they are doing a good job on them."
"__MOVIES__ Well, take for example IT, I watched that many years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that movie scared the crap out of me."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if they will do justice to the original."
"__MOVIES__ I doubt it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I bet they rely on a bunch of cheesy special effects."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that what most of them do these days."
"__MOVIES__ If they aren't making remakes, they are making movies about television series."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like Baywatch, with the Rock."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, and Zach Efron."
"__MOVIES__ That really looks like it is going to be terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I won't be wasting my money on that."
"__MOVIES__ Who thinks this kind of movie is a good idea?"
"__MOVIES__ That's Hollywood for you, all about the money."
"__MOVIES__ True, but it got terrible reviews from critics, how do you make any money turning out junk."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we both know that Hollywood makes money on junk everyday."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they do."
"__MOVIES__ Even movies that fail in the USA still makes tons of money world wide."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there is no accounting for taste with some people."
