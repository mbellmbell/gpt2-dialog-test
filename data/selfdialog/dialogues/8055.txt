"__POP__ Whose music do you like better, Katy Perry or Taylor Swift?"
"__POP__ Personally I'd have to say Katy Perry. Although I do like quite a few of Taylor Swift's songs."
"__POP__ Yea I feel like I'm too old to be super into Taylor Swift. Her music is more for like young teens."
"__POP__ Yea, it's harder to relate to her songs when you're not like 22 years old."
"__POP__ Katy Perry I feel like is more relatable though, even though a lot of her songs aren't like super meaningful or deep."
"__POP__ Yea, but they're just like really fun pop songs, they don't necessarily have to be super inspiring or deep."
"__POP__ True, I guess it's more important for them to be catchy and easy for people to sing along to."
"__POP__ Exactly. Like her songs California Gurls and Teenage Dream."
"__POP__ Yea, even my boyfriend knows the lyrics to those songs."
"__POP__ Haha! Well just goes to show how catchy they are."
