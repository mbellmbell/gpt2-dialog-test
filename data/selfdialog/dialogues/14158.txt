"__HORROR__ So, is Psycho the first slasher movie?"
"__HORROR__ Basically, yeah. There were other things in the next couple decades, but the next heir apparent was probably Halloween -- which, coincidentally, stars Janet Leigh's daughter."
"__HORROR__ Oh, yeah. Halloween."
"__HORROR__ Then, you know, Friday the 13th is a shameless rip-off. Mask-wearing unstoppable zombie man on a spooky-sounding day, hunting not babysitters but camp councilors."
"__HORROR__ Hey... that's... I hadn't thought of that before."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, then Wes Craven sorta did a satire in Nightmare on Elm Street... then again, a decade later, with Scream."
"__HORROR__ Those are satire? I mean, I guess Scream obviously is, but Nightmare?"
"__HORROR__ The first one, sure -- though the later ones didn't quite get the joke, aside from Robert Englund being a huge pot of overcooked ham."
"__HORROR__ Now that you mention it, there was New Nightmare -- which... wasn't a satire, I guess, exactly, but it was... meta."
"__HORROR__ Exactly. That's pretty much all Wes Craven does... er, I mean did."
