"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you believe you have a spirit animal like the patronus in Harry Potter?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I do, I believe mine is a black cat."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think mine is a tiger, just based on what I feel and my affinity with them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was such a powerful moment when Harry called on his patronus to defeat the death eaters."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They were some scary characters huh? I heard J.K. Rowling thought them up while she was depressed."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh I believe that, it shows. The Prisoner of Azkaban was a really dark movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was for sure one of the darkest. But I think it helped her defeat her own demons."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was a great movie, I loved the way they turned back time and were able to see themselves in the past."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love that part, really any movie with that subject or theme appeals to me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Same here. Hermione was so clever during that whole segment."
