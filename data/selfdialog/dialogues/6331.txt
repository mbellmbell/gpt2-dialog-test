"__STAR_WARS__ Here we go again"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why does Darth Vader have to wear a mask? He was only burned"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?!?!?!"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was only burned by the lava. No burn victims have to live with masks. The real reason he has a mask is because th voice of what's his name had to be used."
"__STAR_WARS__ James Earl Jones. You think of the weirdest things."
"__STAR_WARS__ But it bothers me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, whatever the reason. Darth Vader has a mask."
"__STAR_WARS__ But for a wrong reason. That's not right."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it's dramatic, and it looks cool. And makes that cool breathing noise."
