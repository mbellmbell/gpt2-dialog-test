"__MOVIES__ You see 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I loved it so much!  How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay."
"__MOVIES__ Just okay?"
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't as special or as original as the original 'Guardians.'"
"__MOVIES__ I guess the first one was more fun, but I liked this one just as much."
"__MOVIES__ I think the plot for Vol. 2 just wasn't anything special.  I could predict everything that would happen."
"__MOVIES__ But don't you think that adding Kurt Russell onto the cast was a brilliant move?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I absolutely loved the casting choices.  Kurt as Starlord's dad was a really good choice."
"__MOVIES__ And I'm glad characters like Nebula and Yondu were added to the main cast."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, that was a really cool part.  I'm all about the redemption."
"__MOVIES__ Also, don't forget Baby Groot."
"__MOVIES__ Baby Groot was adorable.  Maybe my favorite part of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ You know that Baby Groot was still voiced by Vin Diesel?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I had no idea.  That's pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, especially when you think about his normal voice."
"__MOVIES__ I hope the third movie is as quirky as the original one."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure James Gunn knows what he's doing."
"__MOVIES__ That I can agree with.  As long as the script itself is good, James will make magic with it."
"__MOVIES__ For sure.  I can't wait to see it."
