"__HORROR__ Have you seen 'Ouija: Origin of Evil'? I watched it last night."
"__HORROR__ Sure have. Before I say anything, what did you think?"
"__HORROR__ Honestly, I thought it was really so-so. I kept waiting for something to happen, it does in a 15 minute span, and then oh look, everyone is dead."
"__HORROR__ Yes, thank you! Everyone I know loved it."
"__HORROR__ I was really surprised, so many people recommended it to me!"
"__HORROR__ Me too! It felt like the spooky moments really dominated the plot rather than the other way around."
"__HORROR__ And I really wasn't buying the plot line. A lot of innocent people died in this house in a terrible way, so their ghosts decided to kill a family?"
"__HORROR__ Right, it seemed like an afterthought. It was like they wrote the movie and went, 'oh man, so why are the ghosts doing this again?'"
"__HORROR__ Also, I think they were trying to take borrow that religious turmoil vibe from 'The Exorcist' with their own priest questioning his faith."
"__HORROR__ I think in the movie business they call that an homage so they can skirt being accused of unoriginality."
