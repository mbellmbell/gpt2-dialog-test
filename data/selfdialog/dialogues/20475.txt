"__MOVIES__ What is the last good movie you watched?"
"__MOVIES__ Hell or High Water, no doubt."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea!  I watched that in a theater."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I waited until it came out as a rental and watched it.  Amazing movie."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well first of all it's a nice change from all the big budget blockbusters we get so often."
"__MOVIES__ True.  Did you like the acting?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea!  Ben Foster, Chris Pine, and Jeff Bridges.  They were all really good."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the plot was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was kind of like a modern day western.  A very uniquely American type of movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  The kind of romanticism over bank robbery, the guns, the shooting."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  And the economic desperation."
"__MOVIES__ So who do you think had the best acting performance in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough question.  I'd go with Jeff Bridges."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really.  Not the two brothers?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  They were great, but I think Bridges kind of anchors the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Jeff Bridges is terrific.  I feel like he's been acting forever."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I agree.  He's known for Big Lebowski, but I mean he's good in basically anything he does."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he is an Oscar winning actor."
"__MOVIES__ Very much deserving of it as well."
