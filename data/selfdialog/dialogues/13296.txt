"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's good, man? How are the Chiefs looking this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We're looking good, man. We're looking good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ AFC is stacked this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Pats, Ravens, Chiefs, Steelers..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's going to be a great year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFC is looking decent too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. I want Brees to win one more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That defense, man... they're ALWAYS letting him down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it. He's probably, technically, the best QB in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well... he's no Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I'm also ready to see Lynch return."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. That's gonna be sick!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's gonna be running DOWN people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. And then with Carr on the team..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're looking good, for sure. Hopefully, they can do better than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will. Carr is just maturing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He reminds me of Cam a lot. I hope he rebounds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will. He was really hurt a lot last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True that. Well, I'll hit you up next month for a preseason game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good to me, man. See you then."
