"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the movie 'The Parent Trap'?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one?  The old one?"
"__MOVIES__ Either, actually."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! Yes.  I saw the original movie with Haley Mills during the 70's."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the updated version with Lindsay Lohan?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, but I didn't think it was as good as the original."
"__MOVIES__ Most remakes aren't as good as the first.  Although, I did like the fact that the modern version had the mother living in England."
"__MOVIES__ Where did the mother live in the original Parent Trap?"
"__MOVIES__ In Boston, I believe."
"__MOVIES__ Where did the father live in both versions?"
"__MOVIES__ In the original the dad lived on a ranch in California.  In the modern version, the father operated a vineyard in Napa, California."
"__MOVIES__ Who played the father in the modern version?"
"__MOVIES__ Dennis Quaid."
"__MOVIES__ Did you catch the crossover actress?  The lady who played the step-mom-to-be in the original (Vicky), can be seen playing the mother of the step mom in the modern version."
"__MOVIES__ That's really cool!  I missed that."
"__MOVIES__ It was great casting."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was a nod to the parents of the current generation who had seen the old film."
"__MOVIES__ It was.  I also liked that they updated the relationships of the butler and the maid."
"__MOVIES__ I did, as well.  If they had stuck with the 70's era dynamics, It wouldn't have played as well in modern terms."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. We should watch the two movies back to back one night soon!"
