"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the match between the St. Louis Blues and the Nashville Predators last week?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I cannot believe that Nashville is in the semi finals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know. They have never made it this far into the playoffs. Did you think the would win that series against the Blues?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Never. But the forward Joe Pavleski is their top leading scorer an was able to pull through in the final game and lead them 3-1."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you know who they are playing in the conference finals?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea they are going to play the Anaheim Ducks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are the Anaheim Ducks any good?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah they are good, they just beat the Edmonton Oilers in a pretty good series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh yeah, that went to seven games didnt it?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yep. Seven game series and the Ducks ended up winning at home in Game seven 2-1, it was a nailbiter."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who is playing in the conference finals on the other side?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Pittsburgh Penguins are playing against the Ottowa Senators."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh that should be a good matchup, has Crosby been playing well?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No he has actually had an injured ankle and almost didnt play the last series in game 7."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who did they play last series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It was a great series, the Penguins played the Washington Capitals and won game 7 2-0."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Wow, who do you think will make it to the Stanley Cup?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am rooting for Nashville since they have never made it there."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What about between the Penguins and the Senators?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Depends, if Crosby is healthy I think the Penguins. If he is not, I would say the Senators will win."
