"__DISNEY__ When are they going to make a sleeping beauty remake?"
"__DISNEY__ They kind of already did."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?  I haven't seen anything about it."
"__DISNEY__ Maleficent.  Came out a few years ago, remember?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, that's not really a true sleeping beauty movie."
"__DISNEY__ Of course it is.  Just a different perspective."
"__DISNEY__ That movie was kind of dark and mysterious.  I want something lighter."
"__DISNEY__ You can't make all movies all rainbows and unicorns though."
"__DISNEY__ It frightened my daughter quite a bit."
"__DISNEY__ She'll probably really like it when she's older."
