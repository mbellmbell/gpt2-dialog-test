"__MUSIC__ How do you feel about symphonic metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I've only heard a bit. It's rather like gothic metal, isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes. I'd say it depends on the artist."
"__MUSIC__ Could you recommend a symphonic metal band, in that case?"
"__MUSIC__ Nightwish is one of the more well-known bands. Leaves' Eyes is good too."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard of Leaves' Eyes. I thought they were more of a viking metal band."
"__MUSIC__ They are also called that sometimes. They are also a bit operatic sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ So which of their songs would you recommend, then?"
"__MUSIC__ Symphony of the Night is a good one. It's from an album of the same name."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds interesting. Any other songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I believe Elegy and My Destiny are also some of their most popular songs."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks. I usually listen to pop and a little rock, so its interesting to find other music to look into."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of pop?"
"__MUSIC__ Rihanna and Britney Spears for the most part, then individual songs from other artists."
"__MUSIC__ So you mostly listen to those two and bits of other things then? Like some rock and such?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I actually listen to a bit of most music genres. I like most music."
"__MUSIC__ So you aren't picky about music then?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess not. I mostly like songs though, not so much bands."
"__MUSIC__ I usually listen to all of a particularly band or artists work, so I'm very different then."
"__MUSIC__ Well you probably hear more obscure or less popular songs from a band that way."
