"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I could talk about my love for the Fast & Furious series all day."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I wish I could say the same."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You're not a fan?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Not too much. Action movies just aren't my type."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, that's fine. There's more to it than just action."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Such as what?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There's plenty of drama in it, and there's also a bit of family-oriented stuff in there as well."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't know. The action seems to outweigh everything else."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, then I guess you won't really like the films much."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought about the same thing."
