"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think of the final scene of the last Harry Potter movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It makes me cry every time. Especially when Harry is walking to the forest and all of his loved ones who've passed away come back to be with him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Same! What do you think about the part when he sees Dumbledore at the place that looks like Kings Cross Station?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wasn't sure what to make of it. I didn't really understand it. Did you?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that the dead thing in the station with them is a representation of the Horcrux that was living inside of Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you mean by a Horcrux?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ A Horcrux is made when somebody splits their soul into different parts, hopefully giving them immortal life. Voldemort split his soul into 7 parts, and one lived inside Harry, so Harry had to die for Voldemort to die too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, I see now. So that dead thing is the Horcrux which actually did die, but Harry survived?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes. Voldemort didn't know that he had put a Horcrux into Harry though, it was an accident when he killed James and Lily Potter."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wow! There's so much more that happened than I realized. I really need to read the books."
