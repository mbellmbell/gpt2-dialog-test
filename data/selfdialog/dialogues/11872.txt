"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see the interview with Tom Brady about how long he wants to play in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I didn't see that.  What did he say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wants to play until he is 45.  He is in great shape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that is a long career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet he will break a lot of records if he plays that long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would think so.  I bet Brett Favre and Peyton Manning are nervous!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well they should be.  Brady is still in top shape!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think of their Super Bowl comeback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was amazing.  I think Atlanta just ran out of gas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes the Patriots played fast in the 2nd half and the Falcons got gassed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is there a certain NFL team that you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like the Indianapolis Colts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Andrew Luck.  He's been a bit inconsistent as of late though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he might have been battling some injuries the last few seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Colts defense hasn't helped him either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have been historically bad.  Even when Manning was there they just tried and outscored the other team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet Manning would have won a few more Super Bowls with a better defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes for sure.  They had no problem scoring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The rules seem to favor the offenses in the NFL too so that doesn't help when your defense is bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is so true.  Defenders have to be very cautious with how they tackle and push other players."
