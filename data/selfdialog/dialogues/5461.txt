"__STAR_WARS__ When you first saw Star Wars, what did you think when  it showed Darth Vader was Luke's dad?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I kind of knew, his name means Father in German."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that is a bit of a let down. Did you think they ever showed any other clues."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, when Obi was speaking on Ankain, to Luke, he sais Vader killed your father."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, that would show they were two people, not the same."
"__STAR_WARS__ He even greeted Vader, calling each other 'Old Friend'."
"__STAR_WARS__ That should have warned people."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think we were so caught up in all the action of the movie, no one put it together."
"__STAR_WARS__ The way that Vader killed him always confused me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Obi Wan did say Jedi never die, not really."
