"__STAR_WARS__ So what do you think they should do for the final stand alone movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, I've heard about the possibility of a Boba Fett back story."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've also heard maybe Yoda, or one about Obi Wan Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kenobie or Yoda would be absolutely awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ As long as the bring back Ewan Mcgregor for Obi Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, he was awesome.  I didn't think anyone could stand up to Sir Alec Guinness but he did the job."
"__STAR_WARS__ Great tie in, Rey turns out to be Kenobi's grand daughter, and the Obi-Wan movie is about keeping an eye on her."
"__STAR_WARS__ Awesome idea, maybe you should get hired by Disney."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about for a Yoda story?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Take a look back at centuries of development."
