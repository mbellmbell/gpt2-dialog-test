"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke Skywalker, who's isnt?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well thats a very expected answer, but mine is Obi Wan Kinobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?! He just dies and doesn't really do anything useful."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was very useful actually."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, how so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well if it weren't for him Anakin would have never turned into Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Doesn't that kind of prove my point?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, because with Vader there is no major antagonist."
"__STAR_WARS__ That still doesn't make him useful."
