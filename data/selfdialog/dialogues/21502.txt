"__DISNEY__ It's pretty cool that Disney is making live action versions of their classic movies."
"__DISNEY__ I know, I can't wait to see what they come out with next."
"__DISNEY__ I looked it up online awhile back, it looks like they are making pretty much all of the animations into live action over the next ten years or so."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, really? Even the Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that was on the list."
"__DISNEY__ Yay! I can't wait to see it, it's my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Haha. It was my favorite when I was younger. I think it's the defiant teenage daughter aspect."
"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite one now?"
