"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the opening game of the NFL season this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they always open with the Super Bowl winner at home, so it is Patriots and Chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't the Pats play the Falcons this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, later in the season at home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that was a missed opportunity! They should've opened with rematch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the NFL may have done that a few years ago and the coaches didn't like it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure ratings would've been through the roof though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably. At least it wasn't the Bills or the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for being an in-division 'rival' they aren't really rivals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all. The Patriots kind of run the AFC East."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if they'd be as successful in another division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overall, yes, but I think if they were in a division with the Broncos that would be their one major challenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is literally the only team against which Brady has a losing record?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. He's tied against Arizona, Green Bay, Giants, and Seattle, but only losing against Denver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is really impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is. He has a winning percentage in the high 70s. For someone who has played well over 200 games, that is amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many wins does he have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has 208. The most ever."
