"__MOVIES__ I am digging 300!"
"__MOVIES__ 300, what is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you not seen 300? The one about the Spartans?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I have seen the trailer. Been wanting to see it."
"__MOVIES__ I just got finished with it, the CG was flawless."
"__MOVIES__ Was there a lot of CG, Hollywood is getting carried away with it in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ There is a fair amount, mostly in the battle scenes. When He kicks the messagner in the well, epic."
"__MOVIES__ How epic can kicking somone in  a well be."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, so this messagner comes to Sparta to tell Leonius to surrender and serve him and the town will be spared. He backs him up to the town well and kicks him in the chest!"
"__MOVIES__ That does sound pretty awesome. That isnt the end is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Far from it! Leonius gathers his men 300 Spartans, to hold off this weird guy and his army of a million."
"__MOVIES__ A million? Seriously?"
"__MOVIES__ yes, I think the first wave was 100,000."
"__MOVIES__ How are 300 people supposed to stop 100,000 warriors?"
"__MOVIES__ Spartans historically were fierce , each Spartan on the battle field was said to be worth no less than 10 men."
"__MOVIES__ Still those odds seem pretty steep."
"__MOVIES__ Leonius stopped them at first with a wall."
"__MOVIES__ I guess a wall would work for a little while"
"__MOVIES__ It was no ordinary wall. It was made of the corpses of the enemies. It was like 50 feet high and twenty feet thick."
"__MOVIES__ Yuck! can you imagine the smell? It would be an effective image to be sure!"
