"__DISNEY__ Wreck it Ralph s my son's favorite movie"
"__DISNEY__ my kids also like that movie, the mouse is kind of gross though"
"__DISNEY__ I know, if I saw a mouse I would try to trap it"
"__DISNEY__ so would I! But it was funny how he rode around in the car"
"__DISNEY__ that hotel was so nasty, it was infested with mice"
"__DISNEY__ I would not have wanted to stay there"
"__DISNEY__ remember they did not have a choice because their car broke down ?"
"__DISNEY__ That is right, I think it was also raining pretty hard"
"__DISNEY__ I bet that hotel smelled really old and like mold"
"__DISNEY__ it probably did, I hope they did not have to stay for long, the poor boy was so bored he had to play with a mouse!"
