"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So I heard that the Fast & Furious series is going all the way up to ten?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wait, ten what?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Ten films. They announced around the sixth one that they were going all the way to ten."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, really? That's interesting."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, I'm just curious to see where they;ll take the story."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'd like to think that they'll retire all of the characters."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ As in the same way they did with Brian's character?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah. Just write them into normal lives."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I can't help but think they're going to kill somebody off."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's a bit morbid."
