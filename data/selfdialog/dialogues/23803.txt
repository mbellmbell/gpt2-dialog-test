"__SUPERHERO__ Oh man, I love that movie too!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Do you remember the part with the Russian?"
"__SUPERHERO__ The huge muscular dude that tries to kill The Punisher? Yeah I remember him."
"__SUPERHERO__ That scene was so crazy, how he got hot soup thrown in his eyes and melted his face."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah it was awesome how he just pulled the knife out of his shoulder like it was nothing."
