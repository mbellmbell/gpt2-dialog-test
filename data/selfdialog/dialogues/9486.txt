"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the game between the Cardinals and the Marlins the other night on ESPN?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I missed it. Did Ichiro play?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but he is still playing for the Marlins."
"__BASEBALL__ Didn't he play for the Seattle Mariners for a long time?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, he did for about about 12 years."
"__BASEBALL__ There was one season that he got an enormous number of base hits, if I recall correctly."
"__BASEBALL__ You're probably thinking about 2004, when he got 262 hits, breaking George Sisler's single-season hit record."
"__BASEBALL__ Did he play in the minors before coming into the big leagues?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but he played professionally in Japan for about a decade before coming here to the states."
"__BASEBALL__ Did he really? So he's played for about a quarter century then."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, and he's 43 years old, and still in amazing shape."
"__BASEBALL__ That's crazy, especially when most baseball players retire well before they're 40."
"__BASEBALL__ By the way, there are many seasons in which Ichiro got an enormous amount of hits."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he will be in the hall of fame at Cooperstown one day?"
"__BASEBALL__ Without a doubt, he will be, and most likely in the first year he's eligible."
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds like, if he got many hits per season over many seasons, he would have racked up a whole lot of career hits."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. In fact, when you count his hits in Japan with his hits here in America, he actually has more than Pete Rose."
"__BASEBALL__ And Pete Rose is the all-time career hits leader here in America."
"__BASEBALL__ That's correct, but they never really talk about his hits in Japan that much."
"__BASEBALL__ I still find it incredible the amount of hits total he has as a pro."
