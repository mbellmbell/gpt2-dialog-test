"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you hear Tom Brady has written a book?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, is it about football and the NFL, or about his personal life?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's about training to be an athlete more than about the games or teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He must know something about training since he's such a great player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The book title is about sustaining peak performance. I imagine he does have to really work hard to stay in shape since he's had such a long career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was something last winter when New England won the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, it was New England's fifth time winning the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have thought he would have written a book about the games he's played."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He said the book shows how he's been able to succeed as an athlete because of the way he trains."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it's not just a lot of practice that makes him good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he has an unusual way of training he said."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure that will be useful to new athletes who are trying to make it onto the big teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also said he has an unusual approach and method of exercise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would think exercise is super important for being able to keep up your strength during the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, everyone could use exercise to keep up their energy at whatever they do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm curious how much time someone like Brady exercises to stay in shape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The book comes out in September."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it would be interesting reading."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should go on a book tour and sign copies, and they would sell out everywhere he went."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, wouldn't that be something to be able to get Tom Brady's autograph?"
