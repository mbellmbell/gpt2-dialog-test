"__MOVIES__ Who are some of your favorite directors?"
"__MOVIES__ Tarantino, for sure, Kubrick, David Fincher, Coen Brothers, Cameron Crowe."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like David Lynch?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like Mulholland Drive, but generally, his stuff is too out there for me.  I don't need everything spelled out, but some of it is nonsense."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Eraserhead is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, except for a bunch of others."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, it's a little better than Tokyo Psycho, which I think only us two have ever heard of.  And now that I think about it, no it isn't."
"__MOVIES__ I know you're a big Stallone fan-- what do you think of him as a director?"
"__MOVIES__ I like him-- he directed Rocky 2 through 4, and Rocky Balboa, and I really liked all those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know he directed the little-know sequel to Saturday Night Fever called Staying Alive?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh, yeah.  Look who you're talking to.  Did you know for a time, John Travolta was being considered to be Rambo's sidekick?"
"__MOVIES__ That would've been a much different movie."
"__MOVIES__ Let me as you-- what are some of the worst movies by great directors?"
"__MOVIES__ Ooh, good question.  One that immediately springs to mind is Lolita, by Stanley Kubrick."
"__MOVIES__ Because of the timeframe and the content, his hands were really tied."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it's not terrible, just kind of boring."
"__MOVIES__ Any others come to mind?"
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen the movie, but I heard Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate was really terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, that movie bombed so hard that it led to studio executives taking greater control over movie productions."
"__MOVIES__ And, caused United Artist to go bankrupt."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess it was a pretty terrible movie."
