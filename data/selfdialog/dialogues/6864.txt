"__STAR_WARS__ Are you a fan of Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well yes and no!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why the no?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ewoks, even if they're soft and cuddly and benign, didn't belong in the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah everyone dumps on the Ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus some of the actors, I'm not saying who, phoned in their performances."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow. I'll see if I can spot this next time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that this is the film in the trilogy that fans say they liked the least."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe something about the story."
"__STAR_WARS__ But at least Luke has a reunion of sorts with family."
