"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what is the deal with Jacksonville?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, why do they consistantly have bad seasons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good question."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean they have to get good draft picks, why can't they develope them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, sources say Coach Gus Bradley needs to be replaced."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can believe that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, most of the players ae under 23, hard to develope good players straight out of high school."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HA! That's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also hear Monte Kiffin is comin out of retirement to save the Jags."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? he's gotta be on life support."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus they let a lot of free agents just show up and play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see what you mean, they cant gel as a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So bad coaching, free agents and when they DO get some good drfts they wind up hurting themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yesh, the last passer they acquired got his passing had caught in the garbage disposal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully they will ditch Gus, get some solid players and get out of the 3-13 funk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fingers crossed!"
