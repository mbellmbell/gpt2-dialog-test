"__DISNEY__ I heard that they're making live action versions of a lot of old Disney movies!"
"__DISNEY__ I heard that as well! I love the cartoon versions but can't imagine how they are going to re-create some of them."
"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the most recent Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't but I would like to. I really like Emma Watson."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder who they would cast for the live action Ariel in the Little Mermaid!"
"__DISNEY__ I have no idea! What about Sebastian the crab?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know that either.  I was thinking maybe someone like Ariana Grande for Ariel. She has a lovely singing voice."
"__DISNEY__ She could work... She would have to wear a red wig though. I bet the songs would be beautiful with her voice."
"__DISNEY__ She sang a song on the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I heard the song! It was great!"
