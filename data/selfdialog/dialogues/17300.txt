"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite western movie ever?"
"__MOVIES__ That's almost too tough to choose."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, I'll start.  I'll say Unforgiven."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty darn good choice.  I prefer the classics a bit more."
"__MOVIES__ And what classic would that be?"
"__MOVIES__ The Searchers."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, that's an admirable choice.  The ending scene is iconic."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the doorway scene?"
"__MOVIES__ Right.  He kind of stands there, doesn't know what to do, and then walks away."
"__MOVIES__ It was a brilliant framing device for his overall character."
"__MOVIES__ The reason I like Unforgiven is just how non-Hollywood it is."
"__MOVIES__ You mean how Clint Eastwood is an anti-hero?"
"__MOVIES__ Right.  William Munny is not a good man, but a man who operates out of necessity."
"__MOVIES__ Very film school like of you to think of it in that manner."
"__MOVIES__ That's not to say he doesn't have a heart, but he's also ruthless."
"__MOVIES__ He apparently has killed women and children, at least that's alluded to."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the whole point is that you can't outrun your past."
"__MOVIES__ And that past comes up to meet him at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Like I said, just a phenomenal movie."
"__MOVIES__ No doubt, so many great westerns!"
