"__HORROR__ What's your favorite horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ Has to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
"__HORROR__ Oh, God. That movie scares me so much!"
"__HORROR__ Ugh, the sounds in that movie alone are enough to creep me out."
"__HORROR__ Yes. Like in the beginning with those camera bulb flashes and the high pitched twanging noise?"
"__HORROR__ That scared me, too! Hey, remember when the girl is in the farmhouse and she stumbles into that room of bones?"
"__HORROR__ How could I forget? She falls down, she's crying, and she's just covered in all those human bones."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, and there's like a lampshade with skin on it."
"__HORROR__ That movie destroyed me for years. Like, I think I developed a condition."
"__HORROR__ Who could blame you? I can't think of another film that's been nearly as terrifying."
