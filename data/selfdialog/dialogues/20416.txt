"__MOVIES__ I was reading this morning about how the Wonder Woman movie broke a record."
"__MOVIES__ What was the record for?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the highest earning live action film ever directed by a woman."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. Who was the director?"
"__MOVIES__ Her name is Patty Jenkins. She won an Oscar for the movie Monsters, but it's been 14 years since then before she got offered another feature film to direct."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I bet she doesn't have to wait 14 years for another opportunity."
"__MOVIES__ She is supposedly in talks to do the sequel."
"__MOVIES__ It's nice to see women get a chance and succeed."
"__MOVIES__ I love the star of Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot. She became a fan favorite of the Fast and Furious movies, so it probably helped bring fans to the theatres to see her in this."
"__MOVIES__ I heard the movie had done really good at the box office."
"__MOVIES__ It made almost 290 million at the box office. It's in third spot for the highest selling films of this year."
"__MOVIES__ What were the top two?"
"__MOVIES__ Beauty and the Beast was first, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was second."
"__MOVIES__ Beauty and the Beast stars Emma Watson in the lead role, meaning women have earned the top two out of three films."
"__MOVIES__ Heroines are really popular these days."
"__MOVIES__ It's really nice to see."
"__MOVIES__ I know, maybe it will set a trend for the future."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they are plotting a Wonder Woman sequel already."
"__MOVIES__ The critics loved this film, they called it 'a breath of fresh air.'"
"__MOVIES__ People are tired of dark, depressing, violence. They want something inspiring and fun."
