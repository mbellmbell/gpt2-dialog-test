"__COMEDY__ I wonder what the very first comedy movie was"
"__COMEDY__ These are not the type of question that can be answered."
"__COMEDY__ Why not? It's simple. Which movie used humor mostly to entertain people?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, again. Genres came after the movies. We say a comedy movie, but that genre became a thing after many movies used humor in their content"
"__COMEDY__ So there has to be at least one movie that set that trend"
"__COMEDY__ Well, not really, because there could've been many movies from same time frame that did the same thing."
"__COMEDY__ Either way there has to be some consensus as to the original comedy"
"__COMEDY__ if I was forced to say it, I'd say it's that french film. L'Arroseur Arrose, or the watered waterer."
"__COMEDY__ Even the name's humorous."
"__COMEDY__ yeah, it's was a bit of a slapstick comedy. Guy gets sprayed by his own water hose. But it's the start of the genre I'd say."
