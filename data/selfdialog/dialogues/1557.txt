"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Olivia Newton John's cancer has come back?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember that I am younger than you.  Who is Olivia Newton John?"
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see the movie Grease?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yes.  I've seen that.  Is she Sandy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, she played Sandy."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know she had cancer!"
"__MUSIC__ She had breast cancer about twenty five years ago and it went into remission, but it returned and has metastasized in her back."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that is rotten luck for her!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is.  She was scheduled for a tour this summer and cancelled.  She was coming here to Arkansas."
"__MUSIC__ Were you planning to go to the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking about it.  I saw her years ago in Atlanta at Chastain Park and she was fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ She still has a good voice, then?"
"__MUSIC__ I'll admit that she didn't seem to hit some of the high notes she used to."
"__MUSIC__ Some singers lose range as they get older."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  But, she was like the first singer for me to be crazy about when I was a kid."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like her because of Grease?"
"__MUSIC__ Partially.  But, I also loved Xanadu."
"__MUSIC__ What is Xanadu?"
"__MUSIC__ I was another movie she was in.  She was a roller skating muse."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds really weird!!"
