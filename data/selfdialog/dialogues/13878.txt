"__BASKETBALL__ Ok Then who's the tallest player in the NBA currently?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That'd be Kristaps Porzingis at 7'3. Plays the Knicks"
"__BASKETBALL__ Who's the tallest ever?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That'd be two players. Manute Bol and Gheorghe Muresan. Both at 7'7"
"__BASKETBALL__ They probably have genetic diseases?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Not sure. Some of the really tall people generally have some kind of thyroid or growth hormone imbalances. Not sure if those two do also"
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you know that the tallest player in basketball doesn't play for the NBA?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. Paul Stugess"
"__BASKETBALL__ How come he didn't get signed with the NBA?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He wasn't that good."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's 7'8. He can reach the basket just standing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep. Saw him dunk once. It was hilarious to watch"
"__BASKETBALL__ Doesn't even have to jump that high to dunk"
"__BASKETBALL__ Nor can he jump very high for that matter."
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, when human body reaches a certain height, things like jumping, running become difficult."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's probably why they look so weird when they try."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, awkward gait, and short vertical jump, because their bodies can't handle so much weight."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's just like Football players. the linemen."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, really fat guys can't run even when they get the fumble and usually fall down because they can't coordinate their bodies well in running. Similar thing with the really tall basketball players."
