"__MOVIES__ I just love movie musicals."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, me too! Which ones do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Hairspray, Chicago, Mamma Mia, Rent..."
"__MOVIES__ Phantom of the Opera, Les Mis, Beauty and the Beast..."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see La La Land?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was good, but that ending, though! I cried!"
"__MOVIES__ I can not see that ever again."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a bit too sad."
"__MOVIES__ Makes you wonder what's coming from Broadway next."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of hope it's Wicked or something like that."
"__MOVIES__ You know, that reminds me! I've not seen Into The Woods!"
"__MOVIES__ Me neither, want to watch it together?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'll bring the popcorn!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll bring the tissues and the drinks!"
"__MOVIES__ Should we invite our friends?"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, let's watch it just us. They're all busy these days, anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're right. Jobs, babies, etc."
"__MOVIES__ Your place or mine?"
"__MOVIES__ Um, we did mine last time, so how about yours?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay. Might have to clean up a bit, but it's a deal."
