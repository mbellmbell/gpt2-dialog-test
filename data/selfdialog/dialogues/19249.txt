"__MOVIES__ Have you scene the new Wonder Women movie"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did, I thought it was really good!  What about you."
"__MOVIES__ I actually thought it was the best DC movie so far. It gives me hope for the Justice League movie"
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean.  DC finally got a movie right."
"__MOVIES__ I mean Suicide Squad was pretty good, but Batman V Superman sucked."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I liked it the first time I saw it.  Then I watched it on HBO and the more I watched it, the worse it got."
"__MOVIES__ Every Marvel movie is amazing.  Each one is as good if not better than the last."
"__MOVIES__ I am a bigger DC fan.  I grew up reading Superman, Flash, Justice League comics.  So it is disappointing that they have screwed it up so bad."
"__MOVIES__ Superman is my favorite superhero ever.  I want there to be a great Justice League Movie."
"__MOVIES__ Did you read that Josh Wheadon is doing a lot of reshoots, etc?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did read that the other day.  Now that he is at the helm, hopefully it will be good"
"__MOVIES__ I know they didn't want to do everything just like Marvel, but I think they needed to build each character with their own movie first."
"__MOVIES__ I know, Marvel did it perfect.  Each character got a movie, you got to know them, and then you brought them all together"
"__MOVIES__ I fear the Justice League movie will feel rushed."
"__MOVIES__ I hope not! I hope it isn't a rushed movie."
"__MOVIES__ I also can't wait for the next Thor movie."
"__MOVIES__ The previews look really cool."
"__MOVIES__ I love that scene where he sees the Hulk and gets excited."
