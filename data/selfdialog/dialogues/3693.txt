"__MUSIC__ Are you going to the Fences show next week?"
"__MUSIC__ I am! I already got my tickets, are you going?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'll be there. I'm really excited to see them live."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I haven't ever seen them live, are they good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are fantastic live. It sounds even better than on the record."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, I'm super excited. I hate when I go see a band and they sound totally different live."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know, it feels like you're getting ripped off."
"__MUSIC__ That's how I felt when I saw Blink 182. I feel like they edit the vocals too much on the albums."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Tom is actually not a very good singer live."
"__MUSIC__ Right? He sounds totally flat and tone deaf."
"__MUSIC__ You don't have to worry about that with Fences."
"__MUSIC__ It should be a good show then!"
"__MUSIC__ How did you feel about Chris's work with Macklamore and Ryan Lewis?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually really liked it. I love Macklamore and Ryan Lewis and Christopher's vocals fit so well with what they're doing."
"__MUSIC__ Same. I hope that they are going to do more projects together."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked what they did with Arrows. Did you see the video for it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, how was the video?"
"__MUSIC__ Really good, it told an interesting story about the burdens and pressures of fame."
"__MUSIC__ I just watched the video for Sunburns the other day. I really like that video."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Chris looks like an old sailor in it, but its a great track."
