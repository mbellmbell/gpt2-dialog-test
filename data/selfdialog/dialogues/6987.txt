"__ICEHOCKEY__ I've been a St. Louis Blues fan for all of my life."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm sorry to hear that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, they have one of the longer droughts for lacking a championship in professional sports"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You got that right - they are one of those unlucky franchises."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, what makes it worse is that half the teams make the playoffs in the NHL and they still haven't gotten the Stanley Cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I hear you, but if it's any consolation, I think the Stanley Cup playoffs is one of the most unpredictable in sports. The number one seed rarely wins the cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I guess, but I think that logic goes either way. The unpredictably should mean the Blues could have won the cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe you have a point. Maybe it's bad luck or bad drafting or bad general management."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What makes it worse is that they had there best shot before there were expansion franchises. Now it will be even harder."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I hadn't thought of it that way. It may be another 50 years before the Blues win the Cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ God I hope not, I'll be dead if that's the case."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Think of it this way. The longer the drought, the sweeter the victory... just look at the Cubs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'd take multiple championships, thank you very much."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Dynasties don't happen in the NHL like they used to."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ True. I think expansion has made it harder - it dilutes the talent."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And things will get worse when that Las Vegas team enters the league."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Tell me about it. There will be some good players taken from a lot of teams."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hopefully, that will be it for the expansion franchises in the NHL."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Someday the Blues will win the Stanley Cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'll party in St. Louis when it happens!"
