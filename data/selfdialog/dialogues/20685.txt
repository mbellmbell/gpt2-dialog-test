"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see open water 2?"
"__THRILLER__ Is that the shark movie?"
"__THRILLER__ Yea the one where the friends go on a boat and end up trapped off of the boat. I don't think it's very shark heavy though."
"__THRILLER__ Yea I think it's just more about being stuck int he water."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, the friends start out pretty optimistic and then slowly start to turn on one another."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, it was a good thriller even without the sharks."
"__THRILLER__ I agree, I think in the end a couple survive."
"__THRILLER__ Yea that part was stupid, after all those people died, for two people to live was dumb."
"__THRILLER__ If it was me, I'd feel too guilty to go on after that."
"__THRILLER__ Me too, I couldn't do it."
