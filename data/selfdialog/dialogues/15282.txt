"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, I think I have figured out why in the Harry Potter movies, Snape was so hard on Neville Longbottom."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Because he was pals with Harry?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Not just that, there is way more. He was not as mean to Harry's other pals, at least not as mean as he was to Neville."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Then why?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Because, if Voldermort would have targeted the Longbottoms, his mom and dad, instead of the Potters, Lily might still be alive."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What! Since, either family would fit the criteria to end him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes. So he blamed Harry, and Neville. Neville to a lesser extent."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is why he always took his points away."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And embarrassed him.  He did not even have the excuse he was trying to convince Voldermort by it either."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Snape was a real piece of work."
