"__HORROR__ Have you seen any good horror flicks lately?"
"__HORROR__ It's been a while actually. How about you?"
"__HORROR__ I did just see A Serbian Film, directed by Srdjan Spasojevic. That was really intense."
"__HORROR__ Oh, yeah? How so?"
"__HORROR__ Well it was really grotesque and difficult to watch."
"__HORROR__ Aren't all horror films like that?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, but this was one was more like Salo."
"__HORROR__ Is that the movie based on the Marquis de Sade novel?"
"__HORROR__ Exactly, and anything written by him is going to be a difficult watch."
"__HORROR__ Sounds like not something I'd want to watch."
