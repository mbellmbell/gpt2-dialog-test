"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think will win the NFC division in 2017?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a hard question to answer there are so many good teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know but if you had to narrow it down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Atlanta obviously since they won the division last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah despite the meltdown in the Superbowl I still expect them to be good this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That game was kind of a fluke. They went up early and got careless. Only the Patriots could have made that comeback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it was a crazy game. Besides Atlanta who else do you think has a chance?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? The Cowboys. You really think they have a chance?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch them at all last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I watched their playoff game against Green Bay which they lost."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Barely lost. If they would have won I think they may have been able to beat Atlanta."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that. What makes you think they will be better this next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There offense will be at least as good or better than last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but what about there defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They drafted defense very heavy and picked up some solid players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think a squad of rookies can carry a defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They still have some solid veterans like Sean Lee in the mix."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that guy was really good in the games I saw him play in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is one of the cornerstones for their defense. If the rookies can play a part the Cowboys can make a playoff run."
