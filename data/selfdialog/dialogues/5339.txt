"__STAR_WARS__ What is better an X-Wing, Y-Wing or the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ How could you even ask this? Of course it's the Millennium Falcon."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sorry, I was just curious. I also like the Millennium falcon."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's okay! Yes, the Millennium Falcon is basically the main ship of the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm surprised how big it is from the outside since they only really showed two areas."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I think the rest of ship is only for cargo stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish we could of seen the rest of the ship."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would of been awesome!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope there are more closeups of the cockpit in the future."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah a view from the back would be good!"
