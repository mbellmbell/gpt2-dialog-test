"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the NFL's take on protecting the players now days?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean all the rule changes with making the game less smash smouth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh right, I'm not sure it's still football though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it is but a slower game than it was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to admit things were getting out of control."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't argue with you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People now days are so much faster and stronger on average than they were 20-30 years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think there are just too many good athletes now that it was becoming too dangerous?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was always dangerous but when you have that many players on the field flying around it's over the top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see your point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might have taken it too far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the referees want to be jerks they could throw a flag every play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't think that is a good thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody wants to play hard only to be told that they need to tone it down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good point."
