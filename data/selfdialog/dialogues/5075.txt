"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So I think they should have stopped making the movies when Paul Walker died."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't know man, I think that's unfair to fans who didn't have him front and center, other characters have strong followings too."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, I don't see how it's not going to be on everyone's mind when they watch any of them from now on."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think the character Dom is strong enough, and the fan base big enough they will be fine."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I guess but I still feel it's a bit tacky."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's business, and the movies are mostly about the cars and the mods and hey, in that lifestyle, people die."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ We'll see, I guess ratings will drop if people agree with me more."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm still going to go see every one they make."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Are they making another one?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Talking about it or a spin off series."
