"__MUSIC__ Corinne Bailey Rae has such an incredible voice.  Do you know her?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what does she sing?"
"__MUSIC__ She's a British singer, she has a really soulful voice.  Her most famous song is probably, 'Put Your Records On'.  Do you know it?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean the one that goes, 'Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song'...something about 'let your hair down'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's the one.  She has only made a few albums but the songs she's written are so good."
"__MUSIC__ She must be more well-known in the U.K.."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she is, but I think she has a big U.S. following.  The last time she came here, her show was sold out."
"__MUSIC__ Does she sing jazz as well?"
"__MUSIC__ She has.  She did a duet with Herbie Hancock of Joni Mitchell's 'River'."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I love that song.  I'd like to hear it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Herbie's piano is fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ I will check that song out."
"__MUSIC__ You should really check out all of her music.  My favorite song by her is called, 'Like a Star.'"
"__MUSIC__ Has she won any awards?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think she won a grammy for best R& B performance for one of her songs, the one about her husband.  I can't remember what it's called."
"__MUSIC__ Is her husband someone famous?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a musician, and he passed away in 2010.   I think her last album was about his death, very spooky, sad songs."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, sounds kind of depressing."
"__MUSIC__ It isn't really, because her voice is so beautiful and she writes really good music."
"__MUSIC__ I will give her a listen."
