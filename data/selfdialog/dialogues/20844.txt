"__THRILLER__ I'm in the mood for a good thriller movie. Have you seen any lately?"
"__THRILLER__ I actually haven't seen any lately, but a few I've seen in the past and liked are Gone Girl, Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, and Memento."
"__THRILLER__ I've seen all of those except Memento. Is it worth watching?"
"__THRILLER__ Definitely. It's really original and keeps you guessing."
"__THRILLER__ I've heard of it but can't remember who's in it."
"__THRILLER__ Guy Pearce, who's very good in it, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Ann Moss."
"__THRILLER__ I like Guy. He was in a couple of the Alien movies."
"__THRILLER__ Yep, that's him. It's good in a way that you didn't see it in the theater because it's a little hard to follow in spots, and if you watch it on DVD or online, you'll be able to rewind and watch parts of it over again."
"__THRILLER__ Great, sounds intriging."
"__THRILLER__ I remember when I saw it I was very impressed with the uniqueness of it and I really like the story. It's also filmed in a unique way, but I don't want to give too much away!"
