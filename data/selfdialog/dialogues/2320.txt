"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard anything from Toad the Wet Sprocket lately?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I was just listening to their newest album."
"__MUSIC__ New Constellation?  That's a really good one."
"__MUSIC__ I was afraid it would be terrible, since they hadn't recorded anything in years."
"__MUSIC__ I know. But it was great."
"__MUSIC__ I really enjoyed it too..  I would have worn it out if it was on cd or vinyl."
"__MUSIC__ Do you really listen to albums on vinyl?"
"__MUSIC__ Not too much.  Only when I am at a friend's house who listens to vinyl."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they will put out another album soon?"
"__MUSIC__ I sure hope so!  I love their music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  My favorite song is 'All I Want'."
"__MUSIC__ I  played that one over and over!  Such a great song, with great vocals."
"__MUSIC__ They are a really cool band.  Their lead singer, Glen, has done some solo concerts too!"
"__MUSIC__ I would love to see that.  It would be so cool."
"__MUSIC__ I would like to see him or the band, but in lieu of that, maybe another album?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be great.  I will have to see if they are working on anything."
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget to look up Glen Phillips, too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's right.  Who knows if he's putting anything out?"
"__MUSIC__ Not me.  For now, I am going to go listen to their other album that I have."
"__MUSIC__ The album called Fear?  Enjoy!"
