"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about war movies?"
"__MOVIES__ That's probably my least favourite genre of movies, though there is one I kinda like."
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ Friendly Persuasion."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not familiar with it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's not as much a war movie as some, mainly because it's centered around a Quaker family, but it does take place during the American civil war."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting... Anybody good in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire, oh and a young Anthony Perkins!"
"__MOVIES__ Nice! I've always liked movies I've seen Dorothy McGuire in."
"__MOVIES__ Well this is a great one. In fact, one of your presidents, Reagan, liked it so much he shared a copy with the Soviet premier."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I didn't know."
"__MOVIES__ I like it because there are very few movies I find that depict Quakers in the face of war. There are some factual errors in it but it's overall very good."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favourite scene?"
"__MOVIES__ Not a specific scene, but I like the relationship between the youngest boy and his sister. It's so funny."
"__MOVIES__ Who knew a movie about Quakers in war would be funny?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I'm not saying whether they get involved in the war or not, but it is actually a pretty humorous movie. Not that the writers put jokes in it or anything, but in the way the characters are they're funny."
"__MOVIES__ I think I can see what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely think the humor is balanced by some very sober and serious scenes."
"__MOVIES__ That's good. It is taking place during a war after all."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it can be very thought-provoking, too."
