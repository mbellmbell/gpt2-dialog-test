"__MUSIC__ progressive metal?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."

"__MUSIC__ Well, beginning in the 1990s, heavy metal has been growing more sophistocated."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Metal bands are currently known for experimenting a lot with time signatures and achieving great levels of complexity and virtuosity."

"__MUSIC__ That's funny. What band is it?"
"__MUSIC__ They're called Gojira."
