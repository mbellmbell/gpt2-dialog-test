"__MUSIC__ Have you been to any good concerts lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I just saw Twenty One Pilots a couple weeks ago."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard a lot about them but haven't listened to them much. What made them so good?"
"__MUSIC__ Everything! But to be more specific, their showmanship made their songs even better than they already were!"
"__MUSIC__ In what way? Are they a lot different than other bands live?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! They are very active and are running and jumping all over the place. They were even in a giant hamster ball at one point!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow! That is definitely unique. Could you describe their music to me?"
"__MUSIC__ It has to be heard to understand, but I'll try. They incorporate a lot of things from different genres but they're mostly pop-punk,"
"__MUSIC__ Okay! I've heard that they're Christian, would I not get a lot out of their lyrics if I'm not?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all! There's that extra layer of meaning if you can relate to it, but pretty much every song is still relatable even if you aren't religious."
"__MUSIC__ That's really good to know. What kind of people go to their concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, just about everyone! Kids, teenagers, adults, and even older adults that aren't just there to take their kids."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Are they that popular?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yes. They're really just that unique but not in an off-putting way."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, well I guess I will have to check them out. I have one more question, though."
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ Can I go to a show of theirs with you next time they're in town?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely! I'd love to see them with you."
"__MUSIC__ Good! Thank you for telling me more about them."
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome! They are amazing."
