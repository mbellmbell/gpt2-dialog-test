"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Tarantino movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, they're all so good."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean, but I have a definite favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'm gonna guess Pulp Fiction, his first big hit."
"__MOVIES__ Nope, it happens to be Jackie Brown."
"__MOVIES__ Jackie Brown? Tarantino didn't even like that one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I think he did. He just realized that it was terribly unpopular, for a Tarantino flick, so he didn't make another like it."
"__MOVIES__ Really."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I read. But it's a great film. Takes its plot from Rum Punch, written by Elmore Leonard, and offers a wonderful female lead."
"__MOVIES__ And I heard he called it Jackie Brown to play off Foxy Brown, the character Pam Grier had played years before."
"__MOVIES__ Right. It's Foxy Brown after the years started getting to her. I don't know why she didn't get an Oscar."
"__MOVIES__ I think Robert Forster did."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. And Brigit Fonda is fabulous as the pothead princess."
"__MOVIES__ Plus Michael Keaton, Robert DeNiro, and the amazing Samuel L. Jackson."
"__MOVIES__ A true villain! Yet funny."
"__MOVIES__ And Elmore Leonard supposedly said it was the best screenplay ever made from one of his books."
"__MOVIES__ Yet nobody seemed to like it. As a Tarantino film, anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Too subtle?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. Too sensitive maybe. A criminal hero, who is a middle-aged African American."
"__MOVIES__ Too good. He never made another like it."
