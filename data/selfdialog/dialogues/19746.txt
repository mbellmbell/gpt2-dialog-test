"__MOVIES__ My favorite movie of all time is 'Blazing Saddles'."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh that movie is hilarious, I can't even decide which part is my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ There's so many good quotable parts in there, it's non stop funny."
"__MOVIES__ Remember when Mongo punched that horse?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, or Howard Johnson and his 1 flavor ice cream parlor."
"__MOVIES__ Or that lady in church who starts her speech off quietly..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and someone complains that they can't hear her so she gets loud and scares the entire congregation."
"__MOVIES__ Ha yes, but really, if you had to pick, what would be your favorite scene?"
"__MOVIES__ The one scene that makes me laugh like an idiot for several minutes, no matter how many times I see it, is the campfire scene."
"__MOVIES__ Oh with the beans?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it cracks me up every time."
"__MOVIES__ Because they're all passing gas?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know why that's funny, it just is."
"__MOVIES__ Are you 5?"
"__MOVIES__ When it comes to that scene, yes, I'm 5, because it's hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ And then when Taggert comes out of the tent and says he thinks they've had enough."
"__MOVIES__ 'What in the wide, wide, world of sports is going on around here?'"
"__MOVIES__ 'Howard Johnson is right!'"
"__MOVIES__ That movie is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ They don't make them that good anymore."
