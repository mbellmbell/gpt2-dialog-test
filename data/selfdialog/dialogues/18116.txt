"__MOVIES__ Oh man, did you see 'The Witch'? I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I didn't understand it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was about a witch coven."
"__MOVIES__ No it wasn't. It was about a rather silly girl who let her brother get kidnapped."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, so it doesn't have much of a plot. It's all about mood. And there's more going on than you think."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ The movie is about Puritan attitudes toward nature and the devil. Puritans thought that disorder was reflective of the devil and nature was the devil's realm."
"__MOVIES__ So that's why all shots of the woods were dark and freaky?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. The border of the family's land was godly; everything beyond it was evil."
"__MOVIES__ So, what about the boy?"
"__MOVIES__ The boy was an example of what happens if people aren't vigilant against evil."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't he get eaten by a wolf or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. The girl was straying from God's path and let evil into the sanctity of the family plot of land and the boy paid for that."
"__MOVIES__ You're boring me. Have you seen 'Captain Underpants'? That was fantastic. Never have I laughed so hard."
"__MOVIES__ You're comparing 'The Witch' to 'Captain Underpants'?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure: 'The Witch' is artsy-fartsy crap and 'Captain Underpants' is good old-fashioned fun."
"__MOVIES__ Don't you get tired of fart jokes?"
"__MOVIES__ Never. And some of them were strangely sophisticated."
"__MOVIES__ I was afraid he was going to drop his underpants."
"__MOVIES__ That's the adult version. It comes out next year and stars Jack Black in all his undisguised glory."
