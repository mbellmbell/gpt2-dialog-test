"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So what did you think of that new Young Thug album 'Beautiful Thugger Girls'?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I freaking loved it! I think it was his best yet. What did you think?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I liked it but it's not my favorite of his."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's your favorite Young Thug album or mixtape?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Mine is still 'Barter 6'."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ah, that is my second favorite by him. Did you happen to listen to the new 2 Chainz album too?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah! I really like that one. 'Good Drank' was my favorite song and 'Riverdale Rd' was my second favorite."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I really wasn't feeling it all that much. I thought the lows were pretty low."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I can see that. By the way, check out Let Me Breath by Action Bronson when you get a chance. That joint is fire."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ok, I'm always down for some new Bronson. Can't wait for that Blue Chips 7000."
