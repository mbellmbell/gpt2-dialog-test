"__MOVIES__ hey, so what happened about our movie fan club?"
"__MOVIES__ yes, I couldn't get it started this week, but next week I am sure I'll get it done."
"__MOVIES__ okay so are we going to focus on one particular genre or it is a generalized fan club?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't given it that much thought yet. But I am thinking of making it limited to a particular genre."
"__MOVIES__ oh okay, I am cool with that. So what genre you have in your mind?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I am going to go with sci fi."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds cool. I myself am a huge fan of sci fi movies."
"__MOVIES__ really? I didn't know that. So which is your favorite sci fi movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think martian is one of my favorite sci fi movie."
"__MOVIES__ oh wow! what a co incidence. That's my favorite sci fi movie as well!"
"__MOVIES__ I just love that movie. It's like having glimpse at future."
"__MOVIES__ yes, and the future that doesn't seem very distant."
"__MOVIES__ yes, it definitely looks possible in next 50 years."
"__MOVIES__ so did you like matt damon's acting in martian?"
"__MOVIES__ oh yes, I think he was the perfect actor to play that role."
"__MOVIES__ yes, somehow I feel that matt damon does pretty great job in space movies."
"__MOVIES__ oh yes, I just remember that he was in interstellar as well."
"__MOVIES__ yes, but I didn't like that they took him as a bad guy in interstellar."
"__MOVIES__ yes, I was portrayed as a bit stupid in interstellar,"
"__MOVIES__ exactly. You won't believe that I was going to say the exact same thing!"
