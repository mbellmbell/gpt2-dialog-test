"__STAR_WARS__ Which of the original trilogy was your least favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ WHAT???"
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, kidding. Return of the Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why? Luke redeems Vader. That was the point of the franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Teddy bears beat up trained soldiers."
"__STAR_WARS__ So?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They were there just for marketing. A character created as a toy beat trained soldiers."
"__STAR_WARS__ The action was fun on the speeders, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but to counter that, they broke into the defense because there were no security cameras!"
