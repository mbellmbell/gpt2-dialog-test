"__MOVIES__ Have you been to the movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  The last movie I saw in the theater was Ben Hur."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that too back in the fall."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it, but I thought the original was better."
"__MOVIES__ I never saw the original, but I liked Morgan Freeman in the new one."
"__MOVIES__ He was good, but I was disappointed that I didn't know most of the other actors."
"__MOVIES__ I also thought a lot of the female characters in the beginning looked alike."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was hard to tell them apart."
"__MOVIES__ They did a good job making you realize how bad things got for the main character."
"__MOVIES__ They didn't use the name Ben-Hur much."
"__MOVIES__ That's true.  You know, I never knew that Ben-Hur had an actual first name."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the ending?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  It was too perfect."
"__MOVIES__ I have to agree there as well."
"__MOVIES__ I like it when everyone lives happily ever after, but it was a little overboard."
"__MOVIES__ Did you have a favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess the chariot race at the end."
"__MOVIES__ It was predictable."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
