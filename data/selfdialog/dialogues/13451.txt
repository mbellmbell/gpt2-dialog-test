"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Planning to watch the NFL this fall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, kinda tired of it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same ol' same ol'. Watch hundreds of games over fifty years and they all start to look the same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That surprises me. You used to he a huge Miami Dolphins fan. Larry Csonka was your hero."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I even sported a number 39 jersey through most of elementary school."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that from old family photos. Who was the QB then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bob Griese. One of the most underrated QBs ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I barely remember him. When did he stop playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Around 1981 or so. Dan Marino took over after him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dolphins were a great team back in the 70s, won a few superbowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and went undefeated in 1972. Still the only team that's done that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ New England almost did it a few years back but then lost the Big One."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was a shocker. Another reason I don't like NFL much anymore. New England and all their cheating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think that's anything new."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not, but I guess all the money in it changes things. One reason I prefer college ball these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you, but watching college ball looks a lot like watching high school ball. Not as professional."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha. I like high school ball! Those 70-3 score games are a hoot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Except nowadays that's considered bad form and they put the 5th string in after the lead hits about 30."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't upset the precious snowflakes;)"
