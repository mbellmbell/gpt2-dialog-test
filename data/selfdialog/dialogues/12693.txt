"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to get to go to any home games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I got tickets for two home games this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's going to be playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First game is against Green Bay and the second game is against the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both should be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are both in December so it will be real cold at Giant Stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I've been there before when it was pretty darn cold.  Went one time when the Giants were playing the Eagles.  It was like 10 degrees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been there in the snow before.  Great games.  That's when they play the best too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, hopefully the season will be going good for the Giants then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it will be.  Their defense is supposed to be real good and if their offense can hold up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well that game against Green Bay will be important I bet.  It's going to be late in the season isn't it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh huh, week 15.  It might decide a home field advantage or something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Playoff atmosphere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You ever go to a playoff game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, never a chance at getting tickets for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better chance going to a road playoff game then getting in for a Giant playoff game that's for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, that'd be kind of fun.  A road trip.  Where would you want to go see the Giants win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for the NFC Championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or Philly."
