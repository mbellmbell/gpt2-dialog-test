"__BEATLES__ My friend at Penn State University signed up for a class on The Beatles this semester."
"__BEATLES__ That's brilliant! I wish I could take a class on The Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ I know that Coursera, the free online college course website was offering one at one point."
"__BEATLES__ I'll have to look into that. At the very least, I want to take a book about The Beatles out from the library."
"__BEATLES__ I can only imagine that there are so many quality books about The Beatles. They defined 60s culture in a super significant way."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, as far as Anglo-American culture goes, I don't know who can plausibly be claimed to have a bigger impact."
"__BEATLES__ People talk about Dylan having a huge influence."
"__BEATLES__ That's true, but not Beatles level."
"__BEATLES__ Well, what about the Velvet Underground, weren't so many famous bands inspired to start bands after seeing The Velvet Underground."
"__BEATLES__ There are some prominent examples, but I think if we made an attempt to quantify influence that the Velvet Underground would pale in comparison to the Beatles."
