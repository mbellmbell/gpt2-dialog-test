"__STAR_WARS__ What's your take on the new Star Wars trailer?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Quite eerie really."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It sure seems like they are signaling that Jedis will no longer be a part of the universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ My guess is that Luke knows you have to be on the light and dark side in order to be efficient."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a solid guess.  He probably realizes that to survive, one needs to be of both minds."
"__STAR_WARS__ The poster alludes to it as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Check out the red and blue lightsabers meeting and joining.  I think it's foreshadowing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting idea.  Maybe you're right1"
