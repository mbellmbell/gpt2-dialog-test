"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey man, how's it going?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good dude, what's up with you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, nothing much, just starting out my summer break"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's cool. Any big plans?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Some trips and then I want to get caught up on some good movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, that sounds like a plan. What movies are you going to see?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I want to see the new Baywatch movie"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh I hear that's horrible"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh whatever, it has gorgeous girls in bathing suits in it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, but sometimes not even that can overcome bad acting"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But it also has the Rock in it. He's a good actor"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh please."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He was good in Fast and Furious"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh come on now. That was so campy"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, I thought he did a good job"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No way, those movies are horrible"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Are you kidding?! They're great"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No way man. The plots are full of holes"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well we'll have to agree to disagree on this one"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Okay fine."
