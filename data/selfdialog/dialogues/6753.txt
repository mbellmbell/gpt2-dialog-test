"__STAR_WARS__ How do you feel about the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did not think that they were as bad as everyone thinks."
"__STAR_WARS__ How about Jar Jar Binks?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Now that's something that everyone got right. He was pretty annoying."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah he really didn't do much even after Queen Amidalia got in the senate."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was surprised that the original senator turned into the emperor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah he seemed like such a good guy in episode 1 the phantom manis."
"__STAR_WARS__ He must have been smart to plan all that."
"__STAR_WARS__ But how cool was Darth Maul when they opened those double doors and he turned his double light saber on one side at a time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The best."
