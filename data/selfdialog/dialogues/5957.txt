"__STAR_WARS__ There's something odd about the Star Wars universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's a trillion odd things. What bugs you now?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Lightsabers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, we know they're not possible and if they were real you'd melt your own body off."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, not that--that's the science fantasy portion."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then, when is it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That they have to press a button to activate the lightsaber."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why's that weird?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The technology should be able to recognize who is using it, and that shouldn't be necessary."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it gives them a better grip and more concentration."
