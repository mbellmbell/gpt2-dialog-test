"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen Suicide Squad yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I have and I loved it! Who's your favorite character?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Harley Quinn. She's something else. Joker was ok too."
"__SUPERHERO__ I really didn't like Jared Leto as The Joker. I miss Heath Ledger."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh trust me we all do. But Will Smith was the comic relief in my opinion."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes he makes any movie great."
"__SUPERHERO__ Which character's powers would you like to have?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'd love to have the Witch's powers but I'd like to be able to control them myself."
"__SUPERHERO__ Good choice. I would like to have the Diablo's powers to manipulate fire."
"__SUPERHERO__ That is a pretty cool power but kind of dangerous no?"
