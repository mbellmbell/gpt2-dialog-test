"__MUSIC__ So, how do you feel about the blues?"
"__MUSIC__ As a genre? Well, I'm not a huge fan."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, it's hard to describe, but I just feel that I can't really connect with the music in a way the artists intended."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think that has to do with the time we're living in, now?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. To me, the blues is all about the historical moment in which artists like John Lee Hooker lived."
"__MUSIC__ It's interesting because didn't those artists sort of come out of retirement in the 1960s?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, because bands like the Rolling Stones were huge blues fans."
"__MUSIC__ See, that's always been so funny to me, that Mick Jagger was a well-off white kid who studied economics in London, but he wanted to sound like a bluesman."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think we always are fascinated by those whose lives are unlike ours, who say something about the human condition."
"__MUSIC__ Clearly Mick, and Keith Richards, who was in art school at the time, felt the music spoke to them in some way."
"__MUSIC__ Being disaffected young men, I'm sure it did, because that's what the blues and rock and roll are all about."
"__MUSIC__ So, how do you feel about those blues revival bands in the 1960s rock scene?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like the Stones just fine, but I'd say that their best material was behind them by the mid Seventies."
"__MUSIC__ Any other bands you would recommend from that time?"
"__MUSIC__ The Pretty Things are an awesome '60s blues/rock/psychedelic band from that era. I think at one time they shared a member or two with the Stones."
"__MUSIC__ So the Pretty Things were kind of covered by the British music press around the same time as the Stones, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were outraged by their defiant attitude and long hair, and their songs being about drugs."
"__MUSIC__ Are there any good current blues artists out there?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, who I would say merged blues with punk and some hip-hop influences."
