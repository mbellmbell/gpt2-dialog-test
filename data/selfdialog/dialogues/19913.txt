"__MOVIES__ So, you ever seen the movie Cemetery Man?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh... maybe, that sounds kind of familiar... guessing it's a zombie film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, sorta... it's got zombies in it, but that's only part of the plot."
"__MOVIES__ Well, refresh my memory."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, it's it Rupert Everett as a guy who runs a cemetery and a few days after a body's buried they come back to life as a 'Returner' so he shoots them are re-buries them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wait, I think I remember that.. and he's got this really obese assistant or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's Nagi."
"__MOVIES__ And there's this girl that keeps appearing over and over again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was kind of a bizarre.. not sure I really understood parts of it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I have a theory about it."
"__MOVIES__ Ahhh... bet you do."
"__MOVIES__ Hehe!  Seriously though, my theory is that both him and Nagi are dead and stuck in some sort of purgatory.  For the Dellamorte he's probably there because he loved but killed that girl, so she keeps showing up to torment him."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm.. that's sounds interesting.  Like I said, it's been awhile since I've seen the movie, so I can't really argue one way or another."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's one of my top 50 or so favs, I rewatch it about once a year."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, having no social life sure is nice, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Ow, ow.. .that's hurts."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sorry, that was a bit of a low blow.  Forgive me, bro."
"__MOVIES__ Ahhh.. I can't really argue with it.  I do watch too much TV sometimes.  I just relate more to fictional people I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's not that uncommon, so I'm told anyway."
