"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for the Lions' season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup! I hope they have a good team this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. They always find ways to disappoint."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope I can watch the games this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't watch the games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rarely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The stupid blackout policy the commissioner thinks is necessary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's that? I've always seen the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL says that if a certain percentage of tickets aren't sold in the stadium, that local and regional airings of the game are blacked out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Meaning what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't air. At all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? That's not fair!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do they have that policy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ticket sales. If everyone watches it at a bar or at home, the team makes far less money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get that, but it's still unfair."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, there's always a portion of the population who dies to go to the game to get the live experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus not everyone can afford the tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guarantee you if they make tickets far less expensive, they'll make the same amount of money and have all games sold out."
