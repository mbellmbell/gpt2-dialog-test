"__DISNEY__ Do you think Snow White ever forgot any of the dwarves names?"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe at first. But they are all pretty specific."
"__DISNEY__ There were seven dwarves right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes and they all were named after different attributes."
"__DISNEY__ Name all of the dwarves then."
"__DISNEY__ Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, Bashful, Happy..."
"__DISNEY__ Can't think of the other two can you?"
"__DISNEY__ I can! They're on the tip of my tongue!"
"__DISNEY__ Doc and Sneezy!"
"__DISNEY__ I can't believe I forgot! I'm such a Dopey."
