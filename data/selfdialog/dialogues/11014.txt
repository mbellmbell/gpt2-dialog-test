"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how do you think the Seahawks will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know - I had so much hope last year but the season really disappointed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say last season was a disappointment?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they just lost too many games, haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think they lost so much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks' offense just wasn't getting the job done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they have improved their offense for this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That remains to be seen - hopefully they've made some improvements."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What kind of improvements would be the most helpful?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, some people say that Seahawks' quarterback didn't perform up to his capabilities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would they say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the quarterback is the backbone of the offence, and the team was seen as simply not scoring enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But lack of scoring isn't all the quarterback's fault, is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not entirely, but he is the easiest to blame, haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you go to any Seahawks games last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I prefer to watch the games on TV."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You watch the games at home?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will watch them at home, or sometimes at a bar when I feel like getting out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you consider yourself a Seahawks fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only when they are winning, haha."
