"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the greatest NFL team of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pittsburgh Steelers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?! How can you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've won 6 Super Bowls"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what about the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've only won 5"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they have Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You asked me about the greatest team in the NFL, not the QB"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think the Patriots have the upper hand."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have more iconic players and they've done more recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're forgetting about the Steelers of the 70s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm too young to remember."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the problem. You're only comparing recent history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it was a different generation of football back then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Doesn't matter. Still in the Super Bowl era."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the game's changed so much since the 70s."
