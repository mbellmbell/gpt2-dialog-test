"__HARRY_POTTER__ Who do you think the most over rated wizard in the Harry Potter movies is?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's easy, all the Malfoys."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, especially Luscious.  I mean everyone was terrified of this guy and he hardly did anything except spew threats."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like the Mr. Weasly stood up to him and he seemed to back down.  Gives me the impression that maybe Malfoy was all talk."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Voldy seemed to have esteem for him at one point.  But he turned out to be a punk."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, you can see at the end he looks like hell."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Might have been interesting to see him fight.  Although it seems his wife might be stronger than him, at least mentally."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Any Draco, although he was like his dad.  All talk and no fight."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Always claiming how tough he was and never really fought anyone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I wish Harmine would have turned him into a toad."
