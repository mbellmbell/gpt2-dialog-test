"__MOVIES__ Do you like horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do, but only if they're not gory. I can't stand looking at guts and blood. It grosses me out."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'When a Stranger Calls'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, with Camilla Belle as the babysitter?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. There's another version that was made first, in 1979."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I haven't seen that one."
"__MOVIES__ I have, but I prefer the 2006 film with Camilla more."
"__MOVIES__ I was so freaked out the entire movie. I thought the kids were goners."
"__MOVIES__ It's rare that horror movie Directors kill off children. They were just upstairs sleeping."
"__MOVIES__ It was good that they didn't show the children until the end. It made you cling to your seat."
"__MOVIES__ What'd you think about what happened to the Housekeeper?"
"__MOVIES__ That was crazy! She was positioned under the deck in the pond!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, so creepy. I knew something would happen in that room. Why else would there be birds and a pond INSIDE the house?"
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I was frustrated because I felt like the Police weren't very helpful."
"__MOVIES__ They weren't helpful at all! You'd think after she called so much they would physically come to check on her!"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it was because of the bad weather?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. It was raining and it was windy, but come on, they could've checked on her."
"__MOVIES__ True. How did you feel the Director handled the killer's character?"
"__MOVIES__ I like that they didn't really show his face. It made it creepier."
"__MOVIES__ I think so too, but I hated that we didn't really know who he was. The ending was unsettled."
