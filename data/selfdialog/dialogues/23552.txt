"__DISNEY__ Did you see the Cars 3 trailer? The graphics changed a lot."
"__DISNEY__ Well, the other trailers didn't have the same quailty, but still better than the first two."
"__DISNEY__ It must have been to for the dramatic scene then."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, some scenes are given extra details in animation."
"__DISNEY__ When I see a drastic shift in art quailty, I get taken out of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Lightning McQueen crashing like that and changing from plastic to a gritty art style will make people notice."
"__DISNEY__ I know they do that to get people feel a certain way but still."
"__DISNEY__ It's just a trailer. Maybe the whole movie will still look like plastic."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the trailer is sometimes different than the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I can't wait to see how it turns out."
