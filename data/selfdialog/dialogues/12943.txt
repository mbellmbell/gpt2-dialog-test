"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, are you as excited for the NFL season as I am?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it! I can't wait to see my Packers in action."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think they have a shot to win it all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely! Aaron Rodgers is the best quarterback in the league. I think he can lead us to another Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really think Rodgers is the best in the whole NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I do. Who would you put ahead of him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um, Tom Brady maybe? The greatest quarterback who ever played the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady's great and all, but he's almost 40! He's way too old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Brady didn't look too old in the Super Bowl against the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it's a year later, and Father Time is still undefeated. I'd rather have the 33 year old quarterback than the 40 year old one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever. We'll just agree to disagree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll settle it at the Super Bowl. If your Patriots even make it that far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's going to beat us in the AFC? Name one team that has a realistic shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pittsburgh, for one. Maybe the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pittsburgh can't beat us in the playoffs. And the Raiders are still too young to be a real threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carr looks good though. I think he's the real deal at QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair enough. But who knows what he's going to be like coming back from that injury?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was so disappointing last year. I was really looking forward to a Raiders/Patriots matchup in the AFC championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe we'll get to see it this year. And then we'll get to see the Pats and the Packers in the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, that would be so sweet."
