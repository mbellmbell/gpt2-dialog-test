"__DISNEY__ Do you think Disney will ever stop making Pirates movies?"
"__DISNEY__ If people keep spending money, they will keep making them."
"__DISNEY__ What is it about pirates that people are so attracted to?"
"__DISNEY__ I think part of it is the romantic lifestyle of always moving. And the gold helps."
"__DISNEY__ People do love money they don't have to work for."
"__DISNEY__ I would say Johnny Depp has worked pretty hard for the money he made on these movies."
"__DISNEY__ He has done a lot of them. His character is so flashy and yet somehow vulnerable."
"__DISNEY__ I think the outlandishness is there to cover up the vulnerablities."
"__DISNEY__ That makes sense. I wish we could get a bit more of his back story, how he came to end up a pirate without remorse."
"__DISNEY__ I think he has a good deal of remorse."
