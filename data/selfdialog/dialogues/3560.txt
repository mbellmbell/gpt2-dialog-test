"__MUSIC__ Every time I hear 'You'll be In My Heart' I throw up a little."
"__MUSIC__ That's gross. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Not literally, silly."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I know, you're Mr. Metaphor. So why does it bother you?"
"__MUSIC__ It won the Oscar for best original song."
"__MUSIC__ So? That means it's good!"
"__MUSIC__ But, it wasn't deserved. It's boring and generic beyond belief."
"__MUSIC__ I can believe it."
"__MUSIC__ Of course you would."
"__MUSIC__ So, who should have won?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Blame Canada' by Matt and Trey from South park."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were nominated and it's far more original."
"__MUSIC__ But it's such a short song."
"__MUSIC__ Short and sweet."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you like it so much? I know you love South Park but there's gotta be more."
"__MUSIC__ It's just super well-done. I bet they loved it and didn't want to look bad by giving a song with curse words an award"
"__MUSIC__ Plus they probably find it immature."
"__MUSIC__ It's just...Phil Collins and his music are so boring."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that, but it's still nice to listen to, and the song works in the context."
