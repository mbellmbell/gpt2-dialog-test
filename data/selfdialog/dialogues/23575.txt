"__DISNEY__ How well do you remember the Mulan movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, it was one of my favorite Disney movies!"
"__DISNEY__ Huh, why is that?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, duh, Mulan, the female lead character is represented as a very strong person."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, let me test your knowledge then. Which actor played Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ I've got this. The actor for Mulan's speaking voice is Ming-Na Wen and Lea Salonga did Mulan's singing voice."
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm. I can't verify that without using Google, but you seem confident. I believe you."
"__DISNEY__ What do you think of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ It wasn't my favorite Disney movie, but I definitely got a kick out of Eddie Murphy as Mushu."
"__DISNEY__ You can't beat Eddie Murphy for comic relief."
