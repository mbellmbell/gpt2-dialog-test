"__HORROR__ I really want to see The Babadook."
"__HORROR__ Really? It just looks okay, to be honest."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, but I want to see it because it's pride month and apparently The Babadook is an LGBT horror movie."
"__HORROR__ What? How does that even exist?"
"__HORROR__ Apparently there's some kind of underlying plot points which a lot of gay people familiarize with."
"__HORROR__ For some reason I feel like the Babadook might be a monster coming out of the closet."
"__HORROR__ No no, I don't think i will be that easy. I do know however that the Babadook does have jazz hands and a top hat."
"__HORROR__ It does sound kind of good, and gay people tend to have good taste. There aren't a lot of gay horror movies, I think maybe Martyrs is the only other one I've seen."
"__HORROR__ Martyrs? What's that about?"
"__HORROR__ Oh it's crazy. Probably one of the goriest movies I've ever seen. They literally skin a girl alive and  only leave the face."
