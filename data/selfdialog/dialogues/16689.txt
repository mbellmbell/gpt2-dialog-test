"__MOVIES__ Man, I wish I could find a movie like Superbad."
"__MOVIES__ Superbad is great, have you tried any of Judd Apatow's movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've seen most of them and I'm a big fan. I want something fresh."
"__MOVIES__ Got it. So a comedy with teens who get into trouble?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that sounds about right."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen all of John Hughes' movies?"
"__MOVIES__ What has he done again?"
"__MOVIES__ Breakfast Club, 16 Candles, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've seen all of those, I love his stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm...Let me think then."
"__MOVIES__ I want to add that I'd rather watch something more current."
"__MOVIES__ I just thought of the perfect movie for you."
"__MOVIES__ What is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called DOPE."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's like if Superbad took place in the hood."
"__MOVIES__ When's it from? I haven't heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It came out in 2015. It's on Netflix right now."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, but what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ These nerdy, do gooder black high school students end up a secret club and get mixed up in a crime. A lot of hilarious debauchery follows."
