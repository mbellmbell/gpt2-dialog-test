"__MOVIES__ I bought the Lego Batman Movie on DVD and watched like an hour ago."
"__MOVIES__ How was it? Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it today and thoroughly enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ How could you not?  For one thing, it is kid friendly."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Plus it had an impressive amount of references to all Batman media of the past (including the really old 1940s serials that predate the '60s Adam West stuff) and a whole host of blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos from some very obscure corners of his rogues gallery."
"__MOVIES__ It is also genuinely funny and with more heart than you could reasonably expect from a film so inherently daft."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's the best Batman film I've seen since Dark Knight."
"__MOVIES__ I love that the references didn't stop at just DC either. Everything from Harry Potter to LotR to even Doctor Who was referenced."
"__MOVIES__ 'Ask your nerd friends.' That movie cracked me up."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the lighthearted jab at Marvel as well- Batman's password being 'Iron Man Sucks'."
"__MOVIES__ That was classic. Man that is a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Fantastic movie."
"__MOVIES__ Hilarious and touching, with some great nods (and jabs) at DC history."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely."
"__MOVIES__ Really funny,"
"__MOVIES__ I remember watching it in the theater. Everyone was cracking up the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ They got some obscure characters in this. Crazy Quilt, Clock King, Catman, Gentleman Ghost, Egghead, The Wonder Twins, Chief O'Hara."
"__MOVIES__ Kite Man makes an appearance! Did you see him?"
"__MOVIES__ Kite Man?!  Made my day!"
"__MOVIES__ The thing is filled with DC Characters old and new. It's part of the enjoyment!"
