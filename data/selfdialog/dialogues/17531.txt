"__MOVIES__ This past year I wanted to prepare for the Oscars by watching as many of the nominated movies as I could."
"__MOVIES__ That is a very cool idea. What was your favorite Oscar nominated movie you watched this year?"
"__MOVIES__ La La Land was definitely my favorite. It was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. It is sort of a jazzy musical but also romantic comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good. Did it win Best Picture?"
"__MOVIES__ No! Unfortunately it did not."
"__MOVIES__ What movie won?"
"__MOVIES__ Moonlight won Best Picture."
"__MOVIES__ Did you watch that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope I never got to it. I did watch a couple other nominated movies though."
"__MOVIES__ What was your second favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Hidden Figures."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I have heard of that one! That is about the women who helped NASA right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It stars Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer."
"__MOVIES__ It also has Kevin Costner in it right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it does. They all are so amazing in it!"
"__MOVIES__ Nice! I saw the previews for that movie and it looked really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Next year my goal is to watch every single movie nominated for Best Picture before the Oscars happen."
"__MOVIES__ That is a great idea, I think I will do it with you!"
