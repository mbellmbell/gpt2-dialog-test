"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite movie growing up, as a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ I used to watch a lot of movies as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Was there one that really stood out, for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was 101 Dalmatians."
"__MOVIES__ The old animated one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, I'm way too old to have watched the modern live action one with Glenn Close."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, that makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ As a child, I couldn't get enough of that movie."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like so much about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably mostly just the cute dogs! But also, I think I liked Cruella DeVille as a villain."
"__MOVIES__ The cute dogs I get. Why did you like Cruella?"
"__MOVIES__ I think as a kid, she was just the perfect level of scariness. Not too scary, but scary enough."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I could see how as a kid, you don't want something too terrifying, but you like to be frightened just a little bit."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what it was like."
"__MOVIES__ I used to watch Care Bears movies a lot as a child."
"__MOVIES__ I think I watched the show a little bit, but never all that much."
"__MOVIES__ There was a movie where the Care Bears went to the world of Alice in Wonderland. That was my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty out there!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I bet it seemed super weird to my parents, but I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ And of course, you'd never read Alice in Wonderland, so all that stuff was pretty fresh for you."
