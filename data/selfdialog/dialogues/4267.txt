"__MUSIC__ What would you say is the most beautiful song of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ When you say 'beautiful', do you mean something other than 'best'?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely! There's a big difference."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's say you think the song 'Angel of Death' by Slayer is the best song. It would be hard to also call that the most beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ Because it's got a harsh sound to it? OK, I get it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so my question is about what song you find most beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ I think I might choose the song 'Volare'."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of it."
"__MUSIC__ It's not an American song, nor is it sung in English."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, that's interesting. That's probably why I don't recognize it."
"__MUSIC__ There are actually two versions of the song, one Spanish and one Italian."
"__MUSIC__ Which of those do you like most?"
"__MUSIC__ The Italian one is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Is it sung by someone in particular?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Andrea Bocelli does a beautiful rendition of it."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of him. He sings mostly Opera music, right?"
"__MUSIC__ That's where he got his start. But I think he's kind of a cross-over singer."
"__MUSIC__ I'll give 'Volare' a listen when I get a chance."
"__MUSIC__ You will really love it, I think!"
