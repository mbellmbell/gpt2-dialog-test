"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have been ready a long time for football season actually!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean, life is very bring without the NFL!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you had the chance to go to any Carolina Panthers games the last couple of seasons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have went to a couple, but not as many as I would like."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either! I am wanting to go a few times this upcoming season though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That should be fun, what kind of team do you think we will have this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is hard to tell judging on the past two seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, the year before last was awesome. However, last year was a major let down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure was!  I am still scratching me head about last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me and you both. Hopefully Ron Rivera will figure things out though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am kind of concerned about Cam Newton myself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he did not quite seem like himself last year for whatever reason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he will go back to playing like he was when he took us to the Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will, I am more concerned with how the defense performed last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The front office made some great moves in re-loading our front line this off season. So I am hoping that works."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me to, I am glad we were able to resign Mario Addison as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea that was very big! He is a nice asset to our defense in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus we still have Luke Kuechly, and that is the most important thing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I think he is one of the best linebackers in the entire league."
