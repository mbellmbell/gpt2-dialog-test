"__STAR_WARS__ What is a saddest part of Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think when Anakin is burning is a sad part"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He is getting burned slowly by lava and doesn't get any help?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was nearby to help him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Obi Wan was right there!"
"__STAR_WARS__ And Obi Wan didn't help him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not at all, he let him burn"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought Obi Wan was good?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but Anakin was so angry that he would take every chance to hurt Obi Wan at that time"
