"__MOVIES__ You know that new Transformers movie looks like it will be good."
"__MOVIES__ Transformers 5? The Last Knight?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, man. What do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ You know I like my transforming robots. I grew up watching their cartoons."
"__MOVIES__ Those were the days."
"__MOVIES__ Good cartoons and good TV."
"__MOVIES__ I was watching the trailer and the humans are at war with the Transformers."
"__MOVIES__ That's no surprise. The humans are always at war."
"__MOVIES__ What are you saying? Humans don't like peace?"
"__MOVIES__ Look around you and then you tell me."
"__MOVIES__ True, true. But back to the movie, you know Optimus Prime is gone."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, saw that last movie. This is reminding me of the story they did in the cartoon."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. With Optimus gone Cade, Bumblebee, some English lord and an Oxford professor have to save the world."
"__MOVIES__ So you think. Optimus will prevail in the end and save the day."
"__MOVIES__ They say The Last Knight 'shatters the core myths of the Transformers franchise, and redefines what it means to be a hero,'"
"__MOVIES__ Redefines what it means to be a hero?"
"__MOVIES__ The story picks up with Humans and Transformers warring, with Optimus Prime out of the picture."
"__MOVIES__ Okay and?"
"__MOVIES__ In it they try to explain why the Transformers keep coming to Earth."
"__MOVIES__ Because they are gluttons for punishment. Enough said."
