"__MUSIC__ I just watched a special on Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ I never really cared for him."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that really wasn't my kind of music."
"__MUSIC__ How could you not like his music though?  It's so catchy!"
"__MUSIC__ There are a few songs that everyone knows, but it's nothing that I love."
"__MUSIC__ So you don't sing along when 'Billie Jean' comes on?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't say that.  I just really don't care for him."
"__MUSIC__ What I'm saying is the guy had so many good songs!  Everyone has a few favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Just because I have a few songs by him that I know doesn't make him a better artist."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know how many current artists were influenced by Michael Jackson?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure a few."
"__MUSIC__ Not a few.  A lot."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, really.  Not just musically either; as performers."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess he was a really good performer."
"__MUSIC__ So you wouldn't have wanted to see him live in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Like I said, I just don't like the music.  So no."
"__MUSIC__ You are crazy.  He is the King of Pop."
"__MUSIC__ To each his own."
