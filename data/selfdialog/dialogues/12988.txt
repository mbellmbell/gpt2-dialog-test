"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you a big fan of football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I am, but it is hard being a fan of my team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Vikings! They always get so close and then choke in the playoffs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow that is harsh, I remember they started off strong last year and fell off. At least your team is hosting the Super Bowl this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea that is nice, I sure hope the Vikings are in the Superbowl as well though. What is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am actually a huge cheesehead and love the Packers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no our favorite teams are rivals! But I respect how well your organization is run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks for that, I hate it when people take their fandom too seriously."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree it really ruins the fun of sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We also both got to enjoy the greatness that is Brett Favre!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea his two years here were the most fun I have had watching the Vikings since the Randy Moss years!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was weird watching him play and beat the Packers up but I agree it was amazing to see him have such great seasons at the twilight of his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Weird? Don't you mean great! Haha at least we aren't Patriots fans right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man you can say that again. Remember how great the 2007 season was when they lost in the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do! That was such an amazing game. They are such a good team and I respect them but I can't help but root for them to lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly! I can't believe the Giants beat them. What was your favorite part of the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was easily David Tyree's leaping one-handed catch. That was amazing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember standing up and cheering in the bar I was at when that play happened! Wow Eli Manning had a great game in that Super Bowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea he is a pretty good quarterback, but I think we both agree he isn't as good as the legend Brett Favre!"
