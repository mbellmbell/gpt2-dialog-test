"__DISNEY__ Who's your favorite DIsney princess?"
"__DISNEY__ I really like Jasmine!"
"__DISNEY__ Why is she your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ Mainly two reasons. First, she looks most like me--long dark hair, you know?"
"__DISNEY__ That makes sense. What's the other reason?"
"__DISNEY__ She's independent with some spunk--like how she's not going to let anyone tell her who to marry!"
"__DISNEY__ So true! I think Pocahontas is like that too."
"__DISNEY__ How so?"
"__DISNEY__ She listens to her heart and makes decisions she believes are right, instead of just listening to other people."
"__DISNEY__ So true, they are similar in that way."
