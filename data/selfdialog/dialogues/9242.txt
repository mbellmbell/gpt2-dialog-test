"__BASEBALL__ What time is Eric's ball game today?"
"__BASEBALL__ It starts at noon, but we're supposed to be there about 11:00."
"__BASEBALL__ Really?  Why an hour early."
"__BASEBALL__ The coach wants to talk to the parents."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh geez, let me guess... He's quitting."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know."
"__BASEBALL__ I'll bet he's quitting.  That would make the third coach in two years."
"__BASEBALL__ Don't get ahead of yourself."
"__BASEBALL__ Well... It's hard not too.  It's frustrating."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, Eric loved baseball when he started with Coach Roberts."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, Roberts was a great coach, all the kids loved him"
"__BASEBALL__ I get it though.  I mean, how much can a guy take?"
"__BASEBALL__ I know! I would never have stayed as long as he did with all the crazy, screaming parents."
"__BASEBALL__ I'll never understand how two adult men can get into a fist fight over a little league baseball game."
"__BASEBALL__ Me either!  People are nuts!"
"__BASEBALL__ Why can't they get into their heads it's just a little league game for fun!"
"__BASEBALL__ They all take it like their kid is in the World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ If their kids had any real talent, they would playing in the pay leagues so just let them have fun and make mistakes"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm surprised Roberts made it as long as he did."
"__BASEBALL__ I know I would never volunteer for it!"
