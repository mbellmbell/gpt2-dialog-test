"__HORROR__ Do you remember the Blair Witch Project?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I saw that in the theatre."
"__HORROR__ Did you like it?"
"__HORROR__ I wouldn't have categorized it as horror."
"__HORROR__ Really, you weren't scared?"
"__HORROR__ The whole theatre was laughing.  We were nauseated by the camera."
"__HORROR__ It didn't look real?"
"__HORROR__ The day before it came out, the 'missing' crew came out to give interviews."
"__HORROR__ Oh, that ruined it."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I think it would've been scarier if we thought it was real."
