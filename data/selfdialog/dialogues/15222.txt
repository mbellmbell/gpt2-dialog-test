"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love when Harry is in the zoo with the Dursley family and he accidentally lets the snake loose."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like that part too! That's the first time Harry realizes he can talk to snakes."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also like when Harry, Ron and Hermione have to fight past all of those different challenges to find Professor Quirrell and fight Voldemort."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That part used to scare me when I was little, especially when Voldemort and Quirrell separate from each other and Voldemort's soul is flying around the room."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can see how that would be scary. Who's your favorite character in the movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really like Hagrid. He just seems so jolly and I can tell he's going to be a big part of the rest of hte movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like Hagrid too. I also think I like Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Snape? How come? He's the meanest character in the whole movie!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm not sure why I'm drawn to him. I just feel like there's more to him than the eye can see."
