"__MUSIC__ So do you listen to music often?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I almost always have Pandora running while I work!"
"__MUSIC__ Cool, do you have any stations you like a lot?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I have several devoted to soundtracks that I think are pretty perfect."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, multiple ones just for soundtracks? How come?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they all have different moods. Some are soft, some are exciting, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so what's your favourite of those?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly I really like sad soundtrack pieces, they always feel so rich."
"__MUSIC__ What's the station based off of?"
"__MUSIC__ The sad one is songs based off of Lily's Theme from Harry Potter and the Finding Nemo theme."
"__MUSIC__ Very nice, I like both of those songs!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're great. I also have a station based off of Harvey Two Face from the Dark Knight."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I bet that's a great station. The violins in that piece are amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Zimmer and James Newton Howard did such a good job."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, was that a collaboration? No wonder it worked so well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it worked so well because Zimmer is great with action beats but Howard can do the emotional beats, so they complemented each other well."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed, those are two of my favourite soundtrack artists."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame they stopped after that one, Howard didn't work on Rises."
"__MUSIC__ That explains why that soundtrack wasn't as good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, collaboration just makes for better art pretty much every time."
