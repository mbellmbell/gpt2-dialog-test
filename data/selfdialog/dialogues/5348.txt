"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the new Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue One or Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Force Awakens - did you like it?  I really liked how it felt like one of the originals."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked that it had the same great characters. I loved seeing Han & Leia and of course, Chewbacca."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm excited to see what they will do for the one coming out at the end of the year. I hope they can bring Han back somehow!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know - I swear I almost cried when he died.  It broke my heart.  I heard someone say that maybe he's the one that turned the light saber on."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I heard that theory too.  I think that Kylo Ren is pretty bad though - maybe not evil, but definitely on his way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, he was crazy - totally off his rocker.  I liked it!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that Return of the Jedi is still my favorite.  I just love those ewoks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they're so cute.  Maybe they'll make a return in one of the new movies."
