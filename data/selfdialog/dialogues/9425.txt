"__BASEBALL__ What do you think of the baseball season so far?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's been a little of a surprise, especially with the Cubs struggling."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, everybody and their brother already placed them in the World Series again this year."
"__BASEBALL__ That's true. I got tired of all the bandwagon fans last year."
"__BASEBALL__ I've never seen so much Cubs gear in my life as the season went on."
"__BASEBALL__ I preferred it when they were the loveable losers like in the past."
"__BASEBALL__ That's the way sports and society is now...people jump on the latest trend very quickly."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they will rebound and end up winning the division?"
"__BASEBALL__ I hope not. I can't live through another year of all these 'fariweather fans.'"
"__BASEBALL__ Hopefully, my Cardinals will beat them out this year."
"__BASEBALL__ How long have you liked the Cards?"
"__BASEBALL__ I grew up in the area, so pretty much all my life."
"__BASEBALL__ So, I assume you have been to games before?"
"__BASEBALL__ My dad's company had season tickets that they shared with employees, so we used to go to 8-10 games per year growing up."
"__BASEBALL__ It is probably the best atmosphere in baseball, even when they aren't as good."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I plan on going later this summer when the Cubs come to town."
"__BASEBALL__ That should be a rowdy atmosphere."
"__BASEBALL__ It's going to be great. I'm going to bring my son with me for the 1st time."
"__BASEBALL__ That should be a great time. Let me know how it goes and if he enjoys it."
"__BASEBALL__ I will. Go Cards!!"
