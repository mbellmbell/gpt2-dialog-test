"__BEATLES__ Recently, I have been wondering if all the Beatles had survived, would they still be producing music today?"
"__BEATLES__ Good question. With the success off Paul McCartney, it is a good bet to think that they would have."
"__BEATLES__ Do you think the group would have remained intact?"
"__BEATLES__ I doubt that they would have all the time, but possibly they would have come together for 'reunion' tours."
"__BEATLES__ That would have been something to see -- a reunion tour!  I wonder if they would have kept their original sound?"
"__BEATLES__ I think they would have.  I would be great to hear them together again live."
"__BEATLES__ There are some imitation Beatles groups out there that do a good job imitating them."
"__BEATLES__ I have seen Tribute 1964 where they sing their early songs. They open with 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' and it sounds pretty good."
"__BEATLES__ I have seen that group too.  They even have the Beatles mannerisms down fairly well. 'Ringo' bops his head to the music; 'John' plays the harmonica."
"__BEATLES__ And, 'Paul' even plays a left-handed base guitar!"
