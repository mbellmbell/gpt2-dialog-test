"__DISNEY__ If you could have one pet from a disney movie what would it be?"
"__DISNEY__ Baloo from the jungle book."
"__DISNEY__ Good choice but I don't think you could have Baloo as a pet he's too much of a free spirit."
"__DISNEY__ That's true, I mostly just want to be his friend and have him teach me how to itch by back on trees."
"__DISNEY__ I can see where you're coming from. I loved the Bear-Necessities as a kid. I would drive my mom crazy singing it."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, I used to sing 'Be Like You' all the time. King Louie was pretty cool too."
"__DISNEY__ Yea he was really funny. I always thought that place with all the monkeys seemed kind of fun."
"__DISNEY__ Except in the new version with the giant King Louie. It looked more threatening to me."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yea definitely. I would just want to live with the wolves the whole time."
"__DISNEY__ Oh the wolf parents were so cute!"
