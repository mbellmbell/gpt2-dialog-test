"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like Rey from the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah she reminds me a lot of Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, that's interesting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah just her attitude to the whole thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess you're right, they do kind of have the same attitude so far."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, I wonder if Rey will be like him in the end?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean turn to an evil person?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah the darkside."
"__STAR_WARS__ I doubt it, she's too sweet and innocent."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true but you never know."
