"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the last game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitols?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I was really excited! I was rooting for the Caps."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Me too!  They came back from being behind 3-1 in the series to having it tied up 3-3."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I was so hoping they would win that last game and go on to the Conference finals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, they haven't brought home the cup since they came to Washington."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's still exciting to have hockey here in the Nation's Capitol."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Duh - don't you think that's why they are called the Capitols?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Duh!  Of course.  So nice to be a new team and be able to pick a name and everything."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I like the new team in Las Vegas.  What are they called?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Golden Knights.  How appropriate for a team in Vegas."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did they get some good players?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Just two.  I can't remember their names right now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hey, did you see how Backstrom played in the series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He has really improved this year."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ My other favorite thing was the overtime."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But there was only one in this series.  You know I really love to see a bunch."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I know it's both of our favorite parts of the game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are you going to watch the rest of the playoffs?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Probably not until the Stanley Cup finals.  Who do you think will win the cup?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't know.  It's not as much fun without O-V."
