"__MOVIES__ Do you remember that old Super Mario Bros movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The one from 1993? Yeah, I watched that as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ So did I!"
"__MOVIES__ What brought this up?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I just saw it advertised the other day on a commercial."
"__MOVIES__ Thinking of watching it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably. It has John Leguizamo, who I really like."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's been in some cool stuff since then. And the movie wasn't that bad."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know it doesn't have the greatest rating online, but I thought it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the part with the mushrooms and how Luigi was sure they were telling them something."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too!"
"__MOVIES__ And how angry Mario was. It was certainly something I wasn't expecting."
"__MOVIES__ Who would have thought the red man was so grumpy all the time?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he is a plumber who's now randomly forced to fight dinosaurs."
"__MOVIES__ Hey now, fighting dinosaurs would be awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ And deadly."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but before you died, you'd get to fight a dinosaur! And at least attempt to save a princess."
"__MOVIES__ I was kind of sad that Princess Toadstool wasn't in it, but Daisy was cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Toadstool would have been more classic."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, more classic. But Daisy was part dinosaur, so that's cool."
