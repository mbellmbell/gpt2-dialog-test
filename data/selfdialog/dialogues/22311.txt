"__DISNEY__ I wish they would make another movie like The Emperor's New Groove."
"__DISNEY__ That was a great movie! It was so funny."
"__DISNEY__ Even the villain, Yzma, was funny!"
"__DISNEY__ I loved her and her sidekick, Kronk. I'll never forget that 'Pull the lever, Kronk!' scene."
"__DISNEY__ Also, Kronk could talk to squirrels."
"__DISNEY__ I guess he was more Disney Princess than villain, since he could talk to animals!"
"__DISNEY__ Does that mean Kuzco was the ultimate Disney Princess, since he turned into an animal?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't think that's how it works!"
"__DISNEY__ My favorite part was when Yzma detailed her evil plan, though."
"__DISNEY__ That was hilarious!"
