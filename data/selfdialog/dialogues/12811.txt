"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You ready for some football next month!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Next month? I hate the preseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, why's that? At least it's football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but crappy!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. None of the starters play too long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, don't get me wrong... we're getting close."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Who you rooting for this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but I think the Pats are gonna win it all again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone seems to think that, but I feel like Brady is getting too old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's definitely getting up there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He can say he'll play for however long, but Grandfather Time always win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he feels he's in the best shape of his life."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard him say that. We'll see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's definitely going to be better than Peyton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, definitely. That was sad to see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully Brady goes with some grace."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Watching Manning have to be dragged to a ring by his defense... sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it. And then the HGH scandal..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah. I definitely believed that story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. But whatever, Brady proved he's better than Manning for sure with this last win."
