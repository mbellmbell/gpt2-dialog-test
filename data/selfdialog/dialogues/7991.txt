"__POP__ Did you see that Britney Spears is making music again?"
"__POP__ I did see that but I haven't listened to it yet."
"__POP__ It's actually not bad."
"__POP__ I wouldn't expect it to be. Britney is a queen."
"__POP__ I think the song I heard was called 'Make Me' and it had G-Eazy on it."
"__POP__ I'll check it out. Is it from a new album?"
"__POP__ Yeah. The album is called 'Glory'."
"__POP__ That's awesome. I doubt it will top her old stuff, though."
"__POP__ It definitely doesn't. It's cool she's keeping up with the times, though."
"__POP__ Yeah, it would be sad if she just stopped releasing music altogether. She's an icon."
