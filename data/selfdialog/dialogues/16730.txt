"__MOVIES__ Are you still a fan of Nightmare Before Christmas?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely!"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I wasn't sure. I know you liked it a lot as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ I did, but it's one of those movies that has stood the test of time."
"__MOVIES__ It is a pretty cute movie. I like the character of Jack."
"__MOVIES__ Jack is pretty cool. I like the mayor, the ghost dog zero and sally, oh and sally's father."
"__MOVIES__ All the characters were so creatively designed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! Every time I see it I appreciate something new about the characters' aesthetics and eccentricities."
"__MOVIES__ I like that it's not completely morbid though and it actually pretty heartwarming."
"__MOVIES__ It it very heartwarming. Come to think of it all my favourite christmas movies are pretty morbid though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like Gremlins, and the depression and suicidalness in It's a Wonderful Life."
"__MOVIES__ Those are all great movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Know what my favourite part of Nightmare Before Christmas is though?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ The music. I feel like every single song is written and performed well."
"__MOVIES__ They are, and they are so catchy!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they definitely have a tendency to get stuck in my head."
"__MOVIES__ 'This is Halloween' gets stuck in my head a lot."
"__MOVIES__ For me it's 'What's this?'"
