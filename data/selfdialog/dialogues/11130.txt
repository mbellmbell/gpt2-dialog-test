"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a big football fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I used to watch when I was younger but not anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who was your team when you used to watch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was a diehard Cowboys fan my whole life and still am even though I don't really watch it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I grew up in Vikings territory so I'm a Vikings fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man I am a Viking hater."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, how come?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just got sick of everyone liking them because they are the local team even though they don't like football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So kind of like how you like the Cowboys even though you don't watch football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, I used to like football and watch it every week and I just stuck with my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes sense I guess. Why don't you watch anymore?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I watched I got really into it and it took up all of my time and I just needed a break."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you still watch occasionally then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Once in a while I will watch a game, like on Thanksgiving or if I'm with friends who are watching."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it is always fun to go to the bar and watch with friends."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't drink anymore so I don't go to the bar and watch football. If I am going to watch it will be at a house."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well we watch at my place every Sunday if you want to stop by you sure can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might have to come over and watch the Cowboys beat the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that will never happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We may have to make a friendly wager on it then."
