"__DISNEY__ Hey! How do you feel about the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, I wish they would have stopped making them after the third movie because Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom aren't even in the fourth movie."
"__DISNEY__ True, I see your point. But they've really tried to revamp the whole storyline - especially by adding some Disney theme park rides featuring the Pirates of the Caribbean."
"__DISNEY__ I get that. But I just don't think the movies beyond the third one are any good! They can't live up to the greatness of the first three movies."
"__DISNEY__ So I need to find someone else to go the movies to see the latest one with, eh?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably, yes."
"__DISNEY__ Alright, well, that's okay. What's your favorite most recent Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I actually just watched Moana on Netflix today and enjoyed it. It was a bit short but overall a good storyline and it sure was pretty."
"__DISNEY__ Oh good! I liked it, too!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, turns out I might still be a fan of some of the new Disney movies after all."
