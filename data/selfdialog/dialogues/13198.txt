"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm pumped about the new NFL season. I'm interested in how the teams will work out this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I have my favorite teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the teams, any idea how all of that works?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only because I'm self-taught. I've picked things up here and there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me, how do the teams work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are two conferences, with thirty-two clubs. Sixteen teams per conference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And how do the games work? Must be pretty systematic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the conferences are further split into four divisions, consisting of four clubs within each one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they all get matched up against each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Over a sixteen game season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do they pick who plays and who doesn't?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Each team can have up to 53 players, and of those only46 can be 'active.' playing on game days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a lot of manpower. Lots of active players too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And this doesn't account for possible practice squad players. They're regulated too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For a ball game, football has a lot of rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its not bad though. Could be worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the fact its a homegrown sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All the NFL teams are based in the continental US, I believe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well maybe. I'll look that one up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't heard of teams in Hawaii or Alaska!"
