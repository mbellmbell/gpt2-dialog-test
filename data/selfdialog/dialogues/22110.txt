"__DISNEY__ My kids keep asking to watch Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ I love Disney movies! What are you watching now?"
"__DISNEY__ Now it's Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I loved that! I loved the strong female lead."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it isn't too bad. It makes me want to go on vacation somewhere tropical."
"__DISNEY__ The ending is really fun. And those songs will be stuck in your head."
"__DISNEY__ This chicken is cracking me up, I have to admit!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, there are some really funny parts. You will like it by the end, I promise!"
"__DISNEY__ Well, like all Disney movies, I'm sure I will have learned a lesson."
"__DISNEY__ You are right! There's always a good moral!"
