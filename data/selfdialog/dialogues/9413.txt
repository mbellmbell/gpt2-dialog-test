"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the game between the Braves and Blue Jays the other night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Are you talking about the one where they almost started fighting?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  The Jose Bautista bat flip."
"__BASEBALL__ I did not see the entire game, but I watched the highlights."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about this whole bat flipping thing?"
"__BASEBALL__ I guess it kind of depends on the circumstances."
"__BASEBALL__ So when do you think bat flipping is okay?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well I don't mind it as much when it's a big moment, like a walk off home run."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, but this game the Blue Jays were losing and Bautista just did it for show."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree, that's the impression I got.  That he was doing it more to show up the Braves than to actually celebrate."
"__BASEBALL__ You remember Bautista got in a fight because of all this stuff last year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, with Odor.  That did not turn out well for him."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I think some Braves players were saying Bautista shouldn't want to fight after that."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, that was kind of funny.  But you know what, Bautista can't be afraid of anything either."
"__BASEBALL__ Well anyways, last night Bautista got hit on the thigh with a pitch, and that was that."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, probably justified.  I don't mind those pitches too much as long as you don't go after a player's head."
"__BASEBALL__ And you know Bautista is not going to stop flipping bats."
"__BASEBALL__ No way.  There's almost pressure on him to flip his bat now."
"__BASEBALL__ That's true.  If he doesn't it almost seems like he is giving in to public pressure."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly.  And you know, he can keep doing it as long as the situation warrants it."
