"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about the Cincinnati Reds this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not sure yet."
"__BASEBALL__ They are really young.  I think they might be decent."
"__BASEBALL__ Ya, they have some growing up to do but I agree they could make a run."
"__BASEBALL__ They are really swinging the bats well."
"__BASEBALL__ Ya they have to ride the hot offense while they can.  There pitching is not very good."
"__BASEBALL__ That is true."
"__BASEBALL__ It worries me as the season goes on."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree, they might need to make a trade to bolster there rotation."
"__BASEBALL__ Or maybe they will get Homer Bailey and Anthony Descalfani back."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes.  That would be a major boost for the team."
"__BASEBALL__ If they get those two guys back there rotation becomes a lot better."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes it does.   They could move two current starters to the minors."
"__BASEBALL__ If they do that then there team would be more complete for sure."
"__BASEBALL__ They just have to keep hitting the ball well and get decent pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree.   Think they can make the playoffs?"
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe.  They might be a year or two away from that."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but they are definitely turning the corner."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree.   There manager is doing a great job."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes he is.  Bryan Price is proving to be a good manager."
