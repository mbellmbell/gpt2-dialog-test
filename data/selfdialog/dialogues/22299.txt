"__DISNEY__ You know in Bambi when his mum dies, did you cry?"
"__DISNEY__ You bet I did, that was arguably the saddest moment in any Disney film ever."
"__DISNEY__ Thank God, I thought I was the only one."
"__DISNEY__ Don't worry I think everyone cries when they watch Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ At least Bambi has happy life in the end?"
"__DISNEY__ Really. Do you not remember who the villain was in Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ The villain? I can't really think who it was?"
"__DISNEY__ The villain was mankind."
"__DISNEY__ Crikey mate, that was deep."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I saw it in a Buzzfeed quiz."
