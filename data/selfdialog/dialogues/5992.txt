"__STAR_WARS__ You know, people mock Lucas for turning Star Wars into a cash cow, but the truth is I loved playing with the characters when I was little."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah? You had the action figures?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, pretty much all of them. I could name all of the jedi characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favourite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Adi Gallia, a Tholothian. She was a general in the jedi army."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did she ever show up in the movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, in a few scenes. She's in the jedi council when Anakin auditions, and then she's in the Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Cool, it must have been great to see her on the big screen!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, not in the third movie. She shows up in Order 66. I got to watch her die."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, I bet that made that scene so much more powerful; that's rough."
