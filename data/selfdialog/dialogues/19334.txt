"__MOVIES__ What is your all-time favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh jeez, no way can I pick just one."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, then one of your favorite movies"
"__MOVIES__ Parenthood"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tv show."
"__MOVIES__ No, no it was a movie first.  It came out in 1989."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Steve Martin, Jason Robards, Keanu Reeves"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I think I did see it.  Wasn't it the one where Steve Martin's kid was really nervous and there was that old grandmother?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That's it."
"__MOVIES__ I think I saw it years ago.  I completely forgot about it."
"__MOVIES__ I love the movie.  It's so funny and got sweet scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Ron Howard directed that right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  The only part I didn't like was all the main characters had a new baby at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it flashed forward several years."
"__MOVIES__ No, just about one year.  Some of the characters were already pregnant before they flash fowarded."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Even the older parents of all of them?"
"__MOVIES__ Well sort of.  They were raising their grandson their jerk of a son dumped on them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see.  Maybe they just wanted to get the everyone's happy ending."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but up until that point the movie was very believable and realistic.  I think it kind of messed it up a bit."
