"__MOVIES__ What do you think is the best movie in the Harry Potter series?"
"__MOVIES__ Good question. Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them was pretty good even if it didn't have the original characters in that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I liked the seeing all the animals. Some didn't look like what I expected but I thought the first movie, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone was one of the best."
"__MOVIES__ That's because it was the first. Setting you up for series."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they did a good job. A lot to condense down from the books."
"__MOVIES__ I think the Order of the Phoenix is one my favorites, book or movie."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. It's when things start to get interesting. The movie effects really felt magical."
"__MOVIES__ I think that is part of the best thing about this new technology for movies, they can make it look so real."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah if ever there was magic. The movies from this point forward start to get a little dark."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but they've been edited so you don't feel like you are missing much if read also."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. Back to movies what did you think of Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 1 & 2?"
"__MOVIES__ It was unexpected to have split and so painful to wait for the second part. I would have rather sat for four hours than waited another year!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too but it was great didn't you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was good. I was glad to it stayed true to the books. The special effects were off the hook!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too. Flying around on the back of that dragon! I was getting dizzy!"
"__MOVIES__ The cinematography was very well done and really aided in giving you the feeling of being part of the story."
"__MOVIES__ I thought final fight scene was great."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I was not disappointed though I am still out to lunch on the flash forward in the books and the movies."
"__MOVIES__ It will be interesting to see how the new additions fit in. So far they've done a good job."
"__MOVIES__ I'll go see them and it looks like there are plans for lots more to come!"
