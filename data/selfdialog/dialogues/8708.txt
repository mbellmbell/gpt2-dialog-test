"__BEATLES__ Thinking about it, I'm a really big fan of how vulnerable The Beatles were."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, I know. They wore their vulnerabilities and insecurities on their sleeves."
"__BEATLES__ Think of a song like 'You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.'"
"__BEATLES__ Exactly, it's about fear of heartbreak and of showing your love."
"__BEATLES__ Or 'I'm a Loser'"
"__BEATLES__ Ha ha ha! That's a pretty self-deprecating title."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, it is. I think another great, although less heart-on-the-sleeve is 'Let It Be.'"
"__BEATLES__ Why do you say that?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, the song is about the stresses and troubles and darkness of light and deciding to just let it be."
"__BEATLES__ That's true, I've actually never realized what that song is really about even though I've heard it hundreds of times."
