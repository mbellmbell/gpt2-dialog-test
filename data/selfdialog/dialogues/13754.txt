"__BASKETBALL__ There, there. what was THAT call about?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Hang on. Let me see. Oh, it's a double dribble."
"__BASKETBALL__ Double dribble. What kinda rule is that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ This is an NBA game and we get a double dribble call. ridiculous."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ok. So what is it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ You can only use one hand when dribbling. If you use both hands to touch the ball, and don;t shoot but go back to dribbling, that's called a double dribble."
"__BASKETBALL__ So what happens now?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the ball goes to the opposing team at where the penalty occurred."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, that sucks"
"__BASKETBALL__ This wasn't even intentional, If you look at Hinrich right before the call, he fumbles the ball and drops it and accidentally touches it with both hands."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah it looks like he tripped or something."
"__BASKETBALL__ When they miss the calls is when you get really pissed"
"__BASKETBALL__ like what?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Like, when the referees missed that same double dribble call on Johnson during raptors and trail blazers game"
"__BASKETBALL__ And they didn't call it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Forget not calling they didn't even notice. It was a ridiculously obvious too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well that sucks."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wait until you catch traveling call in the NBA."
"__BASKETBALL__ What's that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Traveling is when a palyer carries the ball without dribbling more than 2 steps. Kimbal Walker walked 5 steps before dribbling the ball. it was ridiculous. There are a bunch more. Traveling is more common than double dribble in NBA."
