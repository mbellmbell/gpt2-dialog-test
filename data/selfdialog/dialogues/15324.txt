"__HARRY_POTTER__ After Dumbledore and Voldemort, who do you think was the most powerful wizard?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm going with Snape.  He went under cover that whole time and was never found."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah that was amazing.  Probably the most well written part of the whole series."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And it shows you the true scope of Dumpledores genius."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That he masterminded the whole plot from the very beginning."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It does kind of bring into question what kind of man he is though.  He sacrificed himself but also a lot of others as well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, indeed he did.  It was for the greater good but who knows maybe there was a better way."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ As powerful as he was, he might have been able to find a way to defeat Tom Riddle.  He was able to destroy horcuxes himself."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But with great difficulty, and Harry ended up a horcrux at the end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I guess you're right.  But he could have stopped Voldy before he went after Harry."
