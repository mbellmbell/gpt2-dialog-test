"__HORROR__ Did you see the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' remake?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, I did."
"__HORROR__ What did you think about it?"
"__HORROR__ It was not my favorite, to say the least!"
"__HORROR__ I just can not see anyone else playing Freddy. Robert England is Freddy."
"__HORROR__ I agree with that. I just don't understand why they felt it should be remade."
"__HORROR__ I agree. Would it kill someone to come up with an orginal idea?!"
"__HORROR__ I know! They are remaking all the classics."
"__HORROR__ Instead of remakes of perfectly good movies they could do more sequels, or just leave them alone!"
"__HORROR__ I agree with that!"
