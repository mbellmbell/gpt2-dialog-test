"__STAR_WARS__ Can't wait to see the next Star Wars installment."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it looks like it'll be good. What's the name of it again?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's called Star Wars: The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow with a name like that you can expect something crazy to happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some people think that Luke Skywalker is the Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe he is planning on starting something totally separate from the Jedi and Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would make a lot of sense since they said he was the one to bring balance to the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ He could start a new group that will utilize both the light and dark side of the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe Rey is the missing key to it all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Daisy Ridley is awesome as Rey. I can't wait to see what she has in store for us."
