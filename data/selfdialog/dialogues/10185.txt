"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Want to know a place that has way more great rappers than you'd expect?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Sure, what's this place?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Long Island, New York."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No way. Long Island is all upper class suburbs isn't it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not exactly. Either way, some great rappers are from there?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Public Enemy, Rakim, MF Doom, KMD, Busta Rhymes, Aesop Rock, and Prodigy to name a few."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, those are some of the most critically acclaimed rappers of all time. Is there an area where most of them come from?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not exactly, but two towns that border on each other, Hempstead and Uniondale are home to Public Enemy and Busta Rhymes among others."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess I need to expand my definition of what New York rap is, i thought it was only the five boroughs. Like Nas from Queens, Wu-Tang from Staten Island, and B.I.G. from Brooklyn."
