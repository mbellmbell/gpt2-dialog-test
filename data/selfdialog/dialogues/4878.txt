"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of Goo Goo Dolls lately."

"__MUSIC__ Probably Slide, a favorite of a lot of people!"
"__MUSIC__ Slide is awesome. I also like Let Love In and Broadway."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard Black Balloon?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. Is it by the Goo Goo Dolls?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, it is on their Greatest Hits album from 2007."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to give it a listen. Every song they sing is so good."
"__MUSIC__ Better Days is also a good song on that album."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I think I've heard that one. Is about New Years?"

"__MUSIC__ Did you know they came out with a new album this year?"
"__MUSIC__ No way! Is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ It definitely isn't as good as their older stuff, but it isn't terrible."

"__MUSIC__ Oh actually I have heard 'Use Me' from that album."
"__MUSIC__ Is 'Use Me' any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it is okay. It doesn't really have their distinctive sound though."
