"__BEATLES__ I was listening to Rain by the Beatles, earlier today."
"__BEATLES__ Is that the one with the weird backwards vocals?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, but it's not really that weird."
"__BEATLES__ Really?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, if you reverse it, it is basically just regular lyrics from the song."
"__BEATLES__ That's actually kind of disappointing. I thought maybe it was about Paul being dead."
"__BEATLES__ I sure if you tried hard enough you could tie it into the conspiricay."
"__BEATLES__ Probably so. Anyway, I have always liked that song."
"__BEATLES__ Me too. Ringo is really on top of his drum game with that one."
"__BEATLES__ I agree. He was so underrated."
