"__BASEBALL__ Did you ever see the movie 61*?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that is a really good movie.  Its about Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle in 1961"
"__BASEBALL__ The year both players made a run at the Babe Ruth home run record."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure, Thomas Jane played Mantle and Barry Pepper played Maris.  They did an awesome job and looked so much like them."
"__BASEBALL__ It was very historically accurate they even showed Roger smoking Camel unfiltered cigarettes."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know how they got them to hit the ball so hard either.  The actors must have had to work hard on their playing skills."
"__BASEBALL__ That and some good editing and great camera work.  The other actors also did great performances."
"__BASEBALL__ They showed Whitey Ford always coming to the rescue of Mickey when he had too much to drink.  Some of the scenes were comical and others were a little sad."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the issue of Mickey abusing himself came up a few times and it was shown in a very realistic light."
"__BASEBALL__ Too bad neither Mickey or Roger lived to see the movie.  I bet they would have liked it, as it was done so well."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah.  They even had Mrs. Babe Ruth in there giving out the MVP award to Roger at the start of the season."
"__BASEBALL__ Maris was somewhat of an under rated player.  He had two really good years at the plate and was just good the rest of the time."
"__BASEBALL__ He was an awesome fielder and good on the base paths.  He retired at a young age, about 33.  Died really young too"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he was a loner type and did not like the limelight.  He retired young after playing two years in St. Louis"
"__BASEBALL__ They said he played his last year because the owner of the Cardinals agreed to set him up in the beer business."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he was set up to have a job after baseball, smart move on his part."
"__BASEBALL__ Players were not paid much as compared to today back then they needed a second career."
"__BASEBALL__ Most of the guys probably blew a lot of the money they made on partying after the games.  Some invested though."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they say Mrs. Babe Ruth tamed the Babe a bit and invested a lot of his money wisely so he would have something after his playing days ended."
"__BASEBALL__ It was a good thing for him as he spent his money like crazy just thinking about having a good time.  Mickey was a little like that too.  Good movie."
