"__MUSIC__ Adele finished the last show on her tour, and said she may neer tour again."
"__MUSIC__ Why? Was it because of the tour?"
"__MUSIC__ No, she said she's not good at touring, she's a homebody."
"__MUSIC__ I don't see why she should have to tour if she doesn't want to- people will still buy her music."
"__MUSIC__ This tour was for her album 25 from 2015."
"__MUSIC__ How long has she been on the road?"
"__MUSIC__ She played 123 shows."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Well, i hope she thinks it was worth it."
