"__MOVIES__ I feel like Hollywood is making too many remakes."
"__MOVIES__ Huh? What do you mean? Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ A remake of The Birds is in the works. That's a classic Hitchcock film. It's already perfection. Leave it alone."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you gotta bring it to a new generation. Kids today aren't gonna watch black and white movies that are super old."
"__MOVIES__ Nonsense. You're not giving people any credit. They will if they are interested in film."
"__MOVIES__ Think about how cool the CGI birds are gonna be."
"__MOVIES__ *Groans*"
"__MOVIES__ Sorry, but it will probably be superior to the original due to better special effects."
"__MOVIES__ Agree to disagree on that. They also remade Carrie. Carrie was perfect. Why remake it?"
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the remake?"
"__MOVIES__ No. And I don't want to."
"__MOVIES__ Then how do you know that it didn't surpass the original?"
"__MOVIES__ I have read many one star reviews of it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe they were written by old, grumpy people."
"__MOVIES__ Like me? Ha! They are also remaking Death Wish and The Craft."
"__MOVIES__ Okay."
"__MOVIES__ Big Trouble in Little China, Don't Look Now, and turning Dumbo in a live action film."
"__MOVIES__ Cool! The Dumbo thing sounds awesome."
"__MOVIES__ You're probably pretty excited about the CGI flying elephant, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah!"
