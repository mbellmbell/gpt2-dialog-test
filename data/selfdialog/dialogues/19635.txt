"__MOVIES__ I was watching a video online and it made me have to ask you: What is one movie that you like or don't hate, but most people you know do?"
"__MOVIES__ The Cable Guy comes to mind. A lot of people I know really hated that movie, but I think it wasn't too bad."
"__MOVIES__ That is the movie with Jim Carrey, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. He obviously plays a Cable Guy, who befriends Matthew Broderick's character."
"__MOVIES__ Can you go a little deeper with the plot? It doesn't sound like much of a movie at the moment."
"__MOVIES__ The idea is Jim Carrey's character basically forces Steven (Matthew Broderick) into a friendship, but he comes on way too strong."
"__MOVIES__ I remember hearing that this movie is also considered a dark comedy. Can you shed some light on that?"
"__MOVIES__ AS the movie goes on and Steven ends the friendship, the Cable Guy begins to stalk him. The movie does become a bit darker with some of the things that go on."
"__MOVIES__ Is The Cable Guy a sadistic madman or just silly?"
"__MOVIES__ He definitely has some problems, but he is a man obsessed with television and film. He almost tries to treat his situation as if it were a movie."
"__MOVIES__ What are some things Jim Carrey does to make this movie a dark comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ One scene that comes to mind is where Steven has a nightmare of the Cable Guy breaking into his apartment and attacking him. He essentially looks like a demon with glowing eyes."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds silly, but also in a scary kind of a way. I can now see why this considered a dark comedy."
"__MOVIES__ There is also a scene in a parking garage where the Cable Guy somehow makes every car's alarm go off and then he starts to do the 'Friday the 13th' sound effects."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds kind of funny. The movie actually doesn't sound like it would be too bad."
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing this when I was a kid, and thinking it was scary. I did not understand the dark comedy elements at that time."
"__MOVIES__ I would imagine it is much funnier watching it now that you are older."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, definitely. So many jokes I missed back then that make me chuckle now."
"__MOVIES__ The Cable Guy sounds like a movie I might consider checking out one of these nights. Is it on Netflix?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe it is, and if so, I would recommend taking the time to give it a watch."
