"__DISNEY__ What was the name of the princess in that one Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Uh, need a bit more help than that."
"__DISNEY__ Sorry, the princess in Sleeping Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, her name is Aurora."
"__DISNEY__ Ah, gotcha.  Wasn't her dress blue?"
"__DISNEY__ It was actually blue and pink."
"__DISNEY__ I only remember blue."
"__DISNEY__ It actually switched.  If you recall, the fairies kept changing it."
"__DISNEY__ Right.  That's how they eventually were found."
"__DISNEY__ Correct.  It was kind of their fault actually!"
