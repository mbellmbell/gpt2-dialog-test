"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hey, you really like the 'Fast and Furious' movies don't you?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, yeah, for sure! They are some of favorite movies! Did you see 'The Fate of the Furious' yet?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, not yet, but I thought I would ask you about it. Did you like it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh yeah, it was awesome! I really like it when the movies kind of take Dom and the team all across the globe; it really gives the stories an 'epic adventure' kind of feel."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Cool! Where did they go in this one?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, I don't want to spoil too much, but they go pretty much everywhere in this one, including Cuba, Russia, and New York."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wow, that's pretty awesome. I am guessing there are some crazy chase scenes like always too, right?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh yeah! There is a crazy scene involving a submarine in Russia that will totally blow your mind!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wow! I really have to see it! Just when you think Dom has done it all, it pulls off some even crazier stunt!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ For sure! This one even tops Furious 7, and that is really saying something!"
