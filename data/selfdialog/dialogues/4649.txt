"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift has won so many awards."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Isn't it insane?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. She is very talented."
"__MUSIC__ I wish her and Kanye West would get over their arguments."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I think they just both need to move on."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it does seem like Kanye is always getting into an argument with someone."
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to like his music when he acts the way he does."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, and it's disappointing because his last album was pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you mean The Life of Pablo?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's it."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard much of that one, but I did like his album Yeezus."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's the one he's most recognized for."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. It seems like to me like he only has a few popular singles here and there."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right. His music isn't really played on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I can only remember Gold Digger being played on the radio and that was a long time ago."
"__MUSIC__ It's been over a decade since it was released."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, time really does fly by."
"__MUSIC__ It sure does."
"__MUSIC__ I used to love Gold Digger when I was younger, but I'm not so sure I would like it now."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know how I feel about it now either."
