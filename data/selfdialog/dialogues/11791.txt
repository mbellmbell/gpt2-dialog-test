"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think the greatest QB in NFL history is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hands down - Peyton Manning!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why Peyton?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He owns all the major passing records and he holds the single season TD record."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going to disagree with you on that one, He only won two Super Bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that is low compared to others, but you have to look at all the records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The records are nice, but winning is why they play the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, who do you think? Bradshaw, Montana, Staubach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on man! You didn't even mention Tom Brady!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, as far as winning he would be the best.  But he always had great teams because of Belichek."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your forgetting that Brady won his Super Bowls in the era of free agency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, most of the other quarterbacks never had to deal with constant turn over of players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's what makes Brady so great, he does it every year with different players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The greatest pure passer was Marino though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was awesome to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Imagine the numbers he would have put up in today's game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, the rules favor the quarterback today more than in the 80's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Marino played today, he may have set records that would never have been touched by anyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he threw a great ball.  Too bad they couldn't get some players for him."
