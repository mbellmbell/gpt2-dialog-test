"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man do you think they will still be going on about Deflate-Gate this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so it seemed to unify the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a team you don't want to give an edge to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Brady didn't say much but he had a chip on his shoulder all season for the last couple of years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He didn't need any extra motivation but they gave it to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah when they talk trash about you you feel the need to prove them wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And do the talking on the field and not with your mouth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bellecheck is pretty good at keeping his guys quiet when stuff like that happens"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, his players that don't know that are soon playing for some other team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and if he really gets mad maybe he'll trade you to Cleavland"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I wonder how Jamie Collins likes playing for the worst team in the leauge"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Should have kept his mouth shut instead of complaining to the media."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear rumors that Cleveland wants to trade New England for Jimmy Garoppolo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard that too on ESPN I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Bellecheck will keep him though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In this league you always need a class second stringer in case of injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They could franchise tag him this year see what happens and trade him next off season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be smart.  I bet that's what they do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so he's good enough to start for most of the other teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And he lasted longer in the league than Johnny Football.  I mean Johnny Manzel."
