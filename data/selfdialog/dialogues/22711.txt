"__DISNEY__ Hey have you watched Dumbo lately?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that's really an old one!  No, it's been awhile."
"__DISNEY__ I still love it.  I watched it with my kids the other day."
"__DISNEY__ I never understood the part with the pink elephants."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, it's simple!  Dumbo and the mouse get drunk and start hallucinating."
"__DISNEY__ That seems kinda weird for a kid's movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, there are some really inappropriate things in the movie.  Fortunately I don't think the kids really notice."
"__DISNEY__ Well, it's a sweet story either way."
"__DISNEY__ It really is.  The part where the mother sings Baby Mine is so sweet."
"__DISNEY__ I know!  I still sing that to my children."
