"__MOVIES__ You know what movie I love?  300."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that movie has made me want to learn all about Spartans."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean.  It's crazy how they fought those odds."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and fought long enough to repel the attack."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, even though they all died."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  That's what makes it so awesome though."
"__MOVIES__ And the Spartans were crazy good warriors."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I wouldn't want to fight them either."
"__MOVIES__ One of my favorite parts is when Leonidis fakes to kneel and cuts Xerksies."
"__MOVIES__ I love it.  And the guy telling the story at the end."
"__MOVIES__ You know what was not good though?  The sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I didn't care much for it."
"__MOVIES__ Until the Spartans came at the end of course."
"__MOVIES__ Of course.  Those guys are beast."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah don't want to be on their bad side."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the Spartan training in the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they make them weapons from day one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and everyone is super fit."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that Sparta was a lot like that."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that too."
