"__DISNEY__ Can you believe that Cars 3 is now out in theaters?"
"__DISNEY__ It's kind of hard to believe there is a Cars 3."
"__DISNEY__ I guess they think people want more Lightning McQueen."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe so. Have you seen any of them?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I've seen Cars and Cars 2. Have you?"
"__DISNEY__ I have. What did you think of them?"
"__DISNEY__ The original Cars was pretty good, but I didn't really care for Cars 2. Things got a little dark for me."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean. I wish they would have just left it alone."
"__DISNEY__ Mater, Doc, Sally, and all the rest of them are what made the first one so good."
"__DISNEY__ I know. If they bring in a bunch of other characters it just won't be the same."
