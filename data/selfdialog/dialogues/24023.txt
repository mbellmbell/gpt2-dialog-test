"__SUPERHERO__ Are you a Marvel or DC fan?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Marvel all the way. DC just doesn't get how to make epic movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, they have good villians but can't seem to deliver on movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ True. Suicide Squad looked promising in the trailers but was very disappointing."
"__SUPERHERO__ I totally agree. It was a butcher job. Did you like Wonder Woman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ It was one of the better DC films I would say."
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought it was worth the watch but still pretty formulaic."
"__SUPERHERO__ I liked the world that they came from and knowing Diana's origin story."
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought the villain was a good surprise too."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I agree."
