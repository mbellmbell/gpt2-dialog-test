"__HORROR__ How many of the Scream movies have you watched?"
"__HORROR__ I think just the first two."
"__HORROR__ The first one was the best out of all of them."
"__HORROR__ How many were there all together?"
"__HORROR__ I think four."
"__HORROR__ I don't like when they keep making them. They should stop at two."
"__HORROR__ Yes, how much could you do with a scary man in a scream mask?"
"__HORROR__ I agree."
"__HORROR__ The first Scream does have the twist of who it actually is though."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, the first time you watch it."
