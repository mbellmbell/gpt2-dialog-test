"__MUSIC__ I am looking for good 'children's' music, do you know of any?"
"__MUSIC__ Is it for little children?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I am looking for something fun and catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I do not really listen to much 'kid's' music."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ I think kids can listen to just about anything."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I never thought about that."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I do keep away from the ones with rough language."
"__MUSIC__ That is probably a good idea!"
"__MUSIC__ My kid likes  music from the eighties, like Bon Jovi, and Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that is pretty different."
"__MUSIC__ Those two are some really different bands, aren't they?"
"__MUSIC__ They are, but they both have some really catchy tunes!"
"__MUSIC__ They really do, and my youngest loves to dance along to the music."
"__MUSIC__ How fun!"
"__MUSIC__ He even tries to moonwalk!"
"__MUSIC__ Does he do any of the other dance moves?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not yet.  He is still really little, so he basically just walks backward."
"__MUSIC__ Well, thanks for the recommendations!  I am off to look for my stash of eighties albums!"
"__MUSIC__ No problem!  Have fun with the 'oldies' music!"
