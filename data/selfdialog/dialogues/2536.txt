"__MUSIC__ So what do you think of Indie music?"
"__MUSIC__ Eh, it's not really my style."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It just always seems second rate, like stuff people couldn't get a label to accept so they just did it themselves."
"__MUSIC__ You, my man, are clearly not listening to the right indie!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh? Then what would you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Personally, I'm a huge fan of the band Of Monsters and Men."
"__MUSIC__ They indie rock, or?"
"__MUSIC__ Indie folk/pop. You might have heard one of their songs, actually--Little Talks, maybe?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually that does sound kind of familiar, were they on the radio any?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were super popular."
"__MUSIC__ Were? Are they not together any more?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh no, they are! There was just a long break between their first and second album."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I see. So are they Canadian or European or...?"
"__MUSIC__ They're from Iceland, actually."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool--no pun intended."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, you're good. They're pretty neat."
"__MUSIC__ So do they sing mostly in Icelandic?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they sing in English. They have two albums so far."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. Maybe I'll check them out--even if they are indie."
