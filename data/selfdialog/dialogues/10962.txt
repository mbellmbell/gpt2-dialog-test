"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Bills firing Rex Ryan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he got a fair shot at the tem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he shouldn't have shot his mouth off on a playoff promise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he only had two seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree two seasons is a short time but he has had other problems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he allowed way too many touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His defense was his downfall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Bills will have a better season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I think they might but again, it is a rebuilding process all over again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many games do you think they will win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I say they win the first game and then lose the next two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But do you think the new coach will allow two consecutive losses?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it would be a tough loss but I think they lose the next two by 10."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the first score."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will win by only 7."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So one touchdown for the win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes or a field goal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will win by 21."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't have a chance to win the first game by three touchdowns."
