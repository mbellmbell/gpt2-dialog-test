"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see Rouge One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I loved it, the effects were incredible."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah it looked amazing, Donnie Yen played such a cool character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah when he was walking blindly through all the gun fire it was sick."
"__STAR_WARS__ I couldn't believe how good it was, I think I liked it better than Episode Seven to be honest."
"__STAR_WARS__ yeah me too, its funny cause its not even part of the main movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah really, but it leaves me hopeful for the other in between movies, like the one about Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ True and it got me even more hyped for Episode Eight."
"__STAR_WARS__ Comes out in December though of course so we have a long wait."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah unfortunately, I can't wait for it."
