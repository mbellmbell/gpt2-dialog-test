"__STAR_WARS__ Do you know how the main cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher picked to be in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I figured there was a big cattle call. I remember that George Lucas wanted to cast unknowns for the main three roles."
"__STAR_WARS__ There were several actors under consideration. They were put in sets of three because they complemented each other well."
"__STAR_WARS__ So Mark, Harrison, and Carrie were a group even before they were given the gig?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right. It was a matter of, pick all of them or none."
"__STAR_WARS__ It must have been such pressure for all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was down to two trios at the end, and then Lucas picked the three we all know and love."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who were some of the actors under consideration?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Kurt Russell was being considered for Han Solo. He had that laid back sarcasm thing that Lucas was looking for."
"__STAR_WARS__ He would have made a good Han. But Harrison, he owns the role forever now."
