"__MOVIES__ Hey, what do you think of all these super hero movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I love them man, I'm a huge fan of both marvel and DC."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, what's been your favorite one so far?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I'd have to go with Suicide squad, I know a lot of people didn't like it, but I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite one lately."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what's your favorite one?"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder woman! It was so good."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet, it seems more catered to women."
"__MOVIES__ No man, it's so good.  Gal Gadot did an amazing job and I was hype the whole movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  I might have to go see it."
"__MOVIES__ You won't regret it.  What's been your least favorite one?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say Batman vs Superman, it was boring and makes no sense to me."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the wonder woman part in it was awesome, but besides that, I'm going to have to agree."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the wonder woman part was cool, but how can a literal super hero not beat a rich guy easily."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, I know what you mean.  It doesn't really make sense."
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, Batman has no super powers! He's just rich and has cool things."
"__MOVIES__ He does have his boxes where he keeps the superhero weaknesses though."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, and back to wonder woman, she has no weakness, so she's probably the best."
"__MOVIES__ RIght? She's awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she is."
