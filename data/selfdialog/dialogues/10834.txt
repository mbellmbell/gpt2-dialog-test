"__FASHION__ Who do you think was the worst dressed at this year's Met Gala"
"__FASHION__ Caroline Kennedy, hands down"
"__FASHION__ Why do you say Caroline was the worst dressed."
"__FASHION__ Although she stuck to the theme, the dress was simply unflattering on her."
"__FASHION__ A agree. What made it unflattering to you?"
"__FASHION__ It just seemed way to large for her body frame."
"__FASHION__ Yes, I agree. It really overpowered her."
"__FASHION__ Right. I hated her shoes as well"
"__FASHION__ They were like little black pilgrim shoes"
"__FASHION__ Yes. Reminded me of the same shoes the Wicked Witch of the West wore in The Wizard of Oz"
"__FASHION__ Yes. They were not very complementary to her dress."
"__FASHION__ Her hair was not complementary to the dress either."
"__FASHION__ I agree. Neither was her makeup. Very plain."
"__FASHION__ It didn't seem like her hair and makeup were done at all."
"__FASHION__ Right. She just put on the dress and figured that was enough, I guess."
"__FASHION__ I would have liked to see her in something with less volume."
"__FASHION__ I agree. One of the more slenderizing designs of Rei Kawakubo would have been nice."
"__FASHION__ Yes. Caroline is tall and slim. I think a drop waist design would have worked better"
"__FASHION__ And better shoes"
"__FASHION__ Yes. A nice pair of stilettos would have looked nice instead of pilgrim heels."
