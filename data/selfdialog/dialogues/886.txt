"__MUSIC__ It's hard to find someone who is not a fan of music. Do you have a particular type of genre?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really a favorite, per say. I can listen to just about anything. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I mostly enjoy rock music. Whether it'd be hard rock, heavy metal, or alternative."
"__MUSIC__ I feel you on that. Same here, but I'm also into some retro music."
"__MUSIC__ Retro as in from the '80's and 90's?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. I listen to a lot of those '90's Alternative stations on my iPhone."
"__MUSIC__ I think when it comes to good music, there are a number of things that make it enjoyable for me."
"__MUSIC__ What comes to mind? Perhaps the lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics are a strong point, for sure. It's always good to hear a strong story unfold."
"__MUSIC__ I completely agree. Instrumentation is something I really enjoy."
"__MUSIC__ I think instrumentation is a huge factor for a rock song."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. Vocals can play a big role in the enjoyment too, in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ I think vocals are most important for a solo act. Such as a Country song, for example."
"__MUSIC__ True. Do you have a particular favorite song of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a hard question, because it is difficult to narrow it down to one song."
"__MUSIC__ I understand. Could you possibly try, for I am curious."
"__MUSIC__ I would have to go with Hotel California by The Eagles."
"__MUSIC__ That is definitely a classic. What made you decide on that one?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, it just brings back a lot of memories and I think it still holds up so well!"
"__MUSIC__ I cannot disagree with that, even though the song's premise is a bit unclear."
