"__MUSIC__ Did you know that the Beach Boy's 'Surfin' USA' is the same song as Chuck berry's 'Sweet Little Sixteen?'"
"__MUSIC__ What? You're kidding."
"__MUSIC__ No. There was even a lawsuit, and Chuck Berry's name was added to the credits of 'Surfin USA' around 1966."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of Chuck Berry's songs sound like the same song, played over and over again."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Just like Bo Diddly's beat."
"__MUSIC__ I think the Beach Boys actually played some of Chuck Berry's music in their early concert tours. With Glen Campbell filling in for Brian Wilson!"
"__MUSIC__ They did. 'Surfin' USA' came out in 1963, I think, and Berry's song had been out since 1958."
"__MUSIC__ I remember George Harrison getting sued for supposedly copying 'He's So Fine'."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that too, but I never hear the similarity."
"__MUSIC__ So if I play 'Sweet Little Sixteen' and then play 'Surfin' USA' back to back, they sound the same?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. I heard some Canadian disk jockey mention it in the late '90s."
"__MUSIC__ I think Johnny Cash was sued for infringement, and lost."
"__MUSIC__ Was that for 'My Name Is Sue' or 'Ring of Fire'?"
"__MUSIC__ No. It was 'Folsom Prison Blues'. I can't remember the name of the other singer, though."
"__MUSIC__ What was the name of the other song in the lawsuit?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was 'Crescent City Blues'. I think they mean New Orleans, not the town in northern California."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to look that one up. I remember Johnny Cash's 'Live From Folsom Prison' album."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Johnny Cash was a jailbird off and on."
"__MUSIC__ Funny I never really liked Johnny Cash's music at first, but began to like it years later."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean."
