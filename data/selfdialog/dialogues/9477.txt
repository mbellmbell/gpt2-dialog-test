"__BASEBALL__ Okay, know what bothers me about baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ *Sigh* You're always ranting about something with the game you pretend to love."
"__BASEBALL__ I rant because I'm passionate about it. Anyway, I hate the Little League World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ Of course you do. Why does it bother you?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's the most pretentious thing in the world. It's not a series in any form whatsoever."
"__BASEBALL__ How so?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, it's two tournaments. The US teams, and 'the others.'"
"__BASEBALL__ The sounds racist ..."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, think about it. If it was truly a world series, the US champion would enter a field of all country's champions."
"__BASEBALL__ What is it now, I'm unfamiliar."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, here the champion of the other countries plays the champion for the US, and then they play a title game."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I see. It's not even a series. It's one game."
"__BASEBALL__ Precisely! It's also insulting to assume the US team automatically either wins or gets second place."
"__BASEBALL__ When in reality, if they entered the field, they could be eliminated after just two games."
"__BASEBALL__ Right. By hosting the tournament, the US automatically gets into the title game."
"__BASEBALL__ That's pretentious, but if we host the game, why won't we get an automatic bid?"
"__BASEBALL__ Because that's poor sportsmanship."
"__BASEBALL__ I have a better explanation."
"__BASEBALL__ No you don't, but you may try."
"__BASEBALL__ If the US lost in the first round, no one would be at the games. These kids come from poor countries; their parents can't fly in."
