"__THRILLER__ You know what I haven't seen in a long time?"
"__THRILLER__ What's that?"
"__THRILLER__ A really good Thriller film, it's literally been years since I can recall seeing a good one."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, you should see Split. It's one of those M. Night Shyamalan films. Really trippy."
"__THRILLER__ Oh Yeah what's it about?"
"__THRILLER__ Well not to spoil it. The story is about a man that has 23 different personalities."
"__THRILLER__ That doesn't sound too interesting, what is the appeal of the movie?"
"__THRILLER__ Well the guy kidnaps three teenagers and sacrafices them to one of his personalities which happens to be 'supehuman'"
"__THRILLER__ That sounds very strange. Now I want to see it just to make sense of what you said."
"__THRILLER__ It's pretty good, I thought it was one of the best thrillers of 2016, it really plays on your mind."
