"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So when was THE first national combine, I wonder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 1982 is when BLESTO and National held a joint combine for the entire league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's kinda fun story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yep. History is always interesting. Oh and then ESPN started televising the draft"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In 1980. And in 1984, Mel Kiper started doign the analysis of the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the best part, because it lets s know who's coming in, what value they bring, etc"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. All important imformation to have about your hometown team or your favorite team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They even started televising the college picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's just going to far if you ask me. They're just kids, barely 18 and talking about which college they will be playing for. That's silly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they form the base of the NFL draft picks in 4 years. It's pretty important"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what irks me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Swapping drafts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's wrong with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it's misleading for one. And if you get a no 1 pick and get a star QB, you should stick with it, and improve the team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, that reminds me, that Eli Manning thing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Manning told Chargers he didn't want to play for the Chargers flat out"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they picked him anyway only to swap with Giants for Rivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Chargers got more than just Rivers, they also got Nate Kaeding, Shawne Merriman."
