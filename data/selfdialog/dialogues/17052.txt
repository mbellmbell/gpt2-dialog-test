"__MOVIES__ Hey! Just re-watched The Lion King last night."
"__MOVIES__ That's my favorite Disney movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Disney during that period in the 1990's was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Right? So many great films."
"__MOVIES__ Sad they took such a downturn afterwards."
"__MOVIES__ Too much reliance on cheap, unnecessary prequels and sequels."
"__MOVIES__ For real. Who needs Little Mermaid 2?"
"__MOVIES__ They've really started to pick it back up again, though. Tangled and Frozen are amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Meet the Robinson's."
"__MOVIES__ That was a very cute movie with a surprisingly sweet message."
"__MOVIES__ Princess and the Frog was also nice. I loved the music."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wish they'd go back to hand-drawn animation more often."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Their computer stuff is nice, but nothing beats a nice hand-drawn film."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about them getting back into sequels? Like Wreck It Ralph 2 and Frozen 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Not sure. If the stories are good, it's fine."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really hope they don't lose focus of the fact that story is what's important."
"__MOVIES__ They've done so great recently telling good stories. Moana was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ So was Zootopia!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's great when Disney focuses on new ideas rather than sequels."
"__MOVIES__ Well, let's hope their new renaissance continues to hold."
