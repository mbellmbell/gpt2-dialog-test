"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what are you thinking for your fantasy football draft strategy this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say the top three picks are D. Johnson, L.Bell, or E.Elliott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you, I would pick David Johnson first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ David Johnson will get 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You throw in 20 touchdowns he is the clear number on e pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After the three running backs, I'm thinking Antoinio Brown, Julio, and OBJ will be picked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I would pick OBJ over Julio this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Reallly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Julio isn't consistent at scoring touchdowns, he rarely gets over 10 in a year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but the yards and catches are awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think OBJ gets almost as many yards and will outscore Julio by 8 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but Eli manning is throwing to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The addition of Brandon Marshall will take coverage away from him and open up the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, Brandon Marshall is a huge upgrade over Victor Cruz."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where do you rank Melvin Gordon?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I rank him at 7."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you on that. He's a full time running back on a decent offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like Gordon, he catches and is their goal line back, he's primed for a huge year.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also like L.McCoy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree McCoy should have a great year."
