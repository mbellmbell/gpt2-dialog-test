"__HORROR__ What was the last horror movie you watched?"
"__HORROR__ I like the classics, so it was Evil Dead."
"__HORROR__ The breakout role for Bruce Campbell?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, exactly.  It's my favorite movie of all time."
"__HORROR__ What is so appealing about it?"
"__HORROR__ The grittyness and the creativity."
"__HORROR__ What do you mean by that?"
"__HORROR__ Well, they had a limited budget so they never let you see the real evil spirit to maintain a constant tension.  They also got very creative for the special effects and makeup due to the low budget.  The film quality, or lack thereof, lent itself to the overall eerieness of the movie too."
"__HORROR__ So nothing to do with the acting itself?"
"__HORROR__ No, the acting was also great.  Bruce Campbell is a bit hokey but still feels real, like how an actual person would when faced with possessions in a cabin in the woods."
