"__DISNEY__ What did you think of Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ To be honest, I thought it was average."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! A lot of my friends who have children are raving about it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it was advertised as 'the first movie that really features female empowerment' and I didn't like that."
"__DISNEY__ I agree! Mulan was years before Frozen and she was the most empowered Disney character ever!"
"__DISNEY__ That is exactly how I feel! I don't like how the newer movies are overshadowing the classics."
"__DISNEY__ I completely agree with you, even though the songs from Frozen are pretty catchy."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know, I went to Kareoke last week with my friends and at least 3 groups sang 'Let it Go,' and by the end of the night it was stuck in my head!"
"__DISNEY__ My sister's daughter has been wearing her Elsa costume for a week straight, so I guess it is pretty popular with the kids!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm gonna stick to watching the classics, Mulan for life!"
