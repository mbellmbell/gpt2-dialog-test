"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard Gucci Mane's new mix tape?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I heard that at John's party last week. Pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, pretty good. But--"
"__MUSIC__ I miss Waka!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh you read my mind! I really wish they didn't have a big fight."
"__MUSIC__ They were so good together."
"__MUSIC__ Now it's just him and Young Thug or Rae Sremmurd. Or whoever else is hot now."
"__MUSIC__ You gotta admit, Black Beatles was FIRE, my dude."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was good. But if it wasn't for that mannequin challenge you think we'd be talking about it now?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmmmm. I guess maybe not."
"__MUSIC__ Don't get me wrong. Sremmlife 1 and 2 were both cool. So many features too."
"__MUSIC__ But it's bubble gum, right? Sesame street voice rapping."
"__MUSIC__ Man, those fools sound like they are just going through puberty and they are twenty-something! That ain't right."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. I never thought about it like that though."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, back to Gucci. Do you think he's really a clone sent here by the Illuminati?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess anything is possible. Right?"
"__MUSIC__ Right. But you know. Occam's razor."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah true, true. Maybe that fool just did hella exercise and got some veneers when he got out of prison."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. Exactly, my dude."
"__MUSIC__ Illuminati might not be messing with him, but his wife is fine as vintage wine. I know that  much."
