"__BASKETBALL__ Hey there, wanna catch the next Lakers game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah! When is it? I haven't been to a game in forever!"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's this Friday night against the Jazz.  I know how much you hate them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh my gosh I'd love to go, but I have a football game that night, and won't be free until 10pm."
"__BASKETBALL__ That sucks, I don't think you've been to Staples Center yet huh?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No! I've been dying to go now. The last Laker game I went to was at the Forum."
"__BASKETBALL__ Damn that was a long time ago.  Are you serious that you haven't been to Staples Center yet?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, that's why I'm so mad I can't go to the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ That sucks, it's an amazing arena, with bars all over the place."
"__BASKETBALL__ How is the parking and the prices of the concessions?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Parking is ok, but a bit expensive. They have lots of great concessions, but of course they're way overpriced."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, another reason why I'd rather enjoy the Laker game at home.  Cheap beer and no lines to the restroom."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, you're right.  So have you been able to follow the Lakers at all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I don't watch the games on TV like I used to, and I heard that Jeannie Buss is now the only owner."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I know, who would've thought that she would be able to push out her brothers?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know.  At least she'll keep Phil close by right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah her and Magic should be able to bring greatness back to LA"
"__BASKETBALL__ I certainly hope so, it's been too long since we had the Championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah well if they make it you better go with me to the playoffs!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, if you have tickets then I'll be there with all my Laker gear!"
