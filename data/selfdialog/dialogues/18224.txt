"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the movie Hush?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I saw it pass by on Netflix!  Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was actually pretty good!  I would recommend seeing it."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there's this girl and she is deaf but she lives alone out in the woods in an isolated location.  She is an author."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting...What else?"
"__MOVIES__ She starts being stalked by this really scary looking guy.  But she's deaf, so she can't hear anything going on."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds scary!"
"__MOVIES__ It is!  And he traps her in the house, so there's nothing she can do."
"__MOVIES__ What a horrible situation!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so the movie is about how she's trying to escape and get away from the psychopath."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds intense."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was very intense.  Kinda an unusual horror type suspense movie."
"__MOVIES__ I will put that on my list.  I'm always looking for a good suspense movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well this one was different.  My husband and I really enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ We watched one the other night that was really good, too!"
"__MOVIES__ What was it?"
