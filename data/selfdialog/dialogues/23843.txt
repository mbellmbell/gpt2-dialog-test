"__SUPERHERO__ What was the last superhero movie that you saw?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I just saw Wonderwoman last week actually."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh yea, what'd you think of it? It got really good reviews."
"__SUPERHERO__ I really liked it actually. It was refreshing to see a female led superhero movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, my thoughts exactly. I thought Gal Gadot was perfect for the part."
"__SUPERHERO__ She did such a fantastic job. Actually all the actors, like Chris Pine, were really good in that movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea. The only thing I could have done without was their little rag-tag team with the Indian guy, the Scottish guy and the other guy...I don't know where he was supposed to be from."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, they didn't really add much to the movie. I didn't particularly feel attached to any of those characters."
"__SUPERHERO__ It's like you didn't really have enough time to get to know them, because they're just secondary characters, so you didn't really care too much if they happened to die."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea I feel like they just put those guys in the storyline to add some diversity. They didn't add much to the overall storyline though."
