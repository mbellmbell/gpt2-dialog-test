"__MUSIC__ I need to find some decent study music."
"__MUSIC__ What do you consider study music?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly instrumental songs, although I can also listen to foreign language music without getting distracted."
"__MUSIC__ What about Rammstein?"
"__MUSIC__ That's already on my list. I've listened to them too much lately and need something new."
"__MUSIC__ Try YouTube. There's a ton of free music on there."
"__MUSIC__ But don't you get bombarded with all those ads?"
"__MUSIC__ Only occasionally. But for hours and hours of free playlists, it's worth it."
"__MUSIC__ What sort of music do you listen to on YouTube?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Gregorian chants. Those are good for background music that you don't really have to pay attention to, but it's just sort of always there."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds perfect! Can you send me a few links?"
"__MUSIC__ I could, but you could just search for study music, relaxation music, or stuff like that."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the tip. I definitely work better with a little background noise, but nothing too distracting."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes I can tolerate lyrics when I'm studying or working. PJ Harvey can be good for that."
"__MUSIC__ Ever listen to Enya?"
"__MUSIC__ As embarrassing as it is to admit this, yes. Yes, I do listen to Enya."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry to say that I do, too. But only for studying."
"__MUSIC__ Totally. Please don't ever tell anyone I listen to Enya."
"__MUSIC__ Sure thing, right back at you. Do you like the Memory of Trees?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it gets annoying after a while. I often just put Boadicea on repeat, since there's really no actual words to that, just humming."
