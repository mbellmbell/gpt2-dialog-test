"__STAR_WARS__ In The Empire Strikes back what's something you don't like?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it's such a good movie that it's hard to come up with something I don't like but there's something that bother me in that movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, it's almost a perfect movie. What bother you about it though?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well in the Battle of Hoth, when Luke and another pilot bring down an AT-AT by deploying harpoons from their ship causing the AT-TI to fall."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about it? That was a classic scene that many people love."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I always wondered why do space fighters have harpoons? There's no reason to have harpoons like that so it just seems to convenient to the plot."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's an easy answer to that question. They might use them in space to attach to something and tow it."
"__STAR_WARS__ That could be it. However they have tractor beams in the Star Wars universe so there's no need to use things like harpoons to tow stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well a tractor beam could be very large so it wouldn't fit on a small ship like the T-47 airspeeders that were used in the Battle of Hoth."
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes sense. Now I love Empire Strikes Back even more."
