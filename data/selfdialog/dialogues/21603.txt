"__DISNEY__ What are your thoughts on the sequel to Mary Poppins?"
"__DISNEY__ No, just no.  I can't."
"__DISNEY__ Why not! I love Emily Blunt!"
"__DISNEY__ Because I don't think you can recreated that magic. And Julie Andrews is so perfect!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, she won an Oscar for it. But, I think the sequel will be great."
"__DISNEY__ And it won't have Dick Van Dyke."
"__DISNEY__ Hey, he's not dead."
"__DISNEY__ But if he is in it, he'll be ancient. Why not make something new?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, there were multiple Mary Poppins books."
"__DISNEY__ I don't care.  I don't want to watch it."
