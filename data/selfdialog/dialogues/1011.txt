"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard any good country music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of Tim McGraw.  He's my favorite for sure."
"__MUSIC__ What songs of his do you like best?  I've never listened to him much."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he's one of the first country singers who blends country and pop music.  I think you'd enjoy his sound."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting.  I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and he's also been in a bunch of movies.  He's married to Faith Hill, and they do duets."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, like what songs?"
"__MUSIC__ It's Your Love and Just To See You Smile are several that come to mind."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting.  I like Faith Hill."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she has a beautiful voice.  They sound great together."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'll be sure to listen to him soon.  What songs should I start with?"
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you try his greatest hits album?  Then you can hear his best songs all in one place."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that's a good idea."
"__MUSIC__ I Like It, I Love It is one of the best for sure.  But there are so many good ones."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds familiar, I might've heard it before."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they all have a great catchy beat."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, and which albums have Faith Hill on them?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I'm not too sure.  He actually did a duet with Nelly, too."
"__MUSIC__ The hip hop artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, that's the one!  Surprising isn't it."
