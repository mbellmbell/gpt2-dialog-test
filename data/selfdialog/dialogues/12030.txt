"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, football season is close, are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely! Who-Dey Baby! I am all in this season to see Andy Dalton lead the Bengals to the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about their draft class this year? Were you impressed with who they picked up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Ross and Mixon will be great additions to the offense. I also like Ellis, the Linebacker from Kansas State"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is a contract year for Marvin Lewis, do you think he will be back after this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who knows? Mike Brown seems to really like him, even though the Bengals haven't won a playoff game with him as coach"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I am not sure either. He is an okay coach, I also know that Mike Brown seems to really like him. I do feel that we need a coach that can us to the next level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love to have an old school Bengal like Max Montoya or Kenny Anderson as head coach. Someone who fans know and love."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite games are the divisional games, the ones with the Steelers, Browns or Raven."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are my favorite games too. Those games are the most important ones, they almost count as two games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know when the Steelers come to town? We should go to that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers come to town on December 4th. That game is even on ESPN"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like a plan, we should totally go. I will buy the tickets and you can pay me back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks man, I am looking forward to it. My brother is a big Colts fan, and the Colts come to town on October 29th, would you want to go with us?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like a great time. Games before Halloween are a lot of fun. People dress up, and have a good time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the 90s we went to games with bags on our heads, when it wasnt even the Halloween game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns are in town on November 26th, would you like to go to that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't, we are going out of town to see family. Otherwise I would. I am sure that is a game the Bengals can win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds great man. I am excited about this upcoming season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, We will have a lot of fun at these games. Talk to you later."
