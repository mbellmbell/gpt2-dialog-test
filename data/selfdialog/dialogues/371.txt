"__MUSIC__ Lately I've wanted to start learning to play the theremin."
"__MUSIC__ What's a theremin?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a kind of musical instrument invented by a Russian scientist in the twenties. It makes a very strange, electronic sound."
"__MUSIC__ Why would you want to learn to play one then?"
"__MUSIC__ It just seems like it could be something unique."
"__MUSIC__ Have I ever heard a theremin before?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably! The Beach Boys song Good Vibrations has a theremin in it!"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, okay, I might try listening to it again. Does it show up anywhere else?"
"__MUSIC__ It's in the Led Zeppelin songs Whole Lotta Love and No Quarter. Apparently they played a loop during live performances."
"__MUSIC__ That's really interesting! I don't know what to expect from this instrument now."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds very out of this world to me."
"__MUSIC__ I like songs that sound that way."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. So long as they aren't just, like, noise."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. The Oasis song 'Falling Down' does that for me."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard that. Should I listen?"
"__MUSIC__ I think you might like it. It sounds like it's not as strange as a theremin though."
"__MUSIC__ Nothing's as strange as a theremin."
"__MUSIC__ Should I loan you a copy?"
"__MUSIC__ Please!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll go find it."
