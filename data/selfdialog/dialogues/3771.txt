"__MUSIC__ Megan and I were talking the other day, and we were trying to come up with a list of the best Weird Al songs."
"__MUSIC__ I used to listen to him a lot when I was like ten."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like everyone has! It's a fun list to make."
"__MUSIC__ So what's your go-to?"
"__MUSIC__ My personal pick is Everything You Know is Wrong. It's the most off the wall."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that one. I couldn't figure out what 'prosthetic lips' would look like as a kid."
"__MUSIC__ I'm still not really sure. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm... I like Amish Paradise."
"__MUSIC__ That one gets stuck in my head for days after I hear it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I might not even know the original, but I definitely know all of the lyrics to that song."
"__MUSIC__ It's weird how that happens. I feel like that isn't usually the case with song parodies."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's like that with Weird Al because he's so out there."
"__MUSIC__ One of my favorite jokes in 30 Rock was when he 'Serious Al'd' a silly song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was a great moment. Okay, what else is on the list?"
"__MUSIC__ The Night Santa Went Crazy, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ A perfect Christmas song."
"__MUSIC__ Sure to put coal in your stockings."
"__MUSIC__ I might actually listen to some of his stuff later. Just for fun."
"__MUSIC__ Might as well. Let me know if you come up with any more!"
"__MUSIC__ Will do."
