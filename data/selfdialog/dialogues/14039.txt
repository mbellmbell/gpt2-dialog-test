"__BASKETBALL__ I am so sick of Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah me too.  He just keeps crushing the terrible East."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah like that is some huge accomplishment."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I mean Isiah Thomas at 5 foot 9 also has been killing the East."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kind of shows you just how terrible the East is."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah and soon Carmelo is going to head West too."
"__BASKETBALL__ You think so?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he is going to end up on the Clippers I bet."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh! I like the idea of that. You think they will have to get rid of Blake?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Possibly, or at least Reddick."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I wonder where he will go then."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hope he goes to Milwaukee to add some shooting."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh I love that idea too.  Riddick in Milwaukee would be fun."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that might make the East a little better too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I don't know about that.  The bucks seem fake to me."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I could see that but I think you are only saying that since you are a Chicago fan."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't get me started  on my dumpster fire."
"__BASKETBALL__ What? You aren't happy with Butler?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I just think he is over rated."
"__BASKETBALL__ I could see that.  He definitely loves ISO ball too much."
