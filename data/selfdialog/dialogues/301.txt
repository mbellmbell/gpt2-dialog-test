"__MUSIC__ Do you like Tool?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I know them, who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a progressive band that's from the 90s and still active to this day."
"__MUSIC__ Who is the singer? Sounds familiar."
"__MUSIC__ The lead signer is Maynard James Keenan, he's incredible. He sounds great live."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, what's your favorite album from them?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely Aenema. The lyrics from all their albums are philosophical or focused on enlightenment. All their albums are excellent though."
"__MUSIC__ Philosophy huh? That's deep."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, it branches out to different topics as well. There's a song called Lateralus which is about the Fibonacci sequence, the lyrics and guitar intervals follow the math sequence."
"__MUSIC__ Woah! That's so different from how other bands and artists do their songs."
"__MUSIC__ They also have another song called Third Eye that is difficult even for them to do live because of the sudden time signatures."
"__MUSIC__ Is it a long song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it is. A lot of their songs are pretty long actually because most songs contain different pieces, sort of like a symphonic piece."
"__MUSIC__ What are their concerts like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the singer usually stays hidden in the back to avoid attention to him while the rest of the band are out playing. It's a different experience every concert and the songs will purposely sound different every concert."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that would make it from sounding too repetitive and give it a unique experience every time."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! One year, they actually did a show where it was completely different versions of their songs that they were experimenting with called Salival."
"__MUSIC__ Tool doesn't seem like your average band, they definitely sound unique."
"__MUSIC__ They are like no other band out there. You need to give them a try and listen to their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Will do! Thanks for recommending them!"
