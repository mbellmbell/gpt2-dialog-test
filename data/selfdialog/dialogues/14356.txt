"__HORROR__ You've seen The Grudge right?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, but felt it was mostly okay at best."
"__HORROR__ I would agree with your assessment, but you did know it was originally a Japanese movie right?"
"__HORROR__ I had heard about this, yes but never felt the need to look further into it."
"__HORROR__ You really should, Ju-on is much better than it's American remake."
"__HORROR__ I know that was the case with The Ring."
"__HORROR__ The acting alone tends to set the Asian versions apart, still not sure why they felt Sarah Michelle Gellar was a good choice."
"__HORROR__ Yeah she's far from the first actress I think of when thinking scream queens."
"__HORROR__ Jamie Lee Curtis she is not!"
"__HORROR__ Oh absolutely, there's no comparison there. Anyway I'll watch The original version of The Grudge and let you know what I think."
