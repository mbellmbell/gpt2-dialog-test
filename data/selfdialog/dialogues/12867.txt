"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for the upcoming season! The Pats have a scrimmage in just about two weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is against the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, just like the previous three years. Bill is great friend with Sean Payton, the New Orleans coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be odd to Saint;s fans to see Brandin Cooks in the opponent uniform so soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it was almost a straight up trade, Cooks for Pats CB Butler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am relieved that it turned out that the trade did not go down that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! I am glad we kept both. We gave them a 1st round draft choice instead, a veritable steal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cooks is just 23. It is akin to drafting him very late in the 1st round, a can't miss proposition!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He will be even better with Brady than the Saints QB, Drew Brees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cooks is a proven commodity.The only risk for the Pats is injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a fact of life in the NFL.But, if he stays healthy, I see 15 touchdown catches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed! And, it would be more on another team. Brady always looks for and finds the open guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brees is a great quarterback in his own right. He was doubted out of Iowa when he arrived in the NFL because of his short stature."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is not the photo-typical QB as fare as height goes..he is barely 5'11'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He shut up the naysayers with a Super Bowl victory. He might have more with a decent defense, which he has rarely enjoyed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like the Saints have always been offense-minded. That will not work in today's NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think it would work in any day's NFL. Defense usually wins out!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, there have been many teams with mediocre offenses that have won Super Bowls. I can name the Redskins, Ravens, and Giants off the top of my head."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the Bears of 1986? Well, I guess their offense was good, but it paled in comparison to their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait.Maybe we'll talk again tomorrow!"
