"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What sport do you think is the most watched?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the world or in the country?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the world I think it's soccer, hands-down. In the country, I'd think football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so. I know I watch it every Sunday, Monday or Thursday when it's in season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do I. Do you watch it at home or at a bar?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I tend to watch it at home. I like to feel like I'm getting use out of the cable sports package I've purchased"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do I! I pay so much to get Fox, CBS, ESPN, and NBC just to make sure I can see every game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ESPN is so expensive for me. I wish I could just watch everything online."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're really strict about that. I don't think you can really watch it for free online nowadays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I pay so much at this rate I might as well just pay to go a couple game a season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you're serious about going I would go with you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We really should. Hard Rock Stadium is pretty easy to get to from here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To be honest though I would only go depending on who they're playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have some faith in our Miami Dolphins!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sorry, I don't deal with faith. I deal with results."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they have been disappointing these past few seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Completely disappointing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We need to have another legend like Dan Marino!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he wasn't the only great player on the team, but he motivated the entire team to compete well amongst each other as well as against other teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes exactly. Having one key player makes the entire team perform greater."
