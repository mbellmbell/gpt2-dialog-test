"__STAR_WARS__ So midichorians are basically mitochondria, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, ugh. I guess that's not... too well-hidden."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's the theory there? Mitochondria produce all the energy for cells, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but... I don't know that this bears much scrutiny."
"__STAR_WARS__ Bear with me, though. So the midichlorians produce an energy that's present in everyone, but Jedi are busting with the things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, so... this is sounding a little like Parasite Eve now."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess, but -- no. I'm saying that Jedi are just pumping out this heavy aura of energy on a cellular level that, if trained, can do all kinds of wacky stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay. So... I guess that's kind of reconciling the Episode One business with the original explanation then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, exactly! I mean, sort of. Everyone embodies the Force, and theoretically could learn to control it -- but Jedi are sort of freaks who produce way more of the Force, so when they're trained it's way more effective."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's a weird class issue here, or maybe even a eugenic model, that disturbs me on a pretty deep level."
