"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football?!! The NFL season is just 6 weeks away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like we just started baseball season and now football is coming again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you like anything about football at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like winning bets on games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you bet? You know nothing of the NFL teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't need to know anything about the NFL when betting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes you do!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No you don't. It's all a guessing game. I used to win my mom's office pool a lot and I went up against hard core Vikings and Packers fans doing so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did they handle losing to a high school kid?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were put out at first but when they found out i never watched football and knew nothing of the game they really got mad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I supposed I can see why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I told them they only fool themselves if they think you can study a bet - its a freaking guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did you do it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had a few different methods. Once I chose between the uniform colors I liked the better for each game. Once I would bet on whatever team had a cute quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see, a real scientific methodology."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, just a guessing game. And may I point out I won more than anyone so when you get snide I know you don't like hearing that you have no control."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I study the numbers of past games and look at the player stats, etc."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And yet I win by choosing the uniform colors I like better. You don't like being SHOWN that you're so-called method is as much BS as my uniform color method. You have no control, period."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, if you win this year you buy dinner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Deal."
