"__MOVIES__ I went and saw Bye Bye Man in the theatre with my friend."
"__MOVIES__ Really, how was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good. I mean, we read the reviews and they weren't good so we weren't expecting much."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder why it got poor reviews then."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I mean there were some jump scares but that was really the only slightly annoying thing about it."
"__MOVIES__ Jump scares?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when they use sudden scary music or a sudden noise or moving object to scare the audience. There isn't any creativity involved or real psychological fear and there usually ends up being nothing there anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I gotcha. I know what you mean, I just didn't know what they were called."
"__MOVIES__ But I mean aside from that, I thought the filming was great, and the actors did a good job considering they weren't anybody I had ever seen before."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes that's a good thing, then you don't see them as a character you're already familiar with."
"__MOVIES__ True. So what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it's a horror, and the whole idea is that saying the name 'the Bye Bye Man' alerts him to you (which you don't want) and that the more you try not to think of it the more you do think of it."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a predicament."
"__MOVIES__ It is. My favourite part was the beginning sequence that takes place a bit in the past, that was where it was really eerie for me in an old fashioned way."
"__MOVIES__ It was in the past after all."
"__MOVIES__ But more than that, it was that it didn't rely so much on gore and jump scares, it was more suspenseful and intriguing and psychological. I would've been alright if the whole movie had been like that."
"__MOVIES__ Nice. Doesn't sound too bad as far as scary movies are concerned."
"__MOVIES__ I'd definitely recommend it. It has a slightly predictable ending though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, where you think the whole problem is done with but some remnant shows up at the end that just screams for a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, what horror movies are flooded with. So if you go into it with low expectations you may be pleasantly surprised."
