"__MOVIES__ I have a horrible Star Wars theory."
"__MOVIES__ I love horrible things. Go ahead."
"__MOVIES__ It's about Rey's parents."
"__MOVIES__ Who do you think they are?"
"__MOVIES__ Luke and Leia."
"__MOVIES__ WHAT??? Oh my god that's horrible!"
"__MOVIES__ Told you. It explains a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Go ahead, what does it explain?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they obviously had sex during episodes IV-V, before Leia got with Han. Gotta do something for those long hyperspace flights."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so the timeline works out. But why was she left on Jakku?"
"__MOVIES__ She's a shame-child. They had no idea they were brother and sister at the time, just that they had a connection."
"__MOVIES__ So what about Han?"
"__MOVIES__ They probably convinced Han it was his ... or Rey and Ben are siblings."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, okay."
"__MOVIES__ Also, having Rey would destroy Leia's career, and Luke's Jedi credibility"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it sure would."
"__MOVIES__ And that's why they dropped her off on Jakku."
"__MOVIES__ It also explains the 'Crap. She found me' look on Luke's face at the end of VII."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, now you're onto it. It also explains how quickly she harnessed The Force."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sold as Disney would never go with it. But, it's intriguing."
