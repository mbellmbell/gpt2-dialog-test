"__MOVIES__ What's the best movie you have seen recently?"
"__MOVIES__ It's been a while since I've been to the movies, but I would say Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that."
"__MOVIES__ It is the Harry Potter spin-off."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I have heard of that.  Based on the book by J.K. Rowling, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ Is it like Harry Potter?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, not really.  There is some overlap, but the time period is much different."
"__MOVIES__ I love Eddie Redmayne.  I heard he was in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ He is.  He plays the main character."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anybody else in the movie I might know?"
"__MOVIES__ Johnny Depp has a small part.  Colin Farrell is in it as well."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't really love the Harry Potter movies.  Do you think I would like it?"
"__MOVIES__ What didn't you like about the Harry Potter movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They just seemed to unrealistic."
"__MOVIES__ Well, there is obviously magic in Fantastic Beasts.  So, I'm not sure."
"__MOVIES__ I'll probably skip it then."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anything else I might like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ If you like clothing and time period movies, you might like how they recreated the 1920's."
