"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited about the upcoming football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't wait to see what my Seahawks do this year.  How about You?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely.  I was crushed last year when the Patriots did their comeback.  I'm really hoping that they lose this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it is frustrating how much they've been dominating these past years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely.  So are you going to be attending any games this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I live in Arizona, so I'll probably watch them when the play the Cardinals.  How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might catch a Lions game or so, but they haven't been doing so hot these past years, so kinda depressing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I hear you, I went through nearly 30 years of the Seahawks sucking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That they did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was especially humiliating because I worked for many years on a fishing boat named after the Seahawks, so I'd constantly get razzed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heh, well I'll keep that in mind if the Lions keep up their current streak."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did you have a Superbowl party or go to one last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, there was a nice party at my local pub, me and a bunch of buddies just hung out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nice.  We did the whole big screen TV, home party thing.  Was a lot of fun, put clean up was a pain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah absolutely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So any other teams you rooting for or are you strictly a Lions fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm for the Lions and 'anyone who can beat the Patriots'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My dad feels the same way, but he is for 'the Seahawks and anyon who can beat the Cowboys'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why does he hate the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure I think they were crushing the Seahawks back in the day, and so he just built up this animosity."
