"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Astros-Yankees game yesterday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Which one? They had to play two games due to bad weather this weekend."
"__BASEBALL__ The night game, the one that was broadcast on ESPN."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I did see that one, where Derek Jeter's number was retired."
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees almost made a comeback, but still lost 10-7."
"__BASEBALL__ They must have, because when I watched it, the Astros were up 9-0."
"__BASEBALL__ That's because in large part to George Springer hitting two home runs."
"__BASEBALL__ Don't forget Bregman's grand slam."
"__BASEBALL__ That too, and that just spoiled the Yankees' night."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but at least they won the first game of the doubleheader."
"__BASEBALL__ Didn't the Nationals and the Phillies have to play two yesterday also?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. The bad weather was all over the northeast, causing many games to be postponed."
"__BASEBALL__ I saw that Bryce Harper hit a home run in the first game."
"__BASEBALL__ He hit the game winning home run Saturday night."
"__BASEBALL__ That kid is amazing. He's got one of the best batting averages right now."
"__BASEBALL__ And he is indeed still a kid. He's only 24 years old."
"__BASEBALL__ He might be in the hall of fame once his career is over."
"__BASEBALL__ I predict he will have at least 500 home runs in his career."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he'll have more than that, perhaps 600 or 650 home runs."
"__BASEBALL__ There are very few baseball players who have hit that many home runs."
