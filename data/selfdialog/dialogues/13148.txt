"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always been a San Francisco 49'er fan. I watched them with my father growing up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were so awful last season. How can you stay so loyal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have great faith in Coach Shanahan. They had some great draft choices this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it may take more than a couple of good draft choices to regain their top tier status."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I agree. Do you remember the years when Joe Montana was the quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll say. I was at the game when Montana threw the pass to Dwight Clark in the last seconds to win the game. It was not called the 'Immaculate Reception' for nothing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those were the days! The team franchise stayed so strong for 14 years. They went to and won 5 Super Bowls during those years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The team had such a long list of talented players like Freddie Solomon, Steve Young, Deion Sanders and so many more."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is where the New England Patriots are now. They have been dominating the game since 2001"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have been to 7 Super Bowls over the past 16 years and won 5 of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if the Seahawks will be able to unseat them this year and win the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is almost impossible to create this kind of dynasty now with the advent of salary caps and free agency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It shows what an amazing coach Bill Belichick is despite these handicaps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree the coach is crucial to the team. There have been some great ones over the years like Bill Walsh, Chuck Knoll and Don Shula."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love watching these kinds of coaches become commentators once they retire. Their perspective is so insightful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I especially love the comments on why a play succeeds and why another play fails."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is why football is so great.  I can't wait for the season to start."
