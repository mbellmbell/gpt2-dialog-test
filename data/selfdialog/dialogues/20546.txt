"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Sausage Party yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that Seth Rogan's new one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I just saw it again for the 3rd time."
"__MOVIES__ Is it that good?"
"__MOVIES__ You have to see it; it's one of his best yet. It's like Zack and Miri make a porno meets Toy Story."
"__MOVIES__ That is a very messed up comparison."
"__MOVIES__ It's a very messed up movie, but does he do any other kind?"
"__MOVIES__ That is true, what are they doing though?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the story of a lone sausage trying to save his fellow foods from human subjugation."
"__MOVIES__ That actually sounds pretty sweet."
"__MOVIES__ They live in this huge Supermarket and before they can make it to the register there is a collision and they are released from there packages."
"__MOVIES__ I would freak if my food started moving."
"__MOVIES__ You would not be alone in that my friend. The first guy that sees them moving almost has a heart attack; of course the drugs didn't help."
"__MOVIES__ Do they ever?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the guy was tripping on bath salts when little Barry the sausage starts talking to him."
"__MOVIES__ That will definitively  make for a bad trip."
"__MOVIES__ You're telling me; they actually end up killing the guy and stealing his car."
"__MOVIES__ That is just insane."
"__MOVIES__ Oh trust me that is not even the start of the insanity in this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay I get it; it's an amazing movie. Can we stop talking and just go watch it now?"
