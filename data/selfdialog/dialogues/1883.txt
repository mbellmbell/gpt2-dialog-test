"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you like music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, definitely. I like a lot of different genres, but right now I'm mostly into rap/hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ Oh okay, cool. I like rap, but I'm not a die hard fan."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I usually look up songs on Youtube to listen to and watch if there's a video to go along with the song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I use Youtube a lot for that too, but I also buy songs off of iTunes as well. Speaking of which, I think Drake just dropped a new album."
"__MUSIC__ I vaguely remember hearing something about that recently, but I'm not sure. I'm not a huge Drake fan."
"__MUSIC__ He's not my favorite rapper, but he definitely has some catchy songs that are fun to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard a few of his songs. What artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like both old school and more modern rap, but lately I've mostly been listening to more recent rap."
"__MUSIC__ Oh okay cool. Is there any reason you're gravitating to more recent rap at the moment?"
"__MUSIC__ It's just so new and fresh with a lot of unique acts. I love Migos and Rae Sremmurd a lot at the moment."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, I'm not too familiar with those artists."
"__MUSIC__ You should definitely check them out some time. What music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I mostly like classic/hard rock from the 60s to the early 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool, yeah I like that genre too. What bands/artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ The usual acts like Led Zeppelin, The Who, Guns n' Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc."
"__MUSIC__ I like all those bands. Do you like more recent stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, but I don't know a lot of brand new bands or at least very recent bands."
"__MUSIC__ One modern band I really like is twenty one pilots. They're incredibly talented and have a lot of creative songs."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them and I might recognize a song or two if I heard it, but I don't really know much about them."
