"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, do you want to an NFL game this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really I would much rather watch the games at home"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why going to games are great"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not if it's cold out I'm always miserable plus I'm a Jets fan so they seem to always lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think the Jets will be any good this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a chance they will be terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Patriots are going to win the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah unless Brady gets hurt they are going to win the division.  I just hope they don't win the Superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they are making it to the Super Bowl this year, I like the Raiders"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that the Raiders are still young and unfortunately the Pats are loaded."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Raiders, Packers I'm calling it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably going to be Giants Pats another rematch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be great you think the Giants could do it again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For my sanity I sure hope so.  Eli beats Brady again would be great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Dolphins"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like the Dolphins I hope they tank"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, think Cowboys will dominate again this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I expect them to take a huge step back this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so excited for the start of the season.  It's almost here!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah we will see how it goes this year."
