"__ICEHOCKEY__ So the Pittsburgh Penguins won the series over the Washington Capitals?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, I saw Game Seven the other night."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It seems like Washington just can't get the job done in the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah they got knocked out early last year too."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ With Ovechkin as their star, it seems like they should do better."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree, but maybe they don't have the right chemistry and teamwork."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Capitals had the best record in the league in the record season this year too."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know. It's such a waste to have so many wins in the regular season, and then save your bad play for the elimination rounds."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So now the Penguins are in the Conference Finals. Do you think they advance?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, I think their experience and composure get the job done again."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's amazing that Sidney Crosby is so young, and yet has been to the Stanley Cup so many times."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He truly is a clutch player, and he appears to be a good teammate as well."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see that nasty hit he took that gave him a concussion in the last series?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, it was a nasty-looking check, but he seems to be alright now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think he'll have any lingering effects or headaches from it?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, I heard that he passed all the baseline tests and that the medical staff was confident in his health."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So it's on to the next round then for the Penguins. If they get past the Senators, do you think they win it all?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, they've got to be considered the favorite to win the Cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree with you. Pittsburgh just has too much firepower to be stopped."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I want some competitive series and game sevens, so I hope that Pittsburgh doesn't dominate too much."
