"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm ready for football season. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I'm ready to see what the Falcons are going to do this year. Who do you think will win it all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys haven't won since the 90's and they lost their whole secondary last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons got demoralized last year. They blew a 25 point lead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All Cowboys fans are the same. They think they will win it every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That what all fans suppose to think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if that is the case, Go Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't come back from what happened last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We are closer to the big dance than the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see. When we make it, we won't blow a lead like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They won't make it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I hear you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dez Bryant sucks and always having emotional breakdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After last year Superbowl, I'm sure the whole Falcons team had an emotional breakdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons is solid on both sides of the ball. Dallas still needs pass rushers and corners."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every year our defense is so weak but Rod Marinelli scheme is so good that he covers up those holes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see all the holes every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also we control the pace of the game and Dak proved in the playoffs that he is capable of leading a comeback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also shows that he is incapable of getting to the big game."
