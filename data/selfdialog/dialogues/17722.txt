"__MOVIES__ Have you had a chance to watch Knucklebones yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched it and wish I didn't."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you meant."
"__MOVIES__ That is a terrible movie. I would rather spend 90 minutes at the dentist."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, with the strange acting, massive plot holes, and simply bizarre happenings all around, this movie never should have been made."
"__MOVIES__ Or at least it could have been done better."
"__MOVIES__ Why is it that young white adults are the ones who are starting trouble or causing it?"
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking the same thing. What do they be thinking?"
"__MOVIES__ Another movie about bored students students and some really bad acting and fake blood."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget the deep satanic voice."
"__MOVIES__ I was trying to."
"__MOVIES__ Even though I liked the idea of movie he acting and effects were dumb."
"__MOVIES__ They should have paid the audience to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ It felt as though they were trying far too hard, to be interesting and original."
"__MOVIES__ True. I think it would have been better off basking in its 'B' grade glory and just sticking with a simpler slasher flick premise."
"__MOVIES__ The story made no sense to me."
"__MOVIES__ If you think about it,  the movie gets very close to porn, which is what this whole stupid movie really wants to be."
"__MOVIES__ Might have been better that way."
"__MOVIES__ You're probably right."
"__MOVIES__ I just hope they don't do a sequel."
