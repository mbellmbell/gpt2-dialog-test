"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've always liked Princess Leia because of her dry humor."
"__STAR_WARS__ She's a good one. I think there was a lot of Carrie Fisher in the character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also like how she's the classic damsel in distress in Epsiode IV, but immediately takes charge upon being rescued."
"__STAR_WARS__ She's an early progressive example of a strong female character in film."
"__STAR_WARS__ How did you feel about CG Leia in Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It didn't bother me since it was only one shot. Tarkin was a lot more awkward."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't help but think there coule have been some way around having no Peter Cushing that wouldn't have looked so dumb."
"__STAR_WARS__ They should have taken notes from Young Robert Downey Jr. in Captain America: Civil War."
