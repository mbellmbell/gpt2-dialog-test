"__MOVIES__ Have you ever watched the Godfather trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course it is one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Which of the three did you like the most?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the first one. The first one. It has story and it had, you know, what-will-happen-next anticipation and yeah, but all three were good"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's interesting, you're favorite is a trilogy, and my favorite is a trilogy too, and that's the Godfather trilogy, and my favorite is the second one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you like the second one. That's surprising! Most people like the first one the best."
"__MOVIES__ I like the first one a lot but I like the second one because DeNiro is in it and I like the story of Don Corleone in Sicily as well."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, yeah, flashbacks!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and I think that the real conflict in the story comes out in the second one. More so than in the first. I see the Godfather trilogy to be very similar to a Shakespearean kind of trilogy, tragic, I think that Michael Corleone is a tragic hero and I like Shakespearean trilogies to so perhaps that's why I like it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a really good explanation"
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch the Romeo and Juliet movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No it was not something that interested me. You?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea I though it was different so I watched it, but it did not really compare with the classic Shakespeare movies."
"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite actor?"
"__MOVIES__ That is a tough question but I would say Anthony Hopkins."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked him in Hannibal."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he did a great job in that franchise. Did you think the movie was scary?"
"__MOVIES__ No not really, I thought it was more of a drama than a horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No not at all, they are way to scary for me."
