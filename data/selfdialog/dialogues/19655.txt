"__MOVIES__ You know my least favorite question?  What is your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I know right?  I mean how can you pick just one?"
"__MOVIES__ And then everybody always answers Citizen Kane.  People that have never even seen Citizen Kane say 'Citizen Kane is my favorite movie.'"
"__MOVIES__ Rosebud.  I know, it bothers me too, like Orson Welles was the only talented person ever in the film business.  So what are some movies that you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Such a better question.  Thanks for that."
"__MOVIES__ You are welcome.  Much easier to think about movies that way isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ It is.  I like many different genres but lately I have been on a gangster kick so Godfather comes to mind."
"__MOVIES__ Ok.  And the Untouchables or Pulp Fiction."
"__MOVIES__ Or Goodfellas, The Departed, Donnie Brasco."
"__MOVIES__ Casino, Carlito's Way."
"__MOVIES__ See what I mean?  I could have considered almost all of those movies as my favorite at one time or another."
"__MOVIES__ I understand, and that is just one limited genre and a thirty second conversation.  Just think how many great movies we could come up with in an hour."
"__MOVIES__ Thousands and thousands.  I wonder how much time I have spent watching movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably a lot, but probably not as much as you think."
"__MOVIES__ I think I will watch Godfather 3 tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Sequels!"
"__MOVIES__ I love sequels.  So what is your favorite sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ You did not just say that, did you really just say that?"
"__MOVIES__ I was kidding."
"__MOVIES__ Not funny."
