"__MOVIES__ Did you like Beauty and the Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ I adored it! I like it more than the original."
"__MOVIES__ The casting was great wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, it has some of my favorite actors in it!"
"__MOVIES__ Emma Watson, Ewan McGregor, Sir Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson etc are some of my all time favorite actors."
"__MOVIES__ Did you watch it in 3D? Because it's even more spectacular on an Imax 3D screen."
"__MOVIES__ I did actually. I loved all the special effects. And the songs too!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I love how they stayed true to the original, yet made it their own."
"__MOVIES__ That's not easy to do, I agree. Which do you prefer?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, definitely this one. It's fantastic to finally see an adaptation that lives up to the original."
"__MOVIES__ This move felt much longer than the 1991 version. Didn't you think so too?"
"__MOVIES__ It is longer. It's 45 minutes longer than the original."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay. I know that at a budget of $160 million, his was the most expensive musical ever made."
"__MOVIES__ That's staggering, but I can well believe it."
"__MOVIES__ Which is the most hateful character in the movie according to you?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Gaston without a doubt."
"__MOVIES__ I concur. I especially hate his treatment of Belle."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I also felt like it was more accentuated in this move."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably because the characters were all real and not animated like in the original."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, undoubtedly, but I would definitely watch it again."
