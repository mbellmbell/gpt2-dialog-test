"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Han Solo would be a fan of his solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he would think it was silly."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was just sort of boring before the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it will show him and Jabba the Hut."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe why he was in trouble with him."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think when Vader put Solo in the Carbonite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was actual not originally part of the plot."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They did that because Harrison Ford was not sure he wanted to do another movie, so they needed an easy out."
