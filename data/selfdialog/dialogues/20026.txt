"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Daniel Day-Lewis, without a doubt."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, he's one of the best. He always picks great scripts too."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly - you know the movie will be great because he's very discerning about what he does."
"__MOVIES__ He only makes a movie once every few years, right?"
"__MOVIES__ That's right. He's incredibly picky about what projects he does."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's why he only ever works with huge directors like Scorsese and Spielberg."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite movie of his isn't even by one of the big Hollywood directors."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? What is it?"
"__MOVIES__ 'There Will Be Blood', directed by Paul Thomas Anderson."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was incredible. It absolutely blew me away."
"__MOVIES__ Day-Lewis completely deserved his Oscar for it."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot he won Best Actor for that film! Yes he did deserve it, he was terrifying."
"__MOVIES__ The movie was already brilliantly written and he brought it to life."
"__MOVIES__ The scenery in that movie was stunning, too."
"__MOVIES__ Even though it's long I could watch it a million times."
"__MOVIES__ Some people found that film boring, apparently."
"__MOVIES__ I can see why - it's more about character progression than action and big explosions."
"__MOVIES__ I think people are spoiled nowadays with all the action. Not everything needs to move a mile a minute."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. 'There Will Be Blood' is a good example of the benefits of slow storytelling."
