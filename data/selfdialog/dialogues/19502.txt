"__MOVIES__ I see there's yet another Transformers movie coming out."
"__MOVIES__ Is there really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, think it's being released today in fact."
"__MOVIES__ What's this one called?"
"__MOVIES__ The Last Knight."
"__MOVIES__ Is it the final movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably not.  They will keep making these things until they start losing money."
"__MOVIES__ Fat chance of that happening anytime soon."
"__MOVIES__ This one apparently has Optimus Prime as the bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ Is he really the bad guy or more of an anti-hero?"
"__MOVIES__ Hard to say for certain since I haven't seen it, but I would guess the latter."
"__MOVIES__ I lost track of these movies.  Is the 4th or 5th?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't even know to be honest.  They all run together for me."
"__MOVIES__ Is this one directed by Michael Bay?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe so.  I think he's done them all so far."
"__MOVIES__ So if I see it, I should expect lots of explosions and corny dialogue?"
"__MOVIES__ And long tracking shots.  Don't forget about those."
"__MOVIES__ Who could ever forget about those?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you want to go see it with me?"
"__MOVIES__ Why not?  Sounds like we need some escapism."
