"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Prophets of Rage?"
"__MUSIC__ It's that band with the former members of Rage Against the Machine and Cypress Hill isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it also has a couple of members from Public Enemy. Do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I really liked Rage Against the Machine but this sounds very different."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah you can't really replicate the old Rage Against the Machine without the lead singer Zach de la Rocha. But I went to see them live and they sound pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe if I saw them live I would like them better."
"__MUSIC__ The concert was rocking! Tom Morello is an awesome guitarist."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he does some awesome special effects with his guitar. Is the drummer from Rage Against the Machine in that band?"
"__MUSIC__ Him and the old bassist from Rage are in this band. Chuck D from public enemy also is in the band."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of weird. I always thought of Chuck D as a gangster rapper."
"__MUSIC__ They really mix well though. They have a sort of rock rap vibe to them that's catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I would have to listen to them live to really get a good feel for them."
"__MUSIC__ If you get a chance to go to one of their concerts, you should definitely go."
"__MUSIC__ I want to go see Green Day, but they are not touring anywhere near where I live."
"__MUSIC__ Going to a Green Day concert would be awesome! They play with a lot of energy."
"__MUSIC__ I would also love to see the Foo Fighters! I still listen to them on a regular basis!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, seeing the Foo Fighters live would also be awesome."
"__MUSIC__ They just announced they will be releasing a new album shortly! It will be called 'Concrete and Gold'."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Wow, I can't wait to hear it."
"__MUSIC__ They will probably have a tour after they release their album so we might get a chance to see them live!"
