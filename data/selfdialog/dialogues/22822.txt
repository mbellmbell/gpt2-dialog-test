"__DISNEY__ I like the animated Beauty and the Beast better I think"
"__DISNEY__ Not me, I have parts of both the animated and the new one I really like"
"__DISNEY__ So are you saying you couldn't pick a favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably not easily. I mean, they are not even both the same type, like both cartoons or whatever."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I see your point, I just grew up watching the old animation."
"__DISNEY__ So did I, and I love it, always will. The new one just brings the story to life in a whole new way for me."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I will agree with you there. Some moments I was just ear to ear grinning and right on the edge of my seat."
"__DISNEY__ I will admit, and maybe it's just my age, but I don't see myself watching this one as many times as I watched the animated as a child."
"__DISNEY__ True, but like you said, probably more of an age thing, we don't have the time anymore."
"__DISNEY__ We should make time, have a disney movie night."
