"__STAR_WARS__ Does the character of C3PO need to still exist?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah and I think R2D2 and him make a good duo."
"__STAR_WARS__ They seem like they are just around now for no reason."
"__STAR_WARS__ They offer alot in terms of the story line though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just think they are old characters and Star Wars needs to depart them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they will but they need a bridge"
"__STAR_WARS__ For what purpose?"
"__STAR_WARS__ To connect older fans to the new Star Wars"
"__STAR_WARS__ So Luke eventually gets killed off?"
