"__SUPERHERO__ I'm going to give an unpopular opinion: I loved Spider-Man 3."
"__SUPERHERO__ You did? Why?"
"__SUPERHERO__ There were a lot of villains and Tobey's character spoke to me."
"__SUPERHERO__ You were emo, that's right."
"__SUPERHERO__ What did you think of it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I only saw two-thirds of it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why just that much? Did you walk out."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, but not on my own."
"__SUPERHERO__ Huh?"
"__SUPERHERO__ The theater's fire alarm went off right before the third act. They gave us free passes but I didn't come back to finish it. I used it on a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I think."
