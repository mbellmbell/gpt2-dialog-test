"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Arizona Cardinals, but my family is full of Dallas Cowboy fans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you like the Cardinals and not the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Larry Fitzgerald is one of the best receivers, if not one of the best players to ever play the game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you there, and I'd say the same about Odell Beckham Jr. on the Giants"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You like the New York Giants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They aren't my favorite team, but I do like OBJ and Eli Manning, and I'm excited about them getting Brandon Marshall"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, now there's a great receiver tandem, like having Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski on the same team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but I hate the Patriots, even if they are full of talent"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too; I'd like to see someone else winning in the AFC for once"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the Steelers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same as you feel about the Patriots, I guess; I recognize the talent, but I'd like to see less of them overall"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Makes sense, kind of how the Broncos faded into obscurity when Peyton Manning left"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They still have a lot of great players like Von Miller and Demarius Thomas"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose so, but they didn't play so great last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of teams didn't play great but I think this next season is going to be a bit different with all the new acquisitions"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team do you think is going to turn it around the most?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think with a new coach and GM, the San Francisco 49ers have a pretty good shot"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, and there's nowhere to go but up when you have a two-win season and miss the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I miss the old 49ers-Seahawks rivalry. Here's hoping the NFL is more competitive this season!"
