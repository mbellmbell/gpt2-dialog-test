"__MOVIES__ Hey John how are you?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm great Deb, what are you doing today?"
"__MOVIES__ I am seeing the new Shymalan film, I forget the name."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the film 'Split'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that is the one! My friends said it was scary!"
"__MOVIES__ I actually saw it the other day, I love how it ended."
"__MOVIES__ Oh did you? Was it as scary as they say?"
"__MOVIES__ I definitely do not want to ruin anything, but there are scary moments."
"__MOVIES__ I heard the girls are bad at acting, was it distracting?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not at all. I think all the girls did a great job. The lead actor was wonderful too."
"__MOVIES__ James McAvoy! That is one of the reasons I want to see the film."
"__MOVIES__ Haha! I get it, he is a truly awesome actor. Portrayed demented quite well."
"__MOVIES__ Now you have me more excited than ever to see the film!"
"__MOVIES__ I am free for the next few hours, we can grab lunch or see the film if you want!"
"__MOVIES__ You wouldn't mind seeing it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, I love rewatching movies, especially in good company."
"__MOVIES__ That is so kind of you to say, let me clear my schedule!"
"__MOVIES__ This will be awesome! I never knew you liked horror films."
"__MOVIES__ I like them in good company."
"__MOVIES__ You got me there."
