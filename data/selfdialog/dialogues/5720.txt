"__STAR_WARS__ Hon Solo is like Lord Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ What are you talking about?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well think about it, they both dress mostly with black clothing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Along with half the cast, so what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, well they both did illegal things for power."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hon Solo followed a code of honor at least, Vader is just evil."
"__STAR_WARS__ Fine, last and most important. They were both killed by their sons."
"__STAR_WARS__ Holy cow, you may actually be on to something."
"__STAR_WARS__ If Kylo Ren ends up having a sister, then say hello to Lord Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ This is starting to get weird, I think we need a marathon to research this issue."
