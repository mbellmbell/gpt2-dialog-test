"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm starting my fantasy football team soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not bad enough that you watch it incessantly you also spend every second of free time with that fantasy stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's wrong with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nothing, I guess. But did you ever notice most football fans look as if they've never done anything physical in their lives other than life a beer glass?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you commenting on my physique?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the shoe fits ... or should I say 'if the pants are tight ...'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Once again, you're mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was just teasing. Lord knows I'm the last person to talk. I just dislike sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't like them at all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a fair weather fan. I only have an interest if they are in the play offs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is fair weather."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Minnesota fans kind of suck anyway so I fit right in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I recall on Fran Tarkenton's very last game, after years of performing for these people, he made a bad play and these 'fans' booed him off the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cold blooded."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure is. Even as a sports hating little kid I knew they were in the wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you think they've gotten better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're so cynical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a realist."
