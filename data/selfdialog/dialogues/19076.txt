"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Pirates of the Carribean movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No! Have you?"
"__MOVIES__ I just did, I loved it!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I want to see it. Is it a lot like the other ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the style is the same and Johnny Depp is in it. He is so good at physical comedy, he cracks me up."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know, you gotta love Captain Jack Sparrow."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Orlando Bloom is in it, but only at the beginning and the end. His son is one of the main characters."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? Was he good?"
"__MOVIES__ Kinda. I feel like his character needs to develop more. He wasn't as strong a character as Will Turner."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think there will be more?"
"__MOVIES__ I do ... but I don't want to give too much away. If you watch it you have to stay till the end of the credits."
"__MOVIES__ Oh one of those huh? Okay thanks for the tip! Did any of the other characters come back?"
"__MOVIES__ Captain Barbosa was back, and some of the other pirates from the other movies, but I can't remember the character's names."
"__MOVIES__ No Elizabeth?"
"__MOVIES__ She does make a little appearance."
"__MOVIES__ Oh nice. Watching those movies always makes me want to go to Disneyland."
"__MOVIES__ Totally! I love it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Do you want to go with me?"
"__MOVIES__ To the movies or to Disneyland?"
"__MOVIES__ Well for now we'll have to settle for the movies."
