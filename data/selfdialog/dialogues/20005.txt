"__MOVIES__ Did you see the trailer for the new Jumanji movie yet?"
"__MOVIES__ The one with the Rock, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Karen Gillan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! I just saw the trailer today and it brought back so many memories from the original Jumanji I watched as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ I caught it just before you came out here, and I have to disagree. It looks like they changed so many things!"
"__MOVIES__ I think I welcome these fresh takes. I know the original with Robin Williams will forever hold it's place in adventure and fantasy as far as movies go but this new one looks to be a lot of fun!"
"__MOVIES__ I think the Rock and Kevin Hart showed good chemistry in Central Intelligence so with them being together again for this there might be hope."
"__MOVIES__ I really like that tandem. I think Jack Black and Karen Gillan are great additions too."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the scene where she does a running roundhouse flying kick to someone on a motorcycle?"
"__MOVIES__ That looked really good! I liked the effects I saw from the animals rampaging around. It looks like it's going to be action packed."
"__MOVIES__ What I got from the trailer was that the kids are playing Jumanji, but it's not a board game anymore, it's a video game now."
"__MOVIES__ That's what it looks like. I don't mind. They have to modernize things a bit for the audience today."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, let's be real, kids these days don't exactly gather around to play board games as much as our time."
"__MOVIES__ Right, so that's why the Jumanji movie coming up has made it a point to present something they can relate to, video games."
"__MOVIES__ I'm still a bit skeptical. I probably won't see it on opening night, but depending on how people respond to it I'll decide then."
"__MOVIES__ I think it opens a few days after the new Star Wars!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's going to be kind of tough to try to win over audiences."
"__MOVIES__ It's going to be a challenge for Jumanji to make an impact with Star Wars releasing."
"__MOVIES__ I know I will for a fact go watch the opening for Star Wars!"
"__MOVIES__ Get ready to wait in long lines!"
"__MOVIES__ It'll be worth the wait I'm sure!"
