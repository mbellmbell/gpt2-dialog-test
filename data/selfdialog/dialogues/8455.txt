"__BEATLES__ I may get some flack for saying this, but I think the Beatles are overrated."
"__BEATLES__ How could you even think that?"
"__BEATLES__ Maybe it is because I am younger and I wasn't alive when they were at their height.  I don't know."
"__BEATLES__ What is your criticism of them?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, I think they did make decent songs.  I guess I like my bands with a little more edge to them."
"__BEATLES__ I think the Beatles were masters of taking a song that sounds clean on the surface, but it had some crazy alternative meaning."
"__BEATLES__ I may have to dig deeper into their catalog."
"__BEATLES__ Have you heard of the song 'Helter Skelter'?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, that is probably my favorite Beatles song.  It reminds me of something the Rolling Stones would do."
"__BEATLES__ It sounds like you enjoy the more straightforward rock and roll songs.  That may be why you don't like some of The Beatles' work."
