"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man did you get your Saints season tickets in the mail yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure did. The 2017 tickets look amazing, I love the new deisgn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here brotha! I hope your pretty pumped about getting to go to London for the October 1st game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude you have no idea. Kinda wish we were playing a better team though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh it's whatever. The Doplhins suck but it's just going to be cool to expierence an NFL game overseas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully beers don't cost $9 like they do in the Superdome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha I hate that so much. Do you remember the Saints/Raiders game last season when that guy infront of us bought like 20 beers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ofcourse I remember that, I also remember how bad of a game that was for us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was very close game just like half of the games last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Our defense sucks so bad, I'm really losing hope that we will win another SuperBowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotta have faith man, gotta have faith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How more years do think Drew Brees has left?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most likely 2 or 3 but who knows, he could get hurt before that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He said he wants to retire as a New Orleans Saint so I have faith in that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Brees is our only hope to win another championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We did draft a bunch of defensive players in the draft this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wasn't too impressed with some of our later 5 and 6th picks but overall I thought Mikey Loomis did okay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah same. I think Sean Payton is making most calls in regards to drafting. Loomis is just a front."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha. I wouldn't doubt it but you gotta give Sean Payton some credit, he's a genius and a great coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really is. It sucks knowing Brees and Payton will gone one day."
