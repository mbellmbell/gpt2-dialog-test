"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Kind of, I watched them all with my husband before The Force Awakens came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean kind of?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he found some version of the prequels online that were supposed to be better.  They cut out a lot of the stuff he told me was stupid."
"__STAR_WARS__ Man, people really seem to not like the prequels.  I didn't think they were that bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ What I saw wasn't bad but I don't know how different they were.  I don't like Hayden Christensen though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't either.  He's not a good actor.  That was a poor choice to play Anakin.  Even Natalie Portman didn't do a great job."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, normally she's a great actress.  It can't have been the material though because I thought the story line was pretty good."
"__STAR_WARS__ A lot of people say that it's too complicated with the whole thing with the Trade Federation and Senate and all that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't think so.  I understood all of that.  My favorite part was actually the fall of the Jedi Temple in the third film."
