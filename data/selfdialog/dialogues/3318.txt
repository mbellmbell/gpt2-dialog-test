"__MUSIC__ What do you think about correcting pop and rap lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ There's a YouTube channel called 'Grammatically correct rap' or something."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like something I'd love!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm sure."
"__MUSIC__ I correct lyrics all the time."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it's kind of irritating."
"__MUSIC__ So what's your beef with it?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think it's insulting?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's insulting to disrespect basic grammar."
"__MUSIC__ Can I offer an explanation as to why?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure."
"__MUSIC__ English teachers don't write music. It's not entertainment, really."
"__MUSIC__ So?"
"__MUSIC__ So, music in all forms doesn't keep proper grammar because it doesn't work."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Think about rhymes."
"__MUSIC__ okay?"
"__MUSIC__ It's way harder to rhyme grammatically correct words than those considered incorrect. It's easier on the ears."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but if it's more difficult, it should be more respected, like art music. They always use proper grammar and it's just as fun."
