"__STAR_WARS__ What's your least favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess most people would say The Phantom Menace. But I feel like I should mix it up and say Attack of the Clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why Attack of the Clones and not The Phantom Menace?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sometimes The Phantom Menace almost works, since it has a child star who comes off as compelling."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Attack of the Clones doesn't have that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, not at all! It was supposed to be building up to the Darth Vader story, but instead we get the worst movie love story in history."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean Padme and Anakin?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, Padme and Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's the worst feature of it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The cheesy lines! George Lucas can create a world, but he can't speak to the person next to him."
