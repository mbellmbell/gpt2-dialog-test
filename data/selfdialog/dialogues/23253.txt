"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see Disney's version of Pinocchio?"
"__DISNEY__ The old cartoon?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's it."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, my mom had rented it for us on VHS when I was a kid."
"__DISNEY__ And you still remember it?"
"__DISNEY__ I remember parts of it."
"__DISNEY__ What do you remember from it?"
"__DISNEY__ I think what stuck with me were the things that became controversial?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, like don't the kids smoke and drink beer?"
