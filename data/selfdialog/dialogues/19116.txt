"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new movie Get Out?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't seen it yet. Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good. There was lots of thrilling moments."
"__MOVIES__ Ooh, I like a good thriller. A movie that keeps you guessing is always a must see."
"__MOVIES__ It's hard to believe it was written and directed by that guy on Key and Peele, Jordan Peele."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I didn't know he could direct, let alone write a whole movie. Move over Tyler Perry."
"__MOVIES__ It was a movie that definitely made you think. Do people really act like this or think this way?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the trailer and have been meaning to go see it. I will definitely find some time this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ You should, I think you will like it."
"__MOVIES__ There's not a lot of blood and gore in it is there?"
"__MOVIES__ No only maybe at the end. Oh, and there is an alternate ending if you wait for the credits to finish."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love those when they give you an alternate ending. Then you can decide which one you like better."
"__MOVIES__ Well I didn't like the alternate ending very much. I prefer the ending of the movie where the good guy wins in the end."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah me too. I like a movie that gives you an ending, not like those movies that keep you wondering."
"__MOVIES__ I know, to me the alternate ending would be the one that would keep you wondering."
"__MOVIES__ I am really excited to see it now. I can't wait for the weekend so I can go to the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Good I'm glad I could help you make that decision. Don't forget the popcorn."
"__MOVIES__ I won't forget the popcorn or the M&Ms."
"__MOVIES__ I know you will enjoy it. Maybe you should take someone with you though. Since it is a thriller."
"__MOVIES__ No I think I will see this one alone. It will be more thrilling that way."
