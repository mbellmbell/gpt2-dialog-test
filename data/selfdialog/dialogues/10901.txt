"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think was the best kicker in NFL History?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely Adam Viniatieri. The guy was clutch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to agree with Adam Vinitatieri. Guy made two game winning kicks in the Super Bowl and kicked a 40 yarder in a snow storm in New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He never seemed to miss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy is ancient now and is still good. He's pushing 45."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Forty-five. I would have figured he was pushing fifty. Ha ha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Funny. He just might kick till he is fifty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Other honorable mention kickers would be Morten Andersen and Gary Anderson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gary Anderson. The guy probably still can't get over that kick in Minnesota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy was automatic all year and missed a 40 yarder inside the dome. So sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, definitely a sad situation. Gary Anderson is a good guy and sometimes bad things happen to good guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Morten Andersen was a great kicker also. He was a left foot kicker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is pretty unusual in the NFL. That guy was pretty clutch also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He played for a bad franchise his entire career. So, he didn't get too many high-pressured situations in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He certainly did not. The Saints were awful for most of his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are some other kickers that come to mind for you? I can think of Matt Bryant and Jason Elam."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can agree with those two. They have field goal distance records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Elam kicked a 64 yarder a few years ago. Right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, that was Matt Prater. Denver always had good kickers, so it's easy to get confused."
