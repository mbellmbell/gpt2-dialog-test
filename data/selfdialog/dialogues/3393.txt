"__MUSIC__ Are you going to see Iron Maiden in Brooklyn in July?"
"__MUSIC__ I really wanted to go, but in the end, I decided not to."
"__MUSIC__ What? I thought you were the ultimate Iron Maiden fan! How can you not go?"
"__MUSIC__ I heard they were only playing songs off the new album. They're not playing ANY of the old classics!"
"__MUSIC__ Woah, are you serious? How can that be? Fans want to hear the classic songs from all the old albums."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! I want to hear songs from Powerslave, The Number of the Beast, Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. The new material can't compare to the great songs they played while I was growing up."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder why they would do that..."
"__MUSIC__ I guess they only play the old songs on the tours between albums."
"__MUSIC__ That's really dumb if you ask me. They should at least play a mix of old and new songs."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Somebody should tell that to the band!"
"__MUSIC__ So I noticed you only mentioned you wanted to hear albums with songs that have Bruce Dickinson on vocals. What about the first two albums?"
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, I'm really not crazy about the albums with Paul Di'anno on vocals."
"__MUSIC__ That's blasphemy! Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ He's an inferior vocalist to Dickinson. As was Blaze Bayley in the other albums I didn't mention."
"__MUSIC__ You mean to say you don't like Di'anno's songs like Charlotte the Harlot? Those are cult classics too!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but when you hear Dickinson do his versions of those songs in concert, the difference is tremendous."
"__MUSIC__ Well I have to agree with you that Dickinson is the better vocalist, but you have to respect Paul Di'anno."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't say I didn't respect him. I just said I didn't really like his vocal performance."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, Are you sure you don't want to go to the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think I'll sit this one out and wait for a tour where they play the old songs!"
