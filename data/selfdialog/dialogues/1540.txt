"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to Ben Folds?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who is he?"
"__MUSIC__ He is this piano player, but has this pop rock style."
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think I ever heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, someone showed me a video of him."
"__MUSIC__ Like a concert video?"
"__MUSIC__ Not quite.  See, the guy is actually really super talented and a great composer."
"__MUSIC__ So what's the video about?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he's doing a concert or something and composes a song on the spot."
"__MUSIC__ How does he do that?"
"__MUSIC__ The audience gives him a key, a subject and he just rolls with it."
"__MUSIC__ He just puts together a song right there on his piano?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that's the crazy part!  He does this several part piece with violins, cellos, trumpets, and everything."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?  How long did it take him?"
"__MUSIC__ Only a few minutes!"
"__MUSIC__ A few minutes?  That's the crazy part!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess it is.  You really need to see the video."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of want to now!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll send you the link."
"__MUSIC__ Please, because I have to see this!"
