"__MOVIES__ Lisa I just saw a trailer for a new shark movie."
"__MOVIES__ Shark movie? I didn't know they were making another shark attack movie."
"__MOVIES__ Seems like they have one every summer."
"__MOVIES__ That's for sure. What's the name of this one?"
"__MOVIES__ 47 Meters Down."
"__MOVIES__ 47 Metes Down?  What's that about?"
"__MOVIES__ Two sisters Kate and Lisa and go  to Mexico for a vacation filled with sun, fun and adventure."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess. They get themselves in the water and attacked by some sharks."
"__MOVIES__ Something like that but not quite."
"__MOVIES__ You know, all these shark movies do is make people fear sharks. It's not like sharks walk on the land and attack us."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. They are always made to be the villains in the movie but they be in their natural habit when they attack people."
"__MOVIES__ So what does that tell you?  Stay out of the water and you won't be attacked."
"__MOVIES__ In the movie, the one sister suggests that they go diving in shark-infested waters."
"__MOVIES__ I would have said no right there."
"__MOVIES__ This is a movie it wouldn't be fun it they had some common sense."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah well common sense saves lives."
"__MOVIES__ You're too much. Anyway they think they will be safe in a protective cage to go swimming with a group of great whites"
"__MOVIES__ You said 'think.' What goes wrong?"
"__MOVIES__ Their cage breaks away from their boat, sending them plummeting to the ocean floor with a dwindling supply of oxygen."
"__MOVIES__ See, if they had kept their behinds on land, that would not happen. I think I will go see that movie just so that I can yell at them for being so stupid."
