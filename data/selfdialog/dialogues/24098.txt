"__SUPERHERO__ I hate how the movies are so rushed"
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean by rushed"
"__SUPERHERO__ What does the word mean"
"__SUPERHERO__ It means it was not done thoughtfully"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well that is what i mean"
"__SUPERHERO__ Why do you feel that way"
"__SUPERHERO__ Comic book movies with superheros are always rushed"
"__SUPERHERO__ Not always some are pretty good"
"__SUPERHERO__ That is the exception not the rule to be honest"
"__SUPERHERO__ Gotta give some of them a chance."
