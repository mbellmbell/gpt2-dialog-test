"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you see Lady Gaga sing Sound of Music?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I heard she did that but, I didn't see it. Did you?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I did! I loved it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She sang it at an awards show, right?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, The Oscars. You should look it up."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I will. I wouldn't have guessed that the same woman that sang Poker Face would be singing from an old musical."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Me either! But it was fantastic."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What made it so special?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I guess the fact that it was unexpected! But, it was also really beautiful and elegant."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Now, I have to see it"
