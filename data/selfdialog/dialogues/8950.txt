"__BEATLES__ You know what song is always beautiful to me?"
"__BEATLES__ What song?"
"__BEATLES__ 'Eleanor Rigby.'"
"__BEATLES__ There was definitely such a unique quality about that one."
"__BEATLES__ Did you know that it was one of the first songs by them that isn't sang in a first person perspective?"
"__BEATLES__ Now that you mention it, there were no 'I's' or 'me's' in that song at all.  At least not that I can recall."
"__BEATLES__ It also really resonated with me.  And so many others."
"__BEATLES__ I could definitely also relate to that sort of loneliness they sang about."
"__BEATLES__ Exactly.  Sad, but also universal concepts."
"__BEATLES__ That gave it depth and made it all the more beautiful, like you said earlier."
