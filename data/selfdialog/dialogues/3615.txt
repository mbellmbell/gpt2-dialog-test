"__MUSIC__ How much should I expect to pay for a music theory tutor?"
"__MUSIC__ It depends. What year are you?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a senior in high school preparing for college."
"__MUSIC__ So you're looking for a way to study theory before undergrad?"
"__MUSIC__ Ideally I'd like to place out of a few courses to make my degree shorter. I've heard people take five years in this program and we can't afford that."
"__MUSIC__ Who you study music with and where will determine the pay."
"__MUSIC__ Are there any professors at my school who will work with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Sadly, no. They're not like instrument professors and don't have the time or availability to teach private lessons."
"__MUSIC__ So who should I go see?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd recommend emailing a music theory professor at your school and asking for recommendations."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think will happen?"
"__MUSIC__ You'll get a junior or senior to teach you, probably one who struggled with music theory."
"__MUSIC__ I want someone who would get an A to teach me!"
"__MUSIC__ No, you don't."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ The people who struggled and got a B+ or A- are far better than those who got an A+ with no effort."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Because they have no idea what it's like to struggle and not understand. They don't know how to relate to the students as much."
"__MUSIC__ Ahh, that makes sense. How much?"
"__MUSIC__ A music theory tutor in undergrad can probably do it for $10-15 per hour. If you want a grad student, expect $20 or $30, depending on experience. You'll pay more but be better prepared."
