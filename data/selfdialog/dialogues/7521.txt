"__LADY_GAGA__ Whatever happened to Lady Gaga? Haven't heard much about her, except last time when she performed at the Superbowl halftime."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I feel like she fell of the map. It's a shame, she's a really great singer and piano player."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly! The Fame Monster is probably one of my favorite pop albums of all time."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I totally agree it's a good album, but I'm more partial to her debut album, The Fame."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh really? What's your favorite song on that album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Hard to say, but I really love Paparazzi and Poker Face."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Can't go wrong with Poker Face, that's the song that made her blow up."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, did you ever see her perform the piano version of it? It was so full of emotion and talent."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Of course I have, the thing I love about Lady Gaga is that she's a great artist even without the studio effects."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Amen to that! I hope she goes on tour soon, I'd love to see her live."
