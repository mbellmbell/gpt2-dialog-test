"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I guess I never gave her too much thought."
"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with her music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, yeah, I know her hits.  They never stop playing them on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ That's true."
"__MUSIC__ I know those songs but until you asked, I never really sat down and thought long about it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, now is your chance.  Thoughts?"
"__MUSIC__ I suppose some of her music always came across to me as derivative."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Just that she sounds like every other pop artist out there, in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you have a point that pop music does sound similar in a lot of cases."
"__MUSIC__ Yea.  Though I do have to say that despite that, she does know how to make catchy songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yea.  They may not be the most complex songs, but they'll stay in your mind for weeks."
"__MUSIC__ Whoever produces her music is really good at what they do."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  'Take it Off' is still stuck in my head, and I think I've only heard it a handful of times."
"__MUSIC__ That one, I like too!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think her pop music is better than her original 'country' music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, for sure.  I never really saw her older stuff as country."
"__MUSIC__ You and me both."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say that's pretty universal.  Definitely prefer her stuff now versus before."
