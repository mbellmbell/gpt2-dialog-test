"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football!!!! Alright!  Almost time for football!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you like football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck, yeah!  Packers fan for life, dude!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many will they win this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinkin at least 22 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmmm, I think there's only 16 games in the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm countin playoffs.  Playoffs!!!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, so I think that'd make 19 games if they win the Super Bowl.  Where's the extra 2?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You forgot the Wild Card game, dude?  Get your head out of your butt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, the Packers are going to go 16-0 and still play in the Wild Card game?  How's that work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Politics, man, it's all about the politics.  It'll happen.  You just wait and see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, assuming that they play in the Wild Card game, that only makes 20 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You forgot the Pro Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the NFC players in the Pro Bowl will all be from the Packers?  You sure about that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Heck, yeah.  Nelson is going to have 27 TDs and 2,700 yards this year.  And Cobb will have 19 TDs and 1,500 yards.  He's not as good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait a minute.  You're telling me that Rodgers is going to throw for 4,400 yards to just those two players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. I forgot the other receivers.  Well, they'll combine for another 3,000 yards and another 19 TDs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So now Rodgers is up to 7,400 yards and 65 TDs this year?  It seems that that's a little high.  Is he also going to throw passes to himself?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?  He can do it all.  Football!!!!!!  Go Packers!!!!!  Go beer!!!!!  Go shirtless fat guys!!!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You scare me."
