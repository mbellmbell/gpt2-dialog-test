"__STAR_WARS__ When did you first see a Star Wars film?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw it in the theater back in the Summer of 1977."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, I didn't think you looked that old.  What did you think of it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was a cool movie that got right down to business. It starts with a battle scene, unlike other movies that seem to take forever to get going."
"__STAR_WARS__ So the first movie is still your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say so, but I remember that I'd learned in kindergarten a few months before that if you put an s after a word it makes it plural, and there was only one war in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess George Lucas sort of fixed that as he went along."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess so, but I think it was a big mistake to make Luke Darth Vader's son."
"__STAR_WARS__ But that's essential to the entire series.  Why do you think that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In the first movie Luke and Han were everyman heroes.  Making Luke Vader's son turns him into a chosen-one superhero who comes by his by by his genetics."
