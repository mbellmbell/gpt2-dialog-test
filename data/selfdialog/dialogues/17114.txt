"__MOVIES__ So did you hear about the new Alien movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw the trailer when I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, it seemed interesting. Is it going to have the girl from the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Sigorney Weaver? Nah, this one's based on the Prometheus series."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, I hated Prometheus."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it myself, I've only seen Alien and Aliens."
"__MOVIES__ The only ones worth seeing, to be honest,"
"__MOVIES__ What was so bad about Prometheus?"
"__MOVIES__ So in the original Alien, you cared about the characters, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, for sure! It was so sad when that one girl got grabbed by the tentacles especially."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. In this one, there were just a ton of characters that you didn't care about and didn't really matter."
"__MOVIES__ But surely that's not all there was, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not. The dialogue was bad, the plot holes were so large you could drive a truck through them, it was just a disaster."
"__MOVIES__ Ouch. Do you think this one's going to be as bad?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, it depends on whether the same people wrote this film. The trailer didn't seem so bad anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think I should watch Prometheus before this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, just read a summary online somewhere and save your time."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. Maybe I'll just watch Aliens again instead."
"__MOVIES__ Now that, my friend, is an excellent idea!"
