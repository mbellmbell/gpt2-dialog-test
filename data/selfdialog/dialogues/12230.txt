"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Dwaye Allen's chances this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, he should be fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but he never really worked out in Baltimore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but in New England he has Tom Brady throwing to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but Andrew Luck is also pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but only one of those guys is already guaranteed a spot in the Hall of Fame."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will give you that, but what about Gronkowski?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if Gronk is healthy, won't he take all the catches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He will get his share, but there is always room for more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even so, will there be resentment over salary?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because the two have similar contracts, you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that is what I'm asking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they are all professionals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, what about the coaching."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well no one knows what Bill is thinking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was referring to the Offensive Coordinator."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, Josh McDaniels.     He will be fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you see this as another Patriots victory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that is my interpretation."
