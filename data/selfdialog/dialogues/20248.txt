"__MOVIES__ Hey, do you have any plans for this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ No not at the moment. What do you have in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking of going to the movies. Do you know of anything that is out at the moment?"
"__MOVIES__ Right now I know that The Mummy, Cars 3, and Wonder Woman are out."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm all of those sounds OK. Would you be interested in seeing The Mummy with me?"
"__MOVIES__ I have actually read bad reviews about that one."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What did they say?"
"__MOVIES__ Mainly that Tom Cruise did a bad job and that they do not compare well to the older releases."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds about right, I think I'll pass on that one then."
"__MOVIES__ Would you be open to seeing Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure! That sounds like it would be a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is. I have friends who have told me it is very good. Are you familiar with the story?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. Should I watch some of the older Marvel movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that would be a smart idea. It would help you understand what's going on."
"__MOVIES__ Which movies should I watch to catch up with the storyline?"
"__MOVIES__ You should check out the Avenger movies and the prequels."
"__MOVIES__ Which are the prequels?"
"__MOVIES__ Captain America and it's sequels and the Iron Man series is a must watch to know the back story."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome! Thanks for the help. I will check those out before we go."
"__MOVIES__ No problem. Thanks for inviting me to go with you."
