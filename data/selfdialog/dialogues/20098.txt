"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the documentary Nobody Speak?"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that about Hulk Hogan suing Gawker over a sex tape?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that whole thing was ridiculous, just a media circus. I wouldn't want to watch a documentary on that."
"__MOVIES__ It's really fascinating, you should watch it. It's insane how the state court ruled against Gawker, even though Federal courts had refused to."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't they bankrupt Gawker?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they closed it down. And they went after individuals in the company like the reporter and editor, and bankrupted them too."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I could see blaming the editor, but the reported didn't have the final say on what they put online, so it seems bad to be blaming him."
"__MOVIES__ It's so bad in so many ways. The movie explained that Hulk Hogan never had the money to fund the lawsuit."
"__MOVIES__ Then how was he able to sue?"
"__MOVIES__ Secretly, at least during the trial, a billionaire executive was funding Hulk Hogan."
"__MOVIES__ Why would he do that?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently he hated Gawker enough that he wanted to destroy them completely, and he was willing to out-spend Gawker's legal team big time."
"__MOVIES__ Is that legal?"
"__MOVIES__ The movie said that amazingly it is. A billionaire can go after any media outlet and crush them. It's terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Well wait, how could Hulk win a lawsuit when he went on TV and radio and joked about the sex tape?"
"__MOVIES__ I know, that should have made it impossible for him to win. But this was a court and jurors in his town, and the judge even criticized online media before deliberations!"
"__MOVIES__ That's awful."
"__MOVIES__ It really is. They said Hulk is reported to know he was being filmed anyway, it was never a secret sex tape."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a set up!"
