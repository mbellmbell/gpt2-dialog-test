"__THRILLER__ What did you think about The Bourne Identity?"
"__THRILLER__ Probably one of my all time favorite movies."
"__THRILLER__ I love Matt Damon"
"__THRILLER__ I saw the behind the scenes of how they make it, and they put a lot of detail into those fight scenes"
"__THRILLER__ The whole trilogy was good, but then it started to go downhill a bit when they introducted jeremy renner."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, the bourne legacy was a bit weird."
"__THRILLER__ And the newest Bourne Film was a bit lackluster too unfortunatly"
"__THRILLER__ I agree, the original 3 films were so good, that my expectations were probably just too high."
"__THRILLER__ Here's hoping they can figure out a way to get that quality back."
"__THRILLER__ I'm sure they will focus on a good story like the original"
