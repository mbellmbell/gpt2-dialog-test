"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think a 2000 yard season from a wide receiver is possible?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I think thats way too lofty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its a passing league now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But who could get that many receptions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Odell Beckham could."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but you would have to average almost 130 yards a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You dont think thats hard?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean when you break it down like that no its not hard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why dont you think more guys do that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cause getting to 130 is hard enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guys produce like that all the time"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but then they disappear like that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You dont think in todays game Jerry Rice could do that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may be able to"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the QB targets him more, it opens up other guys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but then you have backs tearing it up for 200 yards rushing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then when they single cover the receiver he gets his"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish it worked like that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ May be we do see it before long"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they extend the season, yeah"
