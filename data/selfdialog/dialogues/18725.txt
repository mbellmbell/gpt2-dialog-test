"__MOVIES__ DId you ever think that you would see those two acting in a movie of this caliber together?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one of them?"
"__MOVIES__ The only ones who matter- Kurt Russel and Samuel L. Jackson."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I never really thought about it."
"__MOVIES__ That's the point. It's like suddenly seeing Dwayne Johnson and Adam Sandler together."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think that would be a movie worth watching- are you trying to tell me that The Hateful Eight is not worth watching?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think it is an uncanny pair up. You get to see Russel's hard nose attitude and his sense of justice exist in a world of prejudice and divisions."
"__MOVIES__ Hasn't he acted is westerns before though?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but there was never a distinct tone of slavery in his movies- not that I cam remember anyway."
"__MOVIES__ So that's what made the movie great, slavery?"
"__MOVIES__ No, once you have a post civil war setting and a badass like Jackson, you get a no holds bar character who leaves little to chance and who is keen as can be."
"__MOVIES__ So the two play off of each other- it sort of sounds like a cop movie."
"__MOVIES__ It sort of is. Jackson plays a dishonored soldier in the movie, and Russel plays as the muddy arm of the law, a gunslinger who bring fugitives to justice."
"__MOVIES__ What are they trying to do in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well they both have bounties which they are trying to collect."
"__MOVIES__ So they are hunting people?"
"__MOVIES__ No, when we come into the movie, they already got their quarry. Jackson has a pile of dead men, and Russel is escorting Leigh to a town where she will be hung."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds gruesome, but this is a Tarantino film, so I guess it is par for the course."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it is not lost on anyone. Everyone keeps mentioning how distasteful it is to hunt down a woman so she can be hung."
"__MOVIES__ Is Russel's character sympathetic to Leigh- remember how soft he was initially in Tombstone?"
