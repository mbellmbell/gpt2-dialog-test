"__MOVIES__ My husband is a movie buff for sure."
"__MOVIES__ What type of movie's does he like?"
"__MOVIES__ He likes sci-fi and horror movies.  Also lots of action too."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, I like that type of genre too."
"__MOVIES__ I hate sci-fi and horror movies.  He likes them a lot and I just can't get into them."
"__MOVIES__ Wonder why you don't like them?  So many people love to watch those types of movies."
"__MOVIES__ I find it hard to put myself into anything that doesn't seem real or that you have to imagine."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for example sci-fi isn't reality to me.  It's stuff that could happen, but probably wont'."
"__MOVIES__ But, that's why I like it so much.  You sort of get taken away by the fantasty of it all."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess but I just can't sit still watching that type of movie.  I just have to get up and do something else."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what kind of movie's do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I like some love story types.  And also some mystery types that keep you on the edge of your seat."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?  Name some and see if I am familar with them."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Bridges of Madison County for a love story.  I found myself really engrossed in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I've never seen that.  Did that have Clint Eastwood in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it did."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what other movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Cape Fear, I think there are two versions.  This one had Robert Diniro"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah I saw that and it was scary, but I really enjoyed watching it."
