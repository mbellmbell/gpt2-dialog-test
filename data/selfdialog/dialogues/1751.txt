"__MUSIC__ You're a fan of Elton John, aren't you?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say i'm one of the biggest Elton John fans around.  i think he's great."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  i've been a fan of his for almost fifty years, since 'Your Song' hit the charts."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, and that remains one of my favorite of his songs.  It's a beautiful song with great lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ One of the great things about Elton is that he has done so many great ballads, but so many up-tempo songs as well."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely.  For example, he did 'Satuday Night's all right for Fighting,' and also 'Candle in the Wind,' and both are on the same album."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, his classic 'goodbye yellow brick road' album had those songs and so many other great tunes."
"__MUSIC__ I think of all his albums, that one sold the most.  Almost all my friends at that time bought that album as soon as it came out."
"__MUSIC__ I actually remember the day i bought that album.  I got it at the college bookstore, all those years ago when i was a student."
"__MUSIC__ It's interesting that you remember something like that.  That shows what a great fan you are.  What are some of your other favorite albums that he did?"
"__MUSIC__ I always liked 'Don't Shoot me, i'm the piano player,' and i really liked 'the fox,' which was recorded a bit later, i think in 1980."
"__MUSIC__ 'the Fox?'  I'm not familiar with that one."
"__MUSIC__ Well it's not one of his most famous albums; it has quite a mellow sound to most of it's songs.  I especially like 'Chloe' which was not a big hit but which remains one of my favorite Elton John songs."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't Elton go through a bit of a 'slump' at one point when his popularity took a bit of a dive?"
"__MUSIC__ You're probably referring to the mid to late 1980s.  but when he worked on the 'Lion King' soundtrack, that slump was a thing of the past.  His contribution to that soundtrack brought him hundreds of thousands of new fans who saw how versatile he was.,"
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember his song 'Friends?'  That wasn't a big hit but i consider it one of his best."
"__MUSIC__ Actually I do remember it.  there is actually a 'Friends' soundtrack which i remember giving to my wife as a gift many years ago."
"__MUSIC__ I never knew it was a soundtrack.  But i do own the single; on vinyl of course.  It was his follow up to 'Your Song.'"
"__MUSIC__ One thing people may forget is that he had a serious drug problem early in his career; but thank goodness he came through it."
"__MUSIC__ Now that you mention it, i remember him talking about the drug problem during an interview.  you're right, it's very fortunate that he came through it.  nice talking to you about this living legend."
