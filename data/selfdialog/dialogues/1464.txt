"__MUSIC__ Do you like 80s music?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of it.  Do you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's by far my favorite genre. Have you heard of the Psychedelic Furs?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so, but what do they sing? Maybe I'd recognize a song."
"__MUSIC__ One of their most widely known hits is 'Love My Way.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love that song! Didn't know it was by them."
"__MUSIC__ My personal favorite song by them is 'Heartbreak Beat.' You should check it out."
"__MUSIC__ I'll do that. Meanwhile, you like country music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a big fan of it, that's all. Check out Brantley Gilbert if you get a chance."
"__MUSIC__ I'll do that right now."
"__MUSIC__ Heartbreak Beat's a great song, by the way."
"__MUSIC__ Glad you liked it! What's a good song by Brantley Gilbert for me to start off with?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Bottoms Up. It's a great song."
"__MUSIC__ Not bad, but not really my cup of tea. Sorry..."
"__MUSIC__ No worries. But please tell me you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
"__MUSIC__ Of course! Who wouldn't?"
"__MUSIC__ I know, right? Love their new album, The Getaway."
"__MUSIC__ That's a great one. Dark Necessities was the only song I listened to for days once I heard it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. One of my favorites from them in a while."
