"__ROCK__ Do you like rock music?"
"__ROCK__ Not really."
"__ROCK__ Why is that?"
"__ROCK__ I've always thought it was too aggressive for me."
"__ROCK__ Not all rock music is aggressive, though."
"__ROCK__ Like I said, that's just me. I've at least always had a soft spot for the instrumentals, though."
"__ROCK__ That's something. Is there any particular instrument that you like?"
"__ROCK__ Probably the bass."
"__ROCK__ That's unusual."
"__ROCK__ Bass is so undervalued in music, and it's one of my favorite things about music in general."
