"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's only two months away from the start of the season. I can't wait."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither can I. The season always comes up so quick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which rookies are you looking forward to seeing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited to see the new batch of tuning backs most of al."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I can't wait to see how Fornette and McCaffery do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget about Dixon, he should get a lot of playing time too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he fell into a good spot with the Bengals. They should be better this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's a lot of teams that could be a lot better. The Raiders are looking like an up and coming team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I agreee, if Carr stays healthy they should be a Super Bowl threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be nice seeing someone other than the Patriots there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it seems like they are good every year, but Brady can't be this good forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's probably got a year or two before he starts declining."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When was the last time they didn't win their division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't remember it's been so long. The Jets and Bills are a long ways away but the Dolphins are getting better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the Jets are looking like they could be the worst team in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be surprised if they won four games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need a QB, they had a long stretch without one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they lost their best two receivers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe they let Eric Decker go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least he should have someone better throwing to him now."
