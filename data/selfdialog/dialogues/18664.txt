"__MOVIES__ So, my boyfriend and I are in the middle of a huge movie debate."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah? What about?"
"__MOVIES__ We are arguing over which Star Wars movie is the worst one."
"__MOVIES__ And what does each side say?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I said that it was Attack of the Clones."
"__MOVIES__ And what reasons did you have for this point of view."
"__MOVIES__ The acting is so wooden and unfeeling. The murder of the yound Jedis seems to be too dark for the series. And, of course, Jar Jar Binks is in it."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a pretty solid argument to me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought so, too."
"__MOVIES__ OK. What did your boyfriend say?"
"__MOVIES__ He said the little known Star Wars holiday special is the worst Star Wars movie."
"__MOVIES__ And what was his reasoning?"
"__MOVIES__ The fact that it is based almost entirely around Wookies, so you can't understand the dialogue. Also, the fact that most of the star characters don't even appear in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who is actually in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Chewbacca, Han Solo, and Princess Leia. That's it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, sounds boring."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. I hate to admit it, but he also has another really valid point."
"__MOVIES__ What could possibly top a movie franchise realeasing a movie without the majority of its stars?"
"__MOVIES__ George Lucas has basically denied the exsitence of this holiday special, refuses to release it on video, and threatened to destory all copies of it."
"__MOVIES__ OK. When the creator of the franchise denies that one of his movies exists, that must mean it really sucks. Your boyfriend wins this debate. Sorry!"
