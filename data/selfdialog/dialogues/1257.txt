"__MUSIC__ What kind of music have you been into lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to a lot of 80's music."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been rediscovering Judas Priest for a while, some of the earlier stuff."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Iron Maiden?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I'm not very familiar with them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, well they are both classic metal bands from the 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, so Judas Priest is really heavy sounding?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually a lot of earlier stuff isn't really heavy."
"__MUSIC__ What makes it metal then?"
"__MUSIC__ The vocals I would say, and the distorted guitars."
"__MUSIC__ What do the vocals in classic metal sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, most classic metal bands have singers that don't do a lot of noise making or screaming, but more operatic type stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting, I guess I'll have to give them a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you should. I'd definitely give the Defenders of the Faith album a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Are they talking about actual faith?"
"__MUSIC__ More like faith in heavy metal music."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that goes along with their priest title."
"__MUSIC__ You're right, I never thought of that."
