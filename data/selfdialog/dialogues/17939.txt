"__MOVIES__ Really, what was the movie theater?"
"__MOVIES__ Regal Cinemas is showing it ."
"__MOVIES__ Great, I want to go see it with you."
"__MOVIES__ That would be fun!"

"__MOVIES__ Speaking of Sci Fi, Alien Covenant is coming out too."
"__MOVIES__ How is that one?"
"__MOVIES__ it is after Prometheus in the Alien series."
