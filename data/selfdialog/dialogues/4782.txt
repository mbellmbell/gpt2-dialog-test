"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard Hawkwind?"
"__MUSIC__ A little bit... they made space-rock music, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, psychedelic hard rock that sort of overlapped with heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. Wasn't Lemmy from Motorhead in that band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but they fired him sometime in the mid-'70s for excessive drug use."
"__MUSIC__ That's too bad. How would you describe their sound?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's very cosmic, I would say."
"__MUSIC__ So do you think they might have influenced later bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think Sonic Youth took some influence from Hawkwind, for certain."
"__MUSIC__ You mean their songs are long and noisy, with clanging guitar sections?"
"__MUSIC__ Not exactly, but sometimes they get very spacious, and kind of warm and ambient."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds relaxing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a band I definitely think Hawkwind influenced are Radiohead."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That sounds pretty intriguing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the way an album like OK Computer kind of bathes you in electronic sounds during the rock songs is very Hawkwind to me."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't what they would kind of call 'space rock'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, definitely, and some of their songs are more aggressive, and others more mellow."
"__MUSIC__ They sound like a band you could put on whatever your mood."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite Hawkwind album is called 'Warrior on the Edge of Time,' and it's very sci-fi influenced, lyrically."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I'll have to go check it out!"
