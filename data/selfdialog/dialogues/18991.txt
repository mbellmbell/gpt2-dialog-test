"__MOVIES__ Watched any good movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I just saw the Belko Experiment last week, have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I watched it when it first came out. What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good, the story was something new, good acting too."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it too, I like most thriller/mystery movies though. Some pretty good acting in it also."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, especially John C. McGinley!"
"__MOVIES__ I love his acting! Kind of weird seeing him in this role though. I'm used to seeing him in more funny roles."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably from the tv show Scrubs?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. I've only seen him in a couple of other things like Wall Street and Set It Off."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I remember those, they were really good."
"__MOVIES__ I did think in the Belko Experiment that the tags in their heads were kind of stupid."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, that wasn't very realistic. Who would actually sign up for something like that?"
"__MOVIES__ No job pays that much!"
"__MOVIES__ But I guess they had to figure out some way to threaten them without actually being in the building right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that makes sense. The story overall wasn't that great, but I just like these types of thrillers."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. Just a move you can chill and watch, doesn't require a lot of thinking."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, plus it had some comedy."
"__MOVIES__ It did, John C. McGinley is always funny, even though he was kind of creepy in this one."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, yeah. The security guard was kind of funny too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the boss was insane!"
