"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Beyonce had her twins?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, everybody is having twins these days."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you know, babies are a very popular accessory this season."
"__MUSIC__ That seems a little harsh."
"__MUSIC__ Anyways, back to Beyonce.  Do you like her music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm kind of crazy in that I like her Destiny's child stuff."
"__MUSIC__ You are a minority."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I like mindless pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't want to have to censor my music when I'm around the kids.  I don't want them to hear cursing and hypersexualized things."
"__MUSIC__ I think they get a lot it already in music that they already hear."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know anything else about Beyonce's twins?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think everything is hush hush right now."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think they will name them?"
"__MUSIC__ Who knows.  Anything goes these days."
"__MUSIC__ Well the Clooneys had twins and they chose very traditional names."
"__MUSIC__ Well Amal is British."
"__MUSIC__ Beyonce lost her bid to trademark Blue Ivy's name."
"__MUSIC__ Is that weird that she's trying to trademark it?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess she's just trying to protect her."
