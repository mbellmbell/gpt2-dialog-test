"__MUSIC__ Hey Jodie!"
"__MUSIC__ Hi Grover!"
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the B52's?"
"__MUSIC__ The B52's? You mean the airplanes?"
"__MUSIC__ No, silly! The rock band..."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, them...I don't remember them."
"__MUSIC__ They are a new wave band, most popular in the 70's and 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Grover, I was born in the 90's! How am I supposed to remember them?"
"__MUSIC__ You remember Elvis don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, of course I do! But he was THE KING!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll grant yo that, but the B52's were famous too."
"__MUSIC__ Just because somebody is famous doesn't mean EVERYBODY knows who they are."
"__MUSIC__ That's what famous means!"
"__MUSIC__ OK. If that's true, then tell me who invented the thumb tack."
"__MUSIC__ What? What does a thumb tack have to do with Elvis?"
"__MUSIC__ They are both famous."
"__MUSIC__ You make no sense.  Let's get back to talking about the B52's."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. Name any of their hits."
"__MUSIC__ 'Love Shack' was very popular."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I don't know that song, but there is one thing I do know. If you need a sharp object to stick through paper, then thumb tacks are the popular choice."
