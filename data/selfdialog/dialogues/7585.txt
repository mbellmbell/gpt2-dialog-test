"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga has such a beautiful voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. She sounded amazing when she sang the National Anthem at the Super Bowl."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah she sounded great, but her outfit was crazy."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You have to admit it was a little more toned down than some of her other looks."
"__LADY_GAGA__ True. Her style when she released The Fame is so different from her style now."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Even her music is different now. Her newest album Joanne is much more alternative sounding."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love that album. My favorite song from it is Million Reasons."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like that song too, but my all time favorite song by her is probably Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, that was one of her biggest hits."
