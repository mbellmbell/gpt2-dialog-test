"__THRILLER__ Did you watch the Julia Robert's movie, 'Secret in Their Eyes?'"
"__THRILLER__ I actually just watched that the other week. Wow, I was totally blown away."
"__THRILLER__ I know I wouldn't pick her for a thriller style movie, but man did she deliver."
"__THRILLER__ I know, I'm so used to her playing such wholesome roles, like 'Eat,Pray, Love' and 'Stepmom' that this was a real surprise."
"__THRILLER__ I really didn't think she had it in her, but she aced it."
"__THRILLER__ I agree, it was like 'Silence of the Lambs' meets 'Misery.'"
"__THRILLER__ Oh wow, that is the perfect description!"
"__THRILLER__ She doesn't have that Kathy Bates crazy in her eyes, but there was something there."
"__THRILLER__ I hope she does more movies like this, it was great to see her out of her comfort zone."
"__THRILLER__ I agree. Who knew Julia Roberts could be so scary?"
