"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have a favorite character in the Star Wars movie series?"

"__STAR_WARS__ There was chemistry between Han Solo and Princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think so? They were so far apart in age."
"__STAR_WARS__ I always loved the deep voice of Darth Vader in the first movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I believe that voice is spoken by James Earl Jones. Do you know him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ James Earl Jones is a great actor. The later Darth Vader actors were not as convincing."
"__STAR_WARS__ The outfit too was pretty wild for the times. Very scary and dark. What did you think of Yoda?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought the special effects could have been better with Yoda. Do you believe in The Force?"
