"__DISNEY__ Do you prefer The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ I like Beauty and the Beast best, I think. I love the songs in it, and I wish I could have a library like the one Beast gives Belle."
"__DISNEY__ That library is amazing. The ballroom scene is really good, too."
"__DISNEY__ Do you like Beauty and the Beast better, too, then?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I like it a lot, but I actually prefer The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ That's surprising! How come?"
"__DISNEY__ I think that everything in it is so pretty!"
"__DISNEY__ That's true. I like the 'Under the Sea' scene a lot."
"__DISNEY__ I even like the song that Ursula sings, 'Poor Unfortunate Souls'"
"__DISNEY__ I like it too, but her and her eels always scared me!"
