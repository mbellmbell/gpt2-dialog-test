"__MUSIC__ So I've been trying to decide which Howard is better: the first name, or the last name."
"__MUSIC__ What are you talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ So there's Howard Shore, and there's James Newton Howard. Who's better?"
"__MUSIC__ Aren't they soundtrack composers?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're both quite famous, and I like them both a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Shore did Lord of the Rings, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep! All three of the first, and the Hobbit films as well."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, then I don't see how anyone else could be a winner. He's a genius."
"__MUSIC__ He did make probably the most iconic soundtrack of all time."
"__MUSIC__ I could listen to the shire theme all day."
"__MUSIC__ At the same time, though, that's pretty much the only thing he's famous for."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that's true; I can't name anything else he's done."
"__MUSIC__ Howard last name, in the meantime, has done everything from The Dark Knight to Space Jam."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, what?"
"__MUSIC__ Weird, right? He also did the Hunger Games music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love those themes. Mockingjay has such a great combination of all the leitmofs."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, and his work with Zimmer in The Dark Knight is just phenomenal."
"__MUSIC__ I see the conundrum."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I'd go with Howard Shore in the end, because I love Lord of the Rings so much."
"__MUSIC__ Nah, man, I'm going with James. Variety all the way."
