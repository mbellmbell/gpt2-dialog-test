"__BASKETBALL__ Hey, how did you like that Carolina game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh my! It was so intense!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, I can't stand Duke and it was so nice to see them lose."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah it was. I could not believe Butler did that to Hansbrough"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that was so cheap!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I hope he gets suspended from a few games for that one"
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too! Hansbrough is going to have to play through the whole tournament with that guard over his face now"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah hopefully it wont interfere with his playing ability"
"__BASKETBALL__ I doubt it will since he is so good anyway. He can still power through from inside the paint."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that's true. Do you think they're going to win the tournament?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I always have UNC down to win the NCAA!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too, but we will see this year. It always scares me!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but the team is so strong, no one can stop them."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true, Lawson is such a good point guard"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he is.I will be so sad when they all go to the NBA"
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too but hopefully a few will stay around to finish up college first."
"__BASKETBALL__ yeah that is the smart thing to do but when the money calls, you gotta take it while you can."
"__BASKETBALL__ This is true!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, Fingers crossed that we win the tournament over the next few weeks!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly! I have my toes crossed too."
