"__MOVIES__ John Wayne was my dad's favorite actor. I grew up watching a whole lot of John Wayne movies."
"__MOVIES__ He was a classic movie star, I think."
"__MOVIES__ Some people disparaged him, saying he couldn't act, but I don't agree at all."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think were some of his best roles?"
"__MOVIES__ His showiest role was as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, the film for which he won the Oscar, finally."
"__MOVIES__ He had been nominated before, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I think the win for True Grit was a win for his entire filmography at that point, but it was still well deserved."
"__MOVIES__ He had just beaten cancer at that point. I think Hollywood understood that he was a treasure of the industry."
"__MOVIES__ I think one of his best acted roles was in The Quiet Man."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, since it wasn't one of his many Westerns."
"__MOVIES__ This one was about an ex-boxer escaping his tragic past by going to his roots in Ireland, and falling in love with a bold Irish lass."
"__MOVIES__ Who was played by the quintessential Irish lass, Maureen O'Hara."
"__MOVIES__ They made a great team in that film, because they were both such strong characters and personalities."
"__MOVIES__ And that film had one of the best fights ever - going through the entire town before they ended it by shaking hands. Iconic!"
"__MOVIES__ I have a lot of favorite John Wayne Westerns, but I think Rio Bravo would be in the top 2 or 3."
"__MOVIES__ That one had such a great cast - Angie Dickenson, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, and even Ricky Nelson."
"__MOVIES__ I could watch that one over and over. Great writing and dialogue, lots of suspense, great music."
"__MOVIES__ There's another non-Western that he was great in - Hatari, set in Africa."
"__MOVIES__ That's a great one too. Red  Buttons as the sidekick."
"__MOVIES__ And don't forget 'The Baby Elephant Walk,' which became a classic song. Great John Wayne movie."
