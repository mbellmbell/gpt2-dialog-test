"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey bro! Ready for the season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I am!  The Eagles are looking good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they are, we made some good pick ups this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes sir, I'm excited to see how Alshon Jeffrey does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too man, between him, Jordan Matthews, and Green-Beckham, I think we're looking solid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't argue with that, our Running backs are looking pretty good too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're not lying, Darren Sproles is a little beast for his age."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, I guess you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what was most surprising to me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That we picked up Foles again."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Get with the program man, he's probably going to move in front of Daniels."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not saying much, I don't think we'll need anyone besides Wentz."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's definitely the best QB we've had in years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, every since good old Donovan Mcnabb."
