"__STAR_WARS__ I could talk about Star Wars all day."
"__STAR_WARS__ Bring it on - I'm ready!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Actually, I don't know that much about Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ What?  Have you at least seen the older trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but it was a long time ago.  Sometimes I forget everything."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, you should clear your weekend schedule and see them all."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about the new one, Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's more of an offshoot rather than following the original story."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's time for some spin-offs."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll stick with Darth, Luke and Han Solo."
