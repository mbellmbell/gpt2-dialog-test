"__DISNEY__ Did you ever notice that nobody worries about Jasmine when she goes missing in Aladdin?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ She snuck out of the house to go into the village and nobody noticed."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't the guards find her?  Isn't that why they went into the city?"
"__DISNEY__ No, Jafar sent the guards to find Aladdin.  They found Jasmine by accident!"
"__DISNEY__ I never thought of that!  Maybe they thought she was still in the castle?"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe, but that castle was pretty poorly guarded.  She didn't see any guards on her way out and climbed that wall easily!"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe they trusted the people??"
"__DISNEY__ I guess, but it seems a little strange that she was the princess and fairly unguarded."
"__DISNEY__ A little odd, but it sure made for a great movie!"
