"__MUSIC__ Did you ever listen to Lil Kim?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, back in the day yes I definitely did!  She was one of my favorite female hip hop artists."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, mine too.  I don't think there was anyone who even compared."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was never a fan of Missy Elliot or any of her contemporaries."
"__MUSIC__ I heard she got her start from Notorious B.I.G.  They did a lot of stuff together, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I had heard that.  She's from Brooklyn, I believe."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, definitely.  She talks about that in a lot of her music."
"__MUSIC__ Hard Core came out in 1996.  That was a great album."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it had so many hits on it.  No Time, Not Tonight, and Crush on You were my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.  Those really stuck in your mind."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she win some Grammys?"
"__MUSIC__ She's won all kinds of awards!  She's not called the Queen of Hip-Hop for no reason!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, yeah that's true I hadn't even thought of that.  That is her nickname, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I think she said in some interview that Diana Ross inspired her."
"__MUSIC__ That's hard to imagine, but yeah I guess she grew up in that time era."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Diana Ross would probably be scandalized by Lil Kim."
"__MUSIC__ You never know.  She was definitely very fashionable as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a lot of people tried to imitate her style."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she go to prison or something?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she did a few times.  I'm not sure."
