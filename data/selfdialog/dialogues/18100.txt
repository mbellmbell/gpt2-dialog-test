"__MOVIES__ So what's the best movie you've seen recently?"
"__MOVIES__ That would have to be 'Up'!"
"__MOVIES__ Up?  I've never heard of that."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it's great!  It's an animated film and it wasn't hyped up too much, but it was really a gem."
"__MOVIES__ So what is so great about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's about this really grouchy old man who loses his wife and he decides to fly his house across the world using a whole bunch of balloons."
"__MOVIES__ What on earth?  That sounds totally weird!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it is weird, but it's weird in a good way!  He meets this boy along the way who winds up helping him and warming his heart."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so it's one of those heart-warming movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it totally is!  The old grouchy man gradually softens through the movie and learns about himself."
"__MOVIES__ Well that sounds good.  I prefer a good action movie, personally, but it's nice to watch movies like that sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Well I hear that.  I do enjoy heart-warming movies, though."
"__MOVIES__ So have you seen any good action movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just recently watched the Jason Bourne movies, does that count?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course that counts!  Those were great movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I got a little confused with the second and third ones, but I loved the first one."
"__MOVIES__ What confused you about them?"
"__MOVIES__ I felt like there were too many characters to keep up with and the plot was too hard to follow."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I could see that.  The first one was great though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the first one was amazing.  I'd watch it again for sure."
