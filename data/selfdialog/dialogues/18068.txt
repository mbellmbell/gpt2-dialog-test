"__MOVIES__ I just re-watched Django Unchained what do you think about that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard so much about it, but I've never had a chance to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Are you serious, it is one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ What stands out to you about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Lots of things, I can't give it away, but it's a truly original movie with action and great writing."
"__MOVIES__ I need to watch it then, who directed it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Quentin Tarantino, he's sincerely a great director."
"__MOVIES__ Oh then I definitely need to watch Django, I love all of Tarantino's movies. I know Jaime Foxx is starring, but who else?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes Jaime Foxx is in it. Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio also have big roles."
"__MOVIES__ Leonardo DiCaprio is always in such important movies, Inception was an incredible work."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Inception! I still feel like that I haven't figured out what exactly happens even though I've watched it so many times."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it is one of those movies you have to watch a couple times to really grasp what the meaning is."
"__MOVIES__ I think I prefer movies that aren't too thought provoking, but still engaging if you understand."
"__MOVIES__ Hm really? No I really like movies that make me think about what's being portrayed."
"__MOVIES__ I guess sometimes, I really just hate space movies though."
"__MOVIES__ What! I love space and movies about it. Why do you hate it?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I think I saw a space movie when I was young and it scared me, so now I avoid it."
"__MOVIES__ I think you would enjoy them now, have you seen Interstellar?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't, but I have heard some great things about it."
"__MOVIES__ We will watch it together, I promise it won't be scary."
