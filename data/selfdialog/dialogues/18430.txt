"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was awesome.  Gal Gadot was the best."
"__MOVIES__ She was, easy on the eyes too.  But all jokes aside that was the best DC movie yet."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I loved the World War One theme."
"__MOVIES__ Chris Pine was really good too.  I wish they didn't kill his character off."
"__MOVIES__ It was also interesting that Bruce Wayne sent her the photo before the movie started."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, foreshadowing for Justice league no doubt."
"__MOVIES__ I know I can't wait.  So what did you think of Ares?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought they did a great job.  I like the idea of having really good acting in super hero movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was good.  The fight scene at the end was epic."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but the best part was when she went through no man's land."
"__MOVIES__ It was, that was one of the most exciting scenes I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ It showed the destructiveness of the first World War."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think World War One movies are underrated.  They should have more."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean.  So what did you think of her armor?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was awesome.  An improvement over the stars and stripes of Linda Carter."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, these movies have made things a little more real looking lately."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's better that way.  What works in a comic doesn't always work in live action."
"__MOVIES__ And vice versa."
"__MOVIES__ I just hope they make a sequel to Wonder Woman."
