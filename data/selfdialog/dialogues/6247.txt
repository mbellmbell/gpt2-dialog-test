"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the new Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, I have not seen it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haven't seen it? It is like the most watched movie in forever. Why haven't you seen it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am not really interested in new movies. They always try to explain things that should be left to the imagination."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't understand, can you explain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I think that the Phantom Menace was a waste of a movie since they used the whole build up of the movie over explained Darth Vader so it took away all imaginations for him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked the Phantom Menace, I thought it was a good story line."
"__STAR_WARS__ Story line yes but it changed the whole dynamic of the movies for me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Change the dynamic how?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It began to explain Darth Vader and at the end I actually felt a little pity for him. Prior to that Darth Vader was a true villain. One should not have any sympathy for a villain."
