"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is nobody talking up the Ravens right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean exactly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just seems like nobody is giving them much of a shot this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Ravens are just an okay team, that's why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they've got some good players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aging players maybe.  Some of their better guys are past their prime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Joe Flacco is still a top five QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's a lot wrong with that statement.  He's not even top ten."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he won a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, five years ago.  League has changed since then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just saying that you're sleeping on his potential."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, they overpaid him and he's never produced that well again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they'll be better than you think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not with that aging defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you talking about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Weddle, Suggs, old, old, old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're crafty veterans.  Those guys make the team better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't have the defense they used to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, not unless you're bringing back Ray Lewis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't have a time machine to do that."
