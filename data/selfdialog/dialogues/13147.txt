"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The football season is coming up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right; it's been a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe that Super Bowl? It was the best ever!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right; I almost missed it. And that Lady Gaga jumped off the bleeping roof at halftime; that had to be the best halftime show too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was choice when Roger Goodell got booed handing out the trophy."
