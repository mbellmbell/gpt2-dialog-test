"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best wide receiver in the NFL right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Antonio Brown is the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you sure? He is good but is he the best?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Statistically yes, he gets open all the time"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you think Roethlisberger has a lot to do with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course but it is part of the game, a great QB usually makes great WR"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how good he would be if he was on the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Considering they have no QB, I would say awful"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are making my case for me by saying that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A WR cant throw to themselves so a QB is a necessity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Randy Moss? He got open on many teams regardless of who the QB was"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you forget about his time with the Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had one great year with over 1000 yds and 8 TDs with the Raiders"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But his second year was awful. Especially considering how much they gave up to get him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you think Moss is worse than Brown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a chance, Moss was better but Brown is great in his own way"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it is hard to compare them both since the size comparison is different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus Moss played until he was 35 years old"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, Brown could come close is statistics when it is all said and done"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unlikely, Moss was too good early in his career."
