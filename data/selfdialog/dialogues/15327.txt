"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know, I don't get the whole Ron and Hermione thing."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You don't like them as a couple?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just don't think they're compatible."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why not?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Because Hermione is an incredibly smart, academic type. Learning is her passion."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but opposites attract, don't they?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sometimes that's true, but I just don't see it in this case. Ron really isn't supportive of her interests unless they benefit him in some way."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, I can see that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just would've rather seen her end up with someone else, you know? Someone a little more mature."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Now that you mention it, I did like Viktor Krum."
