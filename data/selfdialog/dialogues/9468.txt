"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Dodgers game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ No. I was watching a different game."
"__BASEBALL__ It's too bad that you missed it."
"__BASEBALL__ Why's that?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was a 9-0 shut-out."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow. The Dodgers are doing great this year."
"__BASEBALL__ They sure are. What game were you watching?"
"__BASEBALL__ I was watching the Red Sox and Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ They are such an intense rivalry."
"__BASEBALL__ They are. That's why I usually try to catch their games."
"__BASEBALL__ So, who won?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankess beat the Sox 2-1 in extra innings."
"__BASEBALL__ How late did the game go?"
"__BASEBALL__ I watched until about 11:30 until I finally had to go to bed."
"__BASEBALL__ How many innings was it."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, I think it went to like the 15th inning or something like that."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow. When games drag on like that sometimes it just becomes too much baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. The whole thing was a real ptichers battle."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not surprised. Both teams have really good pitching staffs."
"__BASEBALL__ I think so too. Their sluggers usually don't do much when they play against each other."
