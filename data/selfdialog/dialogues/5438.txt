"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it is . They are so cute. I love all the scenes with them featured."
"__STAR_WARS__ They are cute. I feel no other star wars movie has that aspect in them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I think they tried to do another cute funny character with Jar Jar Binks but that flopped."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya what a failure on that character. He was so annoying. What were they thinking?"
"__STAR_WARS__ George Lucas probably wanted some kind of comic relief just not well realized."
