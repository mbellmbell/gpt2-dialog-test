"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The New Orleans Saints aren't a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think I'm a Saints fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I was just wondering what your response would be to that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are a solid team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could you expand on your argument?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Brees is all I need to say."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a pretty good Quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you say he is only pretty good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah do you have a problem with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is almost 40 touchdowns and over 5,000 yards pretty good to you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well you conveniently left out that he had 15 interceptions this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That doesn't matter when you throw 40 touchdowns in a season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think about it he almost threw three touchdowns a game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not bad at all to be honest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Says the guy who said the Saints are a bad team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I told you I was just curious about your reaction!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You aren't necessarily a Saints fan either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true I'm more of a Tampa Bay guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's not get into that conversation."
