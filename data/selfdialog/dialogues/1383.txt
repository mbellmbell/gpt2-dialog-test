"__MUSIC__ I've been wondering this for a while. What's the difference between contemporary and legit?"
"__MUSIC__ In musicals you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Every time I hear someone say legit I think 'too legit to quit' but that can't be right."
"__MUSIC__ No, it's definitely not. It's partially about age and partially about style."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, a lot of musicals including the ones most people think of when they think about Broadway were written in the 30s, 40s, and 50s."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I can follow that."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard popular music from the 40s?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure that I have."
"__MUSIC__ Listen to a little bit of it. Listen to Greta Garbo, or Judy Garland."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard Judy Garland sing, the Wizard of Oz right?"
"__MUSIC__ That's her. When you listen to people from her time sing they sound sort of classical."
"__MUSIC__ Classical? What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Their voices have vibrato and they're rich and mellow sounding. They sing smooth, like in Somewhere Over the Rainbow."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, so what does that have to do with musicals?"
"__MUSIC__ Musicals from those times were written with that popular style of singing in mind. If you've ever seen The Sound of Music on tv you've heard that same kind of style."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, so that's old music style. Is that legit?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Legit singing is singing in that older, smoother, more classical style. The thing is musicals are written that way but sometimes they also use the current style of singing."
"__MUSIC__ And that would be contemporary?"
"__MUSIC__ Right! Listen to The Sound of Music and then listen to Legally Blonde.  You'll hear the difference right away."
