"__MUSIC__ I heard Taylor Swift is real mean in real life."
"__MUSIC__ Wouldn't surprise me."
"__MUSIC__ There was a rumor going around that her next song will be about her breakup with Tom Hiddleston."
"__MUSIC__ She's broken up with everyone else alive."
"__MUSIC__ Not me, at least not yet.  I look forward to it."
"__MUSIC__ Why does she feel the need to publish that stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean stay in the spotlight."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, what's wrong with being normal."
"__MUSIC__ Nothing is normal when you're Taylor Swift though."
"__MUSIC__ She brings it upon herself."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ She's always in front of the cameras."
"__MUSIC__ I get that, but what else?"
"__MUSIC__ She has this incessant need to be relevant and start fights."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she start a fight with some other singer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't even remember who it was."
"__MUSIC__ But I think that one song she wrote was about a beef."
"__MUSIC__ Man, what was the name of that song?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was Bad Blood."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's it!"
