"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie with comedians from Saturday Night Live."
"__MOVIES__ Hm, I think that would have to be Billy Madison."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That was such a silly movie."
"__MOVIES__ What do you expect? It's Adam Sandler, Chris Farley and Norm McDonald."
"__MOVIES__ True. I was a huge Wayne's World fan."
"__MOVIES__ Schwing! Both the Wayne's World movies were good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Mike Myers was really good in the Austin Powers movies too. He's actually pretty talented."
"__MOVIES__ What else has he been in?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing recently. He was in So I Married an Ax Murderer back in the day, and then I think in the Love Guru."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I havent seen him around. Kristin Wiig seems to be everywhere these days."
"__MOVIES__ Bridesmaids was so good! Melissa McCarthy killed it in those."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she totally stole the show. But Kristin Wiig's been in other movies, like the Martian, which was kind of weird."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, she was? I didnt see that one."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good, Matt Damon turned out to be quite a good Martian gardener."
"__MOVIES__ Whenever I think of Matt Damon, I think of Team America."
"__MOVIES__ Haha! Too bad those guys don't make a sequel to Team America, it would be totally appropriate now."
"__MOVIES__ I think Matt Damon's best movie was Good Will Hunting back in the 90s."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it was kind of boring."
"__MOVIES__ It was understated! RIP Robin Williams."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I was just thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire yesterday and thought of him. He was a brilliant comedian and actor."
