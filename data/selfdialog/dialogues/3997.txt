"__MUSIC__ What do you think is the most romantic song?"
"__MUSIC__ Unchained melody."
"__MUSIC__ Is that the song that is in ghost?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. It is by The Righteous Brothers."
"__MUSIC__ That is such a romantic song and scene. Good call."
"__MUSIC__ I think it was voted the most romantic song of all time. At one point anyway."
"__MUSIC__ I just always think of ghost and patrick swayze , demi moore and that pottery wheel."
"__MUSIC__ Yes very iconic. Speaking of swayze. Did you know he wrote the song in Dirty Dancing?"
"__MUSIC__ What song? There are many in the film."
"__MUSIC__ She's like the wind."
"__MUSIC__ I thought he only sang that , he really wrote that too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, apparently he thought the lyrics were cheesy. But I loved it."
"__MUSIC__ I always cry when that song comes in on the film."
"__MUSIC__ Ya it may be the plot but it also is such a moving song."
"__MUSIC__ He should be proud to have written and performed it so well."
"__MUSIC__ I guess he also felt the dancing was a little cheesy too."
"__MUSIC__ Well he was a trained ballet dancer. It is much more difficult than ballroom."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough, but if he can dance, sing and songwrite like that no need to  be ashamed in any sense."
"__MUSIC__ All musicians and actors seem to have some deep insecurity and peculiarities."
"__MUSIC__ Ya who knows what demands of being the public eye in that capacity does to you."
