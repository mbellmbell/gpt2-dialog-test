"__MOVIES__ What do you think about the new Emoji movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It looks pretty inane to me. About the entire intention of that movie is to sell stuff."
"__MOVIES__ About the entire intention of that movie is to sell stuff.yeah, it does seem a little kitschy for my taste. Are there any summer movies out that you're looking forward to?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't paid attention to what's coming out; do you have any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ So many of the summer's movies are just old movies rehashed or sequels. I don't think anything original is out there."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe the remake of Planet of the Apes. All the others are paid for by Hasbro."
"__MOVIES__ Planet of the apes looks interesting, I'll give you that. But I think the idea is just too old. I think something with robots would be more interesting than eight."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. With the political scene the way it is mad Max beyond thunder dome have some hope."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite ever summer of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Just can't beat the summer Jaws came out. I was about 10 years old and lovedto be afraid in the theater but not in the ocean.  That movie had all of us terrified."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite had to be the summer of 1978 when Greese came out. I think I saw it about 10 times in the theater. I just couldn't get enough"
"__MOVIES__ Well that was a good one."
"__MOVIES__ And both of those films were so original. I just can't get into all these fifth and sixth editions. Mission Impossible, Teansformers, Spider-Man."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. The first ones were terrific. You just can't achieve the same level of excitement."
"__MOVIES__ The best time for film is October to February."
"__MOVIES__ A great preview for the oscars,"
"__MOVIES__ The targeted age group must be sixteen in the summer."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds about right."
"__MOVIES__ I just realized we were sixteen when our favorite summer of movies won us over. I guess there's something to it."
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha. Oh yeah! Summer movies must be for the young at heart!"
