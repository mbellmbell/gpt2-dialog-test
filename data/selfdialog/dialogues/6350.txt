"__STAR_WARS__ Lightsaber or blaster, what would you choose?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Lightsaber"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would go with a blaster"
"__STAR_WARS__ But a lightsaber could deflect a blaster"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but you need Jedi skills do use a lightsaber"
"__STAR_WARS__ But Finn used a lightsaber without being a Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't remember that"
"__STAR_WARS__ And Han Solo used one in the snow world to cut open that one animal thing"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, I remember that one"
"__STAR_WARS__ So I guess a lightsaber is better"
