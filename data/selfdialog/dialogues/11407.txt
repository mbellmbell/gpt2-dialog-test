"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Eli Manning is better then his brother?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is hard to make that decision."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, we need to see how the rest of his career plays out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he wins one more superbowl it is almost definitely Eli who is better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is crazy he already has two at this point in his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't leave out that both his Superbowl wins are against the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly Brady will always regret those games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could have seven rings at this point instead of five."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady is still a great player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but having seven rings he could be better then Michael Jordan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think you can really compare Football to Basketball?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you are right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I am right!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget you actually have to win more games to win an NBA Championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More games means more chances to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL playoffs are single elimination so it is much harder to win a Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That can be debated as winning 16 games is harder then winning 3-4 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We can continue this argument another time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good to me!"
