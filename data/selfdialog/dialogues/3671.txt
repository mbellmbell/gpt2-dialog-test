"__MUSIC__ Do you think that Linkin Park will do well on their tour?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think so. They have been around forever."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, they know how to put on a great show and keep the crowd engaged."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they still play their old music at their concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I absolutely think they do. Have you heard their new CD?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I didn't really care for it. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I did too, but I rather enjoyed it. They continue to evolve and I love that."
"__MUSIC__ That is true, but I'm just not in to it."
"__MUSIC__ I can respect that, but what CD do you think is their best?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure really. I think I like their first CD the most."
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean Hybrid Theory?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes! I love that CD"
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite song on it?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I would have to say In the End. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say Crawling because it really spoke to me."
"__MUSIC__ I hear you man! That song really rocks!"
"__MUSIC__ I think I would have to say my close second would be In the End as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was so different when it came out."
"__MUSIC__ It really helped me get through a lot of emotions I had when I was a teenager."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too. I was able to get through them instead of hide them."
