"__SUPERHERO__ Who is the better actress who plays Mystique?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Remind me who that is again?"
"__SUPERHERO__ The blue one who does martial arts and can transform."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, right. Jennifer Lawrence and Rebecca Romaine-Stamos?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yup, that's them. I like the latter."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why?"
"__SUPERHERO__ She's far more vicious and believable as a villain."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, J-Law is more of a nice character, completely changed."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, it is a different time-line."
"__SUPERHERO__ But as a fighter, Rebecca is far superior."
