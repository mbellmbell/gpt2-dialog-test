"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to find some music to listen to, can you help me?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, what kind do you like? Rock, Country, or what?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I'm in the mood for some rock."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, that narrows it down.  Do you want something new or old?"
"__MUSIC__ I want something new, but also something that seems familiar?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I'm kinda tired of them."
"__MUSIC__ What about Avenged Sevenfold?  Have you heard of them?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't.  Are they any good?"
"__MUSIC__ I enjoy listening to them.  They remind me some of Metallica, but with some other influences too."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting, have they been around long?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, several years, I'm suprised you havent heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Do they get played on the radio often?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I hear them on the rock station quite a bit."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm...interesting.  I guess I need to listen to it more."
"__MUSIC__ You sure do!"
"__MUSIC__ What album of theirs do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I would start with Hail to the King, and then work back some."
"__MUSIC__ Some?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, their earlier stuff sounds different, not as good!"
