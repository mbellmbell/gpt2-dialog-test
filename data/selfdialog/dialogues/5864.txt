"__STAR_WARS__ If you had to choose between c3PO and R2D2, which robot would you want?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I think I'd choose R2D2."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He seems more useful for me.  I mean, I don't need a robot that speak a zillion languages."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true.  R2d2 is pretty handy.  Except when he shuts down for extended periods of time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but he only did that once.  He's not my favorite robot, just my favorite between the two."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting.  Who is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ BB8, of course!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I forgot about him.  Why is he your favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's so cute and clever, and loyal!  I love his shape and attitude."
