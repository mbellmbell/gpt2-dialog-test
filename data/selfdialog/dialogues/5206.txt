"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen the most recent Fast and Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I haven't yet. I plan to, though. You saw it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I did. I wasn't sure if I was going to after Paul Walker's accident."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's kind of why I haven't seen it yet. I think it'll just be too sad."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's what I thought, too. And it was sad, for sure."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I bet. The whole thing with the way he died is just so ironic."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know. Too much like the movies, but no happy ending."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ But the movie was good?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was. I actually feel better because they had a really beautiful tribute to Paul in it. It was very well-done and emotional."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wow, I really respect that they did that. He deserved it. He was a good guy."
