"__DISNEY__ Did you see that they're making a new Mulan movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I saw that but they haven't announced all the actors."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they pick a new actress for Mulan."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed, they definitely need a new face for that character."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that they were thinking about getting rid of her character and creating a new male character instead."
"__DISNEY__ I don't like that, I hope they stick with the original storyline."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed, I loved the original characters and I hope they keep the same plot."
"__DISNEY__ That would be so weird if they introduced a new character."
"__DISNEY__ I know, so many of the new Disney movies change around things too much."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, I like when they stay with a traditional storyline."
