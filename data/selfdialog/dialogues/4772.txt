"__MUSIC__ I've been looking into Delia Derbyshire some more. She's kind of amazing, actually."
"__MUSIC__ She's the one who did the Doctor Who theme, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the original one -- and all its adjustments up through Tom Baker. And that's kind of amazing in itself, but there's so much more."
"__MUSIC__ Lay it on me, then."
"__MUSIC__ Well. How about that she invented Acid House somewhere around 1970?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Some tapes turned up a little while ago of some experiments she did back then, all through tape splices and very very early room-filling synthesizers, that basically sound like they were done in the mid-late '90s. Could have been Aphex Twin."
"__MUSIC__ That's... kind of remarkable, yeah. You said they found them. She never released this stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ No, there's even a lead-in on the tape that says something like 'This is just for my own amusement, so never mind this.'"
"__MUSIC__ Man. So, did she get any kind of recognition in her time for all of this stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really. She was operating as part of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, so the group (which was mostly men) got collective credit if any credit was to be given."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she do anything outside of the BBC, like, on her own time?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a little. There was a weird band she was in, briefly, called White Noise. It's... loopy."
"__MUSIC__ Loopy how? Like, super experimental."
"__MUSIC__ That, and just... deliberately strange. Kind of makes me think of early Frank Zappa."
"__MUSIC__ Man. Or, I guess woman. I get the feeling women are quietly responsible for most of the good things in the world, but just never get any credit for it."
"__MUSIC__ That does seem to largely be the case, yes. Hidden Figures and all."
"__MUSIC__ Right, exactly. So I guess she never made much money off of this stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't seem so. She quit music after a while and went from one dead-end job to another, eventually dying in her sixties, thinking herself a failure."
"__MUSIC__ Oh God."
