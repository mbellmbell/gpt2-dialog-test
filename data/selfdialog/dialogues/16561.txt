"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of Marvel movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! I love them."
"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see 'Spider-Man: Homecoming?' '"
"__MOVIES__ Of course. I've already bought my tickets. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ That's my plan. I want to see how it goes this time around with Tom Holland in the role."
"__MOVIES__ I heard it's actually the best one they've made."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I like the ones with Tobey Maguire that Sam Raimi did."
"__MOVIES__ Those were good. My favorite was 'Spider-Man 2' because of Doc Oc."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! Alfred Molina was amazing in that role."
"__MOVIES__ One of the best Marvel movie villains."
"__MOVIES__ True. Another good Marvel villain was Loki."
"__MOVIES__ I love Loki! I can't wait to see him back in 'Thor: Ragnarok.' '"
"__MOVIES__ Me, too! When does that come out again?"
"__MOVIES__ In early November. In fact, it comes out on my birthday."
"__MOVIES__ Lucky you! One of your favorite characters right on your birthday. That's a great present."
"__MOVIES__ It really is. It's a great year for movies all around, though. Right after that is 'Justice League.' '"
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't into seeing that but after 'Wonder Woman' I'm more excited about it."
"__MOVIES__ I can understand that. The last few films were pretty bad, but I'm excited to see Aquaman, as  well as Wonder Woman in it."
"__MOVIES__ I never thought I'd be excited about Aquaman as a character, but I'm looking forward to seeing him, too."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's going to be better than people are fearing."
