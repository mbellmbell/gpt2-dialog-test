"__STAR_WARS__ In the new Star Wars movie, why is Klyo so crazy about a grandpa he never met."
"__STAR_WARS__ They never really say, I imagine he thinks they have something in common."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why? I mean he has powers but no one made him dark."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is very powerful, but the dark side has more power."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, maybe he wanted to have more power, make his grandpa proud."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, even though Vader turned good at the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ He even visited Luke in a, what is that, a force ghost?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, on Endorine. At the part, he did so that means he some how died a Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even though he lived most his life as a sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ He began the turn long before he got the mask."
