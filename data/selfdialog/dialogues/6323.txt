"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite character in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a tough questions. I think Obi Wan is my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like Obi Wan a lot too although he is responsible for helping train Darth Vadar."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya that's a good point he didn't always make the best choices."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it would have been better if he had listened to Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya yoda did warn him not to train Anikan but then he insisted because of the death of Qui Gon Jinn"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya I guess Obi Wan didn't want to train him at first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya that's a good point. Without Qui Gon Anakin would have stayed with him mom."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya maybe he would have been happier if he had never left to become a Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a great point and then he would have been there to save hiis mom."
