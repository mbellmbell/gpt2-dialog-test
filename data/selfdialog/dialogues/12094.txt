"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The new stadium faisco surrounds the horrifying fact that the new stadium will not be able to house all the fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is quite a delemmna"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know, to circumvent the problem the want to Shuttle Bus, in the fans, along with regarding others fan to park 3 miles from the stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, what were they thinking when they came up with that plan."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Precisely, they'll be a lot more activity surrounding who can make it to the Shuttle buses fast enough instead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get that. And a wish to not be on the very last bus that Shuttles them out of the ball park."
