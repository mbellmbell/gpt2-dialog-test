"__DISNEY__ When does the new Cars movie come out?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's really soon. It should be a good one.  All of the Cars movies have been good."
"__DISNEY__ I liked the first one really well, but didn't like the second one as much."
"__DISNEY__ I can see that.  It's just hard to beat the first one.  Getting introduced to LIghtning McQueen and Mater and all the other characters."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it's hard to beat those characters. Do you think they'll have many of the same characters in the new movie?"
"__DISNEY__ All that I've seen in the previews is Mater and LIghtning. I'd love to see Sarge or Doc or Sally."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah!  I wonder is Lightning and Sally ever got married?"
"__DISNEY__ I wondered that too!  Mater is always so funny."
"__DISNEY__ I think that the second movie focused more on Mater but it looks like this one is going back to Lightning."
"__DISNEY__ That's what it looked like to me too. The first preview looked scary!"
