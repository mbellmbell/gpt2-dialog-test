"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite underground hip hop artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Without a doubt it is Earl Sweatshirt."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't he a part of the group Odd Future?"
"__MUSIC__ He sure was! But he has done a couple solo albums as well."
"__MUSIC__ He was awesome. Him and Taco were my favorite members i the group."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. I loved their flow, but I'm not as much of a fan when it comes to Tyler the Creator."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. He's alright, but not as good as the other two."
"__MUSIC__ What other underground artists do you like in the hip hop scene?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to be really into Brother Ali."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of him. Is he any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, he was awesome! His lyrics are always so important and focus on serious issues."
"__MUSIC__ Has he released anything new lately that I could check out?"
"__MUSIC__ Not that I know of. I'm not even sure if he is still touring."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have any other favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Snow The Product and Honey Cocaine."
"__MUSIC__ They're awesome and they both have made a huge impact on the female rap scene."
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree. They both have a serious flow and always come out with awesome hits."
"__MUSIC__ They sort of remind me of a cross between Remy Ma and Kreayshawn, but way better than both of them. Even combined."
"__MUSIC__ I know just what you mean! I can't wait for Tyga and Honey to release a new mixtape."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I hope it is soon!"
