"__DISNEY__ I think my all time favorite Disney movie is Alice in Wonderland."
"__DISNEY__ Oh good one! Do you like the animated one or the live version better?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd have to say the animated version."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Why?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought Johnny Depp was really creepy as the Mad Hatter."
"__DISNEY__ I thought he was awesome!"
"__DISNEY__ I also just really don't like Tim Burton's style, like I don't like how his movies are directed."
"__DISNEY__ I get that, it's definitely a really creepy vibe."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I like the colorful, playful animation of the original."
"__DISNEY__ I think that the Tim Burton version fits the book better!"
