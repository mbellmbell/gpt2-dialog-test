"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey what are some of the best movies that you have seen this year?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have a few that were really memorable for me actually."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well name a few of them."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Logan, Get Out, and Split were all my favorite so far."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you have one out of those that was the clear cut winner."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I would have to say Split, the entire movie was excellent."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I thought that was M Night Shyamalan's best movie in a while."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I agree, he completely redeemed himself from his last few movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The only problem that I had with the movie were the two girls other than the main one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What was wrong with them."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I just thought the acting was cheesy, and their characters were rather undeveloped."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I can see your point, the characters really were not that believable."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ For sure, I really did not care when they died in the end."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I thought the guy who played the main character was fantastic though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah he had some of the best acting that i have seen in a long time actually."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think that he might win an oscar for that performance."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It is a little early to be able to tell, but I think you may be right."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The way he was able to switch between each personality was outstanding."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He is an super underrated actor for sure."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hopefully this movie will give him more recognition."
