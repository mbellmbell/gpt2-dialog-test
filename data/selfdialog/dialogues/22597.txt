"__DISNEY__ What are your thoughts about the remake of Beauty and the Beast that came out this year?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought Emma Watson was a great choice for Belle!"
"__DISNEY__ Same.  I thought she did a great job with the singing."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they considered anyone else for the role?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure if they did or not."
"__DISNEY__ At first, I was worried she'd seem a little too young to play Belle, even though she's in her 20s."
"__DISNEY__ That's true!  But Belle is pretty young in the animated version, so I think Emma was a good choice."
"__DISNEY__ What about the Beast though!  Them together didn't work all that will in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ Right?!  He seemed so much older than her!"
"__DISNEY__ Agreed.  It was kind of awkward at the end when he turns back into the prince because he looks like he's probably 15 years older than her."
