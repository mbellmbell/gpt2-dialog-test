"__MUSIC__ What's the most beautiful song you've ever heard?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's kind of a big question. You mean the most beautiful one ever?"
"__MUSIC__ That comes to mind anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Well a lot of classical music is really beautiful, like everything Mozart ever wrote for example."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, but can you pick one out?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably not, and I think if we're talking about personally beautiful I'd have to go with 'Music of Heaven'."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard that one. Who's it by?"
"__MUSIC__ It was written by Jason Robert Brown, for a singer and piano and orchestra/chorus."
"__MUSIC__ What makes it the most beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ Well I think a few things all added together. To start with the instrumentation in the opening is perfect."
"__MUSIC__ Which instruments does it use?"
"__MUSIC__ It's piano and a couple of strings, maybe a violin, viola, and cello? It's very open and bare."
"__MUSIC__ And that makes it beautiful?"
"__MUSIC__ The fact that there's so much space in the music lets you really hear what's going on."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I'm with you so far."
"__MUSIC__ He has this really special way of using dissonance where unlike a lot of music that does the tension and release thing a lot of the time (like in the beginning of this song) the tension doesn't so much release as just fade."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I know what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ Well if you listen, right after the singer sings 'Let the music begin' the piano chords are dissonant, and they don't resolve. There's just silence."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so it doesn't go to the resolving chord. It just fades out and then something new starts?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! It's beautiful, and pulls you into the song."
