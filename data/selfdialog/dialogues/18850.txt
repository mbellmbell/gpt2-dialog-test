"__MOVIES__ Hey, do you ever watch those old superhero movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean like the old Batman movies and stuff like that?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm talking about the really old stuff. For example, did you ever see black and white Batman movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't realize they made black and white Batman movies, actually."
"__MOVIES__ They actually made a series of shorts back in 1943."
"__MOVIES__ I guess they used to do more shorts back in the old days."
"__MOVIES__ They did. Movies used to sometimes have those news highlight reels about the war."
"__MOVIES__ I guess nowadays they pretty much just show trailers."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like that's part of the fun of going to the movies, though."
"__MOVIES__ That's true."
"__MOVIES__ Plus, you get to find out about all of the new stuff coming out."
"__MOVIES__ I hate when a trailer looks really good, and then the movie turns out to be really bad."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Sometimes all of the good stuff is in the trailers, and then there's nothing left for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Usually if the trailers make it seem like the movie is all special effects, I don't bother seeing the movie."
"__MOVIES__ So, you're not a car-chase fan?"
"__MOVIES__ No. I prefer the subtle stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Alfred Hitchcock was good at that."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. He was the master of suspense."
"__MOVIES__ Psycho is basically an all-time classic."
"__MOVIES__ I guess they don't usually make them like that anymore."
