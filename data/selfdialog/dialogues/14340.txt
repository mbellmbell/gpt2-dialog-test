"__HORROR__ Which was the better Dawn of the Dead the original or the remake?"
"__HORROR__ The original for plot line and overall creep factor.  But the remake had better special effects and acting."
"__HORROR__ I know what you mean.  Some of the acting in the original was pretty suspect.  And the makeup was just plane lazy."
"__HORROR__ But it was way scarier.  The fast zombies just aren't as creepy."
"__HORROR__ I know, sometimes they are but it doesn't churn your gut the same way."
"__HORROR__ The plot device of the helicopter was pretty solid in the original as well."
"__HORROR__ But the sequel had that guy on the roof.  Too bad they couldn't save him."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, he added comedic relief when it was needed pretty badly."
"__HORROR__ Broke up the gore a little bit."
"__HORROR__ I also like the happy ending of the original as well."
