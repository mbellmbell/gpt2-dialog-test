"__FASHION__ Have you seen the Jennifer Lawrence Dior handbag ad?"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure. Is that the one where she is wearing a white sweater?"
"__FASHION__ Finally. Someone who also thinks her outfit was weird."
"__FASHION__ Baby, you are not the only one. What was that anyway?"
"__FASHION__ While she is hanging it over the back of a white sofa. Yes that's the one."
"__FASHION__ I just love that black bag!"
"__FASHION__ So do I, but my purse doesn't."
"__FASHION__ Tell me about. Designer prices are getting out of hand."
"__FASHION__ That small red bag she was holding in another ad has my name all over it."
"__FASHION__ The one in which she is wearing a pink sweater and that white coat?"
"__FASHION__ Those outfits she was wearing in those ads are stunning."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, she can make dirt look good."
"__FASHION__ Did you notice that big bracelet she had on?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah. I was wondering if it was real."
"__FASHION__ With all the money she makes, I bet it is."
"__FASHION__ I guess. It sure was big enough in any case."
"__FASHION__ What did you think of the sleeves on that shirt/ dress?"
"__FASHION__ The kinda reminded me of bell bottoms.  I liked them."
"__FASHION__ I'm trying to remember if she was wearing any other jewelry in that ad."
"__FASHION__ I don't think she was. I just remember that huge gold looking bracelet."
