"__COMEDY__ What is your favorite comedy?"
"__COMEDY__ Grandma's Boy, definitely. Have you seen it?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, I have. I love it! I love the old people."
"__COMEDY__ Yea, the old people getting stoned are hilarious. I really like the part where the Monkey drives."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yea, and the lion? That was great. Have you seen any other of their movies?"
"__COMEDY__ No, I haven't, but it does remind me of Super Troopers."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yea, Super Troopers is awesome! Did you hear they're making another one?"
"__COMEDY__ Yea, I thought that was in the works for a while. I'm beginning to think that's not going to happen."
"__COMEDY__ It's supposed to come out this next year."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yea, I heard they had to do a Kickstarter for it. I guess we will find out."
