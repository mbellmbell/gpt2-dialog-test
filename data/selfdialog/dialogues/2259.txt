"__MUSIC__ What's your opinion on Miley Cyrus?"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely like her new stuff but I'm not so crazy about her older stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Same. I'm currently obsessed with her new song 'Malibu.'"
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I've had it on repeat for hours."
"__MUSIC__ I put it on blast whenever I'm in the car!"
"__MUSIC__ It's just such a perfect summer song!"
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. I was just listening to her older music and some of it takes me right back to middle school."
"__MUSIC__ I can't really stand her older stuff but sometimes I am in the mood to blast some Hannah Montana."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, of course! I grew up listening to it and sometimes I just need to get back to it."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. It's not even quality music but I just can't stop listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ 'Rockstar' will always be my jam."
"__MUSIC__ Same here! It just makes me feel so good about myself and like I can conquer anything."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! It never fails to put me in a good mood."
"__MUSIC__ And I also like 'Don't Wanna Be Torn.'"
"__MUSIC__ Me too. It's so funny looking back now but that song helped me through my first heartbreak."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, middle school love!"
"__MUSIC__ Right? Middle school was a wild time."
"__MUSIC__ Remember we always used to listen to the Jonas Brothers too?"
"__MUSIC__ How could I forget?"
"__MUSIC__ I miss those days."
