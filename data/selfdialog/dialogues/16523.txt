"__MOVIES__ I watched this movie last night that was so bad, it was truly entertaining!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? Sounds interesting."
"__MOVIES__ It was about a small group of high school kids. Well, mostly about to guys, but it included their other friends in it too."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like alot of other teen movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but this one includes their search for alcohol."
"__MOVIES__ There's something new. Teens and alcohol...how novel!"
"__MOVIES__ Hey, cut the sarcasm. This one was different!"
"__MOVIES__ You haven't convinced me yet."
"__MOVIES__ Well, these two guys are interested in scoring points with a couple of girls..."
"__MOVIES__ Teen boys interested in teen girls...another first. What will they think f next, breaking the law?"
"__MOVIES__ Snot."
"__MOVIES__ I was right wasn't I? They broke the law too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. They did."
"__MOVIES__ Right. And they probably went to a big party where they embarrassed them selves in fron of the girls, too!"
"__MOVIES__ How do you know this stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ I am just brilliant."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I am impressed. And I guess those things are common teen movie themes."
"__MOVIES__ Yup."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. I genuflect before you and acknowledge your awesomeness."
"__MOVIES__ As you should. And your apartment mate told me you watched the movie 'Superbad' last night!"
