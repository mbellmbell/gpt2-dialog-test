"__STAR_WARS__ What's the best Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's 'The Empire Strikes Back,' of course."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not the original, A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ A New Hope is a good movie, but Empire Strikes Back is better."
"__STAR_WARS__ What makes it better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Empire Strikes Back adds all the classic Star Wars features. It's the one that tells you what the Force is, introduces Yoda, and so on."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Ewoks are too annoying in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ And what about The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ While it was a good movie, it took too much of its plot direct from A New Hope. It felt derivative."
