"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Marvel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite so far is Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good one but not my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ No? Which one then?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the first Avengers the best."
"__MOVIES__ I did until Civil War came out."
"__MOVIES__ What's so great about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Just about everything. There were so many heroes in that one."
"__MOVIES__ But there was no Hulk or Thor."
"__MOVIES__ True. But they had everyone else except Doctor Strange and those two."
"__MOVIES__ I still think Avengers was better."
"__MOVIES__ Well what was so awesome about avengers compared to Civil War?"
"__MOVIES__ One word. Hulk."
"__MOVIES__ What about him?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it was the first movie with the new actor and he was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ That's it? He was good but it didn't make the movie."
"__MOVIES__ To me it did. Especially the scene where he grabbed Loki and whipped him around like a ragdoll."
"__MOVIES__ I'd rather watch all the rest battle each other any day."
"__MOVIES__ We'll just agree to disagree."
"__MOVIES__ I'll agree you're opinion is wrong."
