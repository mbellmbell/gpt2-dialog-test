"__POP__ Britney Spears is the best pop artist out there."
"__POP__ No way. Maybe two decades ago, but not now."
"__POP__ Okay. Who do you think is better?"
"__POP__ Well for starters Ariana Grande has much more range and vocal ability than Britney."
"__POP__ I'll give you that, but you can't deny that Britney's voice is unique. On top of that, she is a great performer."
"__POP__ That is true. Her Las Vegas shows were very popular."
"__POP__ Yes, she will always be an icon."
"__POP__ I wonder what made her career blossom so much more than Christina Aguilera's."
"__POP__ I think Britney had the southern belle thing going on which made her seem more lovable."
"__POP__ You may be right, but I would rather listen to Genie in a Bottle than Baby One More Time any day!"
