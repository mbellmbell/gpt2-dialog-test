"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you still a fan of the Bungles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Excuse me, I mean the Cincinnati Bengals?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still watch their games from time to time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They haven't been good in years. I've pretty much given up on them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm definitely not the fan I used to be. Who do you like now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I support the Patriots mostly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see, so you're a fairweather fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You just like whoever is winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, I supported the Bengals for decades. When was the last time they won a championship?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 1988."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See what I mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so. Loyalty can only go so far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't realize it had been so long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should do your research before you accuse someone of being a fairweather fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least there's hope. They didn't do too badly last year, and the year before that they made it to the Wildcard Playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they can make it to post season consistently, I might be willing to give them another shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair enough."
