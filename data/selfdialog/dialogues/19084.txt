"__MOVIES__ What did you think of that new Harry Potter Movie, Beasts from Within?"
"__MOVIES__ It actually surprised me, I thought it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Really, I didn't think you'd like it."
"__MOVIES__ What's that supposed to mean."
"__MOVIES__ Well you didn't like the Harry Potter movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well this isn't a Harry Potter movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's in the same Universe."
"__MOVIES__ Yea it is but it's not about little kids doing magic in some far away land."
"__MOVIES__ So the storyline happening in the real world changed it for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea it did, it was nice to see humans and wizards co existing."
"__MOVIES__ Some historical context?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly!  It was fun to see how the relationship developed."
"__MOVIES__ Yea it gives you a better understanding of the reason they are so secrative."
"__MOVIES__ So you agree with me then."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I do, but there is one thing."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea why they hide, I know they were hunted but their power would seem to out weigh armies of humans."
"__MOVIES__ So you consider that a plot hole?"
"__MOVIES__ A pretty big one in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ That's fair, it was still a good movie though."
