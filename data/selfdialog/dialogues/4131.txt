"__MUSIC__ What do you think of when you think of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania?"
"__MUSIC__ Um, steel mills? Historical buildings?"
"__MUSIC__ How about music, such as a great music festival with a variety of musical genres?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't really think of that."
"__MUSIC__ August 4th through the 13th this year is when Bethlehem becomes a musical place to be. It's called Musik Fest."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of bands will be there?"
"__MUSIC__ Santana, Chicago, Fathjer John Misty, Live, Aloe Blacc, Godsmack, Toby Keith by the f- ford series, The Band Perry, Lee Brice and Justin Moore, and Jethro Tull by Ian Anderson."
"__MUSIC__ That really is a diverse line-up. I wouldn't mind seeing several of those bands."
"__MUSIC__ Tickets are sold out for the first three bands, but the rest still have tickets available, ranging from $39/49/59/69/89/169. It's a big indoor theatre with three levels."
"__MUSIC__ I've sat in cheap seats before in the higher sections. You can still hear the music, and I just took binoculars, and then I could see the stage just fine."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good idea. I did that once too."
"__MUSIC__ What else is there to do there?"
"__MUSIC__ There are all kinds of other activities, dance performances, comedy acts, kids activities."
"__MUSIC__ Are there any free activities?"
"__MUSIC__ There are lots of free performers, music, dance, comedy, hoops, all kinds of things. So if you don't want to pay for the headliners, you can just go watch all the other free bands."
"__MUSIC__ How many different acts are there?"
"__MUSIC__ Friday August 4th under the free guide schedule, there are 24 different performers during the day you can see for free. Some of these will perform multiple days. There's a schedule of all the free things to see."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's great, because if you're on a budget, you could make a camping trip out of it and just go to all the free performances."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Saturday for example there are a bunch of free bands performing, as well as a glass making display, a woman twirling hoops, and a guy who rides a unicycle that is dressed up like a unicorn. So there's lots of free music, but other things to see too."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of thought of Pennsylvania as being a serious bunch of people, I didn't know they loved music and loved performances of all kinds so much."
