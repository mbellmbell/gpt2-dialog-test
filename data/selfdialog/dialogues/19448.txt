"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Don't laugh but it is Real Genius."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, never would have guessed. That starred Val Kilmer."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it did and it came out in I think 1985."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he was super young back then and very cute."
"__MOVIES__ It was a fun movie."
"__MOVIES__ That was when home computers and modems were all still new."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and computer hacking was new also and harder to trace."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the scene where Ick turns the dorm hall into an ice skating rink."
"__MOVIES__ That was so funny especially when Kilmer skates around and says no one signed up for there competition."
"__MOVIES__ Also when they trick Kent thinking he was talking to God."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was genius putting a transmitter on his braces."
"__MOVIES__ You do have to admit the best scene was the popcorn scene"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I couldn't believe that anyone could make such a huge ball of corn kernels."
"__MOVIES__ And they were so smart that they were able to direct the laser to hit the prism in the right spot so that it hit the ball."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and then Kent goes into the house."
"__MOVIES__ And them boom! Popcorn explosion."
"__MOVIES__ So funny how the house gets destroyed by popcorn."
"__MOVIES__ You almost felt sorry for Hathaway when he came home to that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah almost, but not. So funny!"
