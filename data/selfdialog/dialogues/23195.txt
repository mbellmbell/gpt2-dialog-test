"__DISNEY__ Oh, my God. Now that song will be stuck in my head too!"
"__DISNEY__ Sorry."
"__DISNEY__ That's Disney,,,or at least Disney World. Did that song every appear in a Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I have no idea."
"__DISNEY__ Me either! It had to be in some movie or something related to Disney, right?"
"__DISNEY__ I would think so. Maybe it was in 'Winnie the Pooh?'"
