"__MOVIES__ Did you see Nightmare on Elm Street?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually I was going to ask if you've seen both the original and the remake?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I've seen the entire series and the remake."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the remake?"
"__MOVIES__ Horrible. It never should have been made."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree. Robert Englund is the only Freddy Kruegar."
"__MOVIES__ Totally. I gave it a try, but the new Freddy wasn't frightening at all."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah exactly. Which is your favorite from the original series?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the first one and the third, Dream Warriors."
"__MOVIES__ Those are the best in my opinion too."
"__MOVIES__ They scared me the most and had the best plot lines."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, plus having Heather Langenkamp come back to reprise her role was good."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I'm just so bummed they killed her off."
"__MOVIES__ I remember being completely shocked by that."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I was young when it came out but I wasn't expecting the main girl to die."
"__MOVIES__ It was nice not having spoilers back then."
"__MOVIES__ For sure! Social media has ruined that."
"__MOVIES__ Check out Robert Englund's biography if you haven't already."
"__MOVIES__ I will for sure."
