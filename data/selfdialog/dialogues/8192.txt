"__POP__ Were you a Backstreet Boys and an N'sync fan?"
"__POP__ Totally N'sync, although I quietly like Backstreet Boys too."
"__POP__ Me too, crazy how you could only declare to be a fan on one because high school works that way!"
"__POP__ Seriously, how silly kids can be especially when it comes to pop music."
"__POP__ What's even crazier is that one guy was the writer for both albums."
"__POP__ Really?  Who is that?"
"__POP__ Max Martin, he is literally behind a huge number of top 40 pop hits for the last two decades."
"__POP__ Who else did he work with?"
"__POP__ He has written songs for Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Pink, Beyonc√©, Bon Jovi, and a ton more."
"__POP__ Wow, he is a king of pop for sure."
