"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see Birdman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I didn't like it at all. Strongly disliked."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it was pretty interesting how they shot it."
"__MOVIES__ Very depressing and unwatchable a second time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess I would never watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can't believe it won Best Picture. So many other good movies."
"__MOVIES__ What would you have picked?"
"__MOVIES__ Whiplash for starters."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that was good. J.K. Simmons was really good as the teacher."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, agree. I also really liked Grand Budapest Hotel."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm, I don't remember that one."
"__MOVIES__ It's a Wes Anderson movie. Very colorful, but also a great story line."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'll have to check that one out."
"__MOVIES__ I also liked American Sniper."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I didn't really care for that one."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it was a very interesting story."
"__MOVIES__ That's just it though. I heard the story was a little fabricated."
"__MOVIES__ Well they always do that for Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but then a lot of people take it for the truth."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's true."
