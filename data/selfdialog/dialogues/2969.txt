"__MUSIC__ Who's your favorite composer?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I don't really have a favorite. Who's yours?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite is Dmitri Shostakovich."
"__MUSIC__ That's quite a mouthful. Is he Russian?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ Are you from Russia? Why do you like that kind of Music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not from Russia, but many of the greatest composers were, such as Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see. Why is Shostakovich your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ His music is very intense, especially his symphonies."
"__MUSIC__ Really? How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Shostakovich symphonies push the limits of how powerful and forceful the orchestra can sound."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I never thought of classical music as sounding 'intense.'"
"__MUSIC__ Well, think about some of the big battle scenes in movies and some of the action scenes. That orchestral music gets pretty intense."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I guess I never really pay attention to the music."
"__MUSIC__ You're not supposed to. It affects people on a more subconscious level."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose you're right. Is Shostakovich a movie composer?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually he did write the score to a movie, but he is considered a classical composer because he wrote music to be performed in concert halls by classical musicians."
"__MUSIC__ How does his music compare to say - Beethoven or Tchaikovsky?"
"__MUSIC__ Shostakovich is a 20th century composer, so the range of sounds and harmonic dissonances are much more varied than 19th century composers like Beethoven."
"__MUSIC__ I see."
