"__MOVIES__ Mel Gibson seems to be making a comeback lately."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, really? I hadn't noticed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he has Hacksaw Ridge for one thing. That was pretty big."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I didn't realize that was his. I thought that was a Clint Eastwood flick."
"__MOVIES__ No, no, it was all Gibson. He actually has been doing movies here and there for some time now."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really, what else did he direct recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, actually, I meant starring. He did a movie called Blood Father the same year as Hacksaw Ridge."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I haven't heard of it. Was it a small movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of, it only had a budget of a few million. Like 10 or 15 million or something like that."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that explains why I've never heard of it then."
"__MOVIES__ Even before that he played the villain in Machete 2."
"__MOVIES__ You mean Machete Kills."
"__MOVIES__ You know what I meant, but he was the villain there. Sort of like how Tom Cruise did Tropic Thunder."
"__MOVIES__ Man, everyone loves Tom Cruise again. Still, I doubt that'll happen to Mel."
"__MOVIES__ Even so, he's doing better than he was. He had that weird Beaver movie, a while back, and things since then."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right. Wasn't he in The Expendables?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in the third one. Another villain role."
"__MOVIES__ I guess he just has to stick to antagonist roles from now on."
"__MOVIES__ Or just keep making movies like Hacksaw Ridge."
"__MOVIES__ That would probably be best. I think people like him more behind the camera than in front of it."
