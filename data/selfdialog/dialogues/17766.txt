"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Sing Street yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, I know you've been recommending it to me for months."
"__MOVIES__ You have actually betrayed me by giving me that answer."
"__MOVIES__ I just haven't had the time I promise."
"__MOVIES__ For Sing Street you make the time, it's a perfect film."
"__MOVIES__ See though when you hype it like that I'm unsure."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me, perfect soundtrack, great unknown cast, all musicians."
"__MOVIES__ So the actors play their instruments?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes John Carney wanted to make it as authentic as possible."
"__MOVIES__ That's admirable, some music movies are lame when you know they aren't actually playing."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, that's what makes Sing Street so relatable and easy to enjoy."
"__MOVIES__ So everything else is bad?"
"__MOVIES__ Don't be like that, the acting, especially Jack Reynor's character is incredible."
"__MOVIES__ I'll watch it soon I promise, what's it on?"
"__MOVIES__ You can catch it on Netflix now, I've watched it like six times since it was added."
"__MOVIES__ That's a lot, it's hard to believe it's that good."
"__MOVIES__ It's just an infectiously good movie, great vibes."
"__MOVIES__ Will I like it if I don't like 80s music?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, taste in music doesn't defeat a beautiful coming of age story."
"__MOVIES__ You have a point, I'll watch it tonight."
