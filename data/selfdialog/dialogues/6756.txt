"__STAR_WARS__ What about Luke Skywalker, as an action hero?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he's great."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like him a lot, as someone we viewers can relate to."
"__STAR_WARS__ Especially in the first movie, as this kind of bored kid who wonders what's out there in the world for him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kind of like a male Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, do you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I like that idea!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Another interesting thing about Luke is the idea that he is the one we are more like, while Han Solo is the one we want to be like."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and can never be, because he's so impossibly cool!"
"__STAR_WARS__ But Luke changes and grows the most across all the movies, I think."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, by the time we meet him in Return of the Jedi, you can tell he's gone through a pretty intense series of experiences!"
