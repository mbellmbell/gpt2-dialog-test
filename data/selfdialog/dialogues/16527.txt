"__MOVIES__ I watched Kung Pow again last night."
"__MOVIES__ Wow what is that like thirty times for you?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say it's gotta be more than that, it's an all time classic."
"__MOVIES__ I could never see the appeal honestly."
"__MOVIES__ It's just a totally ridiculous concept, dubbing an old kung fu movie with english voices."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely a novel idea and I can see why it's a cult classic, I just can't get into it."
"__MOVIES__ What cult classic type movies are you into then?"
"__MOVIES__ One of my favorites is The Wicker Man, with Nicolas Cage."
"__MOVIES__ Wait you're telling me you enjoy that remake more than Kung Pow?"
"__MOVIES__ It's an unintentional comedy, or maybe even an intentional comedy we will never know."
"__MOVIES__ That I can see but it's such an odd choice."
"__MOVIES__ The acting in that film is so off the wall that I can't help but love it."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite line?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's a tough one, probably when he's talking about the doll that burned."
"__MOVIES__ I'm partial to the sharks in the bag line myself."
"__MOVIES__ What about your favorite line in Kung Pow, while we're on the subject of favorite dialogue."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite line in Kung Pow is probably the 'my finger points' line, so simple, so stupid."
"__MOVIES__ See that's why I kind of can't get into that film as much, just seems random."
"__MOVIES__ That's the point of the movie honestly."
"__MOVIES__ Guess so, maybe I'll rewatch it some time."
