"__MUSIC__ Did you hear A Perfect Circle is touring again?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I thought they had broken up. That's awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they'll be in our area in November."
"__MUSIC__ We'll have to get tickets. Did they put out a album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, actually they are using this tour as inspiring the band to finalize and release new material."
"__MUSIC__ So, they're playing a bunch of test gigs?"
"__MUSIC__ Basically, that's what they did with Mer de Noms back in 1999."
"__MUSIC__ I had no idea that was what they were doing in that tour."
"__MUSIC__ Well, its a good way to motivate yourself and your band to finish an album."
"__MUSIC__ That's very true."
"__MUSIC__ I really hope they play some old songs mixed in with the new material."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure they will, they usually throw in a few classics, to keep the fans happy."
"__MUSIC__ I would love to see them play Blue live. I've never seen them do it."
"__MUSIC__ That was one of my favorite music videos that they ever put out."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't they do a bunch of videos for Blue?"
"__MUSIC__ Those were fan submissions. It was some kind of contest."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite fan submission?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the claymation guy in the desert a lot."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that one too. For claymation, it really captured the song well."
"__MUSIC__ It really did."
