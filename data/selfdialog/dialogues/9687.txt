"__COMEDY__ i wish they would remake blazing saddles."
"__COMEDY__ That is sacrilegious."
"__COMEDY__ Why? Just update it with more modern actors."
"__COMEDY__ What does that even mean? It's set in the 1900s. We can't have a modern actors. It's a period spoof."
"__COMEDY__ Anyway, it will be more fun if it was updated with new actors, then. y'know famous people."
"__COMEDY__ Why did I even begin this conversation. That makes no sense."
"__COMEDY__ well think of it. Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle playing the sheriff. it will be hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ Whatever, One thing I don't get is why people like Tootsie so much."
"__COMEDY__ That wasn't very good if you ask me. But because it was set in the 70s. I just hate movies from that era."
"__COMEDY__ I haven't watched in a decade I think. I don't even remember the details of it. But remember it being boring."
