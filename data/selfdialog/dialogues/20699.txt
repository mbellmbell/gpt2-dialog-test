"__THRILLER__ Have you ever heard of a movie called Battle Royale?"
"__THRILLER__ Yea it's based off of the book right?"
"__THRILLER__ Yea! That's the one."
"__THRILLER__ Yea I've seen it, but I was really disappointed."
"__THRILLER__ Me too, the book was much more intense."
"__THRILLER__ It's a cool premise for a thriller, a bunch of kids having to kill eachother."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, in fact they are making an American version of it, but in an office building."
"__THRILLER__ I guess kids killing eachother would be too much these days."
"__THRILLER__ I think it just makes a more interesting story to do it in a closed office space."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, it's easier to make a movie about it since the area isn't huge like in the book."
