"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So you said that you're a fan of Furious 7?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, I am. I really liked that movie when I first watched it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What did you like about it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There was a lot of things. It'd be hard to tell you just one......"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well break it down for me!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I really liked the story, especially what they ended up doing with Brian's character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Right. I was very nervous about what they'd do with him after Paul's passing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Same here, but I think they handled it the best way they possibly could."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So many people cried during that closing scene, didn't they?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You bet. I counted at least ten people immediately next to me all in tears inside the theater."
