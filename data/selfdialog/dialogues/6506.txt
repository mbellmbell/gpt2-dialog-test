"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever seen the original Star Wars Movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The one with Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes that one!  I think it's so much better then the new ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ I remember the first time I saw star Wars I was so shocked to find out Luke was Darth Vadar's son."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know!   That was a epic cliff hanger. I was like what?  But the new ones don't have that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly I remember waiting and waiting to find out if Darth Vadar  was lying or what was going on.  Then he cut his arm off!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vadar was evil and uncaring in the original movies. The new ones just don't have that element."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have always admired the original movies and how they did the space craft using model toys."
"__STAR_WARS__ I watched the special feature that showed that. All the space scenes were just a toy and a box with a backgroun. But somehow they look so much better then the new movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the new Star Wars movie are more CGI then anything and I can't stand Jar Jar Binks!"
