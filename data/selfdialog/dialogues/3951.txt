"__MUSIC__ This year has been crazy for music releases, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man, lots of good stuff out there recently."
"__MUSIC__ 2017 has already been way better for me than 2016 in terms of solid albums."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, easily. What are some of your favorites so far?"
"__MUSIC__ That album by Jay Som is excellent; have you heard it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I keep hearing that name pop up."
"__MUSIC__ Jay Som is the name that this songwriter named Melina Duterte records and performs under; it's basically like indie rock/pop I guess."
"__MUSIC__ OK. Who would you compare her to?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh, I'm not sure, I'm kind of bad with comparisons. She writes really solid guitar based songs that are really tuneful and melodic."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds right up my alley; I'll check her out. What else?"
"__MUSIC__ Another indie rock album: the new one by Alex G."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you mean (SANDY) Alex G?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha, yeah, I heard that that's what he's going by now. Fair enough."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard a couple of songs from that one. It's a little folkier, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh, kind of. Some of it is borderline country, but other songs are like Elliott Smith."
"__MUSIC__ I hear the Elliott Smith comparisons a lot."
"__MUSIC__ What about you man, what are you digging?"
"__MUSIC__ That Spoon album is good. Hot Thoughts?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I like that one too. Those guys don't put out bad albums."
"__MUSIC__ I know. They're got a pretty insane discography by now."
