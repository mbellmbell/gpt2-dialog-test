"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is one thing that bothered you about the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, you already know! Dobby!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why Dobby, he's so sweet and cute."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No he's not! He's obnoxious, and nearly kills Harry at least two or three times."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well I think he means well, but just ends up getting in the way, lol."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, he does help a bit in the end I guess."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ A bit? He saves everyone by apparating into the Malfoy's cellar and saving the day."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True, I guess I overlooked that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Dude, he DIED as a result. In Harry's arms no less."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're right, okay, fine I love Dobby now! Now let's talk about Hedwig, the truly useless character!"
