"__MUSIC__ We're having a Fourth of July party this year."
"__MUSIC__ That's great! I was wondering who would host one."
"__MUSIC__ We decided that this would definitely be the year for us."
"__MUSIC__ That's exciting! Can I help with anything?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually you can. I need some help choosing the music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what did you have in mind?"
"__MUSIC__ I wanted to pick out some songs that just feel very American, without being overly patriotic."
"__MUSIC__ So, long, American songs you can party to?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Well, Miley Cyrus' 'Party in the USA' seems like an obvious choice then."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know how I didn't think of that sooner."
"__MUSIC__ Me either."
"__MUSIC__ Any other ideas?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe some Springsteen?"
"__MUSIC__ I've never listened to much Springsteen."
"__MUSIC__ You should. Born in the USA would be the perfect album for a party like this."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Any other ideas?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. I'm starting to run low."
"__MUSIC__ Let's find someone else to ask."
"__MUSIC__ Okay!"
