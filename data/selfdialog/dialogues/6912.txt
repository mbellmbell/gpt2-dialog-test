"__STAR_WARS__ Kylo Ren's lightsaber is so weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's got the lightsaber beams coming out of the side."
"__STAR_WARS__ So?  Not sure what you're getting at."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would think that those would be in the way and you could cut your own hand off."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they're there to help protect his own hand from getting cut off."
"__STAR_WARS__ Guess it makes sense.  That did happen to Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly.  Maybe that's why it was built that way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Never thought about that.  You're a genius!"
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right, I am a genius!"
