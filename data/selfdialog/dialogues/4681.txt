"__MUSIC__ Do you know any cool electronica bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Why, are you looking to get into that genre more?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I just don't know where to start!"
"__MUSIC__ You can start off with Ratatat"
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard of them, there is a song with a tiger roar"
"__MUSIC__ That was probably wildcat, that's a great song!"
"__MUSIC__ Besides Ratatat, what are some other good bands?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Odesza, they are not as famous as Ratatat though"
"__MUSIC__ What is a good song by them?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Bloom and Say my name"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I will give those a listen later today"
"__MUSIC__ How long have you liked techno music?"
"__MUSIC__ Since I was born pretty much!"
"__MUSIC__ And what do you like most about it?"
"__MUSIC__ I like that the words are not always important"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ Anyone can enjoy the music, because the words are not essential to feeling the beat"
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's cool. It makes me feel like I should find music from other cultures and see what I feel"
"__MUSIC__ You can check out Tiesto later, he is European and has very energetic music!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I already know of Tiesto, but I will find his stuff on Spotify later too!"
