"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey what do you think about the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you can either love them or hate them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And which group do you belong in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they have been doing really well. That come back was insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! It was! I thought that game was the Falcon's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was unprecedented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No matter what people say. Tom Brady is the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I will have to argue you about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, are you one of those people who hate him because of the deflation thing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I just don't think Tom Brady is the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you seen the arms of Aaron Rodger?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, all of that Hail Mary play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Drew Brees and his leadership."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't count Peyton Manning out? Come back after a year and win the Super Bowl to end his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right, he was great while he last."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See. Tom Brady is not the best player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well have any of those players ever win 5 super bowls and come back from a 28-3 deficit?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got me there."
