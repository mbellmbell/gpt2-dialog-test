"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately? I'm tired of watching Moana with my little one."
"__MOVIES__ I've been watching a lot of classic movies recently. I was watching Breakfast at Tiffany's last night."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of that one. Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Audrey Hepburn. She's a party girl living in New York."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting. What other movies has she been in?"
"__MOVIES__ Sabrina, Roman Holiday, and My Fair Lady."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen that one. I watched it  when I was little."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a musical but she isn't the one doing the singing."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know that."
"__MOVIES__ The real singer's name was Marni Nixon. They used her in a lot of musicals."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy! I'm not a big fan of musicals though."
"__MOVIES__ I love them but I also love to watch the old westerns."
"__MOVIES__ I've watched some John Wayne movies with my dad. They are pretty cool I guess."
"__MOVIES__ The Searchers has always been my favorite of his. I also like True Grit."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen that one. That's when he's helping that kid find who killed her dad."
"__MOVIES__ I also like The Cowboys, but it is really sad."
"__MOVIES__ Why is it sad?"
"__MOVIES__ He dies in that one. It always made me cry when I was little."
"__MOVIES__ That does sound sad. I'll have to find some more of his movies to watch."
"__MOVIES__ You should! He made so many films."
