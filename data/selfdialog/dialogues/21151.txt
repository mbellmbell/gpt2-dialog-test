"__THRILLER__ Have you seen any thriller movies lately?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I did see that new movie Life with Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I wanted to see that one.  How was it?"
"__THRILLER__ I expected it to be a lot better, it wasn't even Jake Gyllenhaal's best work.  I hate Noctural Animals as well but at least he acted his heart out in it."
"__THRILLER__ Nocturnal Animals WAS a weird movie.  What didn't you like about Life?"
"__THRILLER__ It felt like it dragged on, and then the ending became predictable about halfway thought the movie."
"__THRILLER__ I hate when I can guess the movie endings, I love being surprised."
"__THRILLER__ If you like being suprised you should watch some M. Night Shyamalan movies."
"__THRILLER__ Which one do you recommend?"
"__THRILLER__ His older ones were great like Sixth Sense and The Village, but he recently made a new one called Split which was very popular."
