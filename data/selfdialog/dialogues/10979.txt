"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is that you're wearing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My fan outfit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fan outfit? For what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For the Redskins game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you look like a farm animal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your point?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Redskins are indian braves...proud warriors and something to be feared, respected, and revered."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. So?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does your outfit have to do with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nothing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then why would you dress up like a pig in skirt?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not a pig, I'm a hog!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pig...hog...same thing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You obviously know nothing about the rituals and traditions of football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have been a Bills fan for 20 years. I have never dressed like a farm animal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be an improvement on your part."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're avoiding the issue!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The hogs are a tradition!  We represent the enormous, powerful, snorting beast that resides in every Redskin offensive lineman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if that is the best you can do, I feel sorry for you. I'll make it up to you by bringing the Bar-B-Que sauce to the next game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only ribs you'll be seeing will be your own!"
