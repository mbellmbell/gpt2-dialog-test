"__MOVIES__ Whats the scariest movie you've ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you talking about old classic ones, or newer scary ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Whichever, just the scariest movie you've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ Well, thats two different categories, and both have scary movies in it."
"__MOVIES__ I dont get what you mean, shouldn't they just be in one category?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, older movies are cult classics, newer movies have a scare factor."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I get what you mean, which cult classic was the scariest for you then?"
"__MOVIES__ That would have to be the original Halloween, although Rob Zombie did a pretty good remake."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like about the remake?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked how it delved into Michael Meyers background more than the original."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked that about his remake too, one of the reasons I liked the remake better."
"__MOVIES__ I can understand that, but to me, the original is much scarier."
"__MOVIES__ Which new age movie, is the scariest to you?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say, any of the Saw movies."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought they were really cheesy and not very good."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoy the gore and torturous plots of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ So youre more into the gore than the actual plot of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, i really liked the plots of the saw movies too, but i like the torture."
"__MOVIES__ Youre kind of an odd ball arent you."
"__MOVIES__ I just know how i like my movies, thats all."
