"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, I heard this week that Hayden Christensen and his wife decided not to tell their child that he was Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, that's strange.  I would tell everyone that I was Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too!  But apparently, they don't want their child to connect him to one of the most villainous characters of all time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I can agree with that.  But I would still want to say the occasional, 'I am your father,' in Vader's voice to my kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree.  That would be cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hayden Christensen always seemed to reject his connection to Star Wars, so I'm not super surprised."
"__STAR_WARS__ People didn't like the way he portrayed Anakin in Episode's 2 & 3, but I thought he was good."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he was good too. But his chemistry with Nataie Portman was non-existent."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true.  There was no chemistry, and it kind of took away from the films."
"__STAR_WARS__ Natalie Portman had more chemistry with Ewan Macgregor."
