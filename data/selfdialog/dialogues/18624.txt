"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see Bad Words?"
"__MOVIES__ No. What's that."
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie with Jason Bateman."
"__MOVIES__ He's really good!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. You'd like it."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about."
"__MOVIES__ This guy enters a spelling bee."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds lame."
"__MOVIES__ No, it's great."
"__MOVIES__ Why would a grown man enter a spelling bee?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't really say without giving up the end."
"__MOVIES__ Oh..."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me, it's worth your time. It's Bateman like you've never seen."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ He's kind of a bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ A bad guy?!"
"__MOVIES__ More of an anti-hero."
"__MOVIES__ He always plays the nice guy."
"__MOVIES__ I know. That's why it's so great!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out."
