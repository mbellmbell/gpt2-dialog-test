"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the Twilight movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah they weren't too bad. I thought they kind of butchered the books though."
"__MOVIES__ My girlfriend really likes Robert Pattinson, so I went to see them in theaters with her. Personally I think the girl who placed Alice is really cute."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I've seen her in a few other things, she is pretty adorable. What was your favorite scene in those movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well as a guy speaking, I really liked the final battle in the last one. Even thought it did all turn out to be fake."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that was a clever way to give people some action and still retain the story. Kudos to the director."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the CG werewolves?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh they weren't too bad. I think looking back on them a few years later it doesn't quite hold up, but back then it was okay."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's crazy how poorly some CG actually ages. But it's better sometimes than the alternative."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well like take for example the first Underworld movie. They used puppets for their werewolves and it was absolutely terrible."
"__MOVIES__ I think I remember that! You're right, they did look pretty bad."
"__MOVIES__ Even at the time they came out they were the worst. I tried to go back and watch that movie and couldn't even do it."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of movies from the early 2000's, did you like The Matrix?"
"__MOVIES__ Man I was a kid when that thing came out and I loved it so much. The first one anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, well the second one wasn't too bad. There's like a 30 minute action scene in the middle that I really liked."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the whole chase scene where Keanu Reeves is trying to get to Morpheus and the others and they're on the freeway?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that whole thing, starting with the big fight in the mansion. Talk about adrenaline pumping awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ You've got a good point. I think maybe I'd like to go back and rewatch that; not the whole thing, just those parts of it."
"__MOVIES__ And don't even bother with the third Matrix movie, Matrix Revolutions. It was terrible."
