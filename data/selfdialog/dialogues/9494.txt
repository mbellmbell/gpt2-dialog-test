"__BASEBALL__ What is your favorite play in baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Ooh, that's a tie between a 'little-league homerun' and an 'inside the park homerun'."
"__BASEBALL__ Why is that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, these are all highly-paid super athletes. Yet these two situations rely on gross incompetence."
"__BASEBALL__ How so?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, the little-league home run is based entirely on errors. It's usually a bases-loaded situation and the team just over throws or misses their targets, letting everyone continue to run."
"__BASEBALL__ So, it's not a home run, then."
"__BASEBALL__ What?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's a series of errors, not a home run."
"__BASEBALL__ You know what I mean. But the best part is a little-league grand slam."
"__BASEBALL__ I saw that the other day! It's hilarious."
"__BASEBALL__ So what's more exciting, the inside-the-parker or the little-leaguer?"
"__BASEBALL__ I like the inside-the-park, because it's less on human error, minus a judgement call, and more about a massive sprint."
"__BASEBALL__ It's especially funny when the batter is fat."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, an easy inside-the-park homerun would be barely a triple for Frank Thomas. If not, an out."
"__BASEBALL__ So, hypothetical situation:"
"__BASEBALL__ Ok, go."
"__BASEBALL__ Let's say two outfielders are both going to the ball, but collide and are both knocked out. Is it an error or a hit?"
"__BASEBALL__ No idea, but I'd pay good money to watch that. That seems hilarious."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, even more so if the third outfielder runs up to get the ball, and trips over them. Just a series of injuries."
