"__MUSIC__ What was Amy Winehouse's first album?"
"__MUSIC__ Frank.  It's more of a neo-soul album."
"__MUSIC__ Is that the one that has the song Amy, Amy, Amy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  It's really good."
"__MUSIC__ I'm so sad that she died so young."
"__MUSIC__ Such a tragedy. Kind of like Whitney Houston."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They both had husbands who got them hooked on harder drugs."
"__MUSIC__ And both husbands seemed to come out of it unscathed."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard her duet with Tony Bennett?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  She sounds so much like Billie Holiday."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  I also think that Lady Gaga sounds like Ella Fitzgerald."
"__MUSIC__ I think so too.  She really had a beautiful voice."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think that Amy Winehouse sounds like Billie Holiday because they both had the same drug addiction."
"__MUSIC__ But, they also both had great talent."
"__MUSIC__ I have found some Youtube vidoes of Winehouse doing some older songs and they were great."
"__MUSIC__ I have too. But, I don't like Beattles covers."
"__MUSIC__ I don't either. Solo artists just don't capture it the same way."
"__MUSIC__ The worst, honestly, was Motown sings the Beattles."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the styles dont' match."
"__MUSIC__ It's like Drake trying to sing.  Ha ha!"
