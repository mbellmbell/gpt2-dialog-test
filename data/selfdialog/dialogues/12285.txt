"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think the Falcons will be really good again this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, they still have all the same pieces right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, Julio Jones and company will be back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just feel like they peaked last year, and they won't be able to duplicate that success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think Matt Ryan led the NFL in fantasy points right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that what we're using to determine how good players are these days?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I know it sounds stupid, but fantasy points does kind of sum up a players performance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah i guess you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear ya though, it's tough to repeat a stellar performance like last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly I was just surprised they were good all year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just thought that Freeman would get hurt or something, he's so small."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he is.  I mean Julio cooled off there at the end though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that's true, he cooled off but they were still really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he was on pace to break all kinds of records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he had that one game where he got over 300 receiving yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was insane, that's so many yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At some point, I feel like that's a bad thing though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wouldn't you be a little jealous and annoyed if your qb threw to one guy that much, and not you?"
