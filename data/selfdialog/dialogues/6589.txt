"__STAR_WARS__ My mom's favorite character is Jar Jar binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ ...no it's not!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is. I wouldn't lie about something like this. Guess who her second favorite character is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't dare guess..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han Solo!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, her second choice is better than her first!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm going to have a talk with your mom."
"__STAR_WARS__ Please, your favorite is Boba Fett. You're not much better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. Yes I am."
