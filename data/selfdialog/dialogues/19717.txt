"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I just saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh it's out already?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah man, it came out on May 5th!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you like that genre? The action-comedy stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Usually, some movies I don't care too much for. I just love space movies!"
"__MOVIES__ So you're a Star Wars nerd too?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I can't wait for The Last Jedi to come out!"
"__MOVIES__ When does that one come out?"
"__MOVIES__ It'll be out on December 15, 2017!"
"__MOVIES__ oh cool. Maybe I'll see it, I'm more into thrillers though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so whats your favorite thriller movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Creep and Nocturnal Animals."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, those both sound scary."
"__MOVIES__ They can be, but the genre's not all about being scary"
"__MOVIES__ It's not about horror and gore?"
"__MOVIES__ Very rarely, in my experience, do they have gore."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's nice. What defines a thriller then?"
"__MOVIES__ It's just the suspense and mystery that make your skin crawl."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I actually do love the creepy mysteries now I think about it!"
