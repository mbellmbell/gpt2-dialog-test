"__MUSIC__ Hi there, I need some dance music ideas, what kind of dance songs do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ My music tastes are a little eclectic.  What do you need these for?"
"__MUSIC__ Planning some dance songs for a small party at my house.  Nothing over the top."
"__MUSIC__ Got it.  How about a little Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ A little retro but I like it.  Get people up and dancing to Thriller."
"__MUSIC__ Right.  Then something modern like Adele's Rumor Has It."
"__MUSIC__ I find her a little dramatic.  Could work though."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, so maybe one Adele song - let's keep it mixed.  What about David Bowie's Lets Dance?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  Can't go wrong with Bowie."
"__MUSIC__ No you really can't."
"__MUSIC__ Hey Kylie Minogue is great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah she does a lot of dance music."
"__MUSIC__ Anything fun for the party!"
"__MUSIC__ And then...turn things on its head."
"__MUSIC__ How?"
"__MUSIC__ Do a little rock-abilly for example, its so great to dance to.  Stray Cat Strut, or Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check it out."
"__MUSIC__ And also the original material girl -one of Madonna's songs. Maybe Vogue!"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely!  Any one else?"
"__MUSIC__ Can't leave ouut Lady Gaga!  Maybe Bad Romance."
