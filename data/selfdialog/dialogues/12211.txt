"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My father went to a charity dinner earlier and was kind of bored. He was ready to leave until he saw a man's Giants hat. Then my mother had to drag him away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm guessing he's a Giants fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, a huge one!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does he watch all their games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he does. He even has a regular routine where he always orders pizza for Sunday football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does he do when there are no new Sunday football games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sometimes he watches videos from a DVD he has of the most recent season where the Giants won the SuperBowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a fan of football too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not particularly. By osmosis, I like the Giants and dislike the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny. Any other team preferences?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a soft spot for Seattle, as I once read an article about one of the players and he seemed very intelligent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know the rules of football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not as much as I maybe should, but mostly!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where did you learn them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would make sense if I learned it from the football games I watched while I was in marching band. But I actually learned most of the rules from Eyeshield 21."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the goofy football manga/anime, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right! Anyway, my dad's been trying to teach me more about NFL football recently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? What kinds of things?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A little more about trading and how they determine who makes the Superbowl. I still find the wildcard thing kind of weird."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too!"
