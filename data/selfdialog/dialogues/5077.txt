"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How awesome was it when the cars were dropped out of the plane in Furious7?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was incredible, Rome was the best part though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah when he was freaking out at the edge of the bay door telling them how he couldn't do it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Then Tej hits the button for his chute."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was great hearing him scream the whole way down."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Then he ended up in that tree, I couldn't help but laugh."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How cool would that be to do though?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It would be so much fun, but I'd want to go out face first."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why would you want to do that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Cause then I could floor it off the plane and it would force me into a barrel roll. I just think it'd be even more fun."
