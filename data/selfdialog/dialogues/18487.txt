"__MOVIES__ So, have you seen any movies lately at the dollar theater?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  I just went to see The Circle the other day."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?  I heard it was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was amazing.  I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ So it was supposed to be a thriller, was it scary?"
"__MOVIES__ No, in fact I was laughing a bit and some other people were laughing too.  Tom Hanks did the 'tech pioneer demagogue' thing very well!"
"__MOVIES__ I can see how that would be funny, those guys are entertaining.  How was it not scary though?"
"__MOVIES__ Basically only one tragic thing happened, and the guy who it happened to wasn't a major character."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, so what happened to him?"
"__MOVIES__ He died.  So that was the one tragic thing that happened in the whole movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well.  So we know it had a happy ending because it was a thriller instead of horror, so I guess it was just a good movie in general."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  The 'bad' guys weren't that scary and it had a very good ending."
"__MOVIES__ So what else about that movie?  I think I'm going to try to convince my girlfriend to see it with me since she lives near that theater."
"__MOVIES__ Good idea.  It seems like the movie is about social networking and lack of privacy, and about how that is actually a good thing!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, sort of flies in the face of Snowden."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  They say if you're being watched, then you're going to behave better, and that secrets are lies."
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of like movies are about issues that are going on in society and then they make a statement about it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, or sometimes they base a movie on things that are going on, but it's a bad thing, like Skynet in the Terminator movies."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, but in this case it's a positive thing, they aren't trying to scare people."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and the key is that everyone is watching, not just a bad guy or a pervert who stalks someone."
