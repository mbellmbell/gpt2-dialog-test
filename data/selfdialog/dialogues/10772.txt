"__FASHION__ I was in the bank yesterday, and the woman who helped me was wearing the most amazing shoes."
"__FASHION__ What were they like?"
"__FASHION__ Well, to me they looked like something you'd wear to a dungeon. Black leather, tall heels, open toes, and a belt around your foot."
"__FASHION__ Oh, I've seen those. Like a belt you might see on a motorcycle jacket, with a big buckle."
"__FASHION__ Yes! A big shiny buckle. I wanted those shoes."
"__FASHION__ I think I want them too. But they can't be comfortable to wear to work all day."
"__FASHION__ No, probably not. But the woman I saw didn't care."
"__FASHION__ She probably put her feet up at lunch. Or went barefoot."
"__FASHION__ I'm amazed the bank let her wear those."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, not very corporate. I'd wear mine at night."
"__FASHION__ Well, it depends on your job, of course. Like if you sit all day, you could stand it, and nobody would see them."
"__FASHION__ Then you could dance in them at night."
"__FASHION__ Uhm, they're not really built for dancing, either."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, you might fall and hurt yourself."
"__FASHION__ You're already hurting yourself, just wearing them."
"__FASHION__ Hey, you can't wear running shoes all the time."
"__FASHION__ And heels look so elegant."
"__FASHION__ Sometimes fashion hurts. That's just the way it is."
"__FASHION__ Yeah. Somebody should make shoes that look good and feel good too."
"__FASHION__ That'd be a strange new look."
