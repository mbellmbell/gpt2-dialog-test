"__MOVIES__ Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory was a much better in the old version if you ask me."
"__MOVIES__ Really, how come you think this?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Gene Wilder was a better Wonka I think then Jonny Deppp was in the new one."
"__MOVIES__ I like Johnny Depp, I thought he was good."
"__MOVIES__ I like the older version with those characters."
"__MOVIES__ The new one is just newer."
"__MOVIES__ It was darker then the original."
"__MOVIES__ The original was also scarey."
"__MOVIES__ Scarey and darker seem different."
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ Scarey does not have to always be dark, but dark is just dark even if it is never scarey."
"__MOVIES__ The oompha loomphas were also better in the original."
"__MOVIES__ The characters were just better because they were weird not dark like the new one."
"__MOVIES__ You would never have taken a kid to see the new one."
"__MOVIES__ Unless you were trying to traumitize them."
"__MOVIES__ Solid scaring."
"__MOVIES__ Remember Violet?"
"__MOVIES__ The one that blows up?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup the one who turns into the blueberry gum."
"__MOVIES__ Th.at is what you get for whining"
