"__STAR_WARS__ How did they build that base on Hoth?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it was an old empire outpost."
"__STAR_WARS__ I doubt it. Maybe they mainly used natural caves."
"__STAR_WARS__ That sounds very possible. They just brought a bunch of equipment to the existing caves."
"__STAR_WARS__ It did seem a bit chaotic and disorganized there. Not like an true military base."
"__STAR_WARS__ They probably couldn't have been there that long without being detected."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Empire is always good at detecting things."
"__STAR_WARS__ But not so good in finishing off the resistance."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, they should have been able to crush them easily with the Jedi weakened."
"__STAR_WARS__ But good always wins."
