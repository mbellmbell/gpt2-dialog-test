"__DISNEY__ Hey do you remember the name of the evil woman in Sleeping Beauty?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah of course I do! Her name was Maleficent. You know, I don't think she was all that bad."
"__DISNEY__ Really?!? Why do you say that?"
"__DISNEY__ All she wanted way to be invited to the party they had welcoming the birth of Aurora."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, but when she wasn't invited she placed a curse on the baby. That seems pretty wrong to me."
"__DISNEY__ Well that's a good point. She is capable of turning into a pretty cool dragon though."
"__DISNEY__ Yes that's definitely true. Good thing Prince Phillip was there to help lift the curse on Aurora."
"__DISNEY__ Okay I take it back, Maleficent was pretty evil. I still think if she'd just been invited to Aurora's party none of that would have happened."
"__DISNEY__ Well I think if Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather had done their jobs the curse would never have befallen Aurora!"
"__DISNEY__ That's a lot of blame to cast on the Good Fairies. And it wouldn't have made much of a movie if Sleeping Beauty never went to sleep."
