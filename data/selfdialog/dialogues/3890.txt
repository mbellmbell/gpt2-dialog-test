"__MUSIC__ You've been a professional musician for a while, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of. I have been in the classical music scene my whole life but I teach theory."
"__MUSIC__ Do you go to concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Not as much as I'd like. I want to go to one or two per week, but it ends up being per month."
"__MUSIC__ Who do you usually hear?"
"__MUSIC__ Either student recitals, or the wind symphony."
"__MUSIC__ Ever hear someone really badly mess up?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! These are undergrads, for the most part."
"__MUSIC__ What's the worst mistake you've heard?"
"__MUSIC__ One of my friends had a graduate recital a few years ago. She was interrupted."
"__MUSIC__ Interrupted? Someone stopped it?"
"__MUSIC__ One of her friends brought an infant. It started crying, loudly."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, no. Did she take it out?"
"__MUSIC__ No. She lost her concentration completely."
"__MUSIC__ She stopped, or just messed up as she played it?"
"__MUSIC__ She had to re-start one of the movements since she couldn't remember where she was in the music."
"__MUSIC__ Hope you kicked the family out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wish I did too."
"__MUSIC__ How'd she react to it?"
"__MUSIC__ She finished the movement, then GLARED at the mother. It was funny, in a depressing way."
