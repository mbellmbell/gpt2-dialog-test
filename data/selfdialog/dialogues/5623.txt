"__STAR_WARS__ I love The Force Awakens, but it left me with so many questions?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like who are Rey's parents?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  But I think she's Han and Leia's daughter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too.  What other questions do you have?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The biggest one is 'who is Supreme Leader Snoke'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right!  I wonder who he is too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some fans think he is someone we already met in one of the other films."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  Like who?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, maybe a Jedi gone bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Leia did act like she knew who he was, so that theory makes sense."
