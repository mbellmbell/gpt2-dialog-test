"__STAR_WARS__ So what is a parsec?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In Star Wars, Han said he did the Kestle Run in 12 parsecs?"
"__STAR_WARS__ So?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard that a parsec is a measure of distance not time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh. Maybe since he's going the speed of light it blurs the lines of distance and time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Interesting, but I don't think he's going light speed."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought that's what they 'jumped' to."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll have to look that up."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do."
