"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they will be great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think they will be good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are always good, but I don't think they can win the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They finally got rid of Tony Romo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tony Romo has been overrated his whole career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Romo has been a good quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's always injured!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if the Cowboys had a good offensive he wouldn't get injured."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys have a really good offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then why was Romo always injured?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's because some players are just injury prone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Dak Prescott?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to tell after 1 year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Dak will be a good quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will be good but I need to see another year to really say."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't Dak get in trouble this off season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for using a robot to sign his autograph."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, at least, it wasn't something like drugs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah for a Cowboys player using a robot to sign your autograph is pretty tame."
