"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yo! How are the Ravens looking this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty good, pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm ready for the season to start. It's been too long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know. They need to add two more games, if you ask me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it. Or at least make the playoffs longer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I could dig that too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think an underdog is this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but I think the Falcons are gonna be worse than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, me too, actually. I think the Panthers take that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's exactly what I was thinking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They say Cam's not going to run as much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. He needs to calm down with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He needs to become a pocket passer. That would suit them well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't have any receivers though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. They need someone to step up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know who else looks good? The Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, definitely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're gonna win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't be surprised. Their pick ups this offseason have been nuts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes indeed. Gonna great a great season for them."
