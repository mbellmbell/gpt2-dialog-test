"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I really loved the Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ I loved that one also! I wanted red hair just like Ariel."
"__DISNEY__ It's so weird now that we are adults and some of the things that went on in Disney movies. Ariel totally gave up her home, family and voice to be with a man."
"__DISNEY__ LOL, you are right she completely sold her soul to Ursula for a man she didn't even know."
"__DISNEY__ She didn't know that man at all. To make matters worse he fell in love with her and she couldn't even talk. What kind of shit is that?"
"__DISNEY__ but what about Belle? The beast totally kidnapped her and she fell in love....can you say Stockholm Syndrome"
"__DISNEY__ Can you say bestialty? She definitely kissed a walking lion."
"__DISNEY__ Omigosh, she so fell in love with an animal. No wonder they named the movie 'Beauty and the Beast' or the NSFW version 'Beauty and the Bestiality'"
"__DISNEY__ Gotta love Disney!"
