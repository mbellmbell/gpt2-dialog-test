"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch last year's Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I did. I watch every year, but especially if the Patriots are in it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh then you must have loved this game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, not all of it. The first half and most of the third quarter were a bit frustrating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think I've ever seen a game like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think anyone has. To come back from 25 down in the regular season is nearly impossible, but in the Super Bowl?!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unheard of until this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I think ten points down was the biggest comeback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They even did it all without Gronkowski."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had to. I hope he's healthy this year, and I'm excited that James White is coming back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think the Pats will see a lot more of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I completely agree. They also added some excellent free agents and drafted pretty well too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Belichick always has a way of turning nobodies in to sombodies."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. I mean, Brady was the 199th pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't that amazing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They just have a way of getting these underrated guys and turning them into machines."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder what would've happened if Christian Hackenberg went there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it would've been pointless for him. With Garappolo and Jacoby behind Brady, there's just no need for someone so unproven."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. It probably wouldn't have been a fit for anyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. But then again, if you can learn from Brady wouldn't you take the opportunity?"
