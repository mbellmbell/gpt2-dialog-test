"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team are you rooting for in the upcoming football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a lifelong Denver Broncos fan so I will be rooting for them even though they were mediocre last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember they won the Super Bowl a couple years ago, so what happened to them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton Manning retired and they had an inexperienced quarterback take over named Trevor Siemian."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really shows how much of an impact a quarterback can make on the whole team. Just look at Tom Brady's impact on the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true. I had a feeling they were going to win the Super Bowl even when they were down by 25 points. Tom Brady just never lets his team give up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was an unbelievable Super Bowl. I'm still mad at how Atlanta's offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan blew the game near the end!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now Kyle is coaching the San Francisco 49ers this year. It will be interesting to see how well they do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the 49ers quarterback this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is Brian Hoyer. It's amazing how Colin Kaepernick isn't even playing on any team this year when he used to be quite the player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Players in the NFL definitely have a very short playing career. That's what makes the longevity of Tom Brady particularly amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of that, I can't believe Tony Romo is retiring to be an announcer. I was hoping he would join the Broncos instead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott really had an amazing year out of nowhere last year for the Cowboys. And Dak is a great football name, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is what makes the NFL exciting, teams are always changing and you never know what can happen unlike other sports where the same team dominates for year after year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will also be interesting to see how the Raiders do in Las Vegas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Vegas is a crazy city for having football games. I think the best fans are in cities like Buffalo or Green Bay where there is really no other entertainment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, you do tend to get the most die-hard fans in those type of cities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be funny if they allowed open gambling in the stadium during the Raiders' home games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Surprisingly the Raiders are being considered to have a pretty good chance to win this year's Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Interesting, I did see their quarterback Derek Carr just got a big contract. I hope it is another exciting year in the NFL."
