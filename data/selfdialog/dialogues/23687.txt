"__DISNEY__ You ever see that old Disney movie, The Black Hole?"
"__DISNEY__ Seen it? I haven't even heard of it."
"__DISNEY__ It's OK, kind of cheesy and very un-Disney like."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, who;s in it?"
"__DISNEY__ It starred Maximilian Schell and Anthony Perkins, that dude from Psycho. It's a space movie, and it has couple of corny robots."
"__DISNEY__ Really?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but it isn't all that bad"
"__DISNEY__ Are there any women in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Yvette Mimieux, she was in a  lot of those old SF movies."
"__DISNEY__ OK, Sounds good. I think I will check it out,"
