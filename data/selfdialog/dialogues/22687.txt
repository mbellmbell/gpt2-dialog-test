"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the animated movie Tarzan?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure it is a pretty good one."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know who was the voice of the baby ape Terk?"
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't it Rosie O'donnell?"
"__DISNEY__ I am not sure but whomever it was I think it was my favorite character just because of the voice."
"__DISNEY__ I am not sure I understand, what do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ All of the disney characters seem to have a predictable voice."
"__DISNEY__ Like low and gruff for a villain and high and melodious for a heroine?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes but Terk's voice was gravelly and hit the punch lines with just the right tone that it sunk in for me."
"__DISNEY__ I will have to rewatch it so I can hear what you are talking about."
