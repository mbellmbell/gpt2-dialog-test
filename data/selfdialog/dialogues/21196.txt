"__THRILLER__ I recently watched an older thriller movie from the early '90's with Michael Keaton called Pacific Heights. Have you ever heard of it?"
"__THRILLER__ I don't think I have. What's the movie about?"
"__THRILLER__ Michael Keaton plays a very slick conman who rents out an apartment in the Pacific Heights area and is basically the worst tenant ever. He makes the landlord, who are engaged couple, lives miserable."
"__THRILLER__ Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like it would be that great of a movie. How is Michael Keaton at playing the villain?"
"__THRILLER__ Honestly, I think the movie is okay, but definitely nothing special. As far as Keaton, he was okay."
"__THRILLER__ Are there plot twists or any thing crazy go down at all?"
"__THRILLER__ No, not really. The whole idea is learning just how much of a con artist his character really is."
"__THRILLER__ I may consider checking that movie out, because I am a big fan of Michael Keaton."
"__THRILLER__ I wouldn't say Pacific Heights is great, by any means. But it's not awful, either."
"__THRILLER__ I'll have to give that one a watch one of these days and decide for myself then!"
