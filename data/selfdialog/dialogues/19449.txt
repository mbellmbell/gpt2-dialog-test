"__MOVIES__ What your favorite snack for the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I stick with the standard popcorn usually."
"__MOVIES__ That is so boring."
"__MOVIES__ I said usually. It depends on the movie I'm going to see."
"__MOVIES__ What does that have to do with your snack choices?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it depends on what I expect from my movie experience, how interactive I'm gonna get."
"__MOVIES__ Interactive...do I even want to know?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh come on, I just mean how much I'm going to be moving around."
"__MOVIES__ That is still not a good enough answer."
"__MOVIES__ Well for example if it's a scary movie I don't want to waste a lot of money on other treats in case I start jumping in my seat. You were there with me at Freddy vs. Jason."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you did get a little...animated."
"__MOVIES__ Hey to be fair when Jason just pops up after someone kills him, you jump or you die."
"__MOVIES__ This is why I don't go with you to movies anymore, but anyway what a bout a comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a tricky one sometimes, if it's a movie I know I'm gonna be laughing a lot at I stick to quick swallow snacks like m&ms."
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure you're overthinking this whole thing."
"__MOVIES__ Well don't come crying to me after you choke on a Jujube cause you started laughing."
"__MOVIES__ At least I'd die with a smile on my face and a mouth full of greatness."
"__MOVIES__ True there are worse ways to go, but I choose not to tempt fate; I've seen all the Final Destination movies."
"__MOVIES__ By all means, lets not tempt the gods. Next time we go I'll just stick with Snow Caps."
"__MOVIES__ Dude, don't even joke like that. Those are one of the deadliest candies to get at the wrong movie."
