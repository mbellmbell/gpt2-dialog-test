"__BEATLES__ Hey, I saw an old rerun of the Dick Caat show on YouTube."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah? Who was he interviewing?"
"__BEATLES__ George Harrison of the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Nice. What was he like?"
"__BEATLES__ Not like anything I imagined."
"__BEATLES__ What did you imagine?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know. Some pompous, arrogant pop star who was self-centered and ignorant."
"__BEATLES__ And what was he like?"
"__BEATLES__ He was a nice guy. A bit shy and quirky, but he didn't seem like a jerk."
"__BEATLES__ A rare animal in the music industry! For sure!"
