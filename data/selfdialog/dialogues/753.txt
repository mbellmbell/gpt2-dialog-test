"__MUSIC__ My favorite hip hop album of all time is Illmatic by Nas. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Illmatic is at the top of my list too, bit there are a few others as close competition. Criminal Minded by Boogie Down Productions, for example."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah. That's a good one. So lo-tech and gritty. And it introduced KRS-ONE to the world."
"__MUSIC__ And let's not forget the production of Scott LaRock. There's really no album that has the same sound as Criminal Minded."
"__MUSIC__ And of course it's also got one of the greatest diss track of All Time. 'The Bridge Is Over.'"
"__MUSIC__ And 'South Bronx' too! Two diss tracks. Poor MC Shan."
"__MUSIC__ I always though that KRS-ONE's later albums suffered a lot from the loss of Scott La Rock."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the production was just never quite there. He had it as an MC, but his beats were a bit lacking except for the occasional classic like 'Love's Gonna Get Ya.'"
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. It wasn't until Return of the Boom Bap with DJ Premier that I think he really had another totally solid album."
"__MUSIC__ And DJ Premier did some of the best beats on Illmatic! It all comes full circle."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the story about the vocal track for 'NY State of Mind' on Illmatic?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that the first verse is Nas's first take. Crazy."
"__MUSIC__ He even says, 'I don't know how to start this...' right before he goes into his first verse and kills it."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to the demo for Illmatic? Pretty interesting listen."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you can really see how the Large Professor's mentorship helped Nas."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. He helped him craft his lyrics. Taught him how to edit and to never be satisfied until the lyrics were 100% there."
"__MUSIC__ And I think that's a big reason Nas is one of the all time great MCs."
"__MUSIC__ He has always put so much time and effort into his lyrics, unlike some of these wack MCs on the radio today."
"__MUSIC__ And don't forget Large Professor's production contributions too. He had some of the hottest beats on Illmatic."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. Using 'Human Nature' as the basis for 'Aint' Hard to Tell' was genius."
