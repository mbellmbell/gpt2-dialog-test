"__MUSIC__ We're looking for music to play during the school assembly. Do you have any suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ What kind of assembly is it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a high school pep rally. So it's got to be civil and also get people excited."
"__MUSIC__ Well, are there any options so far?"
"__MUSIC__ We can use anything that's in the school's library. It's pretty extensive though."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Well, probably pop or rock would be best, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I don't think I can get away with classical, and EDM might be too much."
"__MUSIC__ What about, like, Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a good option. Do you have any idea what songs we could pick?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really all that familiar with pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Okay, I'll write it down. What about rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe go for something on the classic end? Rolling Stones or Aerosmith or something."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Either of those could work. I bet Aerosmith would go over well with the kids."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, why don't you just ask the school band?"
"__MUSIC__ Like the marching band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Don't they usually play for events like this."
"__MUSIC__ Do they? I had no idea."
"__MUSIC__ You should find out and ask."
"__MUSIC__ I hope they can do it!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure it'd make things easier."
