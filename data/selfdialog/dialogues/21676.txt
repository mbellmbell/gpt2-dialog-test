"__DISNEY__ Do you think there will ever be a Toy Story 4?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't heard of that, but it might be a good idea."
"__DISNEY__ The Disney Toy Story movies are my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I think Toy Story 3 was better than the first 2."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, each Toy Story movie seems to be better than the last.  That doesn't happen often with sequels."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite part of of the movie was the Barbie & Ken characters."
"__DISNEY__ I know, that was hilarious!  I had that same barbie doll as a child."
