"__COMEDY__ How was your weekend?  Did you do anything interesting."
"__COMEDY__ Since it rained all weekend, I bought myself a bottle of wine a watched a romantic comedy movie marathon."
"__COMEDY__ Sounds fun.  What did you watch?"
"__COMEDY__ I watched Bridget Jones Diary, Four Weddings and a Funeral, My Best Friend's Wedding, and Love Actually."
"__COMEDY__ I love romantic comedies from the 1990's - especially British RomComss.  Hugh Grant is great."
"__COMEDY__ I think that I can basically quote Four Weddings and a Funeral line by line.  You should also watch About a Boy if you have not seen it."
"__COMEDY__ LOL.  About a Boy is actually in my queue for the next rainy day.  Do you have any other suggestions?"
"__COMEDY__ If it does not need to be a British film, I would recommend Dogma and, my all time favorite - The Princess Bride."
"__COMEDY__ Both of those are great!  I love Dogma.  Princess Bride is a classic!  'My name is Inigo Montoya!  You killed my father!  Prepare to Die!"
"__COMEDY__ LOL.  Makes me laugh just thinking about.  I cant believe that movie is about 30 years old."
