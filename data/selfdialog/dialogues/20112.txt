"__MOVIES__ I just re-watched an animated film I liked a lot as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ What was that?"
"__MOVIES__ The Secret of NIMH. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I only saw it a couple years ago."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay but there were a lot of major changes from the book."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I never read the book."
"__MOVIES__ So you know how in the film Nicodemus is a wise old rat wizard?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he was always my favorite character."
"__MOVIES__ In the book he's not a wizard at all, just a wise old rat."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Who gives Mrs. Brisby the magical amulet then?"
"__MOVIES__ There's no amulet at all in the book. There's no magic, just technology."
"__MOVIES__ That's very surprising!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not saying the movie is bad though. I just didn't think it was a good adaptation of the book."
"__MOVIES__ Were there any other big differences?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Jenner isn't a villain in the book, so much as just a dissenter. Also, Jeremy isn't quite as goofy."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of Jeremy, did you ever watch An American Tail or Fievel goes West as a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I liked both of those a lot."
"__MOVIES__ The same voice actor who played Tiger the cat was also Jeremy in Secret of NIMH."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny that he's the goofy big animal sidekick in both films."
