"__MUSIC__ My alarm was set to wake me up with Led Zeppelin today. I'm feeling pretty craaaaaazy now."
"__MUSIC__ I can tell. What-- Um-- What is up with those pants?"
"__MUSIC__ They're my ROCK PANTS BAY BAY!! I use them to climb the STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN!"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, but they are mostly skin I think, There's not much, what is that? Naugahyde? There's not much Naugahyde to them. Are you sure you aren't Lil Kim?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm. I do love a good Magic Stick. I might rethink my alarm music moving forward."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, just stay away from the plastic surgeons. And the plastic pants, too. Just Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever, are you ready for Ryan's party this weekend? I heard your manlover Sean is DJing."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Oh god he has the best neo soul collection. I swoon."
"__MUSIC__ Neo gag me. Wait, is what The Weeknd is? Also, who stole his fourth 'e'?"
"__MUSIC__ No, Weeknd is more like, get your groove on music."
"__MUSIC__ Get your groove on? How old are you? 107?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not the one listening to Led Zeppelin to start my day. Did you have any Fiber One with that? Mmmmm yum."
"__MUSIC__ I'm just saying. All Weeknd does is sing about getting high. And excessive drug use does not a good lover make."
"__MUSIC__ True, true. What are you wearing to Ryan's? It has to be danceable if Sean is spinning. You'll be hating life if you wear those *shudder* Naugahyde pants. Can you even sit down in those? Won't they break?"
"__MUSIC__ Sit? I can do some sick hair metal karate style dance moves. High kicks! Heh! See?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I saw. More than I should have seen. Maybe get a wax before the party okay? Or just wear different pants."
"__MUSIC__ You're so boring. Even Led Zeppelin couldn't wake me up from you."
"__MUSIC__ Watch out before you find yourself on that Stairway to Heaven."
"__MUSIC__ Heh. So wait. That song is about dying?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think it's about shopping. You know how the top six floors at the Galleria are all Nordstrom? It's like, the express escalators that go there. Pretty sure that's what he means."
