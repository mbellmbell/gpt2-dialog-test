"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the newest Star Wars yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen any of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ You're joking, right? Everyone has."
"__MOVIES__ I have not. Never been interested in them."
"__MOVIES__ How? They are iconic."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. I remember trying to watch the one with the red and black face bad guy, and got bored right away."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Darth Maul. You need to start from the beginning to appreciate the series."
"__MOVIES__ Its too complicated. They're not titled in chronological order."
"__MOVIES__ Thats because they aren't released that way!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't get it and its too much of a hassle."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, we're going to watch one together."
"__MOVIES__ If we do, lets pick a new one because I don't like movies with bad acting or effects."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, we'll pick the newest one."
"__MOVIES__ That's The Force Awakens or something, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and a newer one comes out at the end of the year."
"__MOVIES__ I see. If I like the force, lets go see that one."
"__MOVIES__ Its not a matter of if, you will 100% like it."
"__MOVIES__ We'll see."
"__MOVIES__ You won't understand much if you don't see the older ones."
"__MOVIES__ That's fine with me"
