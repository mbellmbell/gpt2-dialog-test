"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the Star Wars prequel movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, for the most part."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one was your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked The Phantom Menace, primarily for the epic duel between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was pretty cool. Probably the best duel of any of the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. Which prequel did you like the best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked Revenge of the Sith. It upped the visual effects ante, and we got to see two epic duels between Sidious/Yoda and Vader/Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was my second favorite. Those duels I would place in the top 10."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the way they showed Vader's transformation to the dark side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I thought that it was rushed, and the actor didn't do a great job with the material."
