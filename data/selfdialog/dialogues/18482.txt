"__MOVIES__ Tonight is movie night at my house.  Any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, do you have HBO by any chance?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I do."
"__MOVIES__ Well in that case, I'd recommend a movie called The Wizard of Lies."
"__MOVIES__ Remind me what that one is about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie about Bernie Madoff.  Starring Robert De Niro."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes!  I've seen a lot of ads and random articles about it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was a pretty good movie."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well as you'd expect, it was very well acted.  De Niro steals the show I thought."
"__MOVIES__ I figured he'd be great in it.  De Niro is a ridiculously versatile actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he can do comedy and drama equally well now.  He's awesome."
"__MOVIES__ So is the movie a biopic about Madoff?"
"__MOVIES__ Well not really.  There are aspects of his entire life, but it mostly focuses on his later years when the fraud was revealed."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok, interesting.  I really like these movies HBO comes out with."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree.  There political movies in the past have been really good too."
"__MOVIES__ So besides De Niro, who else was good in this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Michelle Pfeiffer, for sure.  She was amazing as Madoff's wife."
"__MOVIES__ Oh she's a terrific actress as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I thought she really did a good job portraying Ruth Madoff as a sympathetic type figure."
