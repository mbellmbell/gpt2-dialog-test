"__STAR_WARS__ What about the prequels, which one was your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess the 3rd one; I forgot what it's called."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why that one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because it was dark and had some tense moments."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was wrong with the other 2 prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Come on seriously. What about the slap stick comedy with Jar Jar and what not."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but I think it was because they were targeting kids to become fans."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but still, kids can appreciate a Star Wars movie without all of the silliness."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that's true; I think that's what appealed about the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep absolutely!"
