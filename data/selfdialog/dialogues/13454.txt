"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you going to watch much football this upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, my favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are a great team with good young talent"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott are definite offensive stars"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Cowboys have a good shot of winning the NFC East and making a Superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the NFC East is weak outside of the Cowboys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win the AFC this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I expect the New England Patriots will win it again this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they are definite contenders but Tom Brady is getting older"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady may be getting older but the team around him is still elite"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right, Rob Gronkowski will be back and hopefully remain healthy for a whole season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Gronkowski being healthy, I cannot see the Patriot's offense being stopped"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right, teams would have to put the majority of the focus on him which would open up other receivers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the best chance defenses would have would be to rush Brady so that he does not have much time to throw at all"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A good pass rushing defense that could challenge is the Houston Texans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, JJ Watt gets a lot of sacks and tipped passes"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully JJ Watt recovers from last year's injury and is back to his elite form"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even if he isn't, the Texans also have Jadeveon Clowney who can also get sacks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I remember when Jedeveon Clowney was picked number one overall"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a definite game changer and defensive force"
