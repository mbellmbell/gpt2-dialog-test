"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Who is your favorite Fast & Furious actor?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Paul Walker. I love his character of Brian O'Connor. From good guy, to bad guy...back to good again."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Then back to bad. I adore Ludarcis' character. He's so funny!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He and Tyrese Gibbs are awesome. The way their two characters are always fighting, yet they are there for each other always."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I have to admit that Jason Statham's addition to the franchise made things easy on the eyes."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I loved the way he and Hobbs met. Even though he is a bad guy, I love Deckard Shaw."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That accent! The way he fights, the way he always is one step ahead of Dom and his team."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Even when he is put in maximum security, he is still one step ahead of Hobbs."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was so sure that Elana and Hobbs were going to end up together, instead of her and Dom."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was too. But, she and Dom made a striking couple for a little while."
