"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the extra-inning game between the Cubs and Yankees last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ I fell asleep in the 14th inning, what happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees ended up winning in the 18th, I think it was past 1 a.m. local time"
"__BASEBALL__ Jeez, so the Cubs got swept at home?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and they're not even in first place anymore..."
"__BASEBALL__ Who is? The Cardinals?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Reds actually. But everyone is jumbled up within a few games of the lead."
"__BASEBALL__ Cubs were about 10 games up at this point last year? They must have the World Series hangover."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, didn't they start like 25-10 or something? This year they're barely .500"
"__BASEBALL__ They only went 1-5 against Red Sox and Yankees over the past week or so."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, doesn't look good if they end up meeting those teams in October"
"__BASEBALL__ Yankees are playing really well though. I think they are something like 20-9, with one of the best records in baseball"
"__BASEBALL__ How are your Diamondbacks doing?"
"__BASEBALL__ They lost 2 of 3 to Colorado in Denver over the weekend, still in second place but now 2 and a half games back"
"__BASEBALL__ That division is all upside down this year. The Giants are way under .500"
"__BASEBALL__ They're in last place and look absolutely dreadful. They're the reason the Reds are in first."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they got swept in Cincinnati. And the Dodgers have been so-so. Although we knew the Padres would stink."
"__BASEBALL__ If D-backs can find some pitching they can win the division. Not sold on Rockies yet"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they're bats go silent outside Denver usually"
"__BASEBALL__ They host the Cubs tonight for a series"
