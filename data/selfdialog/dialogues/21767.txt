"__DISNEY__ I really want to watch Wall-E again."
"__DISNEY__ Why?"
"__DISNEY__ I remember that it had a big emotional impact on me, but I don't remember too much of the plot."
"__DISNEY__ I love Wall-E--it had two settings."
"__DISNEY__ The 'dump' where Wall-E lived was one, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep--the other was a spaceship full of humans."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah! The people couldn't move on their own--let's hope that's not prophetic!"
"__DISNEY__ I know, right?"
"__DISNEY__ I also remeber there was a romance..."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, with Eva! How could you forget her?"
