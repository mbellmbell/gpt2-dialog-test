"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who is the best QB in the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, tough decision.  Tons of good ones to choose from."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You must have a favorite though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'll have to go with Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I said best though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know you did.  I'd still go with Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy is like 40 years old now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he's still winning Super Bowls.  He would have been MVP last year if he had played all year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not saying he's not a great QB, but not sure he'd be my pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright then, who would you take?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would probably go with Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could make an argument for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really need to make an argument.  He's probably the most talented QB in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His arm strength and accuracy is good no doubt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He basically beat the Cowboys on his own."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If that's the condition you use, why not go Brady though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because Brady's talent seems to be mostly in his head, not his body."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a really dumb argument."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All I'm saying is if I'm choosing a QB, I'll go with Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And me Brady."
