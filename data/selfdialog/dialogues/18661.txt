"__MOVIES__ What is your take on the whole revamp of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ The sort of not exactly sequels you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Like the new Jurassic Park films."
"__MOVIES__ I am on the fence, what do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I think there are too many, but I like some of them."
"__MOVIES__ I like the new Jurasic park. It does not pretend the old films did not happen."
"__MOVIES__ Like a sort of continuation. But not exactly"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Maybe like the new Han Solo film."
"__MOVIES__ That looks like it will be dumb."
"__MOVIES__ Never the less, people will go see it."
"__MOVIES__ I like when the remakes pay homage to the old one."
"__MOVIES__ Like Days of Future Past?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of, but then they just erased the whole plot of the old ones."
"__MOVIES__ But it did move the story on ."
"__MOVIES__ Some of these not really sequels are just too much. Did you see the remake of Dirty Dancing?"
"__MOVIES__ It was actual garbage. Not even fit to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder why they remake so many movies like that."
"__MOVIES__ I do not know. It was worse than the last remake of that film"
"__MOVIES__ There was a last one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Dirty Dancing, Havana Nights. Not great."
