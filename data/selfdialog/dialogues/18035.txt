"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see the King Auther?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think I wait for it to come out at Redbox."
"__MOVIES__ Not that interested, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Just don't want to get burned at the boxoffice."
"__MOVIES__ I know. It always seems to be a little risky these days."
"__MOVIES__ Are you going to go see it."
"__MOVIES__ I am. I'm a bit of a nut for Arturian legend."
"__MOVIES__ There are a lot of great stories on the subject."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the one with Clive Owen."
"__MOVIES__ No. What was that like."
"__MOVIES__ It was a little different."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for starters it was set in a time when Rome was leaving Great Britain."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's different."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Auther was like a soldier for the Roman Empire, as well as his knights."
"__MOVIES__ Weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he gets set up as King at the end."
"__MOVIES__ I might have to check that out."
"__MOVIES__ I'd reccomend it."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. Thanks!"
