"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite force ability throughout the Star Wars series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say my favorite is the electricity ability that Senator Palpatine uses."
"__STAR_WARS__ Mine is the sheer power of moving things that Count Dooku has."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, its pretty impressive that he was able to move things easier than Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't even believe Annakin managed to kill Count Dooku."
"__STAR_WARS__ Annakin made it look easy too, I don't think he would have killed him if Senator Palpatine didn't order him to."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably, the senator was always trying to play with Annakins conscience."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll bet that if Annakin never knew Senator Palpatine, he wouldn't have joined the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh for sure, especially since Senator Palpatine told him Sith powers could save his wife from dying."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's really horrible how they played on his love for Padamane."
