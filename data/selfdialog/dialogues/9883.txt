"__COMEDY__ Have you seen any good comedy movies lately?"
"__COMEDY__ This year? No. I did see that new Ghostbusters movie, but I don't recommend it."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yeah? Why not?"
"__COMEDY__ In my opinion they butchered the franchise. It's literally a gender bend of the original film but much worse."
"__COMEDY__ If it's just a gender sawp how could they of made it worse?"
"__COMEDY__ Well for one it's overly charged with feminist undertones. Every singe guy in the film is portrayed as a total moron."
"__COMEDY__ Well how is the comedy aspect of the film? Was there nothing funny about the movie at all?"
"__COMEDY__ It had one or two funny points but it really didn't save the movie at all."
"__COMEDY__ It sounds like a movie I might watch when it airs on netflix or something."
"__COMEDY__ I wouldn't waste your time honestly. If you liked the original you will hate this."
