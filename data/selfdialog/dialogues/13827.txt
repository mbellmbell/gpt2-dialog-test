"__BASKETBALL__ Hey User 2 have you been watching the NBA playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No. I've only heard a couple of things here and there. What are the standings?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Currently on the west coast Golden State are ahead of the Spurs 3 to zero game wise."
"__BASKETBALL__ What about on the east coast?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Celtics and the Cavaliers are playing but the Cavaliers are ahead in 2 to 0."
"__BASKETBALL__ Looks like it's going to be Golden State VS The Cavaliers in the finals then."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is what I'm thinking too but I'd like it if the Celtics made it to the finals instead of the Cavaliers."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'd like to see the Spurs make it personally."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I'm kind of sick of seeing the same old teams make it to the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, I agree it gets pretty stale if you look at it like that. It makes you wonder what other teams are missing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Honestly? I think it comes down to work ethic and competitive spirit. I just think the bottom teams are lazy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Really? I think it comes down to having start players and proper coaching staff."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can see why you'd think that but it just limits teams that don't have those things. I feelt if you work hard enough you can beat top talent."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't agree, I mean sure you can put in a large amount of effort and get better but to beat the real professionals takes more."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's what I mean. If you work hard enough in time you will become a start talent yourself and beat others."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true I honestly didn't think about it like that but you are correct."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's why I feel the bottom teams are just lazy, they don't want to win they just want to play."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not sure if I was a player I'd just be fine with playing. I'd want to win too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Say that when your playing professional basket ball for millions of dollars a year."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. I guess even if I lost the games I'd still win in the bank department."
