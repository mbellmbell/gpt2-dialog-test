"__MOVIES__ Okay, so, which Steven Spielberg movie is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Are we just talking about movies he directed, or anything he was involved in?"
"__MOVIES__ Either way, just tell me your favorite. Mine is War of the Worlds?"
"__MOVIES__ That's your favorite? Weird; mine is Indiana Jones, the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so, what do you think his best movie is?"
"__MOVIES__ That's easy. Schindler's List, no question about it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, see, I would say Saving Private Ryan."
"__MOVIES__ They're both good films, but I think Ryan is more of a standard war film, while Schindler is just a better film."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if you want a non-standard war film try 1941. Now that's an underrated movie."
"__MOVIES__ If we're talking about underrated Spielberg films, then the most underrated has to go to The Terminal."
"__MOVIES__ No, no way. Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can are both better than it."
"__MOVIES__ Agree to disagree. What do you think is his worst movie though?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he has produced all of the Transformers films."
"__MOVIES__ Worst movie he directed then."
"__MOVIES__ That's easy, it's gotta be Hook. It's such a weird movie; doesn't know what it wants to be."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it's got Robin Williams as Peter Pan! How can you not like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Robin Williams has been in his share of bad films, God rest his soul. Fern Gully, anyone?"
"__MOVIES__ That's just a voice role. Besides, he made up for it by being the Genie in Aladdin."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'll give him that. He was also the best portrayal of Popeye, hands down."
"__MOVIES__ Now speaking of underrated films, there's an underrated film!"
