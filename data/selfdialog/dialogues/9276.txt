"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Giants extra inning game the other night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, 17 innings, unbelievable!"
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe, the Giants will get going now--it's been a rough start to the season."
"__BASEBALL__ What are they something like 12 and 24?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think so--they are so bad I don't even look at the standings anymore."
"__BASEBALL__ I know I don't even know who is ahead in the division.  It's usually the Dodgers, but I don't think so this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe Arizona, I'm not sure either."
"__BASEBALL__ It could be the Padres or Rockies as far as I know."
"__BASEBALL__ Anyway, back to the extra inning game--Posey winning it with a homer, that was something."
"__BASEBALL__ He was so tired after catching all those innings, he was more relieved than joyful."
"__BASEBALL__ And I can't believe the Giants relievers held the Reds down for all those innings."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeh, the pitching has been pretty bad all season and with Bumgarner out it is even worse."
"__BASEBALL__ But he hasn't even won a game this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Well he was pitching fine--not his fault we can't hit either."
"__BASEBALL__ We've gotten it going lately, some hitting, and I think we've won 6 out of seven games."
"__BASEBALL__ Something like that--won the Reds and Dodgers series, but now we're on the road."
"__BASEBALL__ Where are they going?"
"__BASEBALL__ Chicago for one I think--Krukow and Keiper were talking about Wrigley Field being remodeled and complaining about the fact that it will be awhile before the announcers' booth is worked on."
"__BASEBALL__ Those guys are entertaining."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I hope we can keep it going on the road."
