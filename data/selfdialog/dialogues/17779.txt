"__MOVIES__ Are you a Mel Brooks fan?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say so.  I mean, not every movie of his is my favorite, but he definitely made some classics."
"__MOVIES__ Sure did.  I don't think anyone would argue that Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein aren't brilliant."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely, those are two of the best.  No matter how many times I watch them, they make me laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you can't beat the casts in both of them.  Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, they're all great."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the best.  I love Harvey Korman, too.  I thought he was so terrific in Blazing Saddles."
"__MOVIES__ I also liked him a lot in High Anxiety."
"__MOVIES__ Yup, me too.  I'd consider that one of the less appreciated of Mel's movies.  It's always been one of my favorites though."
"__MOVIES__ I think if you don't know Hitchcock movies very well, you might not like it as much."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Mel Brooks told a story on some talk show once about showing it to Hitchcock and he liked it a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Did he? That's so cool. Figures he would have good taste."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. How about Silent Movie? Have you seen that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. Now that's one that nobody talks about. And you hardly ever see it anywhere."
"__MOVIES__ So true. Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein come up all the time. And rightly so. But Silent Movie definitely gets short shrift."
"__MOVIES__ It's funny, when I saw that, I was pretty young and I really didn't think I would like it because it actually was a silent movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, except for the music."
"__MOVIES__ Right, music and sound effects here and there. But I was pretty prejudiced against it going in and surprisingly--or not surprisingly given that it's Mel Brooks--I really had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I loved the cameos of the celebrities. You know, Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli and James Caan all playing themselves. It was a great sendup of Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ It sure was. I would put it in the same category as my other Mel Brooks favorites. In fact, talking about it makes me wanna see it again."
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking the same thing. We should find some Mel Brooks fans who've never seen it because they'd probably really get a kick out of it."
