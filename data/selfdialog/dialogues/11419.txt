"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Las Vegas getting an NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's completely ridiculous. It should be put elsewhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that area already has the Cardinals, 49ers, and Rams, who JUST moved there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overkill?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the city in general? Could it support a team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easily, surprisingly.  There's always a ton of tourists year-round so I doubt they'd have trouble filling seats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think it'll affect the nearby markets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they will be fine. Football fans don't just change allegiances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So where would you put a new team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any of the following: Oklahoma City, Little Rock, Des Moines, or Santa Fe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why those?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're kind of in the middle of nowhere but far enough away from the Cowboys, Chiefs, and Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the population will support it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course! If college sports are big there, the NFL will be too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a different idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Shut down some teams and re-purpose the stadiums."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NO, no no no."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, just kidding. The NFL will succeed anywhere."
