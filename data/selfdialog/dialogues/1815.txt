"__MUSIC__ Do you remember the name of those two guys that were caught lip syncing and they had won a Grammy?"
"__MUSIC__ Are you talking about Milli Vanilli?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, those guys, they were super cute."
"__MUSIC__ Let me think what were their names. Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus I am pretty sure that's their names."
"__MUSIC__ Rob and Fab, yeah do you know what ever happened to them?"
"__MUSIC__ I am not sure I remember reading Fab Morvan was in Los Angeles still working on music but that was a few years back."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's good he is still in music."
"__MUSIC__ I think Rob Pilatus was found dead at 32 in a Frankfurt hotel room."
"__MUSIC__ What did he die of."
"__MUSIC__ I am not sure, I think a combination of alcohol and prescription pills."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a shame because they really could sing couldn't they."
"__MUSIC__ I think they tried to prove to the world they could really sing."
"__MUSIC__ I heard there were different singers for different song. The manager didn't just use two different voices but several people."
"__MUSIC__ I think it was a scam that Rob and Fab got caught up in and it just went too far."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the good thing is back then a lot of people were lip syncing there songs."
"__MUSIC__ I know I would hate to pay for a concert ticket and the singer wasn't really singing."
