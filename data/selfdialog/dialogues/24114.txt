"__SUPERHERO__ Did you see Batman Vs. Superman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, but I heard it was awful."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh my god, it was.  I can't believe they released a movie like that."
"__SUPERHERO__ What was so bad about it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, for one, the plot was a mess.  It made no sense, was impossible to follow, and had just ridiculous moments."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, it was a superhero movie, so shouldn't it be a little ridiculous?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, but in a good way.  This was just silly.  Also, Ben Affleck is a terrible batman.  And the batsuit looked like a suit of armor - there's no way someone could jump from buildings in that."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh wow, that does sound awful.  Should I see it just to laugh at it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, I wouldn't suggest it.  It's frustrating more than anything.  After Chris Nolan's Dark Knight series, this is just a letdown."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ah well, hopefully they'll get it right next time."
