"__STAR_WARS__ I've always had trouble with the Star Wars timeline."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's really not that complicated."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well the release screws me up, I just want to watch straight through the story."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok it's easy, for the story line just watch 1-3,Rogue one, 4-6, Force awakens, and finish with the latest movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whoa it's so simple...how could I have missed it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ When in doubt, go with release date."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just like being able to binge watch without having to keep notes about which side I'm on."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're putting too much thought into it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Says the guy that has four different copies of each movie for each order to watch them in."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't blame me that my hardest decision about which one to watch next is, 'how late can I be to work tomorrow?'"
