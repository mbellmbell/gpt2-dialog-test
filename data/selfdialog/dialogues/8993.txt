"__BEATLES__ Who's your favorite Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, that's a tough question to answer."
"__BEATLES__ Why is that?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, they were kind of unlikable in a lot of ways."
"__BEATLES__ Really - how so?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, John Lennon was a notorious nutjob. He even beat his wife!"
"__BEATLES__ No way - really?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, and Paul is very difficult to work with."
"__BEATLES__ That's a shame, I always liked Sir Paul."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah - maybe he's changed. I guess my favorite would be Ringo!"
