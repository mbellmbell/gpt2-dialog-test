"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite classic Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean like old school, like Alice in Wonderland?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I actually tried to watch the original of that movie, it was really odd."
"__DISNEY__ Did you see the remake of it with Johnny Depp?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I did, I thought that version was odd too."
"__DISNEY__ Me too.  I guess one of my favorites was Mary Poppins."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I did really like that movie."
"__DISNEY__ I liked the movie as a kid and still like watching it today."
"__DISNEY__ For sure, and the songs can really get stuck in your head."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I find myself humming 'just a spoonful of sugar' quite a bit."
