"__DISNEY__ Have you seen all of the Cars movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw the first one and the second one but I don't think I will see the third."
"__DISNEY__ Why don't you think you will see it?"
"__DISNEY__ I really wasn't that impressed with the second one.  I didn't like it at all."
"__DISNEY__ The first one was pretty good.  The spy storyline in the second one was a little bit far fetched for me."
"__DISNEY__ The trailer for the third movie looked pretty intense though.  I heard it scared a bunch of kids."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah it only shows Lightning McQueen crashing and that's it."
"__DISNEY__ I think they are bringing back most of the characters from the first one  though."
"__DISNEY__ I know they are bringing back Doc, which should be interesting."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that it will be about Lightning getting older and trying to compete with younger cars."
