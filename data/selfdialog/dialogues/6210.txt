"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of the latest Star Wars Movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked it, how do you think the next one will be?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I really hope it turns out better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea me too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Personally I thought the last one that came out was a little week."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because they didn't really explain things all that well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Isn't that what they're suppose to do? Make you wonder?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more than what the ending gave."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea that would have been nice."
