"__DISNEY__ Are you gonna watch the new Star Wars movie that comes out later this year?"
"__DISNEY__ They have another one coming out so soon?"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, they are putting one out each year - usually around December I think."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure if I'll see anymore."
"__DISNEY__ Why not?"
"__DISNEY__ I didn't really like the idea of them killing off Han Solo."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, neither did out but it did make for a good surprise."
"__DISNEY__ Still not sure about seeing the others."
"__DISNEY__ Will you go if I buy your ticket?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course, I'll watch just about anything for free!"
