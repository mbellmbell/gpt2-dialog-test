"__SUPERHERO__ Do you prefer the first Catwoman or the second Catwoman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ You mean Michelle Pfeiffer or Halle Berry?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes which one do you prefer the most?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh definitely Michelle Pfeiffer. You would think Halle Berry couldn't act watching that movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's true and Sharon Stone did a terrible job too compared to how she usually does."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right, and they really veered from the storyline in the Halle Berry Catwoman movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes a lot of it didn't make sense. So she was basically battling an evil face cream."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes they could have done better than that. They were really reaching."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. But at least they had a Black woman in a standalone superhero movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right that is a good point. And she did good as Storm so that redeemed her."
