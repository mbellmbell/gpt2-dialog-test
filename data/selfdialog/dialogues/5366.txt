"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think episode 5 is the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I think episode 3 is the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, 3 is good but I don't like the older movies because of the visual effects."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well sure the effects aren't as good but the plot is way better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well in Episode 5 the plot and the effects are good."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, plus Luke makes a better protagonist than Anniken"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly! Aniken kind of sucked as a protagonist. He's a better villian."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader is pretty cool. It's a shame he actually dies in the sixth episode."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, maybe he'll make a comback for revenge."
