"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you know Lady Gaga is touring again?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes! I am so excited. I've always wanted to see her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You got tickets for her show?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, I was able to get tickets for the Philadelphia show."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's awesome. I love her dance music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like that, but I actually really like her new stuff even better."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I guess I haven't heard much of it. Is it a lot different?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, it is still pop music, but it is much less electronic."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's probably a nice change."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It is because you can really hear her talent because her voice doesn't sound like it is as manipulated."
