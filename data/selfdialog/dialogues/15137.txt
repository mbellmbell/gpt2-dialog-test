"__ACTION__ Do you like action movies with a love story built in."
"__ACTION__ I think most action films have one."
"__ACTION__ Like what?"
"__ACTION__ Well, all of them usually. Even Rambo."
"__ACTION__ Wow, I just noticed it does."
"__ACTION__ Yep. All the Rambo movies had lots of guns and a bit of love too."
"__ACTION__ I wonder why?"
"__ACTION__ Maybe to keep the plot more than just non stop action."
"__ACTION__ I think the Matrix did that well."
"__ACTION__ Yep, mostly action, but a little love too."
