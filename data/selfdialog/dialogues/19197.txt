"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Prates of the Caribean movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I have not had the chance to check it out yet. Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I think it was good but there were also some things that I did not like."
"__MOVIES__ What did you not like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they made Jack different in this movie!"
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ They made him more ditzy and he did not seem as hardcore as he once was."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, that is disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ I think they are experiencing franchise fatigue."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that this was the last one in the series, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Thats what I heard too, but there was actually a sneak peak to what looks like another movie after the credits."
"__MOVIES__ What was the sneak peak."
"__MOVIES__ It was something to do with the tentacle guy again.  He was after Will."
"__MOVIES__ That seems stupid, it should just end."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I doubt they will do it though unless this movie gets a great response."
"__MOVIES__ As long as they are still good I will continue to see the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Was the new villain as cool as he looked in the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he was awesome, but spoke a little bit too much spanish."
"__MOVIES__ Can you understand him."
"__MOVIES__ Most of the time, yes."
