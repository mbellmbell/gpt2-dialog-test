"__MUSIC__ Okay, this is gonna be a tough one. Top five favorite country music stars?"

"__MUSIC__ Alan Jackson, George Straight, Randy Travis."
"__MUSIC__ Is that your list?"
"__MUSIC__ No, just running through some of the better ones."
"__MUSIC__ Conway Twitty would probably be up there. Oh, and Tim McGraw."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that's four. Who's number five?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't even thought about the women yet."
"__MUSIC__ Oh?"
"__MUSIC__ Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynna, the great Patsy Cline."
"__MUSIC__ So who makes the top five?"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, Maybe this will be more difficult than I thought."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! told you so."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man! I forgot all about Rascal Flatts."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they are good. I love that one song."
"__MUSIC__ Let me guess 'Melt'?"
