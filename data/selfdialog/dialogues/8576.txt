"__BEATLES__ Do you think that the White Album is the Beatles best album?"
"__BEATLES__ Actually, my favorite is Rubber Soul?"
"__BEATLES__ Really? Why?"
"__BEATLES__ I think they were at their peak during Rubber Soul. George was just getting into playing the sitar with Norwegian Wood and the folk influences made it a very grounded album."
"__BEATLES__ Well, I agree that Norwegian Wood was amazing, but what else was on that album?"
"__BEATLES__ Michelle, Drive my Car, Nowhere Man, plus a bunch of others."
"__BEATLES__ I love nowhere man. It always reminded me of Bob Dylan?"
"__BEATLES__ Lyrically, I can see that."
"__BEATLES__ I still think The White Album was better."
"__BEATLES__ Well, we don't have to choose. We can listen to them all."
