"__MUSIC__ What are your thoughts on club music or music they play at dance clubs?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of it is okay. I tend to like the music that doesn't have any lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that."
"__MUSIC__ Some of the trance or electronic music doesn't have any lyrics. Whenever there are voice overs in the music it seems to diminish the song."
"__MUSIC__ What are a few examples of songs that would fit that criteria."
"__MUSIC__ I would say, some of the more popular ones are Darude - Sandstorm, Robert Miles - Children, and DJ Mangoo - Eurodancer."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I recognize Darude and Robert Miles. Not so much DJ Mangoo."
"__MUSIC__ I bet you would recognize the song if you heard it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure I would. When did that song come out?"
"__MUSIC__ I believe it was either in the late 1990s or early 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ Seems like club music was much better back then."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it definitely was. A lot of the club music today seems to be taking hits from pop songs and adding a club feel to the song."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. The songs back then were specifically written to be club hits."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of have a distaste for the electronic-ization for pop songs. I tend to think that the artists that really focus on electronic and trance music have much more talent than someone who borrows something from a popular song and changes it to electronic."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. This has got me thinking, what are your thoughts on Daft Punk."
"__MUSIC__ Daft Punk is talented. Who could take one or two lines of lyrics and make it into a hit that many different people from all walks of life could enjoy?"
"__MUSIC__ Not many. Around the world would be a funny example of that. One line of lyrics and the entire song is written around that one line and it became a decent hit."
"__MUSIC__ One more time, as well, although they used more than one line of lyrics. You are making me nostalgic."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Daft Punk makes me nostalgic as well."
"__MUSIC__ So many good times and much freer times thinking about Daft Punk and the younger years."
