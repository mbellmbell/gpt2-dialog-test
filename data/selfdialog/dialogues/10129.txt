"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What did you think about that new Sampha album?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Process, right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's the one, man."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's really good. But I'm not sure I like it as much as his work with SBTRKT."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I completely understand. SBTRKT and Sampha were made for eachother."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wish they'd keep working together. Everything they do is gold."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but at least we still have Sampha's voice. Nobody matches it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Too true. Did you hear that collaboration with Solange? Cranes in the sky?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Perfect song. I didn't think I'd ever be into Solange, but I was wrong. I actually bought her album after hearing that song."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I have it, too. I would never tell anyone else this, but I like Solange better than Beyonce."
