"__HORROR__ What do you think of The Purge movies?"
"__HORROR__ They're a bit ridiculous but they seem like they could happen in America."
"__HORROR__ How could that happen?"
"__HORROR__ If the NRA took over, it would probably happen."
"__HORROR__ Would you consider it horror?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, definitely. It's basically home invasion, but the whole country."
"__HORROR__ I only saw the first one. Did you see the others?"
"__HORROR__ Yup."
"__HORROR__ How were they?"
"__HORROR__ The second was awful, but the third redeems itself a bit."
