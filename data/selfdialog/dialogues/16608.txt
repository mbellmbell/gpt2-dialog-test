"__MOVIES__ I'm looking for some good movie recommendations. Do you have any?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, 10 Cloverfield Lane"
"__MOVIES__ I don't recall hearing about that one"
"__MOVIES__ It's a good one. A good thriller."
"__MOVIES__ Any big stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ John Goodman is the biggest star"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I really like John Goodman."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he plays a bad guy in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's not fun. I like him when he plays good."
"__MOVIES__ Well he's kind of complicated character in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a horror movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, more of a thriller. There are some jump out of your seat scenes though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I don't do well with those types of movies."
"__MOVIES__ It's not that bad though. Just a few scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, any light moments?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's some scenes worth a few laughs."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'll check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the ending is kind of lame, but the rest of the movie is good."

"__MOVIES__ You're welcome."
