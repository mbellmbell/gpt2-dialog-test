"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Hopsin?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who is he?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a successful underground rapper, but his style is so different."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like rap that much."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but he is different and you may change your mind after hearing him."
"__MUSIC__ What makes him so special?"
"__MUSIC__ His music deals with real life problems and doesn't glorify the inappropriate parts."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds interesting, but I still don't like rap."
"__MUSIC__ I don't expect you to immediately, but try and give it a shot."
"__MUSIC__ What should I listen to if I were to try?"
"__MUSIC__ He has a whole story set out called The Ill Mind of Hopsin. Listen to number 5 first."
"__MUSIC__ Why would I start at 5?"
"__MUSIC__ It doesn't have to be in order and 5 is the best one in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, no problem. Is he like Lil Dicky at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, but similar in the sense it isn't mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ Okay good because I can't stand the mainstream rap."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, that's why I turned to underground."
"__MUSIC__ Is there anyone else I should try?"
"__MUSIC__ Start with Hopsin and if you like it I can show you a few other artists in the underground rap scene."
"__MUSIC__ You got it man!"
