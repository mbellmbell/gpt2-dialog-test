"__MUSIC__ I was listening to some songs from Vanessa Carlton the other day."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I know that artist. What are her popular songs?"
"__MUSIC__ You know her. She sings the one that goes 'making my way downtown...'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I know that song! It's called A Thousand Miles."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love her piano playing in it!"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know she was playing the piano. Does she do that in a lot of her songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a lot of her songs incorporate her playing the piano."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if she writes the music too."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but I think she does. The clear piano really adds something to songs."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, I've liked it ever since I heard it in old music when I was a kid."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of old music?"
"__MUSIC__ There was this Elvis song on my mom's Elvis Top Hits CD that had some really good piano in it."
"__MUSIC__ Elvis, huh? What song was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was called His Latest Flame. I used to get it stuck in my head all the time when I was little."
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember that one. I know a lot of Elvis songs, but piano never really stood out to me in them."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite Elvis song?"
"__MUSIC__ I love Jailhouse Rock. That song always made me laugh and I would sing it with my brothers."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard that song in ages. Now I need to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ I heard it when I was going through my oldies albums, in between The Beach Boys and The Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Now those are some classics, especially Hey Jude from The Beatles."
