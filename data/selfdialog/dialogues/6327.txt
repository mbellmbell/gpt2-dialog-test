"__STAR_WARS__ Did you hear about the Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The one about Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I mean The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's the sequel to The Force Awakens, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it is."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hear it will be even better than The Force Awakens but I don't know if I believe that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it will do better than the Han Solo movie at least."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, I don't think the Han Solo movie will perform well."
"__STAR_WARS__ They don't know what people want to see."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope they do well on The Last Jedi."
