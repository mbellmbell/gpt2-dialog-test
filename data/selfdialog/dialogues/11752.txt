"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Seattle is really going to have to play defense if they expect to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they may not fill up the score board anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly! And without Marshawn Lynch, they have no goal line punch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it might be tough without him, but they will manage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would personally look out for San Francisco this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You would? Is that a joke?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it is. They are going no where."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was starting to wonder what happened to you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I do not actually think they have a prayer. They have nothing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well at least they do not have Chip anymore. That guy just didn't have it at this level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he kinda succeeded his first year and then fizzled."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, thats what the guy seems to do. He just got gradually worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, we will see if he ends up back in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true. I think his chances of getting back are the same as Tim Tebow's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, both have almost no chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. Its sad for both"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, maybe one day they will both resurface."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't count on it. I'll tell you that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. They were one year wonders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! Maybe Tebow can crack the Mets roster though!"
