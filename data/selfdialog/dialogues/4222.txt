"__MUSIC__ If you picked an R&B artist as your favorite who would you pick?"
"__MUSIC__ Let me think, I have a few."
"__MUSIC__ I would pick Ginuwine. He just had a certain soul to him when he sang."
"__MUSIC__ I can see that, his music would really move you."
"__MUSIC__ So who is your favorite artist?"
"__MUSIC__ I would have to say Mariah Carey, I think she would maybe fall under R&B."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe so. She definitely has a gorgeous voice."
"__MUSIC__ Right! I liked every single one of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Ginuwine sang that song 'Pony', do you remember that?"
"__MUSIC__ Do I? Is the sky blue?"
"__MUSIC__ It was a definite mood setter."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes it was! My boyfriend would play that for me."
"__MUSIC__ I loved his song 'In Those Jeans' also."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I remember singing that one day as I put on my jeans and got ready for school."
"__MUSIC__ And I can't forget the song 'So Anxious.'"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! Another good mood setter song."
"__MUSIC__ You couldn't listen to that song without wanting to make out with your boyfriend."
"__MUSIC__ Yes yes yes! Good times those were."
"__MUSIC__ He was a great artist, I miss singers like him."
"__MUSIC__ I really do too."
