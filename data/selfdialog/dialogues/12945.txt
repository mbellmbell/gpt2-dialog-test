"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So will you be watching football this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure.  I used to love the Buffalo Bills..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sounds like you don't anymore.  What happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, my favorite player was Doug Flutie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he was amazing.  So what's the deal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember when they replaced him in the playoffs after he got them there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yea, that was a long time ago though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know but it soured me on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought it made sense..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you say that?  He was the quarterback who got them there in the first place!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know but they had to make the decision they thought was best for the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That obviously backfired!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You never know what would have happened..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but I know what did happen.  Management proved themselves to be disloyal and they lost anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You sure sound angry after all this time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were my favorite team as my grandfather was from Buffalo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that makes sense.  So you don't watch at all anymore?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might this season.  Who are you rooting for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The New England Patriots, of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so tired of hearing about that team!"
