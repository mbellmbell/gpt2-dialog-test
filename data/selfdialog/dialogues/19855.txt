"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I just saw it last night."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome; I saw it a few nights ago at a drive-in theater."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't realize there were any of those nearby. What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was great! I really enjoyed the film."
"__MOVIES__ I did as well."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely think it's the best of the new set of DC superhero films."
"__MOVIES__ It was certainly better than Batman vs Superman."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't even watch that one because the reviews were so poor."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think they will tie it in with the rest of the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I heard something about a Justice League film."
"__MOVIES__ It seems strange that this one was set in World War One, so it seems harder to connect."
"__MOVIES__ Oh there was one weird thing I noticed about the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What was that?"
"__MOVIES__ So the island is supposed to be somewhere in the Mediterranean, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess so. That makes sense anyway."
"__MOVIES__ So why would there be armadillos there since they're native to the Americas?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a good question; I hadn't considered that."
"__MOVIES__ I still enjoyed the film though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I hope they learn from this one and keep making good films."
