"__MOVIES__ Do you think we will get to see any new horro movies for Halloween this year?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, probably but I certainly won't be watching them?"
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I absolutely hate horror movies. I don't think I've ever watched one all the way through."
"__MOVIES__ Not even one?"
"__MOVIES__ Not that I can think of. I hate being scared!"
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe you've never even seen the classics like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street."
"__MOVIES__ No way. And I have no desire to."
"__MOVIES__ What about thrillers?"
"__MOVIES__ If they are more psychological, then yes I'll watch them. But anything that can be called a 'slasher' movie. No way!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, then have you seen Paranormal Activity?"
"__MOVIES__ Parts of it. I should have added demons and hauntings to the list of movies I don't like."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy. What do you watch at Halloween?!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you know. Halloweentown, Hocus Pocus, Nightmare Before Christmas."
"__MOVIES__ So kids movies?"
"__MOVIES__ That's what I prefer in the Halloween genre!"
"__MOVIES__ I love a good scare. I still haven't found one yet that really gets me scared."
"__MOVIES__ To put it in perspective for you, I jumped during Zooptopia."
"__MOVIES__ The animated kids movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that would be the one."
