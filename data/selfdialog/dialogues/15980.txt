"__ROCK__ The new Cheap Trick album came out this week."
"__ROCK__ Oh wow did it really?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah it's not their greatest but it's good to see them still making music."
"__ROCK__ I was just going to say that even if it's not that great, the old guys still putting out tunes is a relief."
"__ROCK__ Definitely, it's a pretty heavy record too, they're still experimenting with new sounds."
"__ROCK__ Oh wow see I would have thought they'd be kind of resting on their laurels a bit."
"__ROCK__ Nah, not at all, they really bring some heat even if the songs aren't much to my liking."
"__ROCK__ I wonder if they'll tour to support the album."
"__ROCK__ They probably will but everytime an old band tours to support a new album it's boring."
"__ROCK__ You're right, they always end up just playing the hits."
