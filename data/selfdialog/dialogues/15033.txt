"__ACTION__ What do you think is the ultimate action film?"
"__ACTION__ I would go with Die hard."

"__ACTION__ Yes and one of the only action movies I also consider a christmas movie."
"__ACTION__ Ha that is true. Nothing says christmas like die hard."
"__ACTION__ Well it does take place at a christmas office party. I think alan rickman would agree."
"__ACTION__ Hans gruber what a great character. Rickman did that role so well."
"__ACTION__ I think of them as two in one almost. Though rickman was a superb actor in other roles, hans was my favorite performance of his."
