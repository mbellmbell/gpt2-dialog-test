"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Foo Fighters song?"
"__MUSIC__ Not yet. How is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you honestly think that it would be bad?"
"__MUSIC__ You're right. It is impossible for the Foo Fighters to release anything bad."
"__MUSIC__ Its called Run. Listen to it now!"
"__MUSIC__ Let me bring it up on Spotify right now."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think about it?"
"__MUSIC__ This song is totally amazing. Is it a single, or did they come out with a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, its a single of their upcoming album. The new album will be out in September."
"__MUSIC__ I'm excited to hear it! September seems way too far away."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. I wish the album was coming out sooner."
"__MUSIC__ I guess we will have to wait, but I'm sure it will be worth it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it will. Did you hear they are going to play a festival in California with Queens of the Stone Age?"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I might have to go to California on a vacation to see them."
"__MUSIC__ I love Queens of the Stone Age as much as I love the Foo Fighters. I can't believe there is a chance to see them together."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither. What other bands are playing."
"__MUSIC__ I can't remember all of the bands, but I know Royal Blood will also be there."
"__MUSIC__ Royal Blood is my favorite band. I saw them open up for Foo Fighters in New York City."
"__MUSIC__ Was that the tour where Dave Grohl played with the broken leg."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it was. It was pretty awesome seeing how much he cares about his fans that he didn't even cancel the tour."
