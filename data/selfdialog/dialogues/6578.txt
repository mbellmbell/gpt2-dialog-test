"__STAR_WARS__ Mark Hamill is looking pretty old in the most recent trailer."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is old.  You have to remember the original came out 40 years ago."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which is nuts if you think about it.  It still holds up well today."
"__STAR_WARS__ I believe Mark is 65 now so it's expected he's going to show some age."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm very interested to see his character progression this movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  It strikes me that this a older, wiser Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably a Luke who is done with fighting overall and lacks some purpose."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he knows a purpose, but might be too disillusioned to chase it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm predicting Luke dies in this next movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't say that, we already lost Han!"
