"__MOVIES__ If I were to ask you, what is one of the greatest movies of all time, what would you say?"
"__MOVIES__ At this moment right now, I cannot help but go with Back to the Future."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree with that one. Back to the Future is one of the all-time great comedies."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I probably could watch that movie several times a week and never get sick of it."
"__MOVIES__ I understand that view point. What was your favorite scene?"
"__MOVIES__ I always enjoyed the scene at the end where Mart and Doc are at the clock tower and trying to do all they can to succeed in their mission."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. That was a very intense scene but also a lot of fun to watch."
"__MOVIES__ What scene stands out to you from the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I love the scene where George finally takes a stand and punches out Biff."
"__MOVIES__ That was another great moment. I found myself cheering when he actually punched him."
"__MOVIES__ Another thing that makes Back to the Future so great is it's more than just a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that exactly?"
"__MOVIES__ It could also be considered a romantic, science fiction, and even dramatic film."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I can see that. Especially the romantic aspect of things."
"__MOVIES__ I just think as far as a film goes, it has it all and a little bit for everyone."
"__MOVIES__ So I think it is safe to say the movie still holds up all of these years and years later?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. I truly do not know anyone who dislikes that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is it just the original that you love or the entire trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ Don't get me wrong. They are all great films, but I think the original was the best."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. There is denying the amazing chemistry Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have."
