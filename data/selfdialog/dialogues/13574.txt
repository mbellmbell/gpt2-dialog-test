"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know if Kirk Cousins and the Redskins ever struck a deal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they never found a middle ground."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's too bad. I thought they were supposed to be close?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First he was far away from a deal, then they were close, now they're far away again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is he asking for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The rumors were north of $20 million per year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's not even clear if he really wants to return."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I didn't think he'd even consider an offer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where does he want to go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Reportedly the 49ers, where his old offensive coordinator is now the coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Redskins will just slap the franchise tag again on next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it. That carries a salary over $30 million, guaranteed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Redskins need help in other areas, for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't want they're expecting to happen at wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're counting on Jamison Crowder to make a leap, and Terrelle Pryor should be solid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess, but he's still getting used to the position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jordan Reed's a nice safety valve, anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you still worry about his health, though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, but I think Vernon Davis can still be a decent stopgap."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Until he hits his wall, and at his age, you know it's coming."
