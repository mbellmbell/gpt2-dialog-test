"__STAR_WARS__ I have a question about Star Wars that has been bugging me for a while."
"__STAR_WARS__ What is it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why didn't Chewbacca get a medal at the end of the first movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, that's an excellent question."
"__STAR_WARS__ He should have gotten one for helping blow up the Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ Especially because both Han and Luke got medals."
"__STAR_WARS__ Chewie played just a big a role as the other two."
"__STAR_WARS__ Does this imply that they consider Chewie as second class?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think there are a few Wookiees on Kashyyyk that would take offense."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also by that logic, I think the droids should have received medals too."
