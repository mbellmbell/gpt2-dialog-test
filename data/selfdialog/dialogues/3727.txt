"__MUSIC__ Do you like the band Type O Negative?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to love them. My friends and I used to follow them around on tour back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Meaning you don't love them anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ I still love their old stuff, but after they turned Goth, I lost interest."
"__MUSIC__ You mean they weren't always Goth?"
"__MUSIC__ Noooo. They used to be a hardcore punk band! Their songs were really rough, harsh and offensive."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, I didn't know that! When was that?"
"__MUSIC__ In the late 80's. The vocalist, Peter Steele, started off in a band called Carnivore. Type O Negative was a spin-off of that."
"__MUSIC__ I started to listen to them after the Bloody Kisses album."
"__MUSIC__ That was when they were still a little bit punk, but the big hits on that album were Goth. The hits were so big, in fact, that they completely switched to the Goth genre after that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh you mean those fast songs on that album like 'Fay Wray, Come Out and Play'."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, like that. But their earlier albums were much more harsh sounding."
"__MUSIC__ So you don't like the Bloody Kisses album at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually I really do like that album, I even prefer the Goth songs on that album. It's really the full Goth albums afterward that turned me off."
"__MUSIC__ It's too bad that Peter Steele died so young. He was truly a brilliant musician."
"__MUSIC__ He wouldn't have said so. He would have said, 'Don't mistake lack of talent for genius.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's true, he did say that. That's funny."
"__MUSIC__ He said a lot of sarcastic and hilarious things. He could also be very offensive."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that he used to be a sanitation worker before he got famous?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I read about that.I also read that he lived with his mom until he passed away. Seems like a very down to earth guy for someone so famous."
