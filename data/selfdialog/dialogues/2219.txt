"__MUSIC__ Last night I went to my first concert."
"__MUSIC__ Who did you see?"
"__MUSIC__ It was a Green Day concert."
"__MUSIC__ I like them, but I've never seen them in concert.  Was it a good show?"
"__MUSIC__ It was a typical rock show with very loud music."
"__MUSIC__ I always leave those kind of shows with ringing ears."
"__MUSIC__ My ears were definitely ringing and I went home with only one shoe."
"__MUSIC__ How did you lose a shoe?"
"__MUSIC__ I was in general admission and it got a little rough a few times."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny that you lost a shoe in a mosh pit."
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't funny to walk around there without a shoe though."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure it wasn't."
"__MUSIC__ Also, it was pretty cool to see them smash all their equipment at the end of the show."
"__MUSIC__ They must be making a lot of money if they can afford to destroy equipment at every show."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if they do it every time, but I can imagine even once would be expensive."
"__MUSIC__ Did they destroy just the speakers or what?"
"__MUSIC__ It seemed like they smashed everything: the drums, microphones, amplifiers, and instruments."
"__MUSIC__ I've seen drums thrown around at concerts, but never destruction of a complete stage full of equipment."
"__MUSIC__ It was a first for me.  The music was loud and intense so maybe they just got carried away."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds entertaining in any case."
