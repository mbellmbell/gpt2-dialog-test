"__STAR_WARS__ I heard an interesting thing about the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah? What's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Star Wars really is just one big family messing up the universe?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, there's the Skywalker's. And then there's Darth Vader who's the father."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right! And then Anakin, Darth Maul, even Kylo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly all the heroes and villains are just one big family."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that makes sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ And without this family, including the heroes, the universe would be much more peaceful."
"__STAR_WARS__ Skywalker Star Wars."
