"__MOVIES__ Do you think the Community movie will come out anytime soon?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Dan Harmon says he's working on it, but then Mitch Hurwitz said that ages ago, and there still isn't an Arrested Development movie."
"__MOVIES__ It must be hard to adapt a TV show into a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Is it really though? I mean, it's been done successfully a few times."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there was the South Park movie."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was a little ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ It was funny though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was. Just a little inappropriate too."
"__MOVIES__ And there was The Simpsons Movie."
"__MOVIES__ Same deal there--funny but a little off."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Okay. Well, what about any of the TV shows Joss Whedon has turned into movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know those."
"__MOVIES__ Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that a movie to begin with."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Okay. I might be wrong about that. What about Serenity."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. I'll buy that one. That was good."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't as good as firefly though."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe TV shows and movies and just different things."
"__MOVIES__ You might be right!"
