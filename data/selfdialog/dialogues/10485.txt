"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think old people are too nostalgic for old hip-hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I get where they're coming from. A lot of the stuff from the past had way more substance than the newer stuff."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is that right? I think we tend to remember only the really great stuff from the past and to forget a lot of the fluff."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess that's sort of true, I mean, we're not thinking about Vanilla Ice and the Fresh Prince when we think about the Golden Era of hip hop."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I think if you filtered out all of the mediocre current stuff and only highlighted the great stuff, it'd be competitive with the supposed 'Golden Era' of hip-hop."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True, there are so many great records coming out that are bending genres and doing really cool things. From Chance 3 to The Life of Pablo."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So I'll ask again, are old people too nostalgic for old hip-hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know what would constitute 'too nostalgic' but they definitely dismiss current stuff too easily and forget about a lot of the mediocre stuff from their own time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Agreed. I do really miss nineties hip hop though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know, I would explode if I got another Illmatic."
