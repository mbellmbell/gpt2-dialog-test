"__MUSIC__ Do you like music?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I like music! Who doesn't?"
"__MUSIC__ Deaf people."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. What type of music do you enjoy?"
"__MUSIC__ All types though my least favorite genres are rap, heavy metal, and dubstep. Always exceptions though."
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't big into rap until I gave Eminem, Yelawolf, and Tupac another chance. Now I'm more open to it I guess."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean and feel the exact same way about rap, but just cannot get into dubstep to save my life - outside of Skrillex and Deadmau5 at least."
"__MUSIC__ Deadmau5 is alright. I like a handful of his songs."
"__MUSIC__ So who else you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Have an hour?"
"__MUSIC__ Only if you do the same for me."
"__MUSIC__ My absolute favorite bands or musicians at the moment are Goo Goo Dolls, Katy Perry, Nickelback, Kesha, and Pink. You?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a toughie. Of the more modern musicians probably... Avenged Sevenfold, Linkin Park, Green Day, Twenty-One Pilots, and Korn."
"__MUSIC__ More modern?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah... I've only recently gotten into post 2000 songs. Was raised on 70s and 80s mostly, and they're still among my absolute fave."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? Like whom?"
"__MUSIC__ Billy Idol, Billy Joel, ABBA, Buggles, Eagles, Beatles - of course, The Cure, The Doobie Brothers, etc etc."
"__MUSIC__ Ah yes, can't beat the classics. I'm quite fond of The Doobie Brothers and Fleetwood Mac myself."
"__MUSIC__ Shame most of these bands don't tour anymore... if they're still alive."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but at least Billy Idol came through recently. That was an awesome show!"
