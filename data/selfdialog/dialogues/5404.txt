"__STAR_WARS__ I heard that Lucas wanted Luke to fall to the Dark Side at the end of Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would have had a certain symmetry, but there isn't enough setup."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke wasn't ready to confront Palpatine and Vader.  Yoda said it himself.   If Luke left at the end of Empire Strikes Back, he was guaranteeing his fall."
"__STAR_WARS__ Audiences wouldn't understand that, though. They'd take Yoda's warnings as being overly fearful."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda knows what he's talking about, though.  Everything in the movies confirm that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that audiences would have needed it to be more explicit, and there would need to be more buildup.  What does Palpatine have to offer Luke?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nothing.  But that's the point. The Dark Side isn't rational. It's insane.  If you flirt with it, it'll make you insane, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's still difficult to grasp-. No one really wants there to be a giant force of insanity out there. They prefer rational villains."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lucas didn't, apparently. He liked the Ming the Merciless type of evil for evil's sake."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's his mistake, I think."
