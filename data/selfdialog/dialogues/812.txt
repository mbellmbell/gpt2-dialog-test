"__MUSIC__ I love the song Sweet Dreams Are Made of This by Eurythmics."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Do you like any of their other songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I like their song Here Comes The Rain Again."
"__MUSIC__ I like that one, too."
"__MUSIC__ Annie Lennox has such a unique voice."
"__MUSIC__ You know who else has a unique voice?"
"__MUSIC__ Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Celine Dion."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, you're right."
"__MUSIC__ I think she is one of the greatest singers of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I think Madonna is the greatest singer of all time."
"__MUSIC__ I like a few of her songs, but I don't think her voice is that great."
"__MUSIC__ Are you crazy? Her voice sounds amazing, especially in her song Like A Prayer."
"__MUSIC__ That song is good, but it doesn't compare to Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough, but I like Madonna's edgy style."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, her edginess is what made her very popular back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think Lady Gaga copied Madonna's style?"
"__MUSIC__ Hm. I think she was influenced by her, but I wouldn't say she copied her."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you're right. Lady Gaga's early style was much more dramatic than Madonna's ever was."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. Lady Gaga is probably the most outlandish music artist out there."
