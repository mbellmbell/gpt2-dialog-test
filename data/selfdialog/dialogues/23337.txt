"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see the Disney movie version of The Sword in the Stone?"
"__DISNEY__ I think I did, but it's been years since I saw it."
"__DISNEY__ I was just thinking about it the other day and how crazy it was."
"__DISNEY__ I really don't remember much about it other than a scene where the characters turn into fish and sing a song."
"__DISNEY__ I remember that! Do you remember the part where the characters are fighting and the witch turns into different animals?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so. It was such a fun movie from my recollection."
"__DISNEY__ I think we should watch it soon. There aren't too many other movies like it out there."
"__DISNEY__ I guess you're right. Not many movies have singing fish scenes these days."
"__DISNEY__ I can't wait to see if it holds up to my childhood expectations!"
"__DISNEY__ We'll find out soon enough."
