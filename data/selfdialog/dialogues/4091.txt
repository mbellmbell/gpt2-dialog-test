"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the band AJJ?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think so. What kind of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ They're an alternative rock band."
"__MUSIC__ I like alternative rock. Do you think I would like them?"
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty different. Their songs are cool though."
"__MUSIC__ How many albums do they have?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they have a ton. They've been touring for over ten years now."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! Do they have a big following?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. Where do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ We saw them in VA Beach, but they play all over the country."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we should go to their next show."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that would be fun!"
"__MUSIC__ Do they tour with any bands I've heard of?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably not. They played with a band called Mannequin Pussy at the show we went to."
"__MUSIC__ That's an interesting name for a band..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, AJJ actually stands for Andrew Jackson Jihad. But they decided to be more politically correct."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's really weird!"
"__MUSIC__ It definitely gives you a glimpse into what their music will be like."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds crazy!"
