"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think they never tried to properly train Leia to be a Jedi if it was so imperative to have one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They probably still wanted to keep her existence a secret to keep her safe and ensure there was another Skywalker around."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do regular people leave behind corpses when the corpses of Jedi vanish?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's because Jedi are so in tune with the force that their corporeal selves become a part of it when they die."
"__STAR_WARS__ If they made a backstory movie on any character, who would you want it to be on?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Obi Wan Kenobi because he's a very interesting character and I'd like to see him as a child and as he was training under Gui Gon."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of the newest Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Disney is doing them justice and I have been thoroughly enjoying them."
"__STAR_WARS__ What movie was the first one you ever saw?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I first saw Empire Strikes Back when I was a little kid. I caught it on TV and was instantly hooked."
