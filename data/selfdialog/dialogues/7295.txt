"__LADY_GAGA__ what do you think about Kanye West?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ well, he's an excellent hip hop singer surrounded with quite some complications"
"__LADY_GAGA__ yea, I heard his wife was put at gun point at a hotel, so Kanye has to cancel his concert while perfoming"
"__LADY_GAGA__ wow, that sounds pretty dramatic, in a bad way"
"__LADY_GAGA__ yea, but anyway, from audience's perspective, I just like some of his music"
"__LADY_GAGA__ such as?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ he published a lot of albums, have you heard of Champions?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ yea, he wasn't singing alone right?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ no, it was a feat, there were actually 2 people in the songs"
"__LADY_GAGA__ sounds like a great song"
