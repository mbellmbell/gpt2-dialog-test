"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey darlin' would you get me a beer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure I will, honey."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thank you sweetheart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are most welcome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you want to watch the game with me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ *laughs*  Not really.  The only thing that interests me are the uniforms.  Who the heck is playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, this is Miami."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why are the uniforms periwinkle blue?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are more like seafoam blue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, that is definitely periwinkle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could be right, you know that stuff better than I do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems an odd choice for a football team.  Like, you know, it's not an extremely manly color or anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I don't know but the uniforms are different based on whether the team is home or away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know whose uniforms have gotten a lot better over the years?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tampa."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember, years ago?  They used to be like, bright pumpkin orange."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  That was based on what?  Pumpkin colored pirates?  What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly!"
