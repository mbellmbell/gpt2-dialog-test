"__COMEDY__ I need a good movie to watch Saturday night. Any suggestions?"
"__COMEDY__ Well what genre are you looking for?"
"__COMEDY__ I would really enjoy a comedy, I think."
"__COMEDY__ Well I have the perfect comedy for you. It's a little crude, but it is so funny!"
"__COMEDY__ Well, what is it?"
"__COMEDY__ The Heat. It has Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock in it."
"__COMEDY__ I have never seen that. I have heard good things though."
"__COMEDY__ I don't think it will let you down. But, if you want another suggestion I would look for the older movie Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."
"__COMEDY__ Now I have seen that one. I love Steve Martin!"
"__COMEDY__ Me too, he is so great in any movie that he is in."
