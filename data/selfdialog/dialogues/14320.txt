"__HORROR__ Hey Linda, you want to go with me to Friday Fright Night down at Jaspers?"
"__HORROR__ What are they playing?  I hope not Scary Movie again."
"__HORROR__ No, looks like their showing The Exorcist."
"__HORROR__ Oh.  The new one or the Original.  I haven't seen the new one."
"__HORROR__ No, it's the old one with Linda Blair."
"__HORROR__ Uh...sure I'll go.  It's been a while since I've seen that.  Who's in the new one?"
"__HORROR__ I believe that's The Exorcism of Molly Hartley that you're talking about."
"__HORROR__ Oh.  I thought it was a remake of the original.  Well I'd still like to see it.  It looks scary."
"__HORROR__ Well then you'll probably want to watch the Haunting of Molly Hartley first I think it comes first."
"__HORROR__ Ok.  Well lets go get our fill of green soup."
