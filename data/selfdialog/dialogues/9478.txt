"__BASEBALL__ Do you watch Major League Baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ A little, but I don't follow it religiously."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, me too. I have a team that I support, but I don't really watch very often."
"__BASEBALL__ What team do you root for?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm an Atlanta Braves fan."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh really? I'm a Nationals fan."
"__BASEBALL__ They're in the same division I'm pretty sure. I actually think Washington and Atlanta are about the same amount of distance from where I live."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh cool, how did you become a Braves fan?"
"__BASEBALL__ My dad was a Braves fan. There weren't really any other teams in the south east until the 90s I think, so there are a lot of Braves fans around here."
"__BASEBALL__ That makes sense. I like the Nationals because I live very near Washington DC and they've been a good team recently."
"__BASEBALL__ Cool, did you ever play organized baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I played through senior year of high school."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh really? Me too, I played through senior year as well."
"__BASEBALL__ You know, I like playing baseball and going to the ballpark to watch games, but it's really boring to watch on TV."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. I played it and it's fun to go to the ballpark to watch in person, but watching it on TV can be pretty dull."
"__BASEBALL__ It's also hard to keep up with your team consistently because the season is so long."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the season is 162 games long I think. That's a lot of games to devote time to."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but I doubt they'll shorten it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I don't think they'll shorten the season either. That would mean less revenue."
"__BASEBALL__ And I hope they don't lengthen it either. It really doesn't need to be any longer than it already is."
