"__STAR_WARS__ There's this weird thing in the Star Wars prequels no one ever talks about. It's about the Chancellorship."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about the Chancellorship?"
"__STAR_WARS__ So, in Episode I Chancellor Valorum gets voted out, and Palpatine is voted into office, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ So what's wrong with that? Besides him being a Sith Lord, I mean."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the weird thing is that Mas Amedda, who was Valorum's Vice Chancellor, stays on as Palpatine's Vice as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be like if Dick Cheney stayed on as Vice President to Barack Obama. That is weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and no one questioned it really. Except the Jedi eventually."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why did the Jedi care?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know if it's canon anymore or not, but they thought it was a little weird, and figured he was the Sith Lord behind the war."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would make sense, seeing how he was able to maintain power under two administrations. Too bad they were all wrong."
