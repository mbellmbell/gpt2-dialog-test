"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Bieber?"
"__MUSIC__ Justin Bieber?  No, I am not a fan."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like him that much either, but his song 'Love Yourself' is very catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with that sentiment at least.  It's a pretty good song."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know who wrote it?"
"__MUSIC__ Justin didn't write it?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope.  It was Ed Sheeran."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow.  No wonder I liked the song so much."
"__MUSIC__ Are you an Ed Sheeran fan?"
"__MUSIC__ I am.  I think he is so talented."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song by Ed?"
"__MUSIC__ I absolutely love 'Shape of You.'"
"__MUSIC__ It's such a good song.  The lyrics aren't great, but the music itself is well-written."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed.  I wish Ed sang 'Love Yourself' though instead of Bieber."
"__MUSIC__ That would have been much better.  Apparently, Ed actually wrote that song with Rihanna in mind."
"__MUSIC__ Wow.  Now THAT would have been truly great to hear."
"__MUSIC__ For sure.  Rihanna has such range."
"__MUSIC__ That version would be better than Bieber's any day."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if she has done a cover of it."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it's time to go online to check!"
