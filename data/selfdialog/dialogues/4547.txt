"__MUSIC__ So have you heard any good dance music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there's that new Cupid Shuffle song!  I love that dance."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that one is fun!  It reminds me of the Macarena and the Electric Slide when we were little."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it's fun to watch the kids do it at parties."
"__MUSIC__ What about the Whip Nae Nae?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that one is fun too!  I've heard it at a lot of parties."
"__MUSIC__ They should make more party dance songs like that."
"__MUSIC__ Haven't you played the Just Dance games on the game systems? They're full of good dance songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's true.  But it's different when you're doing it at a party."
"__MUSIC__ True.  I can't get into a lot of the pop music nowadays."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean, like Miley Cyrus and stuff like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah Miley and the Backstreet Boys and One Direction, things like that."
"__MUSIC__ I just don't think they have much talent."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not hearing it, either.  It's real popular with the young crowds, though."
"__MUSIC__ I think the stuff we listened to when we were younger had more style and talent."
"__MUSIC__ What, like Madonna and Michael Jackson and those things?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, definitely.  They were better than the new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not so sure about that.  It probably just sounded better to us."
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift is a great artist though."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I'd call her pop.  She's kinda country."
