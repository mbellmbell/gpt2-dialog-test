"__DISNEY__ I just saw Cars 3."
"__DISNEY__ Oh! Was it good?"
"__DISNEY__ It was ok. The first will always be my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I understand. It had to be better than the Planes version, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that one was terrible. The sequels have all kind of been lame."
"__DISNEY__ Well, it's nice to see Owen Wilson in something again."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's been forever! He is definitely the voice of Lightning McQueen."
"__DISNEY__ My kids just got rid of all their Cars toys. I'm sure they will be regretting that."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it kind of made me want to play with that stuff again!"
"__DISNEY__ I will have to take them tonight. It sounds fun!"
