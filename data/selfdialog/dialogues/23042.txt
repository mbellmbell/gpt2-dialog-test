"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?"
"__DISNEY__ Silly as it sounds it has to be the Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ That is a classic, I know a lot of people who love that movie."
"__DISNEY__ We watch it all the time at my house. Even though I have seen it a million times I still cry when Mufasa dies."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think it would make me cry but that part is sad when Simba is left all alone."
"__DISNEY__ At least he finds Timon and Pumbaa to help him and show him family."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite part is when they sing Hakuna Matata, Disney movies always have the best soundtracks."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. The music makes the movie, it wouldn't be the same without it."
"__DISNEY__ I love how they did the Lion King 1 1/2 it was funny from Timon and Pumbaa's point of view."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it was funny seeing things from their perspective instead of the lions side."
