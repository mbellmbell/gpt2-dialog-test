"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marcus Mariota will recover from his injury and lead the Titans to a 12 win season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow that's a lot of confidence in Mariota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mariota showed that he was one of the leagues best quarterbacks last season when he was healthy and he barely had any weapons to work with."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Mariota better then Jameis Winston but I don't think he has enough to lead the Titans to a 12 win season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Looking at the Titans division I think they have the best team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true other than the Texans I don't see the Colts or Jaguars as posing much of a threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't fully rule out Andrew Luck with the Colts because he's such a good quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is talented but he takes a lot of risk and gambles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's what it takes to be a star quarterback. You have to have the talent and confidence to take those chances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He threw a lot of interceptions last season though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Colts trailed in a lot of games so they were forced to pass a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true when you have to play from behind the defenses can predict what you're going to do and play accordingly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, and for Luck to be able to come through in those situations proves that he's a talented quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, that's why I think the Colts aren't completely dead in the water even with the new roster they're fielding this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just feel like the Titans have their team and they're sticking with Mariota as the face of their franchise. He's confident and everyone believes in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do like his wide receivers. They're not household names but they get the job done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They just need the running game to come alive this season again. That'll help out their offense by so much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think DeMarco Murray will hold up for another season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ DeMarco Murray is a tank I think he'll do what he did last season and with Derrick Henry backing him up to give him a breather they'll be fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be exciting to watch how the Titans perform this season. I hope Mariota fully recovers from that broken leg."
