"__STAR_WARS__ I can't believe Kylo Ren killed Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a devastating scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if Kylo will redeem himself before the trilogy ends."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd like to think so.  Redemption is always a powerful device in film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think he is too far gone?  Han's murder may have been the moral event horizon."
"__STAR_WARS__ It very well may have been, but maybe Kylo will team up with Rey against Snokes."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is always a possibility.  It seems as if they are building up Snokes to be the main villain."
"__STAR_WARS__ And we still don't know what the deal with Luke is."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Luke may have nefarious plans or intentions?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess we will find out later this year when the next movie comes out!"
