"__MOVIES__ Let's rent a movie tonight.  Any ideas?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  I was just thinking that I would love to see 'Local Hero' again.  Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I LOVE that movie!  I remember Al Gore saying it was his favorite movie, so I knew I loved him!  It has such an off beat, weird kind of humor!"
"__MOVIES__ I never was a big  Burt Lancaster fan, but he was great in this."
"__MOVIES__ He really was, especially with that psychiatrist Clapper or Trapper!"
"__MOVIES__ That's right!   I forgot about him!"
"__MOVIES__ That is definitely on my top 10 list."
"__MOVIES__ I would put in my top five."
"__MOVIES__ Now I want to go to Scotland!"
"__MOVIES__ I remember that gorgeous scenery."
"__MOVIES__ Like on the drive, when they hit that little rabbit."
"__MOVIES__ Her name was Trudy."
"__MOVIES__ It was so sad when that other guy found out they had eaten her!"
"__MOVIES__ I know.  There are so many little, wonderful scenes.  I think about that movie a lot."
"__MOVIES__ I always think of that scene on the beach, with the old man who wouldn't sell his land, becausr it was such a special place.  It sure was."
"__MOVIES__ Like the oranges washing up on the beach."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how many beautiful places like that are destroyed by the oil industry."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I didn't realize how many things were made from petroleum.  For instance, dry cleaning fluid."
"__MOVIES__ It was great that Mr. Knox changed his mind."
"__MOVIES__ It really was. A happy ending!"
