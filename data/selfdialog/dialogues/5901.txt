"__STAR_WARS__ Hi, I like all Star Wars Movies except the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I think the prequel series are just as good as the others."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha! You are a fool, the prequels are the worst and people who like them are dumb!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I actually think they are the smartest of the series, in terms of the plot. The Phantom Menace, for instance has true political intrigue."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Jar Jar is awful."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar is no worse than the ewoks, or even Chewbacca. You just like Chewie more because because he can shoot a gun."
"__STAR_WARS__ The acting is awful, though, just horrible!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you telling me that Mark Hamill was not a whiny little brat as Luke Skywalker? He was just shrill and awful."
"__STAR_WARS__ But George Lucas ruined the original series to try to make the prequels better."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, he owns them and made his original vision a reality after years of being patient."
