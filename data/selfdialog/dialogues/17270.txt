"__MOVIES__ I just watched Fast and Furious 8, it was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I been wanting to see it, is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Definately! The cars as always are slammin', but they took a different plot twist."
"__MOVIES__ I figured they would have to do something different without Paul Walker."
"__MOVIES__ They did, but they still tied him into the plot in a couple ways so it was nice tribute."
"__MOVIES__ So how was the plot different?"
"__MOVIES__ Dom turns against his team."
"__MOVIES__ No way! The family is everything to him; he preaches about it thru 7 movies!"
"__MOVIES__ He and Letty are in Cuba on their honeymoon and while walking back from getting coffee, he stops to help this chic that turns out to be Sypher."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, I thought Sypher wasa  thing not a person."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! But come to find out it isn't. She shows him something on a phone and he just freaks."
"__MOVIES__ It would have to be something huge."
"__MOVIES__ Your remember that chic he was with before Leddy got her memory back."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but so what, she was so minor."
"__MOVIES__ Well apparently there is a minor involved."
"__MOVIES__ No way! Dom has a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, and he is being held hostage by Sypher, along with the mother."
"__MOVIES__ Why didnt he just take his team and do whatever she wanted?"
"__MOVIES__ She wanted him to go against his team, he even took the Rock out and framed him to go to prison with Statham."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I am gonna have to go check it out."
