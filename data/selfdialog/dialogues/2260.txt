"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really have an opinion because I'm not much interested in country music."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, I don't think she is a country music artist anymore."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean her music is now mostly pop, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ That's nice, I'm a big fan of pop music."
"__MUSIC__ She's got a few new hit songs, you would probably like them."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, what's her new pop album called?"
"__MUSIC__ Her new album is titled 1989 and is the reason I've actually become a fan of her."
"__MUSIC__ You think the music is that good?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it's because of the bonus tracks on the album where you can see some of her song writing process."
"__MUSIC__ And why does that make you more of a fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I feel like a lot of pop artists now days aren't actually writing their own music in any way."
"__MUSIC__ You mean they hire people to play the music?"
"__MUSIC__ To play it, yes, and in some cases to write the music and the lyrics even."
"__MUSIC__ I guess a person who does that wouldn't be an artist, but probably just a singer."
"__MUSIC__ I completely agree and I'm always excited to see some indication that artists are indeed artists, like Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ You talking about this makes me quite interested in hearing her new music."
"__MUSIC__ I can let you listen to some of it if you like, then you can decide for yourself."
"__MUSIC__ That would be great, thanks!"
