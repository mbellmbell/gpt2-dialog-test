"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe some of the weird names that NFL players have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, what's up with Forest Lamp?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like a decoration, not a person, and I think it's odd that someone named Lamp went to the Chargers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There was a player named Taco who went to the Dallas Cowboys in the draft, too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A guy named Taco in a place where Tex-Mex was born seems like a pretty good fit"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can understand some names that sound ethnic, like Ndamukong, but Taco is strange"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Solomon Thomas has a pretty cool first name that commands respect"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it sounds kind of biblical in a way, and for a big guy like that to command respect is definitely a plus"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 49ers defense needs to win back people's respect, and they probably couldn't do that with a bunch of players named Taco and Budda"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then again, Budda Baker is supposed to be a pretty talented athlete"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose it's easier to forgive weird names when the people sporting them are enormously talented"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just wish people would stop naming their kids Deshaun and Lesean so I don't get so confused when they end up on the same team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least if they're on the Eagles like McCoy and Jackson, they'll end up traded away before long"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, what is it with the Eagles and trading their best players away?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they're building up their roster for the future and compiling draft picks like the Browns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Browns lucked out with all those draft picks and still ended up with Myles Garrett and Jabrill Peppers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Peppers is as overrated as people say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think people just say that because he plays at several different positions so there's less information to go off of"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This could be the eve of the Browns' rise to greatness after years of being the punchline to everyone's jokes"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but they're going to need to pick up some more strangely-named players first"
