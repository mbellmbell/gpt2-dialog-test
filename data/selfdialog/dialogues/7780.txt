"__POP__ Who do would you say is your favorite pop artist?"
"__POP__ It would be a tie between Britney Spears and Fergie."
"__POP__ I like Britney a lot, but I can't stand Fergie anymore."
"__POP__ Really? Why don't you like Fergie?"
"__POP__ It just feels like she's not trying anymore."
"__POP__ I agree, she was better with The Black Eyed Peas, but I still think she's a strong singer."
"__POP__ Well, that's the probelm, she's a strong singer, but her songs are straight up rubbish anymore."
"__POP__ Why do you say that?"
"__POP__ Take M.I.L.F Money for example,  that song didn't make any damn sense. The lyrics and the style were all over the place."
"__POP__ Ok, you have a point with ONE song, but I still don't think she's all bad."
