"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No I haven't seen it but I don't think it's going to be as good as the original."
"__DISNEY__ The remakes never are. Plus it's live action so there's only so much they can do."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. I love Emma Watson though, ever since Harry Potter."
"__DISNEY__ Oh everyone loved her as Hermione. But she's done a pretty good job of getting awa y from that typecast."
"__DISNEY__ You're right, have you seen her in This is the End?"
"__DISNEY__ The one with Seth Rogen and James Franco? Yeah that was funny."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I'll take my kids to see Beauty and the Beast. I'm waiting for The Little Mermaid live action."
"__DISNEY__ I think it's coming out next year if I'm not mistaken."
"__DISNEY__ Now that's my personal favorite Disney movie of all time. Part of Your World is a beautiful song."
