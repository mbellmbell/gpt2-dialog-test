"__MUSIC__ Hey, so do you listen to the Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ A little bit, but I don't know too much about them."
"__MUSIC__ You should really explore their music!  I think they're one of the best bands ever."
"__MUSIC__ What's so great about them?"
"__MUSIC__ Mick Jagger, the lead singer, is an amazing artist.  They were formed in London in 1962."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I didn't realize they were so old."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, almost sixty years ago.  Their music is still popular."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that timelessness is a sign of greatness."
"__MUSIC__ Well if you listened to them, you'd see.  They weren't in the Rock Hall of Fame for nothing!"
"__MUSIC__ So what are some of their best songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Brown Sugar is pretty awesome.  You Can't Always Get What You Want is great, too."
"__MUSIC__ They were from the same era as the Beatles, are they similar?"
"__MUSIC__ No way.  I would say they have a completely different sound."
"__MUSIC__ That's good to hear.  I hate the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm not a fan either.  The Rolling Stones are more rock with a little blues influence."
"__MUSIC__ Oh okay.  I didn't think they were similar but I had to ask."
"__MUSIC__ You should check out I Can't Get No Satisfaction too if you're going to listen to their music."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I'll just check out their greatest hits.  I'm sure I can find it somewhere."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there should be a greatest hits album."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the recommendation, I will check them out for sure!"
