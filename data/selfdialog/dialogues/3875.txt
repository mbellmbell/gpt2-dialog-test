"__MUSIC__ Are you a Bon Iver fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I guess."
"__MUSIC__ What's that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I was a fan, but kinda forgot about him actually!"
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the newest album?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe? When did it come out?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's actually been about a year now, though I didn't discover it until a few months ago."
"__MUSIC__ What? Really? I had no idea he put out anything new in years!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you should take a listen. It's pretty unique!"
"__MUSIC__ Unique in a good way or bad way?"
"__MUSIC__ Both I guess!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, you have to explain!"
"__MUSIC__ Well some of the songs are beautiful and super poetic and others..."
"__MUSIC__ Not good?"
"__MUSIC__ Other songs just kinda sound like noise."
"__MUSIC__ Oh weird!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think he strayed a little to far from his roots on this one."
"__MUSIC__ Is it like electronic music?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say some of the songs are, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. Definitely sounds different I'll say that!"
