"__MOVIES__ O.K. for our lunch movie discussion today we're supposed to talk about a recent movie."
"__MOVIES__ Right, I know you want to get off all the older movies we've been talking about, but the only movie I could come up with is The Circle."
"__MOVIES__ Well, neither one of us has seen it."
"__MOVIES__ But that's what I want to talk about it--why haven't we seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess because it got lousy reviews."
"__MOVIES__ So, we don't judge on our own."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, you have to take advice--are you going to go to every movie out there."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you have a point.  But Tom Hanks, Emma Watson--how can you go wrong."
"__MOVIES__ Apparently they did."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it based on a good book isn't it--what went wrong?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know; there are some interesting issues about technology and privacy--I guess they didn't do it well--I don't know; I didn't see it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, o.k., once something's reviewed badly, I guess you don't study why."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, if you want to see something that is rated poorly, wait for television, then you don't have to pay ten bucks a head and you can turn it off."
"__MOVIES__ I did see that it was Bill Paxton's last film before his death, and I enjoyed him in Independence Day."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was Bill Pullman."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, then who's Bill Paxton."
"__MOVIES__ I hate to admit it, but although the name is very familiar I can't place him or what he's been in."
"__MOVIES__ It's funny in our society--an average entertainer gets recognized, although not by us in this case, but an extraordinary college professor, probably not."
"__MOVIES__ Not unless there in the movies.  Anyway, let's forget about The Circle and next week talk about good Tom Hanks films."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good."
