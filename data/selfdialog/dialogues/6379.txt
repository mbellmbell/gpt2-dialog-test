"__STAR_WARS__ Harrison Ford was awesome in Star Wars!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I am so sad that he was killed in the newest one."
"__STAR_WARS__ He must have made a ton of money from those movies, he could have stopped acting!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that in A New Hope he only made $10,000?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is insane! Was he very famous at that point?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not completely. But still, it wasn't very much money."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well it definitely made him more famous so it was worth it!"
"__STAR_WARS__ He had so much chemistry with Carrie Fisher as princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ I always kind of thought that they didn't have any chemistry at all.  It was always fighting."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was kind of the appeal though, they weren't perfect."
