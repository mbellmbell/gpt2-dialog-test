"__MOVIES__ What is the best western you've ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ That would have to be Once Upon a Time in the West."
"__MOVIES__ That's an interesting choice. What is that movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ It has a typical theme for westerns, which is basically how technological advancement is bringing to an end the wonder and freedom of the wild west."
"__MOVIES__ But it also reduces the lawlessness and brutality."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, and I think the film expresses this as well."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it would be much harder nowadays for Henry Fonda's villain to get away with the things he does."
"__MOVIES__ At least in the straightforward way in which he does it."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly."
"__MOVIES__ Who else was in that film?"
"__MOVIES__ Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale."
"__MOVIES__ Is that Bronson's best role?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. He never did anything afterwards with as much weight or substance."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably true, as the Death Wish movies were pretty straightforward."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those were not very good."
"__MOVIES__ Who does Bronson play in the film?"
"__MOVIES__ He is a harmonica-weilding wanderer who is out for revenge."
"__MOVIES__ That is a pretty unique-sounding character."
"__MOVIES__ It really is, and the final showdown is a joy to watch."
