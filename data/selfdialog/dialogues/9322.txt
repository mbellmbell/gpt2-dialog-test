"__BASEBALL__ Did you go to the game last night between the Padres and Giants?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, we had seats behind the Giants dugout."
"__BASEBALL__ Really?  We were just behind third base!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh! Then you almost got hit by that foul ball!"
"__BASEBALL__ Too close.  That home run in the fifth inning was a monster."
"__BASEBALL__ They need to make that right field fence higher."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree.  Seems even most pitchers can hit homers over that wall."
"__BASEBALL__ Speaking of pitchers, why would the Padres bring someone out of retirement to pitch?"
"__BASEBALL__ Seems that's their M.O. -- too cheap to buy good talent."
"__BASEBALL__ Padres should be a AAA ballclub."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, Padres got their new baseball field right smack in downtown San Diego."
"__BASEBALL__ Beautiful field it is -- ranks as one of the tops in the league now."
"__BASEBALL__ All they need to do now is field a team that can compete in the bigs."
"__BASEBALL__ Wouldn't it be great to see a World Series here?"
"__BASEBALL__ Heck yeah!"
"__BASEBALL__ I'd love to see the good ol' days of Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa..."
"__BASEBALL__ Smackin' balls outta the park and roundin' the bases while fist pumpin' on steroids.."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, those were the days..."
"__BASEBALL__ Anyway, see you tomorrow at the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ 7pm against the Rockies -- see you there."
