"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! do you think Brett Favre is a good influence for Aaron Rodgers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, Brett is a great mentor for Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think so? I really doubt that, since they have different style of play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably, but Brett Favre is one of the few remaining veterans that are still in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What if Aaron Rodgers does not need Brett Favre, do you think he's too old to be mentoring in the league right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Aaron needs some of the ropes that Brett Favre can bring and offer, and no, Favre is one of the few veterans that are still relevant."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think that the pairing is a bit flawed because of their individual style of play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's true but I think they can adjust pretty well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Although, Favre is a champion though so I guess that would very much help in a sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Greatly, but so is Rodgers, you would need a mentor who is already a champion, not just a player who have been in the league for quite a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about this, if things would workout, would they (Packers) have a chance in the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, since this past season they did great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I think they have underperformed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I disagree, I think the Packers were only a bit unlucky in most of their games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if you put it that way, they don't deserve to be in the Superbowl if luck is their concern."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just saying that they were games last season that they had a great chance of winning, yet they came up short."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I somewhat agree, that's where Favre needs to focus on mentoring Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, he should be more mental instead of changing how Aaron plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agree, I really hope Aaron Rodgers would click with Brett Favre and win the Superbowl again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would really think so and there is a great chance they can do it, let's just be patient."
