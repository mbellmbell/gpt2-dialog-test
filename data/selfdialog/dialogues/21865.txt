"__DISNEY__ The first time I saw Up I was full of such emotion."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know because you didn't know what to expect."
"__DISNEY__ At first I was happy and laughing for the first bit."
"__DISNEY__ Sure and then you start to see the plot develop."
"__DISNEY__ And before you know it you are crying. I don't think I made it through the first 10 minutes without crying."
"__DISNEY__ It was so sad when the wife died. I cried too."
"__DISNEY__ It was awesome though when the balloons start to rise up from the house."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and the nurses from the old age home just stare in amazement as it floats away."
"__DISNEY__ It had a great ending. I really liked that Carl learned to get over his sadness and became an important part in Russell's life."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, Carl became like a grandfather for Russell who needed a good father figure."
