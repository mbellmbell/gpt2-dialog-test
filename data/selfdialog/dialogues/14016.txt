"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think is the MVP?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Clearly Russ, right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, I guess, but I don't know. He had to lead there."
"__BASKETBALL__ So did Harden, didn't he?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, but Harden actually won games."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, so did Russ. Just not enough."
"__BASKETBALL__ They both are solid candidates, but have you seen Russ?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, he takes it to another level."
"__BASKETBALL__ He does, but so does Harden. They are great players."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lets just say Kawhi and call it a day."
"__BASKETBALL__ That would be fun, but he just isn't quite there yet."
"__BASKETBALL__ Na, not yet, but he could be soon."
"__BASKETBALL__ He quickly took over as the leader of the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, I'll give him that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, hes a gamer, but Russ."
"__BASKETBALL__ I understand. That guy can play."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't leave Lebron out either."
"__BASKETBALL__ We always leave Lebron out. He just keeps doing his thing though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Look, Russ has to be the guy. Has to be."
"__BASKETBALL__ We will see soon."
