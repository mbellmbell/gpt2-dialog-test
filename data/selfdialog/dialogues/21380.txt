"__THRILLER__ What did you think of that new shark thriller film, 47 Meters Down?"
"__THRILLER__ I thought it was pretty awful. I almost couldn't sit through it. The only thing I liked was the ending."
"__THRILLER__ Seriously? I thought it was great. What didn't you like about it?"
"__THRILLER__ The two girls squealing like bubbleheads the whole time drove me nuts. You'd think with that much air in their heads, they wouldn't have run out of oxygen."
"__THRILLER__ You just made me laugh, you're funny. What did you like about the ending?"
"__THRILLER__ It was pretty much the only part of the film that was really emotional. Otherwise it was the kind of film where you end up rooting for the sharks."
"__THRILLER__ You have to admit, it was tense and suspenseful."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, that it was for sure! But if you want a better shark film, I'd recommend The Shallows."
"__THRILLER__ With Blake Lively? I've been meaning to see that."
"__THRILLER__ It's great, it's just her and the shark for most of the film, but she is intelligent, resourceful, and definitely not annoying!"
