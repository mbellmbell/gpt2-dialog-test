"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of King Diamond?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a really strange name. Who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're an interesting metal band that does horror music."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by horror music?"
"__MUSIC__ They write about a lot of scary themes in each album."
"__MUSIC__ Like a story?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, each album is actually a story and there are characters and plots in each one."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's really different. Are they any good?"
"__MUSIC__ They're one of my favorite bands. The guitar work is really good."
"__MUSIC__ What's the guitar work like?"
"__MUSIC__ There are a lot of different rhythms and grooves for each riff and everything is very melodic."
"__MUSIC__ That's nice, most metal isn't like that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Also King, who is the singer, sings in falsetto so that's also very different."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's very strange."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, a lot of people don't really like it, but you get used to it after a while."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of the albums about?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh you have albums about haunted houses and zombies, which would be Conspiracy."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty neat."
"__MUSIC__ That one is probably the best, but there are lots of other ones."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to give them a listen."
