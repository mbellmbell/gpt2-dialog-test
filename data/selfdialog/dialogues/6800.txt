"__STAR_WARS__ Don't you feel something special about the Star Wars films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can think of a lot of special things about that series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, but there's something in particular that I've been thinking of lately."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like each film gives a better look at a certain character than the other. Don't you."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see that for some, but not all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like it's there for all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see it in Revenge of the Sith for Vader, and in A New Hope for Luke, but not much else."
"__STAR_WARS__ I definitely feel like it's there for more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it is, and I'm the one who doesn't see it."
