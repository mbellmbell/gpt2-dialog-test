"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is the year for Andrew Luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you really think so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he is a great quarterback, and he will lead the Colts to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's a bold prediction for a mediocre team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's just how good I think Andrew Luck is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he will put the team on his back and carry them through the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and he's been close a couple times before in his short career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually agree with you that he is a top-notch passer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's my favorite player, and he's durable and tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I followed him a lot more when he was in college at Stanford."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, he was the man when he was in college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was crazy how good Stanford was with Luck and Harbaugh there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, I forgot that Jim Harbaugh coached them for awhile."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and then he went to the NFL to coach San Francisco, and now he's back in college at Michigan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny how things change so quickly for coaches and players in sports."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to be very willing to move and adapt if you play or coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if I could move my family around that much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it must be hard if you have young kids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that's one of the reasons that these guys get paid big money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really have to be committed and love the game in order to uproot your life like that."
