"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite Beatles album?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's easy; it would have to be Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:  it was such a musical breakthrough. How about you?"
"__BEATLES__ I, myself, like their previous record the best: Revolver.  That's where they *really* started experimenting with things."
"__BEATLES__ Really? I always think of Sergeant Pepper as the first *real* concept album."
"__BEATLES__ It's true Revolver wasn't a 'concept' album, but that's where they started with all the tape experimentation; faster, slower, backward..."
"__BEATLES__ But it all came together on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: that's the one everyone looks to their breakthrough album."
"__BEATLES__ It's still just a continuation of Revolver's experimentation. Listen, for example, to the reversed guitar on Tomorrow Never Knows."
"__BEATLES__ Interesting! I've listened to Revolver, but I never thought of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as a continuation of it."
"__BEATLES__ Or listen to weird musical processing they did on Yellow Submarine -- *that* was a brand-new technique at the time, too."
"__BEATLES__ I'm going to listen to Revolver, then listen to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band afterwards.  This will be fun!"
