"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh are those somehow related?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. You know they are."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I'm just confused because LOTR was three books and three movies. But the Hobbit is one book and three movies. Confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I don't know what they were thinking with that."
"__MOVIES__ They were thinking about money."
"__MOVIES__ Probably. How did you like them though?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the Lord of the Rings to an extent. But there were some issues."
"__MOVIES__ What issues did you have? I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Well there was a lot missing from the books."
"__MOVIES__ It's hard to put everything from a book in to a feature length movie."
"__MOVIES__ The extended versions are way longer than feature length and they added very little to the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Even still, there probably wasn't enough time to do everything."
"__MOVIES__ Then why did they have like forty minutes of that love nonsense between Aragorn and Arwen?"
"__MOVIES__ Ok I get your point. What was your issue with the Hobbit besides it being three movies?"
"__MOVIES__ That was the basis for why it was bad. It was so long that it was just boring."
"__MOVIES__ So one series was too long and the other wasn't long enough?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Pretty much."
"__MOVIES__ You're hard to please."
"__MOVIES__ I just know what I like."
