"__MUSIC__ Do you like Nirvana's music at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely, they were pretty great back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ It still is great, it really stands the test of time. I'm always in the mood to put on the album Nevermind in my car or anywhere."
"__MUSIC__ Which album of their do you like the best?"
"__MUSIC__ I would probably say Insecticide but that doesn't mean that I don't like the others. That one's just my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I like their last one, In Utero the best I think. Kurt Cobain really matured as a songwriter for that album."
"__MUSIC__ In Utero definitely had the most complex musicianship. It had a much more layered sound to it than their previous stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That was also when they added Pat Smear as a member of the band and second guitarist."
"__MUSIC__ Which song opff of Insecticide to you listen to the most?"
"__MUSIC__ It's either the song Dive or Aneurysm. I can't choose so I'll say it's a tie between those two."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite by them is probably the song Lithium."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think Nirvana has any bad songs. Every single thing they released was great."
"__MUSIC__ How long have you been listening to Nirvana?"
"__MUSIC__ A long time, over 20 years. I think I appreciate them a lot more now than I did when they were popular."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't like them when they were still around?"
"__MUSIC__ I did but at the time they were so popular and overexposed that I got a little tired of seeing them everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ The last album they put out was their MTV Unplugged in New York. What's your opinion on that, do you like it as well as their studio work?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh it's perfect. It's sad that was their last released music though so it's a little depressing listening to."
"__MUSIC__ Which song off of MTV Unplugged in New York do you like the most?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably it would be All Apologies. I like that album's version better than the version on In Utero."
