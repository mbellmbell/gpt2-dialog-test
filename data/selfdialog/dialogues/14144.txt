"__HORROR__ What is a good horror movie you've watched recently?"
"__HORROR__ I watched The Thing again the other night."
"__HORROR__ You watch that a lot, you must really like that movie."
"__HORROR__ Yes, it's one of my favorite horror movies. Not only that, I think it's one of the best movies of any genre."
"__HORROR__ Who directed The Thing?"
"__HORROR__ John Carpenter, same guy that made Halloween."
"__HORROR__ Oh, that was really good too. He is a talented director."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, he has a great mind for horror."
"__HORROR__ Doesn't it take place in Antarctica?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, that location is really unique for a horror movie. It also helps create a tremendous feeling of isolation and claustrophobia which really adds to the level of tension and fear in the movie. That's a big reason why I love it."
