"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited about the new Falcon's stadium next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know a lot about it. Is it called Mercedes Dome or something like that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To tell you the truth, I know it is Mercedes something. But I'm not sure what exactly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it going to be bigger than the Georgia Dome?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, a good bit. And it is very innovative."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has a retractable roof that is different from any other current stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds interesting. Do you think the Falcons will have a good season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so. Especially that devistating lose in the SuperBowl last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was a big disspointment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure was. I really hated that they lost, but I think it is unfair how bad people talk about New England."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I agree with you. Love them or hate them, they never gave up and earned that victory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. That said, I hope the Falcons meet the Patriots again in the SuperBowl next year to get some revenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they would win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really think it depends on the coaching staff. I think they have just been too soft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard people say that. They do have unbelievable players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some of the best in the NFL! I just don't think the coaching staff has taught them the right discipline to finish a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sure is what happened in the SuperBowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. Hopefully next season is the year they take it all!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully! And in a new stadium, that would be epic!"
