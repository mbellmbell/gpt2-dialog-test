"__MOVIES__ Which do you like better, Kill Bill 1 or 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, I think of them as the same movie"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was intended that way but since they got split up, which do you like more?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea.  It's just one long movie."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I like the first one the best."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ It's got more action and it's really exciting.  In the second, there's just a lot of talking."
"__MOVIES__ How in the heck do you figure that?  She defeated Elle after kicking her butt and killed Bill..."
"__MOVIES__ But Uma Thurman's character didn't really do much in that part.  Elle killed Budd and Pei Mei, Budd buried the Bride and she just blinded Elle."
"__MOVIES__ But she did kill Bill."
"__MOVIES__ Eh, not sure he didn't just let her kill him."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that's why he shot her with the truth serum gun"
"__MOVIES__ He just did that to make sure she told him the truth about why she left him."
"__MOVIES__ Their whole relationship was weird.  I mean they love each other then they hate each other and then they get mushy at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think he slept with all those women that worked for him?"
"__MOVIES__ Duh.  They didn't adore him for tips or his boyish good looks."
"__MOVIES__ You know you would have thought if he was going to be screwing around with all of the he would have gotten a vasectomy or something."
"__MOVIES__ That's true.  You wouldn't think he would want all those women killing people for him with a pregnant belly getting in the way"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm... how's this for a movie?  A group of female assassins.. all pregnant at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ What would you call it.. Prego By Bill?"
