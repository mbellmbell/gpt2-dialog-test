"__DISNEY__ What do you think of Toy Story?"
"__DISNEY__ Growing up that was always my favorite Disney movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Who was your favorite character?"
"__DISNEY__ As a kid I always wanted to be a cowboy, so obviously I really related with Woody."
"__DISNEY__ I always wanted to be an astronaut so I really loved Buzz Lightyear!"
"__DISNEY__ I use to have the Buzz Lightyear action figure, I could never find Woody in stores."
"__DISNEY__ That's because he was the star of the movie and everyone loved Woody!"
"__DISNEY__ Loved? Now that they have made Toy Story sequels kids still love Woody!"
"__DISNEY__ That's a really good point!"
"__DISNEY__ We should have a Toy Story marathon and relive our childhood!"
