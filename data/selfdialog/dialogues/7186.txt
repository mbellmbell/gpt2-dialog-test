"__LADY_GAGA__ How do you feel about Lady Gag?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you mean her clothes or her music?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her music!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, I love her music. I think she's super talented."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I totally agree. Do you feel differently about her clothing?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I just think it's too much. I don't think she needs all that costuming."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think it's an expression of who she is."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her music does that on it's own! Have you heard any of her acoustic stuff?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't think I have."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love it. You should check out her playing piano and singing 'Marry the Night'."
