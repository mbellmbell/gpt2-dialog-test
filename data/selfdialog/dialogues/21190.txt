"__THRILLER__ What was the last great thriller film you saw?"
"__THRILLER__ Hm, recently? Probably No Escape with Owen Wilson."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, that was pretty good. I like the Jason Bourne movies a lot, too."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, those are good. He is a very convincing super agent."
"__THRILLER__ What about the older thrillers? Like Fatal Attraction?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, that's so creepy. Great movie. Good cautionary tale."
"__THRILLER__ I also liked one called No Way Out with Kevin Costner. Had a great twist ending."
"__THRILLER__ The one where he's a Secret Service agent?"
"__THRILLER__ I think so. It's been a long time. I just remember he made out in the back of a limo with someone."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, that's the one I'm thinking of, too."
