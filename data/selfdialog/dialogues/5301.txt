"__STAR_WARS__ I liked the new star wars movie. How about you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was good but I wish Han Solo hadn't died at the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. It was really sad but also a powerful scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Kylo Ren will remain on the dark side or do you think Rey can bring him back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope he can be redeemed like Darth Vader. He seemed conflicted at times so maybe he still has some good in him."
"__STAR_WARS__ The movie raised so many questions and left us with such a cliffhanger. I Wish they had told us more about how Kylo Ren ended up the way he did."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. And what was with that scene where he talked to Darth Vader's remains. It was weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ They had a chance to give us more insight into what drove Kylo towards the dark side of the force but they just left me confused."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hopefully the next movie 'The last Jedi' will answer some of the questions they raised in the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if Finn also has the force."
