"__MOVIES__ So did you get to see Logan yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No not yet, I missed it in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, it just came out on blu-ray this week, totally recommend it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not too into super hero moves though, would I like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say even more since you don't like super hero movies."
"__MOVIES__ What does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It borrows a lot from westerns and stuff like The Last of Us."
"__MOVIES__ Oh so it's not just a big action flick?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, it has a lot of quiet introspective moments."
"__MOVIES__ That's different from other X-men movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's because it isn't an X-men movie."
"__MOVIES__ But Logan and Xavier are in it, no?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes but it's not about the X-men, they're disbanded."
"__MOVIES__ Disbanded?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's in a world where mutants are looked down upon, shunned."
"__MOVIES__ And Logan and Xavier are just walking around?"
"__MOVIES__ No, Logan is keeping Xavier locked up due to a mental illness that's harming people."
"__MOVIES__ Oh interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me you'll love it."
"__MOVIES__ Then I'll definitely give it a rent, thanks."
