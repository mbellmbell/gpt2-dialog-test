"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! I saw the new Wonder Woman movie and it was awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? My mom and her boyfriend went to see it a couple Sundays ago and they seemed to really like it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you should definitely see it. The story is interesting, it has great action, and I loved the actors/actresses."
"__MOVIES__ Sweet, I think pretty much everyone I've talked to has enjoyed it and the reviews seem to be really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, definitely. How about you, have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately, it's been a little while since I've been to the theaters, but I did watch Batman vs. Superman recently."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool, another comic book related movie. How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was great. I've liked all the recent batman movies, but it's a little hard for me to believe that Batman could realistically take on Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah, but Batman has all the cool gadgets and he's incredibly smart."
"__MOVIES__ True, but I'd still rather have super powers. One movie I really want to see is Baby Driver."
"__MOVIES__ I think I've seen an ad or two for it, but I don't know much about it."
"__MOVIES__ I don't really know a ton about it either, but it looks like a lot of fun. It looks like it's got a good mix of action and comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'll have to check it out sometime."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Jamie Foxx seems like he's going to be hilarious in that movie. I definitely want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ This might sound random, but do you know if they're coming out with another Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they are. I think there's going to be another trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the original 6 movies and I recently watched The Force Awakens, but I haven't seen Rogue One."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the first 6 Star Wars movie as well, but I haven't seen either of the latest two. I want to though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you should. Star Wars movies don't typically disappoint."
