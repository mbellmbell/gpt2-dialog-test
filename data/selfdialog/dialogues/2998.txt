"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the band, Spoon?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I listen to them occasionally. They come up on my Pandora stations a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to their albums?"
"__MUSIC__ Somewhat. I know I like Gimme Fiction and They Want My Soul especially."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard their new album?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't yet. But I've heard the hype about it. Do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a little disappointed. I loved their last album and listened to it endlessly."
"__MUSIC__ What did you not like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ It seemed to be very synth motivated and overworked."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by overworked?"
"__MUSIC__ It was overproduced. They had someone else master this particular album and it just ended up to 'busy' for my tastes."
"__MUSIC__ I'm curious. Who was the one that mastered it?"
"__MUSIC__ I can't remember his name. But, he's known for doing all the Flaming Lips albums."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! I love the Flaming Lips and all their albums. I'm wondering why the same formula didn't work for Spoon."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's because Spoon is at it's best when there is a lot of space. They are known for that/"
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense. I love Britt's gritty guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Which is why I don't like this album nearly as much as the others."
"__MUSIC__ But that's their signature! Are you telling me that there's no dirty guitar on this album?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much. That's what I'm telling you. It's all synth, really poppy, and super busy. It's A LOT of sounds but no guitar."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to go check it out. It sounds like they got misled from their path by signing on with this studio engineer."
