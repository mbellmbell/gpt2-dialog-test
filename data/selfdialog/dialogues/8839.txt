"__BEATLES__ Are you listening to the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I'm listening to Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds."
"__BEATLES__ It's weird how they completely changed their style."
"__BEATLES__ I know, they used to be a pretty standard pop band, but everyone loved them. They really changed significantly."
"__BEATLES__ It seemed like some of their songs were a protest."
"__BEATLES__ Revolution comes to mind, Taxman seems to be another one."
"__BEATLES__ They weren't too happy about being taxed on their wealth, I guess."
"__BEATLES__ I guess not. You mentioned Revolution, have you ever heard Revolution 9?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, what a strange, strange song."
"__BEATLES__ Sometimes I really wonder what they were thinking when they made that song."
