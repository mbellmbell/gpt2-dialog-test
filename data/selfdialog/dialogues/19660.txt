"__MOVIES__ Have you heard about the new Aliens movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, but I haven't seen the trailer yet. Have you?"
"__MOVIES__ I did. It looks pretty good. The special effects are amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I bet they are. I hope the new movie isn't all special effects."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. The old ones used models, but they did a great job with it."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I think the story is far more important than most people believe."
"__MOVIES__ Ridley Scott is involved with this movie as well."
"__MOVIES__ Is he, or is it just his production company."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I don't know."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully he has some input."
"__MOVIES__ I imagine he would, because he was so central to the other movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can't see how he stays uninvolved."
"__MOVIES__ At least the new cast looks good."
"__MOVIES__ Really, who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Danny McBride for one."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember there being any comedic relief in the first movies."
"__MOVIES__ There was some, but not much."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right."
"__MOVIES__ In any case, I'll likely see it when it comes out."
"__MOVIES__ Let me know. I'd like to go as well."
