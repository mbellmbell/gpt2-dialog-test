"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Postmodern Jukebox?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a group that got famous on YouTube. They take current music and re-do it in the style of older styles."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like something they'd have at a hipster restaurant"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they seem to be obnoxiously self-loving in their videos."
"__MUSIC__ I can't stand that. Do they make it work, though?"
"__MUSIC__ Their music rocks. They always have seamless blending. It's just a matter of who is performing."
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to anyone else on YouTube?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course. I love Malinda Kathleen Reece."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ She's the one who does the 'Google Translate' series."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ She takes songs and puts them through several layers of Google Translate, then sings the results."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, that sounds odd."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but somehow she makes it work. She speeds up and slows down to make up for it."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like it gets funny. How often does she write music?"
"__MUSIC__ She'll upload once a week with a translate or a cover."
"__MUSIC__ DIdn't she do that Frozen song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, that's her!"
"__MUSIC__ That was fun, but seems like it'll get old after a while."
