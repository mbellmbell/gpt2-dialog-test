"__MOVIES__ Do you like old movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a fan of old movies except for musicals."
"__MOVIES__ What musicals do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like Camelot, The King and I, My Fair Lady, and The Sound of Music."
"__MOVIES__ Which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I have a favorite because I like them all for different reason."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of reasons? Can you be more specific?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I like Camelot because I love the story of King Arthur and, although it's a little odd for knights to be singing it really tells the story well."
"__MOVIES__ What about The King and I? Is that the one with Yule Brenner in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I like that one because it shows how valuable good teaching is and how a person who is willing to learn and grow can make a difference in the world."
"__MOVIES__ I see. Isn't My Fair Lady just about a poor girl who becomes rich?"
"__MOVIES__ Not exactly. It's more about how someone can learn to overcome their circumstances and present their best self to the world."
"__MOVIES__ So you think that all musicals have some kind of moral to their story?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not all, but a lot of them do. I guess that's why I like them."
"__MOVIES__ The Sound of Music is one of my favorites. I love how Maria wins over the Captain just by being herself."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! That's exactly the kind of thing that musicals bring to light."
"__MOVIES__ You mean that they are wholesome...good family entertainment?"
"__MOVIES__ Not exactly. I mean that they have good acting, expansive sets and costuming, a fantastic story, and some educational value too."
"__MOVIES__ Well I guess that is the teacher in you showing through."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm...I suppose it is."
