"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I was speaking to a friend during the week about the new 2 Chainz album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, that one. I thought it was awful."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's exactly what I said. He didn't take too kindly to it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I take it that means he's a fan."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah. He's actually been listening to him for over 5 years."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How can you go for so long with such bad music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Again, that's what I'm saying."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean, we do have to respect others' opinions."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's true. I didn't consider that when confronting my friend."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He'll get over it soon."
