"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you think the fast and Furious franchise is actually done?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, they did call the last one the fate of the eight."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I suppose so, but the franchises just seem to keep making movies even after they stop being good."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ This last one was still pretty good."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was okay, I missed Paul walker."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They did an okay job of explaining why he wasn't around."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought they still could have used some old footage or something as a memorial to his character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Vin Diesel and the Rock were still pretty awesome."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There's no way that the Rock would lose a fist fight to the guy from Crank."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's a good point, his arms are the same size as the other guy's waist!"
