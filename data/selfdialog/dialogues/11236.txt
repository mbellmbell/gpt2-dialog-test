"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe the preseason is only a month away?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! I am so excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think this will be the Packers year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I think every year is going to be the Packers year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They keep making it to the playoffs, though. I'd be pretty happy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but at the same time, it's hard to watch them lose when they are so close."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would suck. Hasn't it been like 7 seasons in a row that they have made the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. Patriots and Packers are on the same streak."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is pretty crazy. Aaron Rodgers is pretty dominate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's hard to tell what the problem is anymore. Everyone blames the coaching, but I don't know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it is hard to argue against anyone when they keep making it to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the Patriots have won 2 in the past few years and the Packers win was like 7 years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, I would rather be in that position than not making the playoffs at all!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. Being a Packers fan has spoiled me a little."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am pretty excited to see what the Raiders can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully Carr is healthy. He was dominate there for awhile."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really was. And now they have Lynch!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are going to be a team to look out for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope they live up to the hype."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really think they will. Good luck to both teams!"
