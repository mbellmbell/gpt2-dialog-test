"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you want to know what I don't understand about Fast and the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What's that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why is it that after eight movies, and showcasing classic, American and import cars, I've never seen a Jeep Wrangler featured."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You probably haven't seen one because because Jeeps are notoriously slow. The movie is called Fast and The Furious not Slow and the Curious."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You're probably right. However, I can definitely Hobbs or Shaw sporting one!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah! Especially in the latest movie, Fast and Furious 8!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What happened in that one?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, as the team was trying to stop the hacker in Russia from stealing a submarine with bombs, they were caught by the Russian military. There was snow everywhere."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh really? That would've been perfect for a Jeep!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well maybe they will in the next one, Fast and the Furious 9!"
