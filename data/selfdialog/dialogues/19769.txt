"__MOVIES__ I know this is cheesy, but I have always been a sucker for romantic comedies."
"__MOVIES__ I know how you feel.  They just make you feel good.  They make you laugh and cry all at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ I have always liked when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan pair up.  They have done such great movies."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones are you talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there's' Sleepless in Seatle', ''You've got Mail and the one I really kind of like is 'Joe Versus the Volcano'.  I'm sure there are some other ones I can't remember."
"__MOVIES__ I have never heard of 'Joe Versus the Volcano'."
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty funny, and I can't really tell why it didn't do well in the theaters.  I don't even remember it being in the theaters.  We bought the DVD for it."
"__MOVIES__ I also like when Julia Roberts does a romantic comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes.  My absolute favorite is 'Notting Hill.'"
"__MOVIES__ That's a great movie.  I cried when she said to Hugh Grant, 'I'm just a girl, standing here, asking a boy to love her.'  Makes me cry every time."
"__MOVIES__ Another good team for romantic comedies is Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler."

"__MOVIES__ I know, and he always expects me to cry at some point.  It's just what I do."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any other good romantic comedies coming out that you know about?"
"__MOVIES__ I really don't know.  I'd have to look."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's time for a date night with my husband.  Dinner and a romantic comedy.  What a great way to spend the evening."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Let me know how it goes.  Maybe I can convince my husband to do the same."
