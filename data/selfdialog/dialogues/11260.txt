"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you plan on watching football next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I usually don't start watching until the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have a favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, probably the Patriots now. Their Super Bowl victory last year was pretty amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You like The Patriots? Did you hear about Tom Brady deflating footballs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he ever admitted to it. Even if he did, it wouldn't give him that big of an advantage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably right, only the greatest quarterback ever could have come back like that in the Super Bowl against Atlanta."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure he's the greatest, that's debatable. After all, Terry Bradshaw won four super bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Bradshaw wasn't as good as someone like John Elway or Joe Montana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's amazing Bradshaw won four, I think it had more to do with the Pittsburgh Steelers defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, that's how the Baltimore Ravens and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won their super bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any prediction on who is going to the Super Bowl next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't bet against the Patriots, but I hope to see the Seattle Seahawks make a return."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle has a good quarterback, Russell Wilson is one of the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if he's one of the best, but definitely one of the most mobile."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the most mobile quarterback ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my mind, it was Steve Young. One of the first games I saw him play filling in for Joe Montana, and he ran for about 60 yards on one play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did Steve Young ever win a Super Bowl? All I remember about him is that he was Joe Montana's backup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steve Young has three Super Bowl rings. Two of them with Joe Montana as starting quarterback, the third when he was the starter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005. I guess a lot of people thought he was pretty good."
