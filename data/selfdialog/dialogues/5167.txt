"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, you mean The Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah number 8. Without Paul Walker. So sad."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah it still kind of pulls at the heart. But no I haven't seen the new one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I just can't bring myself to see it yet. I will probably wait until it comes out on DVD so I can cry in peace."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well I don't know about cry, they are usually so action-packed that you don't have time to do much more than eat your popcorn and watch the screen."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You could be right. I just wish Paul Walker was still here. I hate it that he died like that. Well I do think the send off at the end of the last movie was touching and sweet."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was. When he rode off into the sunset I think that said it all. It had to be hard to come up with an ending that would do him justice. I mean him and Vin Diesel were the movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, family. And in real life too. But I can't wait to see The Fate of the Furious. They have some new people in it like Charlize Theron that should be a good time."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I agree, maybe we'll see it together. Pop some popcorn and get some M&Ms and do it right. RIP Paul Walker."
