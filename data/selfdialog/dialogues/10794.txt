"__FASHION__ I see you're back to wearing your floral dresses this spring, Jackie."
"__FASHION__ Yes, they say long floral dresses are in this spring."
"__FASHION__ I can understand that. It is warmer now and the warmer months are all about staying cool and looking chic."
"__FASHION__ Preferably at the same time."
"__FASHION__ I guess long floral dresses are the perfect item to have in your wardrobe."
"__FASHION__ Whether you are heading to the office, an outdoor wedding or brunch with your girlfriends, the floral dress is the perfect item to have in your wardrobe."
"__FASHION__ I see."
"__FASHION__ The best part about owning a maxi dress is that it’s the ultimate throw-on-and-go item in your closet."
"__FASHION__ You're right about that."
"__FASHION__ Another thing that is in this spring is sheer."
"__FASHION__ Sheer?"
"__FASHION__ Yes. Layering isn't just about keeping warm anymore—it's about adding another dimension to your outfit."
"__FASHION__ And sheer does that?"
"__FASHION__ A sheer top is a more subtle  way to show some skin this spring."
"__FASHION__ Well, not for me it isn't but to each his own."
"__FASHION__ You have to get with the times, Jasmine."
"__FASHION__ I'm sorry but walking around in sheer clothing is like walking around nearly naked to me."
"__FASHION__ You are such a traditionalist. You like being covered up."
"__FASHION__ I have respect for my body and myself. I am not a follower of all fashion trends."
"__FASHION__ I know. I know."
