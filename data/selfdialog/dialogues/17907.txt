"__MOVIES__ Did you hear they're making a Super Troopers 2?"
"__MOVIES__ I've been hearing that for a long time actually."
"__MOVIES__ They have finally started filming now."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome! Is everyone coming back?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe all the main characters are, yes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I can't wait. That's one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I quote it almost every day."
"__MOVIES__ Haha same here. There are so many memorable quotes."
"__MOVIES__ I like how when they made Beerfest, they all had completely different characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it really showed their diversity in acting."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know they make each other audition for each part even though they are the writers?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard them on interview talking about it."
"__MOVIES__ That's so cool. I can't imagine anyone else playing Farva."
"__MOVIES__ No way! Heffernan was born to play that role!"
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what the new Super Troopers will be like."
"__MOVIES__ I can't imagine it being anything less than stellar."
"__MOVIES__ And what about Weedfest? Are they still making that?"
"__MOVIES__ They said yes, but they wanted to get Super Troopers 2 made first."
"__MOVIES__ Great! I'm looking forward to both of them."
