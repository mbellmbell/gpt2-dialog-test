"__STAR_WARS__ I have such a soft spot for Star Wars characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do, too. Yoda is my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ He has a certain cuteness to him, but he's also a cool character."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's a grand master or something like that, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he is. I thought you said he was your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know very little about the actual character. Just things I see on the internet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do yourself a favor and watch The Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Isn't that his debut film?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right. Maybe you can learn a thing or two."
"__STAR_WARS__ Alright. That's definitely something I can do."
