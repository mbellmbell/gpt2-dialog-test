"__DISNEY__ Does Princess Elena of Avalor have her own movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't think so. I think her and Sofia the First were the first two to be introduced on a television show instead."
"__DISNEY__ Elena wasn't even introduced on her own show though!"
"__DISNEY__ Really?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! At least I think so. She was introduced on a tv movie with Sofia the First."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, right. Sofia visits Avalor on vacation."
"__DISNEY__ And releases her from her amulet!"
"__DISNEY__ I hope she gets her own movie. My daughter loves Elena of Avalor."
"__DISNEY__ Mine too. The characters are great and I love all the music in the episodes."
"__DISNEY__ Me too!"
