"__MOVIES__ What is that movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ This group of baseball players that aren't very good end up doing really well to spite their owner. It's really funny."

"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I've see that one. There are a lot of quotable scences in that one."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it. I heard they might be making a sequel."

"__MOVIES__ The movie he did on there with David Spade was pretty funny though."
