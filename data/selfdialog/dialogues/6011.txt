"__STAR_WARS__ I just watched Empire Strikes Back.  Again."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?  It's the best one,"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't stop getting freaked out every time I see Han in carbonite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it scared me when I was a kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure - he was frozen, and he had that grimace on his face."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right?  He looked like he was in agony."
"__STAR_WARS__ But I just realized when I was watching it tonight - when Han first goes into the hole, he's handcuffed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah!  Then he's holding up his hands!  Now how did that happen?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Did the carbonite break the handcuffs?  I have so many questions now!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too!"
