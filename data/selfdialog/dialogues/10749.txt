"__FASHION__ So why do you think all these retailers are failing?"
"__FASHION__ Fashion is different these days"
"__FASHION__ Dont you think its all cyclical?"
"__FASHION__ Sure but theres a point where people will not pay X when they cant get it for Y"
"__FASHION__ So what are you saying"
"__FASHION__ Brands like Abercrombie who market higher end items are not going to keep up with other retailers"
"__FASHION__ Who do you think is their main competition?"
"__FASHION__ I would say H&M"
"__FASHION__ They make alot of products"
"__FASHION__ They do and they make them affordable for everyone"
"__FASHION__ So does Abercrombie need to change their model?"
"__FASHION__ No because they cant afford to sell items at the price point H&M does."
"__FASHION__ So you think we see them stop creating fashion?"
"__FASHION__ In a sense, yes."
"__FASHION__ You can get the same clothes from H&M?"
"__FASHION__ Not the same quality. They wont last as long"
"__FASHION__ But they look the same, just need to replace them more often?"
"__FASHION__ Yes but most of the clothes end up only lasting a season anyway before the next trend comes out."
"__FASHION__ I get where you are going"
"__FASHION__ Yeah so as long as they keep up selling how they do, theyll meet their end."
