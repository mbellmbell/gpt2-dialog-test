"__COMEDY__ I've never understood if Forrest Gump is a comedy or drama."
"__COMEDY__ Both."
"__COMEDY__ How do you figure?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, it has many comedic elements, mostly Forrest himself."
"__COMEDY__ But it's also got a lot of serious parts."
"__COMEDY__ I get that, but let me ask you this: how often did you laugh during the movie?"
"__COMEDY__ Quite a bit."
"__COMEDY__ Well, there's your answer.  It's part-comedy."
"__COMEDY__ I guess. It still feels weird."
"__COMEDY__ Trust me on this one."
