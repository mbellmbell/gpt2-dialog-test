"__MOVIES__ Are you aware of a movie called Sea of Love?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that from the '80s?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's from the late '80s.  It's a thriller/romance."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like something I'd seek out.  Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin are in it.  They play off each other well."
"__MOVIES__ Don't they have some pretty sexy scenes together?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they do.  Not too explicit, though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's good.  I don't like the ones that go too far with that sort of thing."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, Al Pacino is a detective, and there is a murder investigation going on."
"__MOVIES__ I like crime-type movies."
"__MOVIES__ It's set in New York which is a great city as a backdrop for this sort of thing."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  New York cop stuff is the best."
"__MOVIES__ You'll like Ellen Barkin's character, too.  She's mysterious in it."
"__MOVIES__ You're making me want to see this a lot!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's worth seeking out.  Pacino is pretty compelling."
"__MOVIES__ Does it have a lot of violence in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It has some, but not too much."
"__MOVIES__ That's great.  I can't stand it when there's too much killing and car chases."
"__MOVIES__ It will transport you for a while into that New York City crime world."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'd love to see this."
