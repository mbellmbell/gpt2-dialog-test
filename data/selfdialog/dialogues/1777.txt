"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite Cartoon theme song?"
"__MUSIC__ I have too many to name."
"__MUSIC__ Well, pick one. Mine is the original Pokemon theme song."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, mine would have to be The Weekenders."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, I forgot about that show."
"__MUSIC__ Listen to the theme song and you'll remember how great it is."
"__MUSIC__ I do remember. So many memories."
"__MUSIC__ Cartoon theme songs are the best."
"__MUSIC__ Theme songs for hour long shows and sitcoms are important, but not as important as cartoon ones."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I'm not sure why, though."
"__MUSIC__ It probably has something to do with the way kids get addicted to them or something."
"__MUSIC__ I doubt that. But cartoon songs are always more memorable than regular shows for some reason."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can remember all the jingles and lyrics of at least 50 cartoons."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. Not so much with regular shows."
"__MUSIC__ Now I just want to listen to old theme songs."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. I want to feel the nostalgia."
"__MUSIC__ I'll listen to The Weekenders again, you listen to Pokemon"
"__MUSIC__ I don't need to, its still fresh in my head."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, everyone remembers those Lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Of course."
