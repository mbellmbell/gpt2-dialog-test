"__MUSIC__ Did you go to Boston Calling this year?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I wasn't super excited to see anyone and the tickets were expensive."
"__MUSIC__ I really wanted to see Solange."
"__MUSIC__ Was she good?"
"__MUSIC__ She actually cancelled last minute."
"__MUSIC__ OH man, that sucks. Everyone I know who went was excited for her."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They replaced her with Migos, but still."
"__MUSIC__ Who else was there?"
"__MUSIC__ Chance the Rapper was the other big name."
"__MUSIC__ How was he?"
"__MUSIC__ He was awesome -- it started raining when he came out, though, so people started leaving."
"__MUSIC__ That's lame. It rained the one year i went too. They had to cancel Volcano Choir and went straight to Lorde and Childish Gambino."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of Lorde, have you heard her new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Not yet, i've just heard her new single."
"__MUSIC__ It's on Spotify -- you should check it out!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I want to."
"__MUSIC__ Fair. I think it's pretty good though."
"__MUSIC__ I'm listening to Khalid at the moment, but I'll check it out once I'm ready to move on."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's her best album yet."
"__MUSIC__ She only has two -- it's not that hard."
