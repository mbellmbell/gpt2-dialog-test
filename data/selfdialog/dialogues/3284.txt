"__MUSIC__ Who's your favorite composer?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by composer? Do you mean songwriter?"
"__MUSIC__ No. A composer is someone who writes music, such as symphonies or cinematic film scores."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. Well, I like John Williams, the composer of the Star Wars music."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good example. What about classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean classic rock, like The Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I mean fine art music like Beethoven and Tchaikovsky."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I guess I wouldn't know the difference between one or the other."
"__MUSIC__ It takes a while to develop a taste for classical music. Even though I was an orchestral musician, it took me several years to really appreciate a lot of different composers."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I never got into it. It's basically what I think really old people listen to, like over 60."
"__MUSIC__ That's not really true though. I bet there are some things you might like if you know the right stuff to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you like the Star Wars music, you might want to try listenign to 'The Planets' by Gustav Holst. All the sci-fi shows and movies pretty much borrow from that piece."
"__MUSIC__ Is that so? So does it sound like a movie?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, at times when listening to the piece it feels like you could be watching a space epic like Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ Why is it called 'The Planets'?"
"__MUSIC__ The piece is comprised of several sections, called movements, that each musically describe the planets in our solar system, such as Jupiter and Mars."
"__MUSIC__ How does music describe a planet?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, as you probably know, the planets were named after greek gods. For example, Mars was the god of war, so the Mars movement sounds like the kind of music in a movie about ancient battles."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I'm curious enough to maybe try listening to it."
