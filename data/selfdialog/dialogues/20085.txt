"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I watched the original Blair Witch Project the other night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love that movie!  It scared me so much."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too.  I couldn't stand being out in the woods like that."
"__MOVIES__ I've been scared to camp ever since I saw it!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the way they made it so realistic was genuinely creepy."
"__MOVIES__ It was, and that was before reality tv got popular."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it seems like it was a precursor to it.  I wonder if it had an influence."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  Was it based on a true story?"
"__MOVIES__ It said so in the movie, but I'm not sure if that was real or not."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  I guess we could look it up."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  Did you see any of the sequels?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't know there were sequels."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there were several.  I think the latest just came out last fall."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, how were they?"
"__MOVIES__ Not so great.  The second one was pretty lame and I heard the third was bad too."
"__MOVIES__ You haven't seen the third?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I'm still going to check it out.  Sometimes reviews are wrong."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's definitely true.  Maybe we can watch it together."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, we could do that."
