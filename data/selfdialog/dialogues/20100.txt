"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the Brave Little Toaster movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what on earth is that? It sounds weird."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they are weird, but they're really cute movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Are they new?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, they're older.  The first one came out in 1987."
"__MOVIES__ What on earth are they about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they're Disney movies.  They're about a bunch of appliances looking for their master."
"__MOVIES__ What on earth, that sounds bizarre."
"__MOVIES__ It's really funny, and since it's in the eighties everything is so outdated."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ All the appliances are totally outdated and not modern.  It's interesting to see."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by they're searching for their master?"
"__MOVIES__ They get separated from their owner, who they refer to as their master.  So they set out to find him."
"__MOVIES__ I guess the toaster is one of these appliances?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and there's also a lamp, and a radio, and an electric blanket.  And a vacuum cleaner."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely sounds unique.  I'm surprised I never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so am I.  There's a sequel too."
"__MOVIES__ what's it called?"
"__MOVIES__ The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars, I believe."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds even weirder."
