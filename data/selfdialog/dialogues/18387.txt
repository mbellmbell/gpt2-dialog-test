"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about movie remakes?"
"__MOVIES__ Just in general? Or did you have something more particular in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I feel like they do work sometimes. Like the remake of Ocean's Eleven was good."
"__MOVIES__ It was. I like George Clooney and Julia Roberts."
"__MOVIES__ And Brad Pitt! It had a great cast."
"__MOVIES__ Sure. But I feel like remakes have a reputation for not being good."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the remake of Old Boy wasn't as good as the Korean one."
"__MOVIES__ That could be a cultural thing. Like they ruined it while localizing it."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but there are others. I didn't like the remake of The Parent Trap."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that when it came out."
"__MOVIES__ How old were you."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe 10. I guess that could be it."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. It's not a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. But does that mean you think it's bad to remake movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all. It just has to be a movie worth remaking."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of movie is that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it would have to be a movie that you could do better today, with the current technology."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense. Sometimes the effects matter."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. So long as it's not just recycling the idea."
