"__STAR_WARS__ So how excited are you for the new Star Wars movie the Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ On a scale of one to ten I'm a twenty five!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Lol me too. I really want to see more from Luke Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, and how and why Rey has the force and why she is so strong with it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have a theory about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ And what is that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, Rey is actually Luke's long lost daughter!!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! That makes so much sense on why she is so strong with the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't wait too see if that's true or not."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same here. And I'm curious how they are going to spin the story as well."
