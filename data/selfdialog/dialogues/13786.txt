"__BASKETBALL__ I have a gripe about NCAA basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Go ahead."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hate when awesome division I powerhouses pay awful schools to play."
"__BASKETBALL__ You mean, pay-to-lose?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yup. It happens in football too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why does that bother you?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It doesn't improve the players on the team paying, and it uses up the school's money."
"__BASKETBALL__ You really think the students are paying Alabama A&M $150,000 to lose to University of Florida--just for example?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know where the money comes from, other than that it's a waste."
"__BASKETBALL__ I LOVE when they do this, actually?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Why?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, let's say Duke pays The Citadel $250k to lose at Duke."
"__BASKETBALL__ Duke pays The Citadel $250k to lose at Duke."
"__BASKETBALL__ Very funny, you literalist. Anyway, I love when the lesser school that's paid to lose ... wins."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ha, that's right. They spent the school's money to buy a win and didn't get it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Love it."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's not enough for me though. It happens rarely enough to be an anomaly."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're one of those integrity guys aren't you?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I think it ruins the game of basketball. There's no surprise, and the wrong kind of competition."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're only saying that cause you were in the Atlantic Sun."
