"__MUSIC__ Did you see that Radiohead re-released OK Computer with a bunch of new tracks?"
"__MUSIC__ No I didn't! When did this happen?"
"__MUSIC__ Just this week."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, what is the album called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called 'OK Computer - OK not OK'."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of a crazy name huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I think the point is that the second half are B-sides and stuff that was previously unreleased."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I get it. I guess that makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ I thought you were a big fan of theirs, am I wrong?"
"__MUSIC__ No I like them a lot. But the last few albums they put out were not quite my taste."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I get that. Their music has become a lot more experimental in recent years."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! But their older stuff, now that I really loved!"
"__MUSIC__ Well you should check this out then! The old tracks are remasted and the new tracks are mostly b-sides from back when they originally made OK Computer."
"__MUSIC__ I could really get into that. OK Computer might be the best album they ever made!"
"__MUSIC__ For sure! You'll love the first of the new songs, it's called 'I Promise'."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I'm going to check this out today. Where did you get the album?"
"__MUSIC__ I stream it through my Google Play Music account."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, I have an account too. Was it easy to find?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is right there in the new releases section."
"__MUSIC__ Sweet! Thanks for telling me about it!"
