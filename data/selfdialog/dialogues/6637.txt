"__STAR_WARS__ Are you looking forward to the next Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You bet! I thought Force Awakens was a fantastic start to the new trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was much better than the movies from Episodes 1-3."
"__STAR_WARS__ Indeed. I don't think they were that bad, but they just seemed to be lacking."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they did tell a story that you kind of wanted from a Star Wars movie, but most of the characters seemed flat."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they tried a bit too hard, though Natalie Portman was good as Queen Amadala"
"__STAR_WARS__ She was fantastic, Rey from Force Awakens kind of reminds me of her a bit."
"__STAR_WARS__ They really do look similar."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm definitely looking forward to Luke Skywalker and Rey's interactions in the next film."
"__STAR_WARS__ I definitely can't wait for it to come out!"
