"__BASEBALL__ Hey Bill?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes Dad?"
"__BASEBALL__ Hold your popcorn...  You know my dad used to take me to the game all the time when I was your age?"
"__BASEBALL__ Wow were you a Dodgers fan too?"
"__BASEBALL__ I was a fan of the ballpark how it smelled, fresh dodger dog..the smell of peanuts..just so exciting."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm having a great time dad."
"__BASEBALL__ And just when I was your age was when the miracle happened...I caught my very first fly ball."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow all by yourself?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah...with that same glove I gave you. (looks down at the glove he gave to billy last year for t-ball)."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow  I'm hoping that some day happens to me."
"__BASEBALL__ It was kind of strange thinking back on it though...  after I got that fly ball I felt like part of the reason I came to the ballpark was complete."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it was like my dad built it up so much that I felt like there would never be topping that day no matter how many times we went, so we quit going."
"__BASEBALL__ Here dad have some of my popcorn *both smile*"
"__BASEBALL__ Announcer *Next up to batter up is Holiday*"
"__BASEBALL__ Wow look dad he's up!"
"__BASEBALL__ Wow look son its coming right for us!"
"__BASEBALL__ Billy catches the ball*  Wow dad I.... *looks over at his dad then drops it on the ground as another little girl near him gobbles it up*"
"__BASEBALL__ *Dad smiles*  Aww son...oh well there will always be a next time!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah dad, guess we'll have to just keep coming back til I finally get one."
