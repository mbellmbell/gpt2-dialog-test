"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, you think Dak Prescott is gonna win MVP this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think the Cowboys are gonna be really disappointed with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? That guys is awesome!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No he's not, I mean he's ok."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what are you talking about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak did really good last year because the Cowboys running game was so strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, he still was a good quarterback, and could be again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he caught teams by surprise.  They'll be more prepared this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know how you can say that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, running quarterbacks like him, Kaeparnick, they almost always have a glaring weakness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why didn't other teams exploit it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ IT just takes time, you have to get film on them first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I see what you're saying."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's what makes guys like Cam Newton, or Aaron Rodgers so tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they don't really have as much of a passing weakness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but they can still run with the best of em."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I still think the Cowboys are gonna, 'run' away with the NFC!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well you are a mindless, simple drone of the NFL hype machine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever bro, you just wish you had this good of a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The bucs are going all the way this year, I promise you."
