"__MUSIC__ What kind of music did your parents listen to while you were growing up?"
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm writing a paper on how that influences musical taste."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, okay. Hmm. Well, my mother was really into Jewel and Sarah McLachland"
"__MUSIC__ Wow. So I guess your road trips weren't so great as a kid?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. My Dad was into classic rock though--The Beatles, Bob Dylan, that sort of thing."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like that sort of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I still listen to Bob Dylan from time to time. I was happy when he won a Nobel Prize."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. And what sort of things do you listen to now?"
"__MUSIC__ I listen to a lot of jazz. Miles Davis, Nat King Cole, that sort of thing."
"__MUSIC__ That's very different from both of them!"
"__MUSIC__ I can't explain it."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. Well, this will be useful for my paper!"
"__MUSIC__ Have you asked anyone else about this yet?"
"__MUSIC__ A few people! They were all pretty interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Which one had the weirdest response."
"__MUSIC__ There was one girl who said her mom was super into Iron Maiden."
"__MUSIC__ I can't imagine what that childhood must of been like."
"__MUSIC__ And now she listens to ordinary pop music!"
"__MUSIC__ I guess she's being rebellious in her own way!"
