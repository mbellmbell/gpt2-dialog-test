"__STAR_WARS__ Is Greedo the creepiest looking Star Wars villain of all time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say so, Rodian bounty hunters are spooky."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know Greedo shot first right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course I know that. Everybody knows that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Everyone doesn't know that but most people are well aware."
"__STAR_WARS__ You'd think the Mos Eisley Cantina would have a bouncer wouldn't you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He wouldn't last a day with all that villainy and treachery."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's definitely a rough crowd in there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they have a ladies night?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure they do. But I doubt it's the type of nice Tatooine ladies that you'd want to meet."
