"__MOVIES__ So, any other films you've been wanting to see but haven't yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a lot actually... I haven't had a chance to catch too many films of late.  For example, still haven't seen Hardcore Henry."
"__MOVIES__ Hardcore Henry?  Don't think I've heard of that one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it looks really cool!  It's about this guy who wakes up with no memory of his life but he's got a new cybernetically enhanced body and then his wife gets kidnapped by this evil guy and he's gotta fight through a whole bunch of guys to get her back."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so it's like a sci-fi action film then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but what's cool about it is the whole thing is shown through a first person view, kind of a like Doom or Quake."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the guy who directed it did a seven minute music video with the same premise for this group called Biting Elbows and when they saw how well it turned out, he got contacted to do a film."
"__MOVIES__ I'm gonna have to check that out myself."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, it looks really awesome and funny to, cause there's a part in the trailer where he's kicking butt and they're playing Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now.'"
"__MOVIES__ Ha!  I remember when they had that on Shawn of the Dead while they're beating that one zombie down with pool sticks!"
"__MOVIES__ That scene was comedy GOLD."
"__MOVIES__ So, what else you been wanting to see?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, also been meaning to catch the film What We Do In the Shadows."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, I think I've heard of that one.  Is that the one with vampire or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's got this guy who's become a new vampire and he has a documentary crew following him around filming him and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing the trailer for that awhile back and it looked pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard it's gotten a lot of good reviews."
"__MOVIES__ I think there was a scene where they confront of a group of werewolves and they're arguing and insulting each other and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, wonder if that's a little inside jab at Twilight or something."
