"__MOVIES__ I finally saw Knocked Up the other day."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, you must be really behind on your movies."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed I am.  I'm a busy man."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ My impression is that it was a solid film, but probably not quite so deserving of some of the hype."
"__MOVIES__ Critics appreciated that it had a bit more drama to it than they anticipated."
"__MOVIES__ Well, slightly.  I wouldn't call it dramatic by any means, maybe a bit more heart."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Seth Rogen?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think he was a total loser in the movie, but thought the actual hookup could have been better."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I still don't really get how he picked up the girl.  She's hot, he's just average."
"__MOVIES__ Can't that happen in real life?"
"__MOVIES__ It can, I guess, but it's not realistic.  That's my bone with it."
"__MOVIES__ I actually didn't like her character in the movie.  She was very maddening."
"__MOVIES__ That could have been because she was pregnant and her hormones were raging."
"__MOVIES__ That's true.  I think they even call it out in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ It had a tons of other characters from other Judd Apatow movies in it as well."
"__MOVIES__ He seems to always cast his buddies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, they probably work well together and don't cause stress on set."
"__MOVIES__ And probably do a hefty bit of improv as well I'm guessing."
