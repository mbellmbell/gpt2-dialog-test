"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your predictions for this year's football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ College or pro?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL. Who do you think will win the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is the NFC's year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious? Who in the NFC could actually beat the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, so you automatically think the Patiots will be the AFC champion?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, yes I do, but I don't know that there's any NFC contender who could beat the Raiders either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders? Didn't they fizzle out last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only after their quarterback broke his leg! Carr was awesome last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok fine, but that doesn't mean anything for this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Except for the fact that the Raiders now have Marshawn Lynch too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, that's right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that also makes them a force!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I thought you were all about the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, given the way they traded and drafted, I am. I'm just saying I don't see any NFC contenders that will be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this is the Eagles year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles? You must be joking!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. I think it is there time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are delusional! They've never won a Super Bowl and they don't have the personnel to do it this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think now that Wentz has a year under his belt they will surprise everyone."
