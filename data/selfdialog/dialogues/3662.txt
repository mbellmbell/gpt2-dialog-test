"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite band on the 60's?"
"__MUSIC__ Besides the Beattles?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you like the Beattles the best?"
"__MUSIC__ The Beattles are in a class by themselves!  Of course I like them!"
"__MUSIC__ But I really like the Rolling Stones better."
"__MUSIC__ Better? Or as well?  I would almost consider them in two different categories."
"__MUSIC__ Such as?"
"__MUSIC__ Beattles: a great group.  Rolling Stones: a great band."
"__MUSIC__ Ok.  I still put the Stones first.  And if you are going with groups, then what about the Supremes?"
"__MUSIC__ The Supremes, Hermann's Hermits, the Mamas and the Pappas, the list goes on. But you said band."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, okay. Beattles you say are the greatest band.  I say the Rolling Stones."
"__MUSIC__ And we didn't even touch the Beach Boys."
"__MUSIC__ I can't take any band seriously that had Uncle Jesse as a member."
"__MUSIC__ He played drums for them when they were old.  They did some great stuff."
"__MUSIC__ But most of it is that how to stuff a wild bikini kind of songs. Like California Girls."
"__MUSIC__ Because the lyrics to Satisfaction are so profound?"
"__MUSIC__ But the guitar playing . . ."
"__MUSIC__ . . . can't touch Jimi Hendrix."
"__MUSIC__ I said band!"
"__MUSIC__ So you did."
