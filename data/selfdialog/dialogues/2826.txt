"__MUSIC__ Do you know The Planets suite by Gustav Holst?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I've only performed Mars, Venus, and Jupiter."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the other movements?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think so."
"__MUSIC__ Well, did you hear what the CSO is doing with Bell's Brewery?"
"__MUSIC__ No, and which CSO? Every city that starts with a C has a CSO."
"__MUSIC__ Cincinnati. You know, the town we live in."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right, right. What are they doing?"
"__MUSIC__ They are performing each of the movements with beer tastings."
"__MUSIC__ WHAT? How's that work? That's awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Bell's has brewed seven beers inspired by the movements."
"__MUSIC__ What styles are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Mars is a Double IPA, Saturn is a barleywine, Uranus is a Black Double IPA..."
"__MUSIC__ Heh, you said Uranus."
"__MUSIC__ Grow up. Anyway, it'll be fun."
"__MUSIC__ I'm definitely interested. What are the costs?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's $6 per performance for students, and it's in the park."
"__MUSIC__ That's over $40 for six beers and music, seems pricey."
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding? Each beer on tap is like $8 and each concert should be $10 minimum."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, okay, that's a good deal."
