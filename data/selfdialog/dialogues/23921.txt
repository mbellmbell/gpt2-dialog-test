"__SUPERHERO__ Did you like Ben Affleck better as Daredevil, or Batman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Can neither be an answer?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Haha, I'd probably say I belived him more as Daredevil, but Batman v Superman was the better movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree with that, but I just don't think he was a good Batman.  Sure, he looked the part, but..."
"__SUPERHERO__ But, he's been around so long that you had a hard time buying him as Batman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Exactly!  It was like Ben Affleck cosplaying as Batman.  Speaking of Daredevil, what is your favorite Marvel Netflix show?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Hmmm, tough question.  They're all good for different reasons, but I'm going to go with Iron Fist.  I really liked the main character, and the fish-out-water conflict."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm going to say Daredevil-- it's gritty, and Vincent D'onofrio kills it as Kingpin."
"__SUPERHERO__ I would really like to see the 'Defenders,' show up in the MCU."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, that'd be awesome.  Maybe in Infinity War."
