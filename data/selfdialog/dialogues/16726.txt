"__MOVIES__ 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is my happy movie."
"__MOVIES__ Your happy movie? What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Whenever I don't feel great, for whatever reason, it never fails to cheer me up."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that is?"
"__MOVIES__ It's just a naturally uplifting movie. It never takes itself seriously and there are so many funny parts."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, though it has a couple of sad ones."
"__MOVIES__ It does, but they just add to the movie. The rest of it just puts a smile on my face."
"__MOVIES__ Is it the humor?"
"__MOVIES__ Mostly, but there's something else about it, too. I think it's the camaraderie or how they never give up."
"__MOVIES__ Are you sure it's not Chris Pratt?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there's that, too. I admit, I love watching him. He's great-looking and so hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ There's more to the film than that, though, isn't there?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course there is. The cast has awesome chemistry together."
"__MOVIES__ They really do. Everyone seems to fit."
"__MOVIES__ Plus, it's just such a unique film. It doesn't follow a model the way most superhero movies do."
"__MOVIES__ So you like the misfit factor?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think I do. It makes the characters relatable."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. They're kind of like us."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. They may be aliens (except for Peter Quill) but they're funny and flawed. It's easy to understand them."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I bet that's what makes it such a successful movie."
