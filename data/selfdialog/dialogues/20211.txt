"__MOVIES__ Did you see the remake of Miracle?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did.  That was an awesome movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they put so much work into it."
"__MOVIES__ I was watching how they did the sound.  For the American Skates they used smaller skates than the Russian ones."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ To make the impression the Russians were bigger.  So the skakes sounded like a larger body."
"__MOVIES__ Cool.  Kurt Russle was amazing as Herb Brooks."
"__MOVIES__ It's too bad he died during the making of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah unexpectedly too."
"__MOVIES__ But the memorial is he didn't need to see it, he lived it."
"__MOVIES__ That's awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was.  It's incredible how they remade every part of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Remaking the plays and everything."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  Al Michaels re-doing his whole commentary."
"__MOVIES__ All except they said you can't remake the emotion of the final call."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you can hear it switch to live."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome part though.  I mean it gives me goosbumps."
"__MOVIES__ That whole movie does."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of those ones to show to you kids."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I agree, they'll be better for it."
