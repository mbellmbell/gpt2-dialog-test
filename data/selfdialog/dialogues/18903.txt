"__MOVIES__ Who is your least-favorite actor?"
"__MOVIES__ My god, there are so many."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, list them."
"__MOVIES__ Adam Sandler, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller."
"__MOVIES__ Why them?"
"__MOVIES__ They only do the same role every time, it's ridiculous and doesn't show talent."
"__MOVIES__ It's just typecasting. Why be mad at them for taking money offered to them?"
"__MOVIES__ Because it promotes low-class culture, which I can't stand."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with Owen Wilson just because of his obnoxious voice."
"__MOVIES__ What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ You may hate my answer because you like him."
"__MOVIES__ Uh-oh, go ahead."
"__MOVIES__ Sylvester Stallone."
"__MOVIES__ WHAT?"
"__MOVIES__ Everything he does is way over-the-top, it's ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ They're supposed to be! The Expendables are great parody and throwback."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but the early movies aren't. His deliveries are horribly forced."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe in Over The Top."
"__MOVIES__ No, in everything. Over The Top was probably just an experimentation to have the 80s see what they can get away with."
"__MOVIES__ You know... Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot was pretty dreadful. I'll give you that."
