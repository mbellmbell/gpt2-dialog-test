"__HARRY_POTTER__ I finally got my kids to watch some of the Harry Potter movies!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh really, what did they think of them?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well the youngest fell asleep during the first movie. The oldest stayed up almost all night with me watching two of them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did she think of them?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She loved them, she wanted to know what happened to the boy with the 'scarf on his head and the man with no nose.'"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's funny, you've got her addicted to them then?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, you can say that, she keeps asking me to watch more of them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Good job, starting her out young, now you need to plan a movie night and have her watch the rest!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh I know, she will be so excited to watch them, pop corn and movie night with Mommy!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sounds like fun!"
