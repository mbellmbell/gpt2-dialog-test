"__MOVIES__ Even though I don't like fantasy movies in general, I like Harry Potter. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I love the Harry Potter movies. The whole franchise really."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's really tough. I know my favorite book was the fourth, but for movies, it may be the first just because of the nostalgia."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see all of them when they came out?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes. Midnight showings every year!"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new related one."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one."
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen it but I really want to."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see it either. I'd like them to make The Cursed Child into a movie."
"__MOVIES__ That would be pretty cool. I think there is a second Fanstastic Beasts coming out."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I hadn't heard that. Do you know who that actor is?"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't it Eddie Redmayne?"
"__MOVIES__ I think you are right. It's too bad they couldn't incorporate any of the Harry Potter actors."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was kind of a different story and a different world almost."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. But I wouldn't mind seeing Daniel, Emma, or Rupert again."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Emma in Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It was so good."
"__MOVIES__ I love that Disney is remaking all of their animated movies into live action films."
