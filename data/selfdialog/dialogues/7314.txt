"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you think of Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love her! I think she's so progressive and distinct and her music is a good role model for young girls."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Great, because someone gave me some of her music and I don't want it. You can have it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What, you don't like her?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm not a fan. All her music sounds the same and it's so one-dimensional to me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Aw, I'm sorry to hear you say that."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's all good, she's just not my personal taste."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well I would love to take whatever you've got off your hands."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Great! I'll bring you the albums next time I see you."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I can't wait!"
