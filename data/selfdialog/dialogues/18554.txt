"__MOVIES__ Have you seen a movie of Nicolas Cage lately?"
"__MOVIES__ You know what, I have? I saw him in Snowden, though he was not the main character."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really what´s the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ It´s about the real character Edward Snowden and his life."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, thank you. Which one then do you recommend where Nicolas Cage is a main character?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the movie Family Man, it´s from the year 2000 but it has a really good message."
"__MOVIES__ Really, what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ it´s about this person who´s been given the chance to see what would had happen if he had chosen to have a family instead of a mayor career?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow it really sounds interesting. I don´t know what I would do. I really liked him in his movies of National Treasure."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it feel like you are in a conspiracy theory and everything has it´s meanings."
"__MOVIES__ By the way, did you see Nicholas Cage in the movie Knowing?"
"__MOVIES__ No I didn´t, what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ He discovers a major catastrophe that´s going to hit earth and it´s his mission to find out what´s going on."
"__MOVIES__ No wonder, I haven't seen it, it´s not my type. Since I´m not going to see it, you might as well tell me what else happens."
"__MOVIES__ Well I really liked it at the start, kinda like a doomsday, that the earth will one day come to an end, but In reality it was about aliens who wanted to destroy the earth and only same a few kids."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that sounds very dramatic. Did Nicolas Cage saved himself?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he didn´t. That´s the part I didn´t like, all his work on the movie and he dies, only his kids get saved and to like who knows where with some aliens."
"__MOVIES__ For what it sounds, it sounds kinda off. Who else is the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Chandler Canterbury, Rose Byrne, Lara Robinson, etc."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I really don´t know them, but now because you made the movie sound so awful I´m curios to see it, hehe. I´ll let you know what I think."
