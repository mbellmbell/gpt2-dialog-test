"__MOVIES__ Did you hear that they're making a new verison of the movie The Lion King?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's been on Broadway for a long while now."
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't mean the Broadway play. I mean they're making a whole new movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Why?? That movie is a classic! It doesn't need to be redone."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you're thinking - whenever they remake movies the new version is never quite as good."
"__MOVIES__ That is Exactly what I was thinking.."
"__MOVIES__ I think this one should be good though. It's going to be different."
"__MOVIES__ Different in what way? They're changing the storyline?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's not going to be a cartoon. It's going to be with actors, and they have some really good actors on board."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting then. I went to see a similar remake last month of Beauty And The Beast."
"__MOVIES__ How was it? I was thinking about going to see it."
"__MOVIES__ It was nice. My kids really enjoyed it even though they had never seen the original cartoon version."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I will take my kids to see it as well. They didn't seem too interested, but I'll drag them there with me since now I want to see it"
"__MOVIES__ Do you take your kids to the movies often?"
"__MOVIES__ Fairly often. You know kids these days love TV and movies."
"__MOVIES__ I take my kids only once a month. We tend to see family comedies more than animated movies."
"__MOVIES__ The next time you're planning to take your children to the movies please let me know. Maybe we can join up and have one big outing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that would be great! Have you already taken yours to see Guardians of the Galalxy?"
"__MOVIES__ Is it PG rated?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is, so we can all go."
