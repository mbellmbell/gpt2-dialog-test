"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you most excited about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, since I'm a 49ers fan, I'm curious to see how their revamped coaching staffe and personel will do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I suppose. But aren't they still rebuilding?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will make it out of the NFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think the Atlanta Falcons are the best team in the NFC."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true. Who do you think is coming out of the AFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's actually gonna be surprising this year. I can totally see the Raiders going to the Super Bowl."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I think that it's possible that they go all the way to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they could beat the Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I do. Who do you think is winning the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that the Atlanta Falcons will probably win it."
