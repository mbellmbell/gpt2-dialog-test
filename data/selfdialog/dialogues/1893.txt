"__MUSIC__ Yes, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May, and Juan Atkins."
"__MUSIC__ But, don't they themeselves owe a huge debt to Kraftwerk?"
"__MUSIC__ They do. And, they have also acknowledged the influence of Giorgio Moroder on their music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I Feel Love by Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder represents a change in disco music."
"__MUSIC__ That's correct. It's one of the first tracks with a progressive bass line and hard kick drum."
"__MUSIC__ Those elements form the essence of techno music?"
"__MUSIC__ They do. Yet, the key was the 'do it yourself' attitude of the three pioneers."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ In the early 1980s, Casio started releasing cheap synthesizers which were easy to obtain."
"__MUSIC__ Why does that matter?"
"__MUSIC__ Easy access to these machines allowed the pioneers to spend endless hours playing around with musical possibilities."
