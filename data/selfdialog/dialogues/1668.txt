"__MUSIC__ Do you still listen to good music?"
"__MUSIC__ If by good music you mean Eluveitie, yeah!"
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Have you listened to their new album Helvetios?"
"__MUSIC__ I have."
"__MUSIC__ And what did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I really liked it. I thought it was powerful and very story-driven, which was nice."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I thought it had a very warlike, victorious sound."
"__MUSIC__ I honestly haven't heard any Eluveitie I didn't like though."
"__MUSIC__ Do you prefer their instrumental songs or songs with words?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, some of their instrumentals are really catchy or contain a lot of emotion, like Anagantios, but the songs that have words tend to sound more powerful and complex."
"__MUSIC__ I gotcha. I like their harder sounding songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too sometimes, but I like that they have different music for different moods, ya know?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so you can never get tired of them."
"__MUSIC__ I also don't feel like I'm missing out with the instrumentals because I don't speak Gaulish anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Well I don't blame you, seeing as it's basically extinct."
"__MUSIC__ It sure sounds pretty though. What instruments do you favour in their stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm kinda digging the hurdy-gurdy. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the ocarina. Just always been a fan of it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm really glad Eluveitie's using instruments like that that otherwise don't get enough exposure."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I love sharing that with people."
