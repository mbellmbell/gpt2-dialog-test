"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady's had several concussions, do you think he's still going to be any good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he'll have any effects from the concussions, but he is getting old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Think he should throw in the towel and retire?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not after he just won one of the most amazing Super Bowl comebacks ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a pretty impressive comeback. I felt bad for the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I felt sorry for Matt Ryan. He seems like a good guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Matt Stafford? Is he ever going to do anything with the Lions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, the Lions need another receiver like Megatron."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is Megatron?  Must be a nickname."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Calvin Johnson, one of the best wide receivers ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, I remember him. Didn't he retire early?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kind of early, but he was having a lot of trouble with his knees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't imagine playing in the cold weather is very easy on somebody with bad knees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if that's why Barry Sanders retired from the Lions so early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I bet either one of them would have stuck it out for another year if they thought the Lions had a chance of winning a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've seen some pretty cold games between the Packers and the Bears. They've been to a few super Bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Bears have only won one Super Bowl. 1985, and that had more to do with their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I imagine cold-weather teams are better off with a good defense. It must be hard to catch a ball when your fingers are cold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably true. I wonder why Green Bay has never built an indoor stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably because of the mystique surrounding Lambeau Field. A new stadium wouldn't have the same appeal."
