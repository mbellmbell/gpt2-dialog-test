"__DISNEY__ Did you see that movie Big Hero 6?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I loved it!"
"__DISNEY__ I just saw it last night and thought it was great!"
"__DISNEY__ I really like the technology Hero comes up with.  Do you think someone will invent that some day?"
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely!  Don't you think they're already working on it?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure.  I think those movies are just made up."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I think there's a kernel of truth in what they imagine.  I bet someone is already working on it.  Technology moves so fast these days!"
"__DISNEY__ Really?  I don't know mind controlled bots that can create anything you think of? Don't you think that's a little far fetched?"
"__DISNEY__ No way!  You can control the internet with glasses, bots are next!"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe.  Still seems a little out there to me."
