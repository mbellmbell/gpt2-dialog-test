"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever wondered how many species there are in the entire star wars series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I have, I'm guessing there's probably over 10,000."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, even in the bar scene in A New Hope shows like 50 different species."
"__STAR_WARS__ Its really incredible the level of detail they put into that scene with making all those different costumes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah you don't see that anymore in movies. Now a days they just use editing and visual graphics."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish they would make star wars movies like they used to. It was so much more engaging."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it was. Especially how the light sabers looked. I always thought the old light saber fights were cooler than the new ones like in the Clone Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the old light sabers too, but I really liked seeing Mace Windu's light saber for the first time. I had never known a jedi could have a purple one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah his purple light saber was really cool. Its a shame he died later."
"__STAR_WARS__ Mace Windu will always be remembered though. Especially because he was played by Samuel Jackson."
