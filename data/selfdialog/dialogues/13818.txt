"__BASKETBALL__ So, who do you think will win the NBA finals this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Aren't I supposed to say the Warriors will win? Isn't everyone saying that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess they are. Everyone does say it."
"__BASKETBALL__ So doesn't that end the conversation?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It only ends it if you want it to. Do you think the warriors will win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I don't. I'm betting on the Cavaliers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why the Cavaliers? They haven't been given a lot of chance by most people."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, but look at their strengths. They have LeBron James."
"__BASKETBALL__ LeBron James can't win it by himself, can he?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, but he goes a long way."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true. He does go a long way. But can he beat an overall better team like the Warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He did last year. And I don't see why he can't repeat."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, that makes sense to me. What would LeBron and the Cavs need to do to win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the first order of business is obviously that they need LeBron to play an excellent series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, I've got that. But are there any other orders of business?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, LeBron has to get his teammates involved."
"__BASKETBALL__ Involved in what way? Just by getting more assists?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, more assists are good. But he also can't shoot the ball so much. Wouldn't you agree?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, that's how they'd win. I'm far less confident than you that it will actually happen. I'm still betting on the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sounds good. Let's find out."
