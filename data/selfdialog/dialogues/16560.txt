"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you ever see the movie Hustle and Flow?"
"__MOVIES__ With Terrence Howard and Taryn Manning?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a great movie!  I saw it in the theatre."
"__MOVIES__ It came out when, back in 2005?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I remember because I was pregnant with my daughter when I saw it.  The soundtrack was great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it had some great songs in it.  Plus it was a good movie overall."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed the plot.  Did you know Ludacris was in it too?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the rapper?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  He had a role in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't even recognize him.  Huh, that's interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  I thought it was a pretty realistic movie as far as the hip hop culture."
"__MOVIES__ It seemed that way to me, although I wouldn't really know."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, parts of it were sad but it also had some upbeat parts too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it definitely made me feel sad at parts.  I felt bad for the women in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ They were definitely degraded a lot.  That part was discouraging."
"__MOVIES__ But overall it was a great movie and I think it realistically portrayed the rap and hiphop culture."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it did.  So it had some social value as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I would say it had a message."
"__MOVIES__ It's not as well known as I would think it would be."
