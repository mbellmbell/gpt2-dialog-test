"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of the Transformer movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I do like them. I have been watching them since I was a kid so I admit I am biased."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of wish they would bring Shia Labeouf back to the franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree. I think he kind of representative of the series and its a bummer he is no longer in them."
"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about Mark Wahlberg being in them?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he does a good job acing, but there is something like depth missing from his character in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I personally think he is too stereotypical and he doesn't strike me as the mechanical genius type as we are led to believe."
"__MOVIES__ True, and his smoking hot daughter looks like she could play his reindeer in another movie so its hard to buy their familial relationship."
"__MOVIES__ One thing that still impresses me about the series is the visual effects, they are fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Oh for sure, there is so much detail in all of the transformers I couldn't begin to imagine designing much less animating them."
"__MOVIES__ I hope the story of the new one doesn't have optimus prime being bad, I hope he is just playing a part or become corrupted and goes back to being good in the end."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I sure hope he doesn't actually destroy Bumblebee."
"__MOVIES__ I am literally going to cry if Optimus Prime kills Bumblebee, that would be so stupid."
"__MOVIES__ Another thing I like about the Transformer movies is all the cool new cars they always feature."
"__MOVIES__ The latest cars are always in the movies, its great to see the latest model of camaro and other cars."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if there will be a 3D version of the new film, I know there is a 3D version of the last one because I own it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you prefer watching movies in 3D?"
"__MOVIES__ It depends on how I am watching it, in theaters or on big screen tvs I prefer standard to HD but if I'm watching with my virtual reality headset I prefer 3D."
"__MOVIES__ Whats it like watching in virtual reality?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there are several different theaters you can choose from including a theater in space orbiting the earth and a drive in theater on a cliff so its pretty cool."
