"__BASEBALL__ How about last night's game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs?"
"__BASEBALL__ Crazy! I can't believe it went 18 innings."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you know the Yankees and Cubs set a record in that game?"
"__BASEBALL__ Most strikeouts in an MLB game ever. Amazing."
"__BASEBALL__ The Cubs seem to be struggling a bit more than I had expected them to this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Haha, a new World Series losing streak has got to start somewhere, right?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm pleasantly surprised by how well the Arizona Diamondbacks are doing this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they got Greinke last year. Looks like he's settled in nicely."
"__BASEBALL__ Too bad it took a whole season before this. Diamondbacks bullpen in general seems improved."
"__BASEBALL__ They're a nice young team. Could be very competitive if things continue to go their way."
"__BASEBALL__ The Diamondbacks have Goldschmidt at first base. He's a great guy."
"__BASEBALL__ Indeed! Gold Glover, All-Star... would love to see him get a World Series ring with that team."
"__BASEBALL__ How about those San Francisco Giants, eh?"
"__BASEBALL__ Man, the Giants are terrible this year. I swear they should hire clowns off the street to pitch for them."
"__BASEBALL__ Speaking of pitching, did you see the Cubs' Miguel Montero pitch the other night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Position players pitching is one of my favorite things in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Of all the Cubs pitchers who pitched that night, only Montero pitched a scoreless inning."
"__BASEBALL__ Ha! Cubs should pay him more money for playing as a catcher and a pitcher."
"__BASEBALL__ So, who do you think will win the World Series this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm going to go out on a limb and say the Mets. Just because they've been terrible so far and it would be an amazing turn around."
