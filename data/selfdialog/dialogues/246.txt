"__MUSIC__ When you were younger, did you ever listen to Britney Spears or Nsync?"
"__MUSIC__ All the time when I was in school!"
"__MUSIC__ The boyband era was something else, it makes me laugh now when I hear the music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I used to like Backstreet Boys a lot!"
"__MUSIC__ I did not like them as much as Nsync, even though they did sound similar."
"__MUSIC__ There was this battle between Nsync and Backstreet Boys."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, my friend was all about one band and I was all about the other."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't Britney Spears used to date Justin Timberlake from Nsync?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes she did, this was a long time ago though."
"__MUSIC__ They made a cute couple, but did they ever duet together?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a good question, I am unsure if they sang together or not."
"__MUSIC__ I am going to have to look that up, now I am curious."
"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to it now?"
"__MUSIC__ I have not heard any of their old songs in many years."
"__MUSIC__ It has been quite a long time for me as well."
"__MUSIC__ I remember the music videos were not half bad though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I agree, I remember reading Justin TImberlake made fun of himself for the way he dressed in that boy band."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that too, I think he is still a great artist."
"__MUSIC__ He seems to be the only one out of those two groups who took off and made a career."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you never hear about any of the other members."
