"__DISNEY__ It is weird to think of disney in terms of Star Wars , I always think of lucas studios."
"__DISNEY__ Ya it is a little weird. You think disney you think animation first."
"__DISNEY__ Yes like snow white, cinderella etc."
"__DISNEY__ True. But as for disney's Star Wars movie I think they are really doing a great job."
"__DISNEY__ I agree with you, Disney may have been more successful than the epsiode one 2000's set of star wars films."
"__DISNEY__ Oh for sure, in terms of quality."
"__DISNEY__ They went back to what people really loved. Such as storm tropers in suits not cgi."
"__DISNEY__ Disney made the right call on that one for sure!"
"__DISNEY__ I guess I need to start connecting Disney more to Star wars, I am sure with more and more movies being put out by them won't be hard."
"__DISNEY__ I think that is very true. You know disney is going to keep pumping them out."
