"__THRILLER__ I watched that movie Hush last night. I loved it!"
"__THRILLER__ The one with the deaf girl who lives alone in a cabin in the woods?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, that's the one! She gets stalked by a masked killer."
"__THRILLER__ I really liked that one too! In fact, I was thinking of watching it again. It was really suspenseful."
"__THRILLER__ I thought it was pretty amazing how they filmed the whole thing with hardly any dialogue."
"__THRILLER__ I agree, it must be a really difficult challenge to make a film like that, especially for the actress."
"__THRILLER__ Although to be honest, I think it probably caused other parts of the film to suffer."
"__THRILLER__ Really? How so?"
"__THRILLER__ Well for example, they didn't do a great job with the back story of the killer."
"__THRILLER__ Now that I think about it, you're right. He didn't have much motive. But it was still a very enjoyable film!"
