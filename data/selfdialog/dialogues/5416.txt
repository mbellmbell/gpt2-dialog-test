"__STAR_WARS__ Do like star wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do, but the originals are my favorite by far."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the originals, george lucas is great. I did like the newest ones too. Did you not like them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did enjoy them, just not as much as the originals. I liked how forward the females were in the last two."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya , it is an interesting thing to see how differently the females are being portrayed now. I liked having the female hero."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, but I worry now that it seems to be repeating itself. anything done too much gets boring."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose I agree, it could get played out . But then again look how long males have been typically the lead. Decades with luke, han, darth..."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, perhaps this is just where all movies must go now to change up what has become played out. I wonder what george think of this, do you ?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do wonder sometimes if he approves of these new disney versions. I honestly think they are much better than the ones he did in between."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed, the cgi was not a good choice, and jar jar was so annoying. I am glad the star wars franchise has redeemed itself. Looking forward to the next one."
