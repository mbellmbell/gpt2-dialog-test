"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember when the Falcons too Ryan in 2008."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They grabbed him in the second pick right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They grabbed him in the second pick right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think it was the second pick and they only got him for a fraction of what the Bills got EJ for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ EJ is playing with some real vets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but the Bills don't have a single Super Bowl player on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bills has a fresh line up, but that also means they don't have a bunch of bad habits."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess they can improve once their head coach is gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Flacco did get some good playoff wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did have some impressive plays. None of them got Flacco to the finals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's hope Flacco's new contract can get him to the finals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It shouldn't take him more than two seasons to hit the finals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are assuming they keep their head coach. Flacco has never taken to new leadership well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he did interfere with the new running back a few times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dalton and Rogers got overlooked in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't even know their contracts were up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their contracts have both been open since last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Free agents usually don't go for the bidding wars, but I guess they are staying put for now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dalton, can't be that picky. It's not like he's going to get on a playoff team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos were courting him, but I don't know what happened with the negotiations."
