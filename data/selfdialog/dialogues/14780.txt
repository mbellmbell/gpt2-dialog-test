"__ACTION__ What was your favorite Bond movie?"
"__ACTION__ Old or new?  There's been so many."
"__ACTION__ I would just say ones that have been made recently, like the last 15 years or so."
"__ACTION__ So out of the Daniel Craig movies?  Skyfall."
"__ACTION__ See, I always thought that was a bit overrated.  I prefer Casino Royale."
"__ACTION__ Well, that was the first one with him I think.  They worked the kinks out in that movie."
"__ACTION__ I actually thought the plot was better than Skyfall."
"__ACTION__ We'll have to agree to disagree on that one."
"__ACTION__ One thing's for sure: Quantam of Solace was garbage."
"__ACTION__ Oh yeah.  Not a good film."
