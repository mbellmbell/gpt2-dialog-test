"__SUPERHERO__ So, did you see Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I did.. and sadly, I thought it was one of the biggest disappointments movie-wise in my life."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, it had a LOT of live up to."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, even with that, there was just so many missteps here and I can't really begin to count them all."
"__SUPERHERO__ Let me guess the biggest one...."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, Martha!  Save Martha!  Yeah, I'd totally call my mother by her first name if I thought I was about ready to die."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, and Batman's all, 'Oh, wait you have a mom!  That must mean you're not a danger after all!  I shall join forces with you now!'"
"__SUPERHERO__ I know, I mean, it just doesn't make any sense, and I don't care how many essays people try to concoct to justify that sloppy bit of screenwriting.  They've had Batman vs Superman fights many time in the comics that have done it way better."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree.  I did think it was cool see Wonder Woman, though."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, I heard that movie is really great."
