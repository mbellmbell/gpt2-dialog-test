"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was reading about the top draft pick for the 2018 NFL draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's the top pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sam Darnold, a QB from USC. He threw 31 touchdowns last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like he has quite an arm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He completed 67% of his throws, so he's pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he's the top pick, huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not. The article said he might play a couple more seasons at USC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's going to wait for the 2019 season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He still has time to decide, but several people close to him have said he might want to play with USC a couple more seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes sense, if you are doing well on a team, you want to keep that up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but if he gets hurt it could stop his chances from the big leagues."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure his team is going to try and protect such a valuable player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It depends on how well he plays this season. If he does well and is the number one pick, that would be hard to pass up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many yards did he throw last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Over 3,000. So all eyes are going to be on him this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially the scouts. That's a lot of pressure on Darnold."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it's a good pressure to see how well he'd do in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They can always use a good quarterback in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, especially since some of the QB's are getting older and probably going to be retiring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Somehow, I see Tom Brady playing with grey hair and never retiring."
