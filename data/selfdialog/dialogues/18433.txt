"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the movie Ms. Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what a strange sounding title!  What is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's based after a juvenile fiction book, and it's really great!"
"__MOVIES__ It seems like there are so many movies based on juvenile fiction lately."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know!  Like Harry Potter, the Maze Runner, and so many more."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so was it a good movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  It's a fantasy movie so it's definitely not for those into realism."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's kinda hard to explain.  There's this boy and he's wanting to visit this home for children that have special power."
"__MOVIES__ Sorta like the X-Men?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they're not super heros, but it's a similar idea, yes.  They can do things that normal people can't."
"__MOVIES__ So does he get to visit the home?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he does.  He goes on a trip with his dad and finds the home by himself."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds a little boring from what you've said."
"__MOVIES__ No, you'd just have to see it to understand.  He starts getting involved with the children at the home and things going on in their lives."
"__MOVIES__ I wanna say I've seen the trailer at some point.  That rings a bell."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's pretty neat.  And there are villains that they wind up trying to attack together."
"__MOVIES__ So it turns into a hero type story?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I would definitely say that is true.  It is suspenseful and interesting at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, well I might look into it.  I don't usually like fantasy though."
