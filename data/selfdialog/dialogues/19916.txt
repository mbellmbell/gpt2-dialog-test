"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see that movie 'Moonstruck'?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure, who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It had Nicholas Cage and Cher."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that was a great movie, although kind of silly."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, we actually used that movie in our English class in college."
"__MOVIES__ How would that be used in a class?"
"__MOVIES__ We watched the movie and would have to point out the symbolisms and write about them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, that's actually a pretty neat idea."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, at first I didn't like it but as it went on, I was so glad that the professor chose to teach us about symbolism that we might miss."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you can't be a good writer if you don't know the reason behind the object, person, action, etc."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly right, and it really taught me a lot."
"__MOVIES__ So give me an example of something from that movie that was symbolic."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, so of course the movie revolved around the title 'Moonstruck' and the song about when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie."
"__MOVIES__ That's amore!"
"__MOVIES__ So one morning we see Loretta making Ron some french toast with a poached egg in the middle."
"__MOVIES__ Right, I remember that because I tried it for breakfast after watching that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the egg inside the toast represented the moon."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but what was the significance of that?"
"__MOVIES__ In the beginning, everyone was obsessed with death, but the moon brought them all together and gave them life and love again."
"__MOVIES__ The moon connected them all, I never even thought about that."
