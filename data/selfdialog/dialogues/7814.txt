"__POP__ Did you see that Katy Perry has tried to make peace with Taylor Swift?"
"__POP__ No way!  That fight has been going on for song long I don't remember what it was about."
"__POP__ I guess she finally said that she is sorry and forgives her and wants to move on.  She even said she loves her!"
"__POP__ That is a pretty big change, especially since she just released a song about her."
"__POP__ I didn't know she released a song about Taylor Swift."
"__POP__ Yeah, it's called Swish Swish and it sounds pretty much like a fight song to me."
"__POP__ I haven't heard that one yet.  I did hear the Bon Appetit song though, it was ok."
"__POP__ I saw the video for that one.  It is pretty weird."
"__POP__ What makes it so weird?"
"__POP__ Basically its a video where Katy is food and they prepare her dinner."
