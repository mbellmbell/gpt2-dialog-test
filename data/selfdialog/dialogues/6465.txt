"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see that really funny scene in the new Episode II movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one was Episode II?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Episode II is Attack of the Clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ I actually skipped over that one because it got pretty bad reviews."
"__STAR_WARS__ It wasn't as bad as everybody made it out to be."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, so what is this funny scene?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's something that Darth Vader says."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought Vader didn't exist in that time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He does but as an adolescent. He drones on about how much he hates sand!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's not very befitting of a major villain!"
