"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for NFL games again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! Pre-season starts next month."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bucs should have a good year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that. Doug Martin's suspension could hurt them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are stacked with Running Backs and Martin will be back once the suspension is over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Charles Sims is back from his injury to lead the Backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jaquizz Rodgers showed promise last season but I think Sims will get the nod."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bucs were hammered with injuries last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will have a good group of receivers this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they draft any receivers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They drafted OJ Howard from Alabama."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Combine him with Mike Evans and Winston has two great targets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They still have Vincent Jackson too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is getting older and playing less but Adam Humphries doubles as a receiver and tight end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they can get past the Atlanta Falcons they might own their division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the plan. I can't wait to watch all the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might go to a couple in person."
