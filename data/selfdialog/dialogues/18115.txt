"__MOVIES__ Remember how wild the horror movies of the 1980's were?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, best place to watch them were in the theaters. Most of them were campy, but a lot better then horror movies they have these days."
"__MOVIES__ Which one horror movie of that time was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I was big into vampires so I would have to say Lost Boys. i was practically in love with Keifer Sutherland."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's one of the best vampire flicks I've seen to this day. And a bonus is it was filmed in the town where I grew up."
"__MOVIES__ You lived in Santa Cruz? Did you see them actually film the movie there?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I wish. There was a big hubub though when they were filming, lots of areas in Santa Cruz were closed off to the public. I would have loved to grab a peak at Jason Patrick. He was a hunk and a half."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was hot. The character he portrayed was amazing, he oozed attraction. But never as good a vampire as Keifer."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you. The movie had a good story and actually gave me a couple jump scares."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and I loved the fact that Lost Boys also casted the two Coreys. Corey Haim and Corey Feldmen."
"__MOVIES__ I remember them, they were a pretty popular duo in the 1980's."
"__MOVIES__ I had posters of them plastered all over my bedroom walls."
"__MOVIES__ You and hundreds of other teenagers. I was not really into their characters in the movie itself. They were trying to hunt the vampires after all."
"__MOVIES__ Cheers for the vampires. If only they could make great movies like that one these days. I honestly have not seen a decent vampire movie since Lost Boys."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I would agree that one has never been made. Look what you have to compare Lost Boys to and it's a no-brainer."
"__MOVIES__ Amen to that."
"__MOVIES__ Thinking of the movie makes me yearn to visit Santa Cruz once again and walk the old Santa Cruz boardwalk. It's so nostalgic."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Maybe we should hang out this weekend and rent the movie to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Let's do that! We can hang out at my place."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome. Can't wait to see some hot vampire action. I'll bring the popcorn."
