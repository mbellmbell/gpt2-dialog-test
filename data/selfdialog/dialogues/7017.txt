"__ICEHOCKEY__ How in the world did the Penguins lose to the Senators?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They just weren't ready to play."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They looked lackadaisical and sluggish out there."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, I was really disappointed in their energy level."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I tell you what, if they don't bring some intensity for game 2. This serious could be over quick."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree with you! They won't come back if they lose game 2"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I really think this could be their year, if they can refocus"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah I do too, but if they drop that 2nd game then all bets are off."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They really need some leadership from Sidney Crosby."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree. He is their best player and he needs to step up"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And they are playing at home, so they can't afford to lose this one."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They need to come out way more aggresively to even this series up."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah,  you can't lose 2 games at home and expect to win this series"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ This team needs to get more shots on goal in order to be effective"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I couldn't agree more. That aggressivenss needs to be established at the beginning of the game"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Right. If they don't the Senators will really take it to them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No doubt about it. The Senators are playing great as a team right now."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Exactly! The Penguins better get their heads out of their butts in order to turn this thing around."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If not, they will be watching the games on their sofas like we are."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You are so right! I couldn't have said it better myself!"
