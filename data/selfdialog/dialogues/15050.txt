"__ACTION__ Do you like action movies?"
"__ACTION__ I do! I love going to the theatre to see them."
"__ACTION__ What kind of action movies do you enjoy?"
"__ACTION__ I really love action movies with strong female leads, what about you?"
"__ACTION__ I'm really into dystopian action movies, a lot of them start out as books and are translated onto screen really well."
"__ACTION__ I love dystopian everything. Dystopian action films with strong female leads have really blown up in the last few years."
"__ACTION__ Thats so true. The entire action genre has really split into so many different categories, its no longer just blowing stuff up."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I think it's because you can only blow so much stuff up before it gets boring for the viewers."
"__ACTION__ There's definitely some classics that are mostly just blowing things up that I still enjoy though."
"__ACTION__ I agree, you can't beat a classic."
