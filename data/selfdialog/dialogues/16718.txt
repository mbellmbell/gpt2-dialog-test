"__MOVIES__ Have you ever watched Rocky Horror Picture Show?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, it's a classic!"
"__MOVIES__ Awesome! Which character do you think I'm like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, with how much you love attention I would probably go with Frank N. Furter."
"__MOVIES__ Hey now, everyone likes attention every once in awhile!"
"__MOVIES__ You're not wrong, but you might wanna tone it down a little bit."
"__MOVIES__ You're just jealous.You would probably be Rocky; standing there not doing anything."
"__MOVIES__ So rude! Who was the guy that played Rocky anyway? Was he ever in anything else?"
"__MOVIES__ Rocky was played by Peter Hinwood, and I'm not sure if he ever did anything else."
"__MOVIES__ I remember hearing that he quit acting because he thought he wasn't very good at it."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's one way to drop out of acting I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Better than making a million terrible movies at least."
"__MOVIES__ It's like he was the opposite of Tim Curry. That man is amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ Seriously, it's crazy he didn't win any awards for being in Rocky Horror Picture Show."
"__MOVIES__ That really is a shame because I think he did so great in that role."
"__MOVIES__ Aww man now I want to go watch Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's all your fault."
"__MOVIES__ Sorry I have such great taste in movies."
"__MOVIES__ You should be sorry because I actually have work to do, but might put that off if you wanna come over and watch it with me."
"__MOVIES__ I'm totally down to watch it! do we get to throw stuff at your TV though?"
"__MOVIES__ Uhhh, absolutely not. Please don't break my TV."
