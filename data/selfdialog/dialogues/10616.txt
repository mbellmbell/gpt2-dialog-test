"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think rap is better today or back in the 90's"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Definitely back in the 90's"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I feel the same way, Like today rappers don't really say anything that has a lot of meaning or depth."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly like Soulja Boy he is retarded. I can't believe he sold even one album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Definitely and that song Pretty Boy Swag is not exactly Nas or Tupac."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah these new rappers are really lame. I wonder if someone dropped on their by accident when they were a baby."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's too funny. So who is your favorite new rapper out right now?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ that would have meek mills"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I love meek mills. He's from Philly"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm from too home of the cheese steaks."
