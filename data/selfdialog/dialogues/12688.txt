"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't decide who's the best linebacker in the NFL right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The position has some real depth to it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could probably name three guys who stand out at the top of my head."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, well who would you put up top?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the sack master himself, Von Miller."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd probably slot him at #1 too.  Reigning DPOY."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's just so quick.  An OT alone can't seem to stop him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He certainly drives the Denver defense and makes their CB's look better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After Miller, it's a toss-up.  I can't decide."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably Mack, though right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See, I can't decide between him or Kuechly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both are good choices for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would probably say Mack though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On what grounds?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Mack is faster, younger, a bit less banged up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good point.  Kuechly was out much of the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would probably give Luke the edge in covering the TE."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, that's his bread and butter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But for rushing the QB, Mack looks to be the real deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might challenge Miller for DPOY I think."
