"__MOVIES__ Have you seen that movie  'The Switch'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I loved it. Jason Bateman was too funny."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously? I have never really thoguht of him as funny. Although the did ok in Horrible Bosses."
"__MOVIES__ The Switch  was awesome, he couldn't figure out for the longest that the boy was his."
"__MOVIES__ And his face in the bathroom scene when he spills the sample... that was easy to see coming, no pun intented."
"__MOVIES__ He will never look at Diane Sawyer the same again!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a believable enough story line. Lots of women are turning to invetro now adays and it was nice to see a movie address that in a light manner."
"__MOVIES__ It was definatelyh a modern look into parenting and commented on older parents."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think one can call Jennifer Anniston old, she is beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't she 45 when that movie was made?"
"__MOVIES__ Somewhere around there. But so what?"
"__MOVIES__ Biologically speaking, she was a little old to be having a baby. If they were going for realisim, that was never addressed."
"__MOVIES__ I think the movie was more about unrequieted love and not so much hving a baby in ones forties."
"__MOVIES__ Perhaps, but the age issue was addressed much stronger from his characters side than hers."
"__MOVIES__ Are they even the same age in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Circumstances would lead one to believe so."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like how they introduced the biological father, made him appear creepy."
"__MOVIES__ How did he appear creepy?"
"__MOVIES__ In the cafe, he was telling her that he has donated before and wondered how the baby was doing and started hitting on her."
"__MOVIES__ True, I never got that the first time I watched it, but there are people that are serial reproducers. Kinda creepy now cause he did say he always knew this day would arrive."
