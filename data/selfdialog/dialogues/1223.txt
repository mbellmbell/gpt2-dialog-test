"__MUSIC__ Have you been following the whole Nicki Minaj, Remy Ma confrontation?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I have,  It seems like it had got pretty serious."
"__MUSIC__ Some of the things said were a little too personal."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that Nicki Minaj had said something about Remy Ma leaving her son."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that too. Things like that have led to violence in the past."
"__MUSIC__ I just hope that they learned a lesson from the whole Notorious Big, Tupac fight."
"__MUSIC__ I know that was a tragedy that should've been avoided. In the end everyone lost by the passing of both icons."
"__MUSIC__ It's so sad and sometimes people like to start confrontation because it sells records."
"__MUSIC__ Drama is the number one most marketed product in America media."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but once famous people have drama it bleeds down to their followers who are more prone to take action."
"__MUSIC__ I think thats what happened in the Notorious Big, Tupac feud."
"__MUSIC__ It makes no sense to be so powerful and still fall victime to such pettiness."
"__MUSIC__ Hip hop artist of their stature need to be better role model for the fans who idolize them."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  They have more influence on our children than we do at a certain age."
"__MUSIC__ I love hip hop, but I'm in no way a fan of glorifying violence and ignorance."
"__MUSIC__ I hear you. Either Nicki or Remy needs to be the bigger person and stop the feud."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think it was smart for Nicki to start with Remy in the first place. Remy just got out of prison."
"__MUSIC__ She allegedly shot another female, am I right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I don't remember what it was over, but Nick doesn't have a status like that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she needs to be smart and not try to be someone who she isn't."
