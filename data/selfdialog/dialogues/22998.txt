"__DISNEY__ i just bought the Frozen soundtrack."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really I bet I have heard each song a bunch of times."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite is probably In Summer with Olaf singing."
"__DISNEY__ I just watched the movie again and Olaf still makes me laugh."
"__DISNEY__ I hope he is in the second movie."
"__DISNEY__ Ya I heard that is not coming out for a long time."
"__DISNEY__ How did you feel about Cristoph and Anna?"
