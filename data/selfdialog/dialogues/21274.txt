"__THRILLER__ What is one of the freakiest thriller movies you've ever watched lately?"
"__THRILLER__ I watched Split with my family. It was okay. Didn't know it was an M. Night Shyamalan movie until I was already in the movie!"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah M Night made a few good movies with a twist in my opinion."
"__THRILLER__ This one reminds me of Sybil, who i think had multiple personalities also. Pretty much the same kinda split personalities genre with an M Knight flavor if you will."
"__THRILLER__ I personally think James Mc Avoy was okay, but I told my wife when we watched the movie that I think Joaquin Phoenix would've been a better cast than James."
"__THRILLER__ I thought so too and surprisingly he was actually considered first for the role before James but he was unavailable at that time."
"__THRILLER__ I thought it was more of a mixture of thriller, and a bit of horror also."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, without giving too much spoiler, I guess you're right kinda a bit of a horror movie towards the end although not in a ghost kinda way."
"__THRILLER__ True. I wonder if they have a sequel based on the last minute of the show."
"__THRILLER__ We shall see. M Night's movie tend to have that open ending sometimes."
