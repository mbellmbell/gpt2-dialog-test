"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi, how are you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm great. How are you? What did you do over the weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm good. I took my family to the movies to see the new Diary of a Winpy Kid Movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, Diary of a Wimpy Kid the Long Haul, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's the one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It really wasn't very good. They have an entirely new cast and the previous cast was much better than the current one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh really? That's too bad. I read that it received a rating of around 17 percent on rotten tomatoes."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Unfortunately, I read that after I had already watched it in the theater."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Doesn't Alicia Silverstone play the mother?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, she does. Every time I saw her, I thought about that movie she was in a long time ago, Clueless."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I loved that movie!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too, it was fantastic."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What year was Clueless released? I can't remember."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Clueless came out in 1995 I think. I remember because I know what grade I was in at the time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Paul Rudd was great in that movie too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I agree, he played her step brother. The one she ended up being in love with at the end."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, I hadn't seen that coming at the beginning."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, it was fun to reminisce about a great 90s movie but getting back to Diary of a Winpy Kid, I would skip it if I were you."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Thanks, I will. I'll wait for the next family movie to come out."
