"__BASEBALL__ Is Cliff Lee a hall of famer?"
"__BASEBALL__ Are you asking if he's in the hall of fame or if we think he should be based on his stats? He's not in the hall of fame."
"__BASEBALL__ Well yeah, I mean if he's retired and doesn't come back. Is he a hall of famer in your opinion?"
"__BASEBALL__ DId he even officially retire? Last I heard he was rehabbing but that was a couple years ago now. I'm not sure."
"__BASEBALL__ I looked, he did retire last February."
"__BASEBALL__ 3.52 career ERA doesn't scream hall of famer to me but man that doesn't even seem right."
"__BASEBALL__ That was the crux of my argument too. When you take into account his dominance that number didn't seem right."
"__BASEBALL__ He had a heck of five year run, but that probably isn't enough."
"__BASEBALL__ He has less than 150 wins too. Not looking great. I mean how can a guy that was so good seem so average in retrospect?"
"__BASEBALL__ He did get a ring though, so he has that going for him."
"__BASEBALL__ That five year run was Koufax-esque in an era where players were supermen."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that's gotta count for something. But hof is usually compiled stats and you got 300 wins as a benchmark."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm looking at this article that has him in the neighborhood with Whitey Ford, Lefty Gomez, and Don Sutton."
"__BASEBALL__ Ford has all those championships though, Sutton got his 300 wins, Gomez played in the era before fire was invented lol tough to compare."
"__BASEBALL__ Baseball reference has similarity scores comparable to Jered Weaver and John Lester. Would you put either of those guys in the hall?"
"__BASEBALL__ Weaver no, Lester maybe but again, the rings. Plus the guy had cancer, that's pretty impressive."
"__BASEBALL__ The more I read I gotta say no and just today I thought he was a pretty sure thing."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it really looks more like hall of very good for Lee. Still a solid career, just no hall of fame."
"__BASEBALL__ Tend to agree, but it's still just so surprising."
"__BASEBALL__ You wonder what could have been if he didn't get injured."
