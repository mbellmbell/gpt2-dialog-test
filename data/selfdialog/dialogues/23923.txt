"__SUPERHERO__ Did you see both Wonder Woman and Superman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, and I saw all Superman movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Which did you like better?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Wonder Woman by far."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too, but did you hear about the wage gap?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Nope, what happened?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Henry Cavill made $14 million for his first stint as superman but Gal Gadot made just $300,000 per each of her three Wonder Woman movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's crazy, but I understand."
"__SUPERHERO__ How??"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, Superman is well-established in the superhero movie business and was easily going to make $500 million, whereas Wonder Woman is not and is a gamble. He is also well-established as an actor, while she's a famous model.  So, it makes sense."
