"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked the story line and the Rey was my favorite character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya I thought she was awesome. I liked how it seems she know about the Force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya I think there is more to her story we don't know about."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya same here. I can't wait to find out if she is related to Luke or someone else."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what they will do about Leia's character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ ya it's sad that Carrie Fisher died."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya I wonder if they will address that in the next movie. I forget what it is called."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's called The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right. I wonder if that person is Rey."
