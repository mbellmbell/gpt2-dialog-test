"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you started using Spotify yet?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually signed up a month ago! It's changed the way I listen to music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I love being able to download playlists for listening on-the-go."
"__MUSIC__ Have you discovered any new bands on Spotify?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually have been obsessed with this group called Dove & The Wolf."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of them. Tell me more about them!"
"__MUSIC__ It's two French women, and they make dreamy pop music. It's very relaxing music."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds great. I'll have to check them out."
"__MUSIC__ What about you? What have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you know how much I love Andrew Bird."
"__MUSIC__ I listened to him a bit in high school, but what new material does he have?"
"__MUSIC__ His latest album 'Are You Serious' is a masterpiece."
"__MUSIC__ He's quite the wordsmith!"
"__MUSIC__ And playing the violin like he does?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you been to any concerts recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, yes! I just saw Conor Oberst. He's fantastic on recordings, but even more so live!"
"__MUSIC__ I love Bright Eyes! His solo stuff is pretty good too."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed! He's just an all-around genius. Our generation's Bob Dylan."
"__MUSIC__ Check out Dove & the Wolf and you've inspired me to go listen to some Bright Eyes."
"__MUSIC__ Will do! Talk to you later!"
