"__SUPERHERO__ Did you see Suicide Squad yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Not yet.  I heard it was disappointing."

"__SUPERHERO__ I heard it was a bit violent and over the top."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, it wasn't your prototypical superhero movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Of course not.  The main guys are bad guys."
"__SUPERHERO__ I will say that I think Will Smith was miscast as Deadshot."
"__SUPERHERO__ Anything that he does these days is bound to fail I'm afraid."
"__SUPERHERO__ But man, Harley Quinn?  Wow, she's a stunner even if she's crazy."
"__SUPERHERO__ I could support that."
