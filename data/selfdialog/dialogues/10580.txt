"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You've seriously never heard of Public Enemy?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No man, I don't think so."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They're like one of the most popular rap groups of all time!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, rap is young people music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Almost a third of their studio albums are older than me, that's not exactly young."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You really like them?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I mean, I have their song Can't Truss It stuck in my head right now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You should introduce me to them sometime."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah definitely. I think we can skip their album It Takes a Nation but a couple of my favourite albums of theirs are Yo Bum Rush the Show and Fear of a Black Planet."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Sounds good!"
