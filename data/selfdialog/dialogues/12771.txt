"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the league is too stacked for certain teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mostly those in the AFC north"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who specifically? I can't think of any"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots and Ravens obviously!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I suppose about the Patriots but the Ravens aren't very good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait, aren't they your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're a bit biased here?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright full disclosure, yes, I've been a Ravens fan for years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well i guess that makes sense, they did win the superbowl recently"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was a Raven's fan long before they won the superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well then I guess that makes you a real fan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate it when people cheer for only the best teams in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are called bandwagon fans I believe"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate those kind of fans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh well I hope your team does well, I don't particularly watch football"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks! I hope the Ravens end up winning the superbowl"
