"__MOVIES__ I can't tell you how much I LOVE the Princess Bride."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Me too!"
"__MOVIES__ What's your favourite part?"
"__MOVIES__ I love the fire swamp with the ROUS's. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, so many good scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I love the part where the old lady is like, 'bow to the queen of slime!' and the whole mad max thing, 'get back witch!'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh, those are great. What about the wine scene?"
"__MOVIES__ How could I forget?! 'so CLEARLY, the poison must be in front of you!'"
"__MOVIES__ I can't picture anyone else in that role."
"__MOVIES__ I can't picture anyone other than Andre the giant as the giant."
"__MOVIES__ You know what? I never knew that the grandpa was Peter Faulk who played Columbo."
"__MOVIES__ Who?"
"__MOVIES__ Columbo, liutenant Columbo on that old murder mystery show."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, who knew! I just knew him as that guy who plays the grandpa for a few minutes."
"__MOVIES__ I mean I thought he did a great job of playing grandpa, but it's cool to now have that background and be able to recognize him as the guy who sneakily figures out who done it."
"__MOVIES__ I heard he has a glass eye."
"__MOVIES__ He does, it's super hard to notice, not that you have much opportunity to in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm so glad I lived my life familiar with that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I seriously can't imagine living without it. I mean, the Pit of Despair??"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I love Mel Smith as the albino."
