"__SUPERHERO__ So who is the best Batman of all time?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Hmmm, let me think about it...maybe Christian Bale?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Really, my favorite was Adam West."
"__SUPERHERO__ Dude that is old. How can you say that? He made Batman goofy."
"__SUPERHERO__ Not goofy, cool in a different way....retro think 1960's."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, but Batman isn't supposed to dance or be silly."
"__SUPERHERO__ But if you think about it Adam West still played it cool."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, Ben Affleck couldn't do that unless you wanted a douchy Batman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Definitley my least favorite."
"__SUPERHERO__ Next to George Clooney....who was awful."
