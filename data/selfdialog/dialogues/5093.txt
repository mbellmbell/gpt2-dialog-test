"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, I've seen all of them except the 8th one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The one that's out in theaters now?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Right, I haven't seen that one yet."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Which one -- of the ones you've seen -- is your favorite?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I probably enjoyed the 1st one the most, but I liked them all. Some were better than others, though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Which one did you like the least?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think the second one is probably my least favorite."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, I agree. I can't even really remember the second one very much."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's the one where Brian teams up with Roman Pearce as undercover cops. Vin Deisel and Michelle Rodriquez aren't in it."
