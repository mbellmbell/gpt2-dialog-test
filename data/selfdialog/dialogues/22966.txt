"__DISNEY__ I have heard people say the Gargoyle in Hunchback of Notre Dame is really Pumbaa from The Lion King ."
"__DISNEY__ People are mistaken. That statue actually exists."
"__DISNEY__ Like in real life at the cathedral?"
"__DISNEY__ Exactly if you went to paris and saw it in person you would see it is a real life gargoyle."
"__DISNEY__ But maybe that is what inspired  the looks of Pumbaa from The Lion King"
"__DISNEY__ Well what year was lion king out?"
"__DISNEY__ I think 1994 was when Lion king was released."
"__DISNEY__ So that theory can't work because  hunchback was in 1996."
"__DISNEY__ Unless the creators were already aware of the statue and maybe got inspiration for it prior to hunchback's release."
"__DISNEY__ That could be. The cathedral was standing long before lion king."
