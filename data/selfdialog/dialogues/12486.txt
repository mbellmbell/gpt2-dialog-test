"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like there's a pretty good group of safeties in the league right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some real good players for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not a Lonnie Rott, but some good ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the position has changed so much.  Can't hit guys like you used to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably why nobody wants a safety in the box anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It helps to have good run skills, but you need to force turnovers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why I would probably take Eric Berry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great choice and a total inspiration."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the way he came back cancer is simply incredible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And came back better!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a true ballhawk for sure.  Wish he was on my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Landon Collins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great pick by the Giants.  Just seems to be around the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember him falling in the draft a bit too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's just skilled in all facets of the game with tons of room to grown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd also be remiss to not include Earl Thomas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't he get injured though?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he did, but he completes that secondary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle really suffered without him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, they need him back healthy."
