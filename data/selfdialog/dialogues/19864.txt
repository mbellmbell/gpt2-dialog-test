"__MOVIES__ I need a good horror movie to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I would recommend watching 'The Ring.'"
"__MOVIES__ I've already seen that one. It was terrifying!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's probably the scariest movie I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I never finished watching it because I had to leave the movie theater because it was so scary."
"__MOVIES__ No way! That's actually pretty funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you have any other good horror movies to recommend?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like the 'Blair Witch Project.'"
"__MOVIES__ What's that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a bunch of kids who go into the woods to film a school project on a witch."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds scary. Was it as scary as The Ring?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it wasn't nearly that scary."
"__MOVIES__ That's good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you should be able to handle it."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, thank you! I'll watch it tonight."
"__MOVIES__ You should! It's a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know how long it is?"
"__MOVIES__ I think roughly two hours."
"__MOVIES__ Great. That's just what length I'm looking for."
"__MOVIES__ Glad I could be of assistance"
