"__STAR_WARS__ Have you heard that they are making a new movie about Han Solo when he was younger?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is crazy. I wonder what will happen in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they will show how Han first met Chewie."
"__STAR_WARS__ They could also show how Han won the Millennium Falcon for the first time."
"__STAR_WARS__ How funny would it be if they had him making the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha, that would be funny. I just hope they stay true to his rogue like character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely. They need to go back to the Han who shot Greedo first instead of the Han that George Lucas tried to sanitize."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard Donald Glover is in the movie playing a young Lando Calrissian."
"__STAR_WARS__ That should be good. Woody Harrelson is in it too."
"__STAR_WARS__ I never thought I would see him in the Star Wars universe, but I guess anything is possible now."
