"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, who is the greatest quarterback of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know you want me to say Joe Montana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because you know I'm a 49er fan, and you want to disprove his greatness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not that mean, but he was rather slow with an average arm--what's so great about that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Four Super Bowl Wins, no losses, MVP three times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, mediocre quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl and the winning quarterback is usually the MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Montana could read the defense, throw with deadly accuracy to an open receiver, and lead that receiver into long gains after the catch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K. the guy was pretty good.  Would you consider anyone else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Dan Marino probably was the best passer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, for an immobile guy to just stand there and throw for that many yard is pretty impressive.  How about Joe Namath?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you trying to sucker me?  Joe Namath's win in Super Bowl III changed the history of professional football, but he only threw for about 200 yards in that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the game was different then--not the big passing yardage, but Namath good, but not the greatest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I have to consider Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think.  Seven Super Bowl appearances."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought the Super Bowl was not a necessary criterion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K, but seven?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He lost two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you're never going to back down from Joe Montana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, there's Steve Young."
