"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to Opera music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not purposely. Only by accident."
"__MUSIC__ My father loves opera."
"__MUSIC__ How can anyone love opera?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know myself. It is like fingers on a chalkboard."
"__MUSIC__ I can imitate the singers and sound just as good by holding a high note and putting my arms out."
"__MUSIC__ Well I wouldn't go that far. Ha ha!"
"__MUSIC__ I wonder how people nowadays get interested in it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know. At least with my father there wasn't much music around."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, my grandparents think what I listen to is terrible."
"__MUSIC__ There is one piece of opera music strangely enough that I actually do like."
"__MUSIC__ What is it?"
"__MUSIC__ The marriage of Figaro."
"__MUSIC__ Oh is that where they sing Figaro, Figaro, Fiiii gaaa rooooww!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. You do do a great job."
"__MUSIC__ I told you. Not too hard."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that one quite often as a kid because my father played it in the house."
"__MUSIC__ Well if it is something you constantly heard I can understand if you like it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it really isn't too bad. Maybe you can listen to it sometime."
"__MUSIC__ Umm, I don't think so."
