"__MUSIC__ What are your feelings about Meatloaf?"
"__MUSIC__ I love meatloaf. Just make sure to let it rest for ten minutes before you cut it or it'll fall apart."
"__MUSIC__ No... the band."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I'm totally kidding."
"__MUSIC__ One thing I love about them is that it proves ugly people can be successful in music."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of rude."
"__MUSIC__ Well, think about it. He's ugly. Find me another ugly celebrity who isn't typecast."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of drummers are ugly."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, a singer who is the frontperson of their band. Ugly. Go."
"__MUSIC__ Fine, you win."
"__MUSIC__ Now, what do you think about their music?"
"__MUSIC__ I only know a handful of their songs, but I like what I hear."
"__MUSIC__ I like that they are kind of the Netflix of music."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Netflix has allowed shows to tell a story in as much or as little time as needed, rather than the typical length."
"__MUSIC__ So?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of their songs are well over the typical three-to-five minute radio song. They're extensive and allow for great storytelling."
"__MUSIC__ Well, from what I remember, the lyrics are pretty repetitive."
"__MUSIC__ 'Paradise by the dashboard light' does spend like three minutes repeating the same lyrics, true."
"__MUSIC__ But yeah, they're definitely fun to listen to."
