"__MOVIES__ Have you watched any movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, last night I watched Howl's Moving Castle for the first time."
"__MOVIES__ Howl's Moving Castle? I've never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a Ghibli Studios animated movie."
"__MOVIES__ Animated movie? So, it's for kids?"
"__MOVIES__ It would be good for kids, but also very entertaining for adults."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a wizard, a cursed girl, a fire demon, a magical castle, and learning to love yourself and others."
"__MOVIES__ Wow - that sounds pretty deep!"
"__MOVIES__ It is, but it's also a lot of fun."
"__MOVIES__ So, are there any famous people behind the voices?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! Christian Bale, Emily Mortimer, Billy Crystal, and Lauren Bacall are the voices of the main characters."
"__MOVIES__ So, it's in English even though it's a Japanese movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Ghibli studios has made several movies with English-speaking viewers in mind."
"__MOVIES__ So, no subtitles or delayed speech?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. There are a couple of images of Japanese writing that has translation at the bottom of the screen, but otherwise, it looks like it was created in English from the start."
"__MOVIES__ Fire demons and wizards sounds a little dark."
"__MOVIES__ It does have some dark themes in it, but it is a colorful, fun, well-rounded movie."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds fun - I'll check it out. What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it! Let me know what you think when you see it!"
