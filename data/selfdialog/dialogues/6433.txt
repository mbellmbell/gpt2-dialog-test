"__STAR_WARS__ I gotta say, I don't think OSHA exists in the Star Wars universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably not, as it takes place 'A long time ago' and in 'A galaxy far, far, away.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ True, but even though, I don't there's anything equivalent over there.  Think about how many structures you got that are built with HUGE bottomless shafts never to them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, like Cloud City, the Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I know, safety violations aplenty!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Course, I don't expect some place called 'The Death Star' to be the most worker environment to being with."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's that's true. Then they got that thing in The Phantom Menace that's built by a huge pit, with NO safety rails or anything."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but that have those rotating force field things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, don't even get me started on how ILLOGICAL those things were."
"__STAR_WARS__ I won't.  I know how you get."
