"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of the band The Eagles?"
"__MUSIC__ I have.  I really like their music."
"__MUSIC__ It's tough to pick a favorite song but I'd have to say mine is Hotel California.  What is yours?"
"__MUSIC__ I like that one too but to be different I'll pick Life in the Fast Lane."
"__MUSIC__ Whenever I hear that on the radio and I'm driving I always end up driving way too fast!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too!  They have a lot of great songs and you know, they are still great today."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean.  I think it is because each member of the band is super talented in his own right."
"__MUSIC__ The songs they wrote back in the day could really touch your soul."
"__MUSIC__ They were real too.  They were about stuff everybody goes through not like the music out there now."
"__MUSIC__ I hear you on that."
"__MUSIC__ I brought them up because I heard that they are going on tour again soon."
"__MUSIC__ Even after Glen Frey's death?  Who'd they get to replace him as if anybody ever could?"
"__MUSIC__ They actually got his son to do it.  I think that is very very cool."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely.  I would love to hear how he sounds. I hope he can sing just like his dad."
"__MUSIC__ They are also tapping Vince Gill to tour with them."
"__MUSIC__ I bet he'll do the songs with all the high notes in them."
"__MUSIC__ I bet you are right."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if they'll release a new album or at least a new song or two."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know but if they do I'm sure it will be great!"
"__MUSIC__ I hope they do it in rock style instead of country."
