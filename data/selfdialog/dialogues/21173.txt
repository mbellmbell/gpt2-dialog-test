"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see 127 Hours?"
"__THRILLER__ Doesn't strike a bell."
"__THRILLER__ It's the one where the guy cuts off his arm because he trapped himself in a canyon."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I remember now.  That was based off a true story."
"__THRILLER__ It was pretty amazing he somehow lived through that."
"__THRILLER__ Can you imagine what it would be like trying to cut off your own arm?"
"__THRILLER__ I couldn't do it."
"__THRILLER__ Most people probably couldn't.  He did it with a little knife."
"__THRILLER__ It's a wonder he didn't die.  You should probably watch it again sometime."
"__THRILLER__ I think I need to."
