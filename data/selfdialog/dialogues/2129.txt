"__MUSIC__ Hi Thelma Lou, what are you doing?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, hello Barney, I am just going through my old record collection."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, can I look through them with you?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course you can!"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know you had Elvis records!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh sure, Barn, I love Elvis!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  Which is your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a hard question, but I think I will go with Devil in Disguise.  What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Oooh, that's a good one.  I think I will pick Heartbreak Hotel."
"__MUSIC__ Another good choice there Barn, did you know that he sold an estimated 600 million albums world wide?"
"__MUSIC__ 600 million, that's incredible!  Wow!"
"__MUSIC__ He also holds the record for top ten hits with 38!"
"__MUSIC__ That is so impressive, didn't he sing more than just rock and roll?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he also sang country and gospel as well."
"__MUSIC__ He was very talented."
"__MUSIC__ He sure was, he was loved by millions and millions."
"__MUSIC__ It's too bad that he died, I bet he still had some great music left in him."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  It is sad.  His estate occassionally allows a new song or remix of his to be released, but it isn't the same."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like 'A Little More Conversation' that came out a few years ago, it was pretty catchy!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes it was, I have that on CD over here, let's go listen to it!"
