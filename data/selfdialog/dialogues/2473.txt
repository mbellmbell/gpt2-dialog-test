"__MUSIC__ Did you hear about Meatloaf's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ He has a new one? What's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ Braver than We."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any of the music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there were some clips on Amazon.  He still has the golden voice."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds great! Did he work with Steinman again?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep! And you can hear the signature style in some of the songs."
"__MUSIC__ That's great.  I was a little disappointed with Welcome to the Neighborhood."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I mean, it had some great tracks, but it just wasn't the Steinman sound, was it."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly.  Speaking of Steinman, did you know that he did a womens group project?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't.  What was it."
"__MUSIC__ Pandora's Box."
"__MUSIC__ So, he wrote a bunch of songs for some women?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and for the singers, he picked women that had operatic training so that they could hit the notes."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds amazing."
"__MUSIC__ It is.  There's one song, 'The Future Just Ain't What it Used to Be' that is so sad and yet hopeful, you know?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean kind of like that old song, 'Hello Marsha'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, a little, but in Future, it has this super powerful vocal, and it's almost like the sound you would expect in a southern church.  The vocalist really belts it out."
"__MUSIC__ Like Halestorm?"
"__MUSIC__ Kinda, yeah.  Strong vocal and completely unapologetic."
