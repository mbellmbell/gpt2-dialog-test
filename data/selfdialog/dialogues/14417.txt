"__HORROR__ hey, have you seen the friday the 13th remake they did a few years ago?"
"__HORROR__ unfortunately i have."
"__HORROR__ come on, it wasn't that bad.  it had it's flaws, but i thought it was ok."
"__HORROR__ it just seemed a bit campy."
"__HORROR__ Isn't that what the friday movies always were?"
"__HORROR__ to some extent, but this one was over the top.  like the guy having sex with the girl and says 'you have perfect nipple placement.'"
"__HORROR__ yeah, that was a bit odd.  seemed like they might have tried to put too much in one movie as well.  kind of skimped over jason's mother"
"__HORROR__ yeah, that was the cool thing about the first movie a lot of people don't remember.  Jason's mother was the killer, not jason."
"__HORROR__ I would have like to see more of her and more of the back story of jason as a child."
"__HORROR__ yeah, someone should do a movie on her back when jason was still alive and a child."
