"__MUSIC__ What do you think about the new Loerde album?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's ok, I wasn't blown away by it though"
"__MUSIC__ I really, really, like it!  And pop music isn't usually my thing but I think this album is really good!"
"__MUSIC__ I do like how she does more experimentation on this album. I'll give her that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm surprised by your lukewarm reaction. I thought you'd feel the same way I do."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, its not terrible. Overall I'd say it's a good album but not an excellent one."
"__MUSIC__ Personally, I'm blown away the whole album is electrifying. I actually get goosebumps on some songs."
"__MUSIC__ I do appreciate her storytelling, I think she has a true gift for words."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, if she didn't pursue a career as a musician,I think she could have one as a writer."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe she'll do both. It wouldn't be the first time a musician has crossed over into writing."
"__MUSIC__ True, but I think she likes to use music and her voice to emphasize the words."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite track?"
"__MUSIC__ Sober II (Melodrama), for sure. It is the perfect way to start closing out the album."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that track a lot. I don't understand why she didn't end the album with that instead of Supercut and Perfect Places."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she definitely should have switched the order. Supercut, then Perfect Places, and ending out with Sober II."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she's still new to all of this, but I feel like a producer should have noticed that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it really distracts from the story she is trying to tell. What is your favorite track?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Liability. I feel like it was so raw and full of emotion."
"__MUSIC__ I completely agree, the lyrics are almost haunting."
"__MUSIC__ I think she's really going to go far in the industry. She's got talent, I feel like she just needs to fine tune it a bit."
