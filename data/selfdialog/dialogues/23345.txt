"__DISNEY__ What is your least favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ My least favorite are any of the movies where a parent dies."
"__DISNEY__ That is a lot of Disney movies. Bambi, Dumbo, Lion King, Frozen and I think a few others I'm forgetting."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it seems to be a theme. Bambi made me really sad when I was a little child."
"__DISNEY__ I understand. The Lion King used to make my little brother cry every time he watched it."
"__DISNEY__ I bet most of the main characters from Disney are missing a parent."
"__DISNEY__ It's a sad trend. My brother enjoys Disney movies and he cried a lot when he was a kid because of things like that."
"__DISNEY__ Wreck-it Ralph and Zootopia are kind of sad too but in different ways."
"__DISNEY__ Wreck-it Ralph is pretty upbeat."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, nothing too sad happens at least."
