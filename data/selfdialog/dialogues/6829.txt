"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have a favorite Star Wars scene?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh my, I have many. The first one that comes to mind is from The Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm, the Luke storyline with Yoda, or the Leia/Han storyline?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Leia and Han. That scene in the cockpit when Han corners Leia and makes her all uncomfortable."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a great scene. I loved it when she called him a scoundrel, and he took it as a compliment."
"__STAR_WARS__ Isn't that just like a charming scoundrel?"
"__STAR_WARS__ And right when things were getting interesting, here comes Threepio to interrupt."
"__STAR_WARS__ After Han realized Leia had slipped away, I thought Han was going to strangle 'Goldenrod' right then and there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Threepio has such a way of...getting in the way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Anthony Daniels played him perfectly."
