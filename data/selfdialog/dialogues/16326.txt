"__ROCK__ I wish rock music was the same as it used to be."
"__ROCK__ I know!  What happened to the days of Nirvana and Soundgarden?"
"__ROCK__ Aren't both of those lead singers dead?"
"__ROCK__ They are.  And that is a terrible tragedy.  They would be embarrassed by the songs on the radio today."
"__ROCK__ I'm sure.  Who wants to listen to rap songs all the time that repeat words the whole song?"
"__ROCK__ I know.  I just put in my Silverchair CD and ignore mainstream radio."
"__ROCK__ Sirius makes that so much easier.  Did you know that Pearl Jam even has their own radio station now?"
"__ROCK__ Really?  Does it only play Pearl Jam songs?"
"__ROCK__ It does.  But a lot of it is the live stuff that you haven't heard.  It's awesome."
"__ROCK__ I'm going to have to check that out."
