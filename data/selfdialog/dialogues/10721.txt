"__FASHION__ Have you seen the new designs for wedding dresses this year?"
"__FASHION__ No! When did they come out?"
"__FASHION__ Last week, I believe.  Would you like to see them?"
"__FASHION__ Sure!  I can't believe it's only 3 months until my own wedding."
"__FASHION__ Are you thinking of a traditional wedding gown or a more modern look?"
"__FASHION__ I like the idea of a simple, A-line dress with lace."
"__FASHION__ That sounds lovely.  Long or short sleeves?"
"__FASHION__ I was actually thinking of capped sleeves."
"__FASHION__ Good choice!  Have you thought about adding a pop of color or will it be all white?"
"__FASHION__ I was actually thinking of going with an ecru or ivory gown.  I want it to photograph well and I think it would look better with my complexion"
"__FASHION__ What about the length?  I think tea length would look great and show off your legs."
"__FASHION__ I really like the idea of a floor length dress.  I think a little train looks best in pictures."
"__FASHION__ I got ya'.  Have you thought about the weight of the dress? Are you leaning toward one fabric over another?"
"__FASHION__ I think I want a simple cotton or silk, as opposed to brocades and heavy fabrics."
"__FASHION__ Do you want any beading?"
"__FASHION__ No.  I think it's tacky!"
"__FASHION__ Have you thought about what the bridesmaids will be wearing?"
"__FASHION__ Oh, yeah! Since the guys are wearing soft gray suits, I was thinking of having the girls wear Tiffany Blue."
"__FASHION__ That sounds beautiful.  I can't wait to see it."
"__FASHION__ Me, either.  Now, help me find the dress of my dreams!"
