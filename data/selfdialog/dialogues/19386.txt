"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the new Logan movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the new Wolverine one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the first rated R X Men franchise movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was really intense"
"__MOVIES__ That's what I thought too. Really violent."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there were several decapitations on that movie."
"__MOVIES__ And several impaling of people's heads, chests and other appendages."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I did like professor X in that one thought."
"__MOVIES__ True, interesting take on the whole future state of mutants."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everything wasn't bliss in the future."
"__MOVIES__ No, it sounds like most of the mutants were killed off somehow."
"__MOVIES__ I think Professor X killed a lot of them with his mind"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, his mind was starting to fall him and so he'd have seizures..."
"__MOVIES__ ...oh yeah, and those seizures would kill other people and mutants."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, except for Wolverine."
"__MOVIES__ Right, since he can heal himself."
"__MOVIES__ Well, unless he starts getting old like Logan."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was kind of sad. Finally died in the end."
"__MOVIES__ But makes sense that all things die at some point."
