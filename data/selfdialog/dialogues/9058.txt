"__BEATLES__ I'm looking to buy a CD for my dad's birthday. What do you think I should get?"
"__BEATLES__ Get him a Beatles CD."
"__BEATLES__ Do you really think he will like that?"
"__BEATLES__ Of course! Everyone his age would. They were legends back in the day."
"__BEATLES__ Great idea! I actually like them too."
"__BEATLES__ I like them, but I can't say I really know much of their music."
"__BEATLES__ You must know at least Hey Jude."
"__BEATLES__ Yea, I think everybody knows that one!"
"__BEATLES__ True. In any case, my father will know all!"
"__BEATLES__ All of his baby-boomer friends will want to borrow his CD!"
