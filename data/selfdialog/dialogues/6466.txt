"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think will happen to Kylo Ren in this movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hard to say.  I get the feeling he might not be as bad of a guy as we think."
"__STAR_WARS__ He might have some qualities that are redeeming, I guess"
"__STAR_WARS__ It will be interesting to get more of his backstory."
"__STAR_WARS__ On why Leia and Han abandoned him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the didn't abandon him, but he obviously didn't grow up how they anticipated."
"__STAR_WARS__ My guess is they start talking about that in this movie and the next one fully comes out with the why."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm interested myself.  It's one of the character narratives we don't understand quite yet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Only another six months or so to find out!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, can't wait!"
