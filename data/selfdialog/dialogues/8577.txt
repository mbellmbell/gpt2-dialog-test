"__BEATLES__ I you could choose a single Beatles album as your favorite, which one would that be?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh, there are quite a few albums that I like, but I'd have to say 'Rubber Soul' is probably my favorite."
"__BEATLES__ Can you tell me why that is? What in particular draws you to that album?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, I think it's the songs. 'You're Gonna Lose That Girl' really draws me in, and it always has."
"__BEATLES__ What is it about that song that you like?"
"__BEATLES__ It's the harmonies. When I was a kid I used to listen to it over and over again, to learn to sing harmony. It's so rewarding now to sing with the album!"
"__BEATLES__ Whose harmonies are you singing?"
"__BEATLES__ I think it's Paul - my voice and his have always been quite similar, so I can usually sing his parts. Though my voice isn't as good as it used to be!"
"__BEATLES__ Is Paul your favorite Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ I always thought he was the most good looking of the bunch - but I have to say John and George were always next in line!"
