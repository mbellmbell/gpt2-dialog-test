"__MOVIES__ My son wants to watch 'an old adventure movie.' Got any ideas?"
"__MOVIES__ Haha old like something from our childhood?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think that's what he means."
"__MOVIES__ How about Stand By Me?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's a great idea! I hadn't thought of that."
"__MOVIES__ Has he seen it before?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he's only 7 so he's mostly just seen animated stuff and super hero movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, 7 may be too young then."
"__MOVIES__ You think? I was pretty young when I saw that."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it won't appeal to him as much with such a serious tone."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you're right. Anything else come to mind?"
"__MOVIES__ How about The Goonies?"
"__MOVIES__ Great suggestion! I can't believe I never showed him that."
"__MOVIES__ There's a lot of adventure in that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and he loves anything having to do with pirates."
"__MOVIES__ He will love it for sure then."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it in so long. Is there a lot of bad language or any nudity in it?"
"__MOVIES__ No nudoty, but a couple swear words if I remember correctly."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, nothing he hasn't heard before I'm sure."
"__MOVIES__ Not with the internet and kids these days. Enjoy Goonies with your son!"
