"__MOVIES__ I just saw No Country for Old Men again last night. It's so good!"
"__MOVIES__ Didn't that movie come out, like, 10 years ago?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it's a classic. So dark and scary and good!"
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson... just to name a few."
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of a Western, right?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's crime drama. It takes place in Texas in 1980."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about again? I don't think I've seen it all the way through."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't want to give the plot away and spoil it for you."
"__MOVIES__ Just tell me some basics."
"__MOVIES__ OK. Tommy Lee Jones plays a sheriff out in west Texas. He sort of narrates at the beginning and the end."
"__MOVIES__ I love him. He's a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, absolutely. Josh Brolin's character is the one who's on the run during the whole movie, but he's not the bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ Who plays the bad guy then?"
"__MOVIES__ Javier Bardem."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right! With the weird wig?"
"__MOVIES__ It might have been his real hair, but yeah."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't he win an Oscar for that role?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think he did. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones deserved Oscars too, but I think only Bardem was nominated and won."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. I need to see this movie again. The whole thing this time."
