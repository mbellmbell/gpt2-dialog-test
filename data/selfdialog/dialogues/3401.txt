"__MUSIC__ What are you feeling on lana del rey?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually love her. I think she is sexy and cool."
"__MUSIC__ Ya she is pretty sultry and ultra cool. I love her videogames song."
"__MUSIC__ That is a good one along with bluejeans and summertime sadness."
"__MUSIC__ She has such a nice tone and quality to her voice, I wish I could sing like her."
"__MUSIC__ Ya I heard her live and she sounds just as good as on a recording."
"__MUSIC__ Not all singers are capable of live performances that match or even come close."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Lady GAGA is someone similar in that she is truly a talent."
"__MUSIC__ She really has the vocal chops. Also so creative. I am always impressed with her."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. though she does have a huge team behind her helping her create a lot of her iconic looks."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe true but she is the only writing most of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Always more impressive when the singer is also the songwriter."
"__MUSIC__ Does Adele write her own songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I would think at least some of them. They seem so personal to her."
"__MUSIC__ I know sia first wrote songs for other artists before making her own album."
"__MUSIC__ I love sia, she is such a talent. And like that she hides her face."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if it is because her music has a younger sound/appeal. Yet she is pretty old."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know she was old at all! Maybe that is part of it, smart on her part. Makes me like her even more now."
"__MUSIC__ Well glad I could strengthen your love for Sia, she deserves it!"
"__MUSIC__ I am going to go look up her age. Thanks for the information and chat."
