"__SUPERHERO__ I don't think I've seen a good superhero movie since The Dark Knight."
"__SUPERHERO__ The Dark Knight was an amazing movie. Christian Bale will always be Batman to me."
"__SUPERHERO__ The voice he did in that movie was so great."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know! His suit was also really cool."
"__SUPERHERO__ It really was. I also think the dark tone of the movie really pulled it together."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. It didn't feel like a superhero movie, which is why it was the best superhero movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think so too. I even got my mom to watch it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I can't believe that! Has she ever seen any other movies like Batman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, not that I know of. She may have seen the first Spiderman, but I don't think she did."
"__SUPERHERO__ Spiderman is also one of my favorite superhero movies!"
