"__SUPERHERO__ So, the ultimate question, Marvel or DC movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ That is really a hard on to choose, they both have their own qualities."
"__SUPERHERO__ I pick Marvel, myself."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why is that?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, Marvel has a bigger story line and almost all their superhero movies combine into one."
"__SUPERHERO__ I do like that all of Stan Lee's creations have a sort of central world."
"__SUPERHERO__ The Marvel Universe. From Spider man to the mutants, they all connect."
"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think Xmen will merge with the Avengers any time soon?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I am sure some of the Heroes will cross over."
"__SUPERHERO__ We can only hope to see a Logan and Spiderman reunion."
