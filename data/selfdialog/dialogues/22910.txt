"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! I watched it in theaters when it came out."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really? How was it?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it a lot. I don't really remember the original, though, so I couldn't compare."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I haven't seen the original in years. I still want to watch it, though."
"__DISNEY__ We could watch it together when it comes out on DVD!"
"__DISNEY__ Okay! Sounds like a plan."
"__DISNEY__ We should watch the original first!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah. That is a really good idea."
"__DISNEY__ Sweet. I will see if I have it tucked away somewhere."
