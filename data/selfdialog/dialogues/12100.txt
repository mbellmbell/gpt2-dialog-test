"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm struggling who to pick for my fantasy team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At which position?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ TE.  I don't know what to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How could you not go with Gronk?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't get me wrong, I want to choose him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, so what's the dilemma?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though he's the obvious best TE, I can't rely on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean health-wise?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  He's the most imposing tight end in history, but can't stay on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His injuries do scare me a bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If not for that, I would arguably take him in the first round as he piles up catches and TD's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are there any good alternatives?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Travis Kelce had a sneaky good year last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For the Chiefs, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, he was a favorite target there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The advantage to him is that he's not injury plagued."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  That's what I need."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be a shame to draft Gronk and have his backup handle all the starts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm just conflicted.  I'll need to sleep on it to make a decision."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When in doubt, trust your heart."
