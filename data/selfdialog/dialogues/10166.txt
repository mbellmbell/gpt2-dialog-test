"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who are your top 5 favorite rappers of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Kanye, Drake, Tupac, Nas and Kendrick Lamar and if I had to add one more person I would add Chuck D of Public Enemy."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ while, I think we have the same taste.  I would just throw Biggie in there in place of Drake.  Drake is in my top 10, but not my top 5."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who are your top 5 female rappers of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Lauren Hill, Little Kim, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma and The Real Roxanne...lol.."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ ok I agree, but I also love Queen Latifah, Salt and Peppa and Nicki Minaj."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So are any of the ladies in your top 5?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, Laura Hill, she was so great she was so smooth.   She could sing and rap, she was one of the greatest rappers period."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I agree, I got back and listen to her old stuff all the time, she was pretty impressive and could hold her own among these male rappers."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would love to see something with Lauren Hill and Kendrick."
