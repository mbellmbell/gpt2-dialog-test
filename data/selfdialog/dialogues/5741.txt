"__STAR_WARS__ George Lucas was just making more money like with the reissues."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was odd Jar Jar seemed like a racist caricature too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also Watto was."
"__STAR_WARS__ Could have been a great movie. Darth Maul was a great character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea Lucas is washed up as a director."
