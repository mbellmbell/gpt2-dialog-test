"__BEATLES__ I feel like Love Me Do was the Beatles best song"
"__BEATLES__ No way that wasnt a bad track but nowhere near the best."
"__BEATLES__ So what would you say is the best?"
"__BEATLES__ Hey Jude."
"__BEATLES__ OK I can see where you are coming from"
"__BEATLES__ Actually anything from Abbey Road as well."
"__BEATLES__ So nothing from Peppers?"
"__BEATLES__ Peppers wasnt bad, but there was too much variety for me to nail a song down"
"__BEATLES__ I think that was the point of the album"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah it was a concept album in a relative sense."
