"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you have a favorite Fast & Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ At this point I'd say that my favorite is Furious 7. How about you?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ My definite favorite is 2 Fast 2 Furious. That movie's a classic if you ask me."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really? I didn't think it was that good."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ At first, neither did I. I've just come to appreciate it for the story details it offers."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What story details?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Since it doesn't have Dom or Letty in it, it gives us a better look at characters like Brian, Roman, and Tej."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I guess that makes sense."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Overall, though, I definitely still have a soft spot for that movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I can definitely respect that."
