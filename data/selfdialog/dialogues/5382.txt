"__STAR_WARS__ You know what I think it's funny?"
"__STAR_WARS__ i know what's funny. All the conspiracy theories about the identity of the new characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, there was this idiot theory that went around saying Jar Jar Binks is the Plagueis AND the supreme leader Snoke."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was so stupid. How did they even come with that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Something about the only Gungan Jedi turning to the dark side at the same time when Jar Jar was in Gungan."
"__STAR_WARS__ There was a Gungan Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There were two, actually. Kin-Ya Dosun the master, and his padawan Kin-Ya Hadu who later emerges as a Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ And they're saying Jar Jar is Kin-Ya Hadu, and the Sith Lord Plagueis?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, which is why he was able to kill so many of the drone soldiers being as clumsy as he is. That clumsiness is a part of his disguise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, then that still doesn't explain the Snoke's appearances."
