"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know the Emperor from the original movies is the same as the ones from the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well of course he's the same character!"
"__STAR_WARS__ And the same actor."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yup."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, isn't that funny."
"__STAR_WARS__ The young Emperor is actually the older emperor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Too hillarious! I thought they picked a good guy for the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ They picked the ONLY guy!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll have to remember that."
