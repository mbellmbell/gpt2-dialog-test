"__MOVIES__ Do you know how many Fast and The Furious movies there are?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you including the one that just came out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought there was only 6?"
"__MOVIES__ No, there are  8 of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Does Tokyo Drift really count though?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah. Its still in the franchise."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so, Vin Diesel did show up at the end."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that Tokyo Drift, was kind of supposed to be like a new generation of it."
"__MOVIES__ What? Kind of like Star Wars, that one was out of order?"
"__MOVIES__ Thats what I heard, I dont know if there is much truth to it."
"__MOVIES__ That would be really weird, but that movie didnt play into the storyline, so maybe."
"__MOVIES__ Thats how I feel to, it doesnt make much sense."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest one though?"
"__MOVIES__ I have, I watched it when it first came out."
"__MOVIES__ How bizarre was it, Dom had a kid!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I read a meme that said he had died tried to save his kid."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, and when I saw him with a kid, I was so upset."
"__MOVIES__ Right? Im so happy he didnt though."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, cant wait for the next one coming up."
"__MOVIES__ Me either, we should go together when it comes out."
