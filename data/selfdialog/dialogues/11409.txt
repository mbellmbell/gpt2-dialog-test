"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm pumped for next season! How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it. Your Cowboys are going down to my Birds!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! Dez Bryant and Dak Prescott will lead us to another NFC East title!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, you wish! Carson Wentz has some new weapons and an improved D. We're headed to the top!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carson Wentz is a joke! Scouts have him figured out!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not a chance. He didn't have any help last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Doesn't matter. Dak Prescott is the real deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're living in a dream world. Carson is the better QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who made the playoffs last year? Dak."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he had Ezekiel Elliott. Carson had nobody."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, Darren Sproles is pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not on the same level as Ezekiel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Put Dak with any team, he has a better record than Wentz."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're living in a dream world. Carson has better mechanics."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak threw for more yards and had a better QB rating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know how many receivers dropped Wentz's passes? Too many."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak also does it with his feet, man. He's the total package."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see next season. Eagles are going 11-5 and winning the East."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! More like 5-11!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your Cowboys don't stand a chance."
