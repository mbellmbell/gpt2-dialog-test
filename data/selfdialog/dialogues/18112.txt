"__MOVIES__ Wanna know something crazy? True Lies is only available in HD, uncropped on D-VHS."
"__MOVIES__ What the heck is a D-VHS?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a VHS format that released for home use in 2002. It was basically true, 1080i HD quality film, but on a VHS."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of it before. What does it have to do with True Lies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you see, when the film was first released, HD TVs weren't common."
"__MOVIES__ Of course not, that was 1994. No one had big screen TVs yet."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and so, the common thing to do was pan and scan the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Right, that's that thing where they zoom in on the picture, and move it along with the footage to try and fill up the whole screen, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you fill up the screen at the cost of losing some of the video. Nowadays no one does that, of course."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but what's the big deal? So what if True Lies had that done to it if every movie did?"
"__MOVIES__ It's because James Cameron loved the pan and scan version of the film so much, he kept it for all the following releases."
"__MOVIES__ What? That's crazy!"
"__MOVIES__ The only release that doesn't have the pan and scan and is in HD is the D-VHS release."
"__MOVIES__ And let me guess, D-VHS players aren't too common?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, no."
"__MOVIES__ Just as well, I suppose. We're even moving past Blu-ray into 4K UHD Blu-ray now."
"__MOVIES__ We'll just have to hope that James Cameron gives in and allows a release with the unedited film. Or at least, the option to choose it over the pan and scan version."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm sure it'll happen around the same time as he releases those Avatar sequels he always talks about."
"__MOVIES__ Until then, I guess if you're a big fan of the movie you'll just have to invest in a D-VHS player."
"__MOVIES__ No thanks. I'll stick with the LaserDisc version, thank you very much!"
