"__DISNEY__ Which is your favorite classic Disney princess movie, Cinderella or Snow White?"
"__DISNEY__ I think definitely Cinderella."
"__DISNEY__ What about the dwarves in Snow White, though? They're so funny!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but I love the mice that help make Cinderella's dress."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, they were pretty great."
"__DISNEY__ Plus there's the romantic dance at the ball!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but Snow White's prince gets to wake her up and save her life."
"__DISNEY__ That's true, and the evil witch is a great Disney villain."
"__DISNEY__ Cinderella gets a great dress, though!"
"__DISNEY__ And she gets to wear the glass slippers. That's my favorite part!"
