"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Apparently not every town is a big supporter of their NFL football team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The New York Jets want to build a helicopter pad at their training facility, and a nearby town is protesting it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are they complaining about, the helicopter noise?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That, and it's a safety risk if there's an accident."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do the Jets need the helicopter pad?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They want to use it for executive's travel, and for injured athletes to be quickly flown out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm sure no one cares about fat cat executives, but injured players is a good excuse for one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's an airport a couple of miles from there, so locals say there isn't that big a need."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe so, but if a player has a really bad injury, transporting them by ambulance to the airport could be painful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They already tried to propose it a couple years ago, but people objected a lot them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why are they bringing it up again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They said they don't need permission from the locals because it is on state property owned by the Sports Authority."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So whose decision is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The state's Department of Transportation has to approve it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think the chances are with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Somebody from the state said they were considering the proposal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Protestors have a way of stopping things though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Department of Transportation said the time limit for the public to appeal was over, but they were reading the comments."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I personally hope they get it, because athletes need to have the best medical care available, and that includes medical transport."
