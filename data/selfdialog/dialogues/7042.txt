"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are you disappointed that the Lightning missed the playoffs?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Of course!  What kills me is that they only missed by a few lousy points."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you thing not having Bishop on the net made a difference?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It made a huge difference.  It also didn't help that Stamkos was injured for so long."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ RIght.  He was out for a while at the end of regular season, but wasn't the only one injured."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, there were others.  If our lineup was healthy we would have made the playoffs guaranteed."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ We also have a few younger players that could develop into a good core."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They could if players like Kucherov, Hedman, and Johnson take on strong mentor roles for the team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What do you think is the team's biggest weakness?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They don't attack the zone hard enough and not enough speed to the zone."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think they don't shoot enough on the power play."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're right they seem to make one pass to many looking for the perfect shot."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ If you pepper the net, eventually something will get through."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think Jon Cooper can lead us to a Stanley Cup...ever?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think so.  He's a good coach and the players respond well to him.  It might take another season or two."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What do you think of the overtime rules since the change?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think this is the best rule change since removal of the 2 line pass rule."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, it really speeds up the game and makes overtime more exciting."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But there's nothing like a good shootout."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Nothing except a good shootout that your team wins."
