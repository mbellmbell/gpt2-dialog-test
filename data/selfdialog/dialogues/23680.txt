"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the GIF going around with the guy from Pocahontas?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean the Kocoum running GIFs? Yeah they're pretty hilarious!"
"__DISNEY__ It's been so long since I've seen Pocahontas. Do you remember that scene?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's the scene where Kocoum was following Pocahontas and he finds her secretly meeting with John Smith."
"__DISNEY__ Right! And he sees them kiss and loses it!"
"__DISNEY__ Then Thomas, who was following John Smith ends up shooting Kocoum."
"__DISNEY__ That was so sad! I know he was just following orders but that was so disappointing."
"__DISNEY__ He eventually makes up for it though by standing up to Ratcliffe."
"__DISNEY__ I heard Christian Bale played Thomas."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that! But I did know Mel Gibson played John Smith."
