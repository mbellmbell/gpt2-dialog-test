"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey do you like the Notorious B.I.G.?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well yeah, I love him!  He was one of my favorite rap artists in the nineties."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, it's too bad he was shot."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know!  I bet he would've kept making good music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No doubt.  He and Dre were awesome back in the day."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah they really were.  I think he's still alive, though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's possible.  His album Ready To Die was amazing."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, you could play the whole thing without skipping any songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, they were all great."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, they were.  I wonder what his songs would've been like if he'd kept making them."
