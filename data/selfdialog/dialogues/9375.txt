"__BASEBALL__ Did you hear about Chris Sale, Donny?"
"__BASEBALL__ What about him?"
"__BASEBALL__ Chris Sale has tied the MLB record for consecutive appearances with 10+ Strikeouts."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah. I saw that on the Sports report yesterday."
"__BASEBALL__ Struck out 4 of his final 5 hitters to get it, I can't believe it!"
"__BASEBALL__ He was in the 6th inning with the pitch count heading toward 100 and just 6 strikeouts.I thought for sure the streak would end but the absolute madman did it."
"__BASEBALL__ He has got to be the best pitcher in the AL by a lot."
"__BASEBALL__ He tied the record he had already tied in 2015."
"__BASEBALL__ This is the second 8 straight 10+ K streak he's had. Unreal."
"__BASEBALL__ Correction, he ties Pedro and himself. He had 8 consecutive 10K+ games in 2015 too."
"__BASEBALL__ But still."
"__BASEBALL__ I knew he would do great in the AL east."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure the offense is potent on teams but so are the strikeouts."
"__BASEBALL__ I hope he can win a Cy young award."
"__BASEBALL__ And the fact that he doesn't mess around on the mound. Just gets the ball back, says yes to the first sign his catcher puts down."
"__BASEBALL__ And fires nothing but strikes."
"__BASEBALL__ MLB needs to use him as the example of game pace."
"__BASEBALL__ He's really, really good."
"__BASEBALL__ The best strikeout Pitcher since Randy Johnson."
"__BASEBALL__ Chris Sale is actually very reminiscent of Johnson. Huge/tall guy with no weight."
