"__MOVIES__ Saul Bass is my hero."
"__MOVIES__ Who? The Satanic Verses guy?"
"__MOVIES__ That's Salman Rushdie."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, yes. Almost the same thing. Probably."
"__MOVIES__ If you're creative about it, maybe. Saul Bass was a graphic designer."
"__MOVIES__ So what did he do, comic books?"
"__MOVIES__ Not that I'm aware of. He did logos and title sequences for movies and things ."
"__MOVIES__ Like the Star Wars scroll?"
"__MOVIES__ That wasn't him, but -- that kind of thing. Except, more mod."
"__MOVIES__ Pardon?"
"__MOVIES__ Pardon what? Mod?"
"__MOVIES__ Are we talking Beatles here?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, not -- I mean, sort of, but no. The modernist movement, that brings us Helvetica and plastic bucket seats."
"__MOVIES__ I think I skipped this chapter. Can you be kind to me?"
"__MOVIES__ Modernism is all about putting the rational and the practical above the emotional. This is where we get the phrase 'cool,' as in keeping a steady head, which in turn is a desirable trait: 'He's so cool, he's above it all!'"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds kind of... I don't know. Not classist, exactly, but there's something that feels off here."
"__MOVIES__ It's aspirational, so it's a super middle-class notion, which totally took off with the Baby Boomers, because, you know. But basically, it's about stripped-down elegance: ridding yourself of unneeded emotional baggage in favor of the bare skeleton of what you need to function."
"__MOVIES__ Austerity as an art form? Barfaloney. Why is this guy your hero, again?"
"__MOVIES__ Saul Bass? Oh, he just did lots of cool stuff. The intros to most of Hitchcock's late-era stuff, like Psycho and Vertigo and North by Northwest."
"__MOVIES__ North by Northwest... I think I remember the intro to that. It reminds me of Mad Men."
