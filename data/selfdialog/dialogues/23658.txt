"__DISNEY__ Have ever seen any of the Star Wars movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you kidding me?! I am a huge fan of a Star Wars saga."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know that a new movie Star Wars: The Last Jedi is coming out soon? I am not going to miss it."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Nice! What is the planned release date?"
"__DISNEY__ December 2017, according to Disney. Remember that character Jyn Erso from the 'The Rouge One' episode? She is going to finally start her Jedi training."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that is actually how the last episode ended. I am pretty sure this one will be awesome just like the other ones."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I really liked how they introduced new story lines and characters into the saga."
"__DISNEY__ It really amazes me how they can keep it coming for so many years. Although I am a grown man, I really enjoyed those animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Did you watch those?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, sure. We watched it together with my son. I hope there will be more episodes coming in the future and it will never end..."
"__DISNEY__ Agree, I would not want it to end ever! Such a fascinating story!"
