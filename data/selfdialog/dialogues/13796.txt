"__BASKETBALL__ Are you watching the Celtics play the Cavs tonight?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, what time is it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It starts at 8:30.  Who are you rooting for?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I wanted the Celtics to win, but they're getting crushed right now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, 86 points last game?  That's embarrassing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Seriously.  The Cavs lead by 41 points at halftime."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who can come back from that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It would take a miracle.  Can you imagine losing on home court like that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I wouldn't want to show my face in public."
"__BASKETBALL__ That press conference afterwards was tragic."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's what happens when Isaiah Thomas gets injured and he's the one you count on most."
"__BASKETBALL__ I heard he's out for the rest of the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Celts are DONE."
"__BASKETBALL__ Better luck next year, guys."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah.  The Cavs are unstoppable right now."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's a good thing LeBron came back."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, but he didn't score all those points by himself."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe not, but he really lit a fire under their butts."
"__BASKETBALL__ Fair enough.  Did you see how he's not an MVP finalist this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, what's up with that?"
