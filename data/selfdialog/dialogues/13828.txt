"__BASKETBALL__ Did you hear that the playoffs are starting?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Already? Seems like this season by went so fast.."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm kind of relieved since baseball is in full effect by now"
"__BASKETBALL__ I hear ya, i wish they wouldnt have the NHL playoffs at the same time as basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Anyways I also think theres too many teams in the playoffs, its not even competitive til the conference finals most years."
"__BASKETBALL__ I feel the same way, its pretty ridiculous to have almost 2 months of playoffs in a sport, even baseball doesn't seem as bad with it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who are you rooting for?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Spurs...but theyll have a tough road...you know how the Cavs just march through the east each year without any competiton..."
"__BASKETBALL__ What about the Celtics?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They have no chance...I like their coach though"
"__BASKETBALL__ Still, I think they're off to a great start after tanking 3 years ago, and they have all th ose draft picks including #1."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow really?  That is crazy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Its kind of crazy to think about the Lakers aren't in the playoffs again...i bet LA is pissed."
"__BASKETBALL__ They have the Clippers though..."
"__BASKETBALL__ I meant like a real team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Still they sucked for so long I'm glad to see them turning it around..but no shot for the next 10 or so years against the Warriors"
"__BASKETBALL__ Does anyone though?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well the Spurs..."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lol anyways..."
"__BASKETBALL__ Come on they got this!"
