"__ROCK__ Tame Impala is really changing the game"
"__ROCK__ You think?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, they're the first people to really do psychadellic rock right since the 60's"
"__ROCK__ Yikes, that's a harsh accusation."
"__ROCK__ I'm serious! Sure, there's Jake Bugg and Mac Demarco, but you can't really trip to them."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I guess they're more of a vibe."
"__ROCK__ Right? So, Tame Impala is doing it."
"__ROCK__ I'm hoping it'll open the door to more psych music."
"__ROCK__ Me too, my man. Childish Gambino's latest album shows that it will."
"__ROCK__ You're right! It was crazy to hear him make a rock album."
