"__DISNEY__ Did you get to watch the live action version of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I did! Emma Watson was awesome!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she was great as Belle. The new songs were not bad at all, either."
"__DISNEY__ They fit the expanded storyline, but I still kind of like the old stuff better."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean. It was cool to see a bit more backstory."
"__DISNEY__ You know, I think I remember the Beast's past being expanded on in the Christmas special but not much of Belle's past before she came to whatever town they were in."
"__DISNEY__ She mentions having moved there, in the original. Also, Gaston had a bit of a job change. He was a hunter in the original and he's some kind of soldier in this one."
"__DISNEY__ And LeFou, too! They changed him a bit, he's kind of...quesioning, I guess?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess. They still did really well with it overall."
"__DISNEY__ True, true."
