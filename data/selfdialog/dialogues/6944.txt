"__STAR_WARS__ Why is C3PO so annoying?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You don't like him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course not.  He's a whiny robot with little worth."
"__STAR_WARS__ R2D2 can obviously do more than him, but he's not worthless."
"__STAR_WARS__ Think about most of his scenes.  He basically just says they're always in danger and going to die."
"__STAR_WARS__ He also can compute things and help out with strategy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Look, we'll just agree to disagree on this.  What role do you see him playing in the next few movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not quite sure.  I know he'll be in them though."
"__STAR_WARS__ My guess is maybe he'll do some sort of self-sacrifice to move the plot forward."
"__STAR_WARS__ I could see that happening."
