"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavaliers seem unstoppable."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I don't know who can guard LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ They will win back to back championships."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't see them beating Golden State."
"__BASKETBALL__ You gotta be kidding."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I'm serious."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who on Golden State can guard LeBron?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I would put Kevin Durant on him."
"__BASKETBALL__ No one will stop LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ It doesn't matter, Golden State has too many shooters."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kevin Durant cannot guard LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ You are missing the point.  Golden State has 4 or 5 people on the court at all times that can score.  Cleveland maybe has 3."
"__BASKETBALL__ You think that will be the difference?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Absolutely, we'll concede that LeBron will get his points."
"__BASKETBALL__ What if other Cavaliers are also scoring?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I really don't think it will matter, there is too much fire power on Golden State."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think if Cleveland slows the game down they have a real chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ If Cleveland slows the game down they just have a real chance of losing by less."
"__BASKETBALL__ You are impossible."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm impossible to defend, like Golden State.  They will win two out of the last three championships.  Scoreboard!"
