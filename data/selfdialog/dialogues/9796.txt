"__COMEDY__ So, if I'm going to watch a Marx Brothers movie -- I know I'm going to regret asking this, but -- where should I start?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, there's a question."
"__COMEDY__ No, please. Just give me a title. Seriously."
"__COMEDY__ Okay; people are going to tell you Duck Soup, but ignore them. Go with Night at the Opera."
"__COMEDY__ Okay, Night at the Opera. Why?"
"__COMEDY__ First, it's easily their best movie just in terms of its writing, its direction, its setpieces. Second, the party of the second part shall be known as the party of the second part."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, uh. So... I take it you're being referential again. Should I understand what you're saying?"
"__COMEDY__ Not really. Not yet."
"__COMEDY__ This is why I never ask you anything."
"__COMEDY__ You're really missing out."
