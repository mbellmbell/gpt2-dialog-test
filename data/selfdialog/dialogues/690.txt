"__MUSIC__ Do you know who sings Thrift Shop?"
"__MUSIC__ It's by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis."
"__MUSIC__ Oh right, thank you. I wanted to buy it off iTunes but couldn't remember who sings it."
"__MUSIC__ Well while your there check out their other songs."
"__MUSIC__ They did more, I didn't know. Are there any good ones I should look at first?"
"__MUSIC__ You have to listen to White walls. It's a great song about white wall tires on his Cadillac."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound that good."
"__MUSIC__ Trust me it is, and also check out Can't Hold Us and Same Love."
"__MUSIC__ Wait I've heard Can't hold us, I didn't know it was the same guys."
"__MUSIC__ Who did you think it was."
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was Justin Bieber."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, you were way off."
"__MUSIC__ Well it made me think of Love Yourself."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, I thought that was an Ed Sheeren song."
"__MUSIC__ See, I'm not the only one, but no it's definately a Bieber song."
"__MUSIC__ Well that would explain why I could find that under Ed's music."
"__MUSIC__ Well at least you didn't think it was a lady gaga song or something."
"__MUSIC__ I knew it was a guy singing it, I'm not that stupid."
"__MUSIC__ I think we need a music marathon on YouTube and really put some names to voices."
"__MUSIC__ That would actually come in handy, and I can show you those songs/"
