"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think a woman will ever play for the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, no way, never."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Biology."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not sexism?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, basic biology."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, Doctor. Tell me why not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only position women have been able to do somewhat well in in high school and Division 3 college is the extra-point kicker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So? Put them there!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I worry the defensive tackles won't want to tackle them out of fear of hurting them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So then they get a free extra point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but here's the other thing. The male kickers can kick it farther."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not more consistently, though. Gender and aim don't go together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. But a 60-yard field goal? No way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not saying don't use them for short extra points or field goals, but I don't see them competing anytime soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This still reeks of sexism. Give them a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A woman wouldn't succeed in the NBA but that's not sexist. Baseball is possible, but not the NFL for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope one day you're proven wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. It'd be fun to see but deep down seeing a female get tackled full-force by a 350 pound lineman hurts to think of."
