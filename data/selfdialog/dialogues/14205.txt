"__HORROR__ Jason versus Freddy was awful in my opinion."
"__HORROR__ Why?"
"__HORROR__ I just think they are 2 different horror characters."
"__HORROR__ Yeah I see what you mean but it was a combination of both."
"__HORROR__ I think you could have gone with Jason versus anyone else."
"__HORROR__ Well Freddy exists everywhere."
"__HORROR__ But just in dreams."
"__HORROR__ So you think Jason cant arrive in dreams"
"__HORROR__ I think then you go to almost science fiction"
"__HORROR__ No it was a horror movie and it worked right into what the movie should have been"
