"__STAR_WARS__ It's all about carrying a story though, and the prequels do it superbly."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's an arguable point. Some may say the premise is boring and executed poorly"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?!?! Where do you even... I don't even kniow what that means. Excuted poorly? How?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Where did Darth Maul come from? Where was he born? How was he trained?"
"__STAR_WARS__ From that planet. With those demon witch women. Whatever they are."
"__STAR_WARS__ But that's the story line from the TV animation series. We're not told this in the prequel."
"__STAR_WARS__ No. This is true, but that doesn't mean it's executed poorly."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's what it means exactly. The character development is a very impoirtant part of making a movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I do agree with that point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. And Darth Maul just appears out of nowhere, and ttey start fighting."
