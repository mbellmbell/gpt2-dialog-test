"__MOVIES__ It's got a really cool set up which makes the story flow smoothly, and it compartmentalizes things."
"__MOVIES__ What made the set up different from any other movie?"
"__MOVIES__ So the movie was broken apart into several chapters. In each chapter, the movie followed classic story telling etiquite."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't Kill Bill follow a similar format- I think I know what you are talking about."
"__MOVIES__ I am not sure- I never saw Kill Bill. Anyway, the first chapter is really about bringing the main characters together. There's a black guy who was a major in the union army."
"__MOVIES__ Was the black guy Samuel L. Jackson- wait, that's a dumb question."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is and of course he was. Tarantino only uses top-billed actors in his movies, and you didn't see anyone else mentioned except Jackson, who was black."
"__MOVIES__ He was a major in the army, okay. This was one of his western movies, right? When exactly did the movie take place?"
"__MOVIES__ It was set in a time period after the civil war."
"__MOVIES__ Figures, Tarantino seems to have a thing for that time period."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, he was this dishonored major who was hellbent on killing white people. He earned a bad reputation after he accidentally killed 37 union soldiers during a configuration at a southern prisoner camp."
"__MOVIES__ Tarantino  really likes to kill people in his movies, doesn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think it would be a Tarantino film without a bunch of killing and bloodshed."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in the set up."
"__MOVIES__ Kurt Russel is playing this bounty hunter nicknamed 'The Hangman.' He is the one in charge of transporting the character played by Leigh."
"__MOVIES__ I think I saw a commercial with him- he is getting old."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, this is sort of one of those 'old men can be cool' sort of movies, like RED, and I have to admit, he was cool."
"__MOVIES__ It couldn't have been an action film though with him in it. This isn't Tombstone."
"__MOVIES__ No, but he didn't take anything off of anyone. Everywhere he went, he was the boss."
"__MOVIES__ So he had an intimidating aura about himself? That sounds believable. Some old people are scary."
