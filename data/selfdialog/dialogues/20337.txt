"__MOVIES__ What kinds of movies have you seen in theaters lately?"
"__MOVIES__ None, actually, I don't really go to the movies often."
"__MOVIES__ What?? Why not? I go probably once a month!"
"__MOVIES__ It's much simpler to watch films from home, I suppose. Besides, I'm in no rush to see new releases or anything."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, that's a shame, the experience at the movies is definitely worth it in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I understand, I just don't like dealing with having to go out and spend all that money just to sit in an uncomfortable chair and watch something I could see in my own home later."
"__MOVIES__ Well, fair enough I suppose. Do you use Netflix to watch movies or do you order them online or what?"
"__MOVIES__ I do use Netflix, but I also like to buy them from Amazon on occasion. Netflix is definitely simpler for me right now. Truth be told I'm not that big of a movie person."
"__MOVIES__ I've always been passionate about film so that boggles me. Netflix is good, but they don't have a lot of the things I really want."
"__MOVIES__ Really?? I've been nothing but surprised at their catalog size!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but some of the more specific titles I really like are DVD only or missing altogether."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't come across that situation yet. What kinds of films do you watch?"
"__MOVIES__ Admittedly yeah, they're more cult/obscure, but I like all kinds of movies. I guess Netflix has more well known things too, it's just that odds are I've already seen them tons of times or own them in person."
"__MOVIES__ How cult can you get with movies really? I mean, I've seen Eraserhead and that's about as crazy as I can get."
"__MOVIES__ It gets waaaay more cult than Eraserhead, trust me. So many weird art films that are kind of terrible and kind of awesome at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ Why would you want to watch something that's terrible?? Even the smallest bit?"
"__MOVIES__ That's part of the fun. Have you ever gotten a laugh out of something that's really dumb, like on youtube, or a song or something?"
"__MOVIES__ I have, on occasion, so I guess I can see what you mean. It's just beyond my experience."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. A perfect example is The Room which is popular enough so that you might recognize it. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ 'YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!!!'"
