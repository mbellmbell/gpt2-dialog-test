"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey when does the NFL pre-season start this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but I know it's in August."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let me see if I will be able to find out the exact date; hold on. It starts up with the Hall of Fame game on August 3rd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, okay. Who is playing that game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Looks like the Cowboys will be playing Arizona."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. Hey, remember the Hall of Fame game between the Packers and Colts was canceled last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I do remember, it was supposedly because of field conditions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was the reason. Hopefully that doesn't happen again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. Who you going for this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to stick with Tampa Bay Buccaneers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you really think they have a chance for the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nothing is impossible, they just signed Sean Renfree as their quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright. Didn't he play for the Atlanta Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he was drafted by the Falcons in the 2013 NFL draft out of Duke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, well, we will have to see if he can make it happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like I said anything is possible; who you rooting for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Green Bay Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes way. I am a loyal fan regardless of my team's performance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cool. Well good luck and our teams will be seeing each other on Dec. 3rd at 1:00 pm. ET"
