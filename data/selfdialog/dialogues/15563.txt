"__HARRY_POTTER__ Whats your favorite movie series?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry Potter hands down."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really?  I've seen the first one a really long time ago but I never finished it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You have to!  I know there are a lot of them but everything about them is great."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How many movies are there?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, there's eight Harry Potter movies but that new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them takes place in the same universe.  It happens before Harry Potter."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So should I start with the first Harry Potter or that new movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You should definitely start with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  The new one just has nods to the others that you wouldn't get if you hadn't watched them first."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Does it have any of the same actors?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, not that I know of.  Speaking of that the casting is amazing.  Daniel Radcliffe was spot on playing Harry Potter."
