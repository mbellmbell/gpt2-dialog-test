"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the Tedeschi Trucks Band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I've heard the name, but I don't know any of their stuff."
"__MUSIC__ They are a husband and wife team, and they have a full band behind them."
"__MUSIC__ So what is their main genre?"
"__MUSIC__ They are rock, but there are elements of blues and jazz as well."
"__MUSIC__ They sound good, but where can I hear them?"
"__MUSIC__ Well your best bet is online, like all music now of course."
"__MUSIC__ Don't they get air time or play shows?"
"__MUSIC__ I have never heard a radio station play their stuff, and they play a lot of small venues and colleges."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to search for them, but it sounds like it might be a challenge."
"__MUSIC__ Band founder Derek Trucks is a guitar virtuoso, and his wife Susan Tedeschi has an incredibly soulful voice."
"__MUSIC__ So did they get married first, or start the band first?"
"__MUSIC__ I believe they were married a while before they formed the band."
"__MUSIC__ So when you said band, did you mean like a full orchestral band?"
"__MUSIC__ They do have some flutes and brass instrumentalists behind them."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty unique for a modern band."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and it really allows them to play a wider range of genres."
"__MUSIC__ Just from the sheer size of the band, they must create a better sound than just a trio of guys or a soloist."
"__MUSIC__ I think so, because I've been really into their music lately."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the recommendation, and I really want to check them out."
