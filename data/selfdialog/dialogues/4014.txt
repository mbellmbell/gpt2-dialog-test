"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite Weezer album?"
"__MUSIC__ I think I like Pinkerton the best."
"__MUSIC__ Its one of my favorites too, but I think I'll always hold the Blue album as number 1 favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that they're releasing another album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I had no idea. Do you know when it is coming out?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't know when the full album will be out. They released a single a few months ago, its called  'Feels Like Summer.'"
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check it out. What did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was pretty good, it sounds more like original Weezer."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if this means that they'll tour again."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine that they will, what's the point of a new album if you don't play it live?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess you're right."
"__MUSIC__ I do hope that they play smaller clubs and venues. It feels weird seeing Weezer play in a huge auditorium."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, their music is infinitely better played in an intimate setting."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's true for most bands. I understand why well known bands play the bigger shows, but the sound isn't nearly as good."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they have to support the tour with ticket sales. Its not like bands make a ton of money off cds and albums anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Right. Why buy the hard copy when you can pirate it online, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately, that's the truth these days. People want the music, but they don't want to pay."
"__MUSIC__ I still buy records whenever I can. Nothing I download online ever sounds as good as it does on vinyl."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you on that. I love having my records to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Weezer will do a vinyl release of the Black Album when it comes out."
