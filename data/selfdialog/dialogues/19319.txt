"__MOVIES__ Are there any movies out that you want to see?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, but my husband wants to see Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that looks good.  You don't want to see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I've never been a big super hero movie fan and I really don't care about Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ You don't like any super hero movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked Guardians of the Galaxies."
"__MOVIES__ That was good.  What kind of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Horror or comedy mostly."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think about that new mummy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure.  Is it supposed to be like The Mummy from a few years back?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so.  This is supposed to be more horror than action adventure."
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of confusing with the same name."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ I think that shark movie might be alright."
"__MOVIES__ 47 Meters Down?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it probably sucks, but it's something different."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like the new Jaws."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing will ever beat Jaws."
