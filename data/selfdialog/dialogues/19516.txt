"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Alice Through The Looking Glass?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was very good. I liked it even more than Alice in Wonderland."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes. The backstory on the Red Queen and White Queen explained why the Red Queen was so mean."
"__MOVIES__ Why was she so mean?"
"__MOVIES__ When they were little the White Queen blamed her for eating the treats, so the Red Queen ran away."
"__MOVIES__ Ran away! Where to?"
"__MOVIES__ She ran outside but she hits her head, so the White Queen is to blame for how big her head is."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. I never would have expected that from the White Queen."
"__MOVIES__ I know. She's not as innocent as she appears to be."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Anne Hathaway's portrayal of the White Queen?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, I didn't think it was very good."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. It just feels like I'm watching Anne Hathaway play dress up."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The difference between her performance and Johnny Depp's performance is astounding."
"__MOVIES__ Johnny Depp does a good job as the Mad Hatter, but I honestly thought his performance was a little lackluster in Alice Through The Looking Glass."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it was just the plot."
"__MOVIES__ You're right. He really wasn't his normal self for most of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. The Mad Hatter's family was missing after all."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I thought Mia Wasikowska had a great performance as usual."
"__MOVIES__ I've only ever seen her in the Alice in Wonderland movies."
