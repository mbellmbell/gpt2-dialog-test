"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Rams are going to be awful this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think so?  They'll do better than you think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, they're terrible.  No offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Goff had a rough year, but is getting better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, Goff never got better last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he got picked off less as the year progressed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, okay, that's some really sound reasoning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a fact though, he's getting better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, whatever you say."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't argue that the defense isn't good though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't say good, but they do have some quality players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Donald is the best DT in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt he's good, but not #1."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Name one DT better than him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some guy named JT Watt comes to mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was hurt all last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So?  Watt's the best player in the league when healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but if he's not healthy, he's just a guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look, not arguing Donald isn't really darn good, just saying that Watt is infinitely better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your opinion stinks, but we'll see."
