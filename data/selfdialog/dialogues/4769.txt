"__MUSIC__ Hey did you ever listen to Eminem's music?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, yes.  Back in the late nineties I did."
"__MUSIC__ I love him!  He still has great music too."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?  I despised him!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, how could you? From the very get go his music has been unique and novel, and so amusing."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's always been disgusting and offensive."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ He glorifies all sorts of heinous things!  Plus he's a complete moron."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so, I think he's brilliant.  He has catchy lyrics that rhyme and make you laugh."
"__MUSIC__ Not hardly!  I can't believe he's still popular."
"__MUSIC__ That's because he's great!  You're wrong about him."
"__MUSIC__ Well, the first album had potential, but after that he completely went downhill."
"__MUSIC__ No, he just got better and better!  Dr. Dre wouldn't have teamed up with him if he didn't have potential."
"__MUSIC__ That's not true.  It's all about the money for those people."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, and if he didn't think he had money-making potential he wouldn't have worked with him."
"__MUSIC__ Well, regardless I still think his music is a travesty."
"__MUSIC__ Well we will have to agree to disagree."
"__MUSIC__ If you can even call it music!"
"__MUSIC__ I think it's great.  I will keep listening to him."
"__MUSIC__ You do that.  He's totally off my list."
