"__MUSIC__ I love '80s music, New Wave stuff especially."
"__MUSIC__ Like A Flock of Seagulls?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, or like Talk Talk."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about New Wave?"
"__MUSIC__ The sound; the feel of it. That sort of synthesizer based music we don't get anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Synthesizers never completely went out of style, they're just much more advanced now."
"__MUSIC__ Which is sort of the problem, they sound completely different than they did 30-some years ago. It's not the same."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of dance music uses obvious synthesizers."
"__MUSIC__ Dance music, and club music, and house music are their own things though. They're often faster, with a different tone."
"__MUSIC__ There's always Synthwave then. It's a genre stylized after the old New Wave songs of the '80s."
"__MUSIC__ That's a little different. It tries to emulate the sound, but a lot of those songs have more of a cyberpunk or horror feel to them."
"__MUSIC__ It Follows had a soundtrack like that. Very '80s sort of synth sounding, but with a definite leaning towards unsettling. It was a horror movie after all."
"__MUSIC__ Come to think of it, another horror movie comes to mind with a soundtrack like that. Southbound, it came out in 2015."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that one definitely fits. The band The Gifted used real, actual analog synthesizers to create the music for the film."
"__MUSIC__ Again, that's all horror though. What I like is more traditional New Wave stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Shiny Toy Guns sort of has that sound in some of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Sort of, but they're not completely a true New Wave group. Though, I suppose they couldn't be since to be a New Wave group you kind of had to be there at the time."
"__MUSIC__ You're probably right, I guess they're more of an electric-rock group or something along those lines anyhow."
"__MUSIC__ At least a few artists from the time like Duran Duran continue to make new albums. It's not exactly the same, but it's as close as we'll probably ever get."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I suppose there is at least that. Maybe you'll get lucky and someday using old synths will be the hot, trendy thing to do in music again."
