"__STAR_WARS__ What is the cheesiest part of the old Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think its funny when they go to that jazz club"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah the music was really weird"
"__STAR_WARS__ do you remember one alien playing the saxophone? What the heck!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a funny scene. Another funny thing was when they are getting squished in the trash compactor"
"__STAR_WARS__ And they try to stop the machine with a long pole?"
"__STAR_WARS__ yeah that's the scene!"
"__STAR_WARS__ On top of getting squished there was a huge snake in ther too!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that was so random!"
"__STAR_WARS__ makes me feel grateful for the newer movies! Better acting and better plots!"
