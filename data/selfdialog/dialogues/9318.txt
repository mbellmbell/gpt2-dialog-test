"__BASEBALL__ What's the fastest fast ball ever measured?"
"__BASEBALL__ 105.1 mph"
"__BASEBALL__ By..."
"__BASEBALL__ Aroldis Chapman. Cincinnati reds, during the game against San Diego Padres."
"__BASEBALL__ I was watching this tv show about biomechanics, I think that was about Aroldis."
"__BASEBALL__ Was it about strides, shoulder turn, delivery etc?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think so, it was pretty good. It was on sports science."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, there are few biomechanic traits that go into a fast ball."
"__BASEBALL__ Such as?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well the very first thing most of us look at is the stride. Well, actually, to start off there are 6 stages of motion. Windup, stride, arm cocking, arm acceleration, arm deceleration, and follow through. That's what a pitch is."
"__BASEBALL__ And the windup does what?"
"__BASEBALL__ Windup stores the potential energy you will release as you go into the stride and helps you get a good stride going. Some pitchers don't have a big windup."
"__BASEBALL__ Is that disadvantageous?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not as long as you can move the stride along. Just lifting the leg briefly can get your stride going no problem."
"__BASEBALL__ And the stride is when you convert the potential energy into kinetic energy?"
"__BASEBALL__ well, you will convert it to mechanical motion or energy first, kinetic energy won't come into play until you release the ball. Stride is to get that motion going and at the same time start the arm cocking or extend your arm back to start the forward motion."
"__BASEBALL__ That's what it's called? really?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yep. And as the stride ends, the foot plants on the ground, the arm stretched back will start to move forward, and this is the start of the release phase. And you do that by accelerating your arm towards the home base."
"__BASEBALL__ Then release and follow through."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep"
