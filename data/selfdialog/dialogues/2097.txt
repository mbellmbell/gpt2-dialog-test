"__MUSIC__ Hey what do you think of Adele's music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she's got a lot of talent and although I don't want to really admit it I like her music."
"__MUSIC__ Why wouldn't you want to admit you like her music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well he music in my opinion is for a certain group of listeners."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well a lot of her songs are all love songs based on having a borken heart."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she sung from her own personal experiences."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I just feel that  her songs are for hopeless romantics."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you have a point with that to a degree but I think about it in a different way."
"__MUSIC__ How do you see it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I see it as a a person who sings about her own personal expeirence and people just happen to relate."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I can understand that and it makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ All in all I think her powerful voice and personal experiences is how she gained her popularity."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'll admit thats how I happened along her music."
"__MUSIC__ I was the exact same way. I'm pretty sure everyone I know got into her music the same way we did."
"__MUSIC__ While I am a fan I still don't listen to her music as much as the average fan."
"__MUSIC__ Why? Don't want to appear soft or something?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't say that. I just think her songs bring down mood and make you dwell on the negative."
"__MUSIC__ Now it makes snese why you don't want to admit you like her music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, While its great music it's not something I'd want to hear often."
