"__BASEBALL__ Hey, man, did you see the Yankees game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, their outfielder was on Not Top 10 because he couldn't find a ball that was a homerun!"
"__BASEBALL__ What an idiot!"
"__BASEBALL__ Seriously, and he makes like $5 million a year."
"__BASEBALL__ I hate them so much. I hope next time their star player is up to bat, the pitchers of that team repeatedly hit all of their batters in the knees."
"__BASEBALL__ Why? Dude, that's cruel."
"__BASEBALL__ Once again, I'm a girl. I'm not a dude. Anyway, this way even though the pitchers will get suspended for a few games, all of the Yankees players will have to forfeit a few weeks of games as they have no one to play."
"__BASEBALL__ That sounds good, as everyone loves an injured Yankee. But there's one problem."
"__BASEBALL__ What's that?"
"__BASEBALL__ The minor-league system."
"__BASEBALL__ Ooooooooooh snap. That's right. Well, if they bring up those players, they won't be as good, so they'll lose anyway."
"__BASEBALL__ Unless they play your Red Sox."
"__BASEBALL__ That was not cool, dude."
"__BASEBALL__ Hey, I'm not a guy either! Why are we calling each other dudes? Anyway, your Sox aren't very good this year."
"__BASEBALL__ They have a winning record!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, 18-16. That's like getting a solid C on an exam. No one is proud of a C."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, I bet Yankees fans are, since they're dumb."
"__BASEBALL__ True. I just hope they don't make the playoffs again this year."
"__BASEBALL__ That'd be great."
"__BASEBALL__ Know what would be even better? If one of the Yankees tries to steal second but trips and smashes his face on the base!"
