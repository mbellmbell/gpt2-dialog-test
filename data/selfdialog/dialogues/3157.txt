"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Empire of the Sun album?"
"__MUSIC__ I've only heard one single from it on the radio. Is it good?"
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty decent. Much more like their first album than the second one."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool! I liked the first album a lot, but the second one was a little too electronic for my tastes."
"__MUSIC__ I kinda agree. The second album felt like they had jumped on the whole Calvin Harris bandwagon."
"__MUSIC__ That style of dance music was everywhere a few years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Right, and I don't think there's anything wrong with expanding your style musically, but being trendy seems a little desperate."
"__MUSIC__ So, what else have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like the new Spoon album."
"__MUSIC__ I love the song Hot Thoughts. That's the title track, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is. They seem really rejuvenated since they took that long break after Transference."
"__MUSIC__ They needed a break. Transference was terrible!"
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't terrible. It was just kinda mediocre compared to their other albums. Spoon really hasn't had a bad album."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with that. I was exaggerating a bit about Transference. Spoon is a very solid band."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they are! Not many bands can consistently bring out album after album of good material."
"__MUSIC__ I can only think of a few. LCD Soundsystem, The National, and Arcade Fire all come to mind."
"__MUSIC__ I am so excited about the new LCD Soundsystem album!"
"__MUSIC__ It's supposed to come out soon, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Pitchfork reported that it should be out within 6 weeks."
"__MUSIC__ Good. That's going to make my summer."
