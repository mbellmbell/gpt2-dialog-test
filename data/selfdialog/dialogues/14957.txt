"__ACTION__ Isn't the new Transformers movie coming out soon?"
"__ACTION__ This Friday I think."
"__ACTION__ What's even going on with these things anymore?"
"__ACTION__ I can't keep track myself.  This is the fifth movie or something by now I think."
"__ACTION__ You can only film the destruction of the world so much."
"__ACTION__ To me, the movies are just too loud and dumb."
"__ACTION__ Yeah.  It was cute at first, but got old quick."
"__ACTION__ But they'll keep making them until people stop going."
"__ACTION__ Fat chance of that.  Too many fanboys."
"__ACTION__ I'll probably watch them all someday when I'm bored."
