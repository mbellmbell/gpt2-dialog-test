"__DISNEY__ Hey, I got a cool fact."
"__DISNEY__ What's that?"
"__DISNEY__ Can you guess how many movies Disney has made in total?"
"__DISNEY__ In total? It has got to be alot."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it is, but can you give a ballpark estimate?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, maybe three a year for the past seventy years. So like 210?"
"__DISNEY__ That's not a bad guess. From the information I just read online, they have made at least 161."
"__DISNEY__ Wow! I wonder how many of those I've seen."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I've probably seen two or three new Disney movies for each year of my life. So probably around fifty."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds right. I hadn't realized how many I had seen until you pointed that out."
