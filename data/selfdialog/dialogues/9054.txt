"__BEATLES__ I went to this trivia night at a local bar two nights ago. It was a lot  of fun."
"__BEATLES__ So did you do well? Did you win anything?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes our table did very well. I couldn't believe then questions about The Beatles that stumped people."
"__BEATLES__ Like what? How hard could it have been?"
"__BEATLES__ They didn't know any of the wives names of any of them. The question was name 2 of The Beatles wives."
"__BEATLES__ And not many of them knew? Or did any of them know?"
"__BEATLES__ No one knew except our table. These younger people don't know what music is anymore."
"__BEATLES__ Let's see if I can do it. Barbara Bach, Yoko, Linda,who else?"
"__BEATLES__ You did well. Each of them I believe had at least two."
