"__MOVIES__ We have to talk about Bellflower."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness. You either loved it or hated it."
"__MOVIES__ Loved it. Five starts."
"__MOVIES__ Dark. Surreal. Bizarre romance"
"__MOVIES__ Evan Glodell’s going to be huge."
"__MOVIES__ Were there too many explosions, though?"
"__MOVIES__ Too many explosions? How dare you."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's a weird juxtaposition of words, I know."
"__MOVIES__ Woodrow’s and Milly’s relation, that was total kismit."
"__MOVIES__ They were lovable losers for sure. And Jessie Wiseman, she's going to have a career, too."
"__MOVIES__ It was so over the top that it was actually great. They took romance to a new level."
"__MOVIES__ Romance? They took bromance to another level."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the relationship between Glodell and Tyler Dawson  . . . let's just say Glodell was all in on this project."
"__MOVIES__ Dawson stole the movie, I thought, with his performance. He's the ultimate buddy. Weill you be my Tyler Dawson?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think anyone can be your Tyler Dawson, but I'll be your movie buddy. Jessie Wisemen, though. I've never seen a break up portrayed as the Apocalypse.  It was crazy, hysterical."
"__MOVIES__ Jessie Wiseman was a wrecking ball. She did flat-out warn Glodell, though, even before they started their trip that she would end up hurting him."
"__MOVIES__ Who breaks up with a guy who has a flamethrower?"
"__MOVIES__ That was some of the most artful rage I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ Glodell is from a new generation of filmmakers. I've heard a lot of new guys called 'daring.' Glodell is the real-deal daring."
"__MOVIES__ This is what happens when you give kids an iPhone and tell 'em they can make movies."
