"__MOVIES__ You seem to only like scary movies, do you have a favorite comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a hard one. Does it have to be strictly a comedy, or can it be a funny horror movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to make this a tough one for you, so strictly comedy!"
"__MOVIES__ Ummmm, oh, I got one! Office Space!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? you can't think of anything more recent?"
"__MOVIES__ I know it's from the late 90's but it's a classic!"
"__MOVIES__ So what makes you like that one out of all the great comedies that have come along since?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the only reason I watched it was that it reminded me of where I worked at the time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the old office building by Michigan Ave?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one!"
"__MOVIES__ Was it really that bad where you worked?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, but there were a lot of similarities!"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Jennifer Aniston in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she was, opposite Ron Livingston."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that guy from Sex and the City."
"__MOVIES__ Surpisingly, I like Aniston in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I thought that she would be annoying, but she wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ Now I really want to watch that movie again!"
"__MOVIES__ Want to have a movie night?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, your place or mine?"
