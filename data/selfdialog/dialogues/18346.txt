"__MOVIES__ What do you think about the Hunger Games movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I love them! I like Jennifer Lawrence is great."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. She's awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Althought I never got the idea that she was really torn between the two guys."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think that was her fault. I think that was the writing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree.  I never thought that Liam Hemsworth was really in contention."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Peta or however you spell it was in SO many more scenes and they never really showed her thinking about the other guy."
"__MOVIES__ And when he builds the weapon that kills her sister! I mean really, you know she isn't going back to him."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  But I actually felt less like she was in love with Peta than that they had bonded over suffering."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's the best she could get after all she went through."
"__MOVIES__ The end was a suprise for me!  I never thought that she was going to kill Julianne Moore."
"__MOVIES__ I agree! I thought she's expose her but not kill her."
"__MOVIES__ That was pretty rough."
"__MOVIES__ And when they go after the other President in the end.  I thought he'd live."
"__MOVIES__ No, I never thought he'd live."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the costumes!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! That dress that goes up in flames is fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ That would be a great halloween costume, minus the flames."
"__MOVIES__ But I don't like the bow and arrow outfit."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what can you expect.  It's suppossed to be pratical."
