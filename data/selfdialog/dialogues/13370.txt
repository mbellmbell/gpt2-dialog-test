"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who was the winner of the first Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was Green Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, there weren't nearly as many teams back then. They won the first two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they have the most?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think that's the Steelers with six."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many does Green Bay have then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Four I think. The first two, one in the '90s and one in 2011."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did they beat in 2011?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, I'm pretty sure it was the Steelers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots have to be closing in on the Steelers right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have five, and all of them in the 2000s and 2010s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's really impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. And from what I hear, I think they are favorites for next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but so much can happen in a season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. They need to stay healthy and with a 40 year old quarterback, that isn't easy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is pretty amazing to see how good Brady still is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he takes really good care of himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He definitely does. I'm looking forward to seeing what he can do this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you are a Pats fan, so I guess you would be!"
