"__DISNEY__ We just saw the new Cars movie the other night, Cars 3. It was really good."
"__DISNEY__ I love the Cars movies. Cars 2 wasn't as good as the first, but I was pretty excited about this third one."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Cars 2 seemed more like it was about Mater than anything, but it was still fun."
"__DISNEY__ Mater is a great character, but my kids' favorite is Lightning McQueen."
"__DISNEY__ I think they'd really enjoy the new movie then. I'm sure you will too."
"__DISNEY__ Well, Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors, so I'm looking forward to hearing him put one of the characters to life in only the way he could."
"__DISNEY__ I know he's been in a lot of shows, but wasn't there some big movie he was supposed to make an appearance in recently?"
"__DISNEY__ He filmed a scene for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it was cut."
"__DISNEY__ I remember you telling me about that. Man, speaking of great movies..."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely! Only movie I've seen more than once in the theater."
