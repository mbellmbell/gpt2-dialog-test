"__MUSIC__ What was your first concert ever?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, I didn't go to many concerts growing up. You?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to a Backstreet Boys concert to make my high school ex happy."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, how torturous was that?"
"__MUSIC__ You have no idea. It was insane."
"__MUSIC__ Do girls at concerts really scream when a guy takes off his shirt?"
"__MUSIC__ YUP, and they get mad if we do it if a woman takes hers off. Very hypocritical."
"__MUSIC__ I remember now: Rusted Root. It was crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't they a hippie band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, my brother told my mom that I'd come home smelling like pot but that doesn't mean I smoked."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, it was in a really tight enclosed space, too. The guards were handing out joints!"
"__MUSIC__ That's. Insane."
"__MUSIC__ I'm surprised the cops didn't break the door down and arrest everyone."
"__MUSIC__ Did you at least have fun?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and no. I was with a girl I liked but I hated dancing and I'm really boring."
"__MUSIC__ You're SUPER boring."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks."
"__MUSIC__ At least I danced with girls."
"__MUSIC__ Don't be mean! You went to a more open space for your concert."
