"__COMEDY__ Have you seen any good comedies lately?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah. I finally got around to seeing Knocked Up."

"__COMEDY__ The main characters are played by Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl."
"__COMEDY__ Oh. Seth Rogen is the guy that played in Pineapple Express, right?"
"__COMEDY__ That's right. He's pretty funny."
"__COMEDY__ He's been in quite a few movies with James Franco."
"__COMEDY__ I think the best one they starred in together was This Is the End where they basically parodied themselves."

"__COMEDY__ I know. I thought it was hilarious when Rihanna slapped Michael Cera across the face after he touched her butt."
