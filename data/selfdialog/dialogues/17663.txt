"__MOVIES__ Did you hear of the movie Wadjda?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a girl growing up in Saudi Arabia."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds oppressive already."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  She's an eleven year old girl who wants to buy a bike."
"__MOVIES__ Do they let girls ride bikes there?"
"__MOVIES__ No, her mom refuses to get her one."
"__MOVIES__ That stinks."
"__MOVIES__ So she tries to get her money by selling mix tapes, but gets bagged."
"__MOVIES__ Too bad."
"__MOVIES__ Then she hits on the idea of winning a Quran recital competition."
"__MOVIES__ Neat. Does she win?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she does."
"__MOVIES__ Does she get the bike?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the school doesn't like her idea about buying a bike."
"__MOVIES__ And?"
"__MOVIES__ They donate her prize money to Palestinians."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds lousy."
"__MOVIES__ Her mom buys her the bike, so she's happy."
"__MOVIES__ That's good.  At least it's a good ending."
