"__FASHION__ What do you think about this leggings craze?"
"__FASHION__ I think leggings are fantastic when worn as leggings, not as pants."
"__FASHION__ With so many companies using marketing sales and pop up stores do you believe they are all the same?"
"__FASHION__ I think some companies like LuLu Roe and Buskins have great quality products but there's a lot of copy cats with poor quality."
"__FASHION__ What body type is best for leggings?"
"__FASHION__ I think all body types are good for them as long as the style is coordinated right. Anyone can pull them off with the right top!"
"__FASHION__ I happen love my Buskins because of the price, free shipping benefit, and they aren't sheer at all."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I have seen some amazing prints also. My favorite are the aztec designs."
"__FASHION__ I really think there should be more options for the plus sized girls when it comes to bottoms so this trend is perfect."
"__FASHION__ It's funny how popular they've become and how fast these companies have grown."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I remember as a little girl just wearing 'tights' and a dress. I had no idea they would evolve into what they are today!"
"__FASHION__ It's not a bad thing for sure. I just don't like when people wear them as pants with a top that doesn't cover their butt or thighs."
"__FASHION__ They do need to be worn with a tunic or dress, I agree."
"__FASHION__ Which is better to go with them? Boots or sandals?"
"__FASHION__ Some I wear with sandals but mainly boots and a short dress. It gives it that edgy look."
"__FASHION__ Speaking of boots! Best brand?"
"__FASHION__ Dr. Martens of course!"
"__FASHION__ Omg you and I are too much alike."
"__FASHION__ Most people think they are outdated."
"__FASHION__ No way! They will never go out of style just like leggings won't."
