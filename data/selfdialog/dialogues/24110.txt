"__SUPERHERO__ Do you like the Dark Knight movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I do but I'm not a huge fan of Christian Bale as Batman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Is it because you prefer another of the original Batmans?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No it's because he sounds like he's battling throat cancer. It's really annoying."
"__SUPERHERO__ I guess that's true. I love how Christopher Nolan directed those movies though."
"__SUPERHERO__ You're right, he did a terrific job. I loved the one with Bane the most."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh that was my favorite too. When he broke Batman's back I was in shock."
"__SUPERHERO__ I was in even more shock at how long it took him to recover."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well he is just human, so it made sense in reality."
"__SUPERHERO__ True but I don't like watching my superhero's battle their weaknesses for too long."
