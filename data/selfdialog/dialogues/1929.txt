"__MUSIC__ What is going on with Miley Cirus?"
"__MUSIC__ She seems to want the same attention as Brittany Spears."

"__MUSIC__ It did, didn't it? I think Miley was tired od being seen as that Disney channel icon she was."
"__MUSIC__ At least her music is still pretty good. I like her song 'Wrecking Ball'."
"__MUSIC__ I actually like that one too."
"__MUSIC__ Her changes don't seem to effect her music, it's just the way she acts that's extreme."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what her father thinks of it. I haven't heard an opinion or comment from him on it."
"__MUSIC__ She is an adult now, not much ol' Billy Ray can say."
"__MUSIC__ I guess not, but what is wrong with just being a wholesome music artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift has that market locked down, but she still gets antagonized by other artist."
"__MUSIC__ I remember what Kanye West said at that awards show ac oouple years back."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if that was completly directed at Taylor Swift, but I'm sure it was still awkward."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I would've wanted to fade from view of anyone who was there."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I have actually listened to any of Taylor Swift's music, except what is played on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ She tends to be more geared toward the heartbroken."

"__MUSIC__ What type of music is that?"
"__MUSIC__ The oldies, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, artist like that."
