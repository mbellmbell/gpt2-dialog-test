"__STAR_WARS__ Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Personally I've always been a big fan of The Empire Strikes Back. That Hoth battle was really cool!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think a lot of people also feel that way. I like Return of the Jedi myself."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you a huge fan of Ewoks?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they're so adorable. And I liked how they kicked some stormtrooper butt in that battle on Endor."
"__STAR_WARS__ My other favorite part about The Empire Strikes back was the saber fight between Luke and Darth Vader. That was awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ It wasn't bad. The lightsaber combat is so hard to watch now that I've seen the flashier choreography in the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ To me it will always be better, more real. I liked that The Force Awakens tried to kind of replicate that gritty feeling that the fights had."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's almost like the prequels and the other movies aren't even in the same universe! They're so different."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. But if we didn't have the prequels we'd have missed out on a lot of great characters. Like Qui Gon Jinn."
