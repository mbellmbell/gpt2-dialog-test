"__MUSIC__ I know I played that Alanis Morrisette album to death."
"__MUSIC__ 'Jagged Little Pill'?"

"__MUSIC__ It was a great pop/rock radio album, for sure."
"__MUSIC__ I remember Shania Twain being everywhere, too."
"__MUSIC__ Of course! Whatever happened to her?"

"__MUSIC__ Same with Celine Dion. Especially with the Titanic theme."

"__MUSIC__ It wouldn't surprise me. I feel like I've seen the music video a thousand times."
