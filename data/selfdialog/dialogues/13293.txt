"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't it insane to think that the Miami Dolphins went undefeated?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When did they do that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In 1972."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Patriots did that in 2007."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but the Patriots lost the Super Bowl that year. The Dolphins won the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So that has only happened once in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. It is an amazing feat to think about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even if the Dolphins are the only team that has ever done that. They have only gone downhill ever since."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not true. We repeated and won the Super Bowl again the next year in 1973."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but I mean that the last 30 plus years of Dolphins history has been pretty lousy since that streak."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We won the AFC in 1984."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that when you had Dan Marino?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. He was MVP that year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who beat them in the Super Bowl that year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was the Buffalo Bills. They didn't even deserve to be in the Super Bowl but they somehow beat the Dolphins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well what are they going to be like this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is some hope for them this year. They made the playoffs last year and the new coach started to show some good signs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is their new coach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is Adam Gase. He started last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok. Well hopefully they will make a comeback this year!"
