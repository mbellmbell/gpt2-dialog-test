"__DISNEY__ Who is the best Disney villain?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm gonna have to go with Jafar."
"__DISNEY__ No way. It has to be Scar."
"__DISNEY__ Let's not forget Ursula from The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, she is so scary."
"__DISNEY__ Remember at the end when she got huge?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that was very cool."
"__DISNEY__ She is the best female villain for sure."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure. The wicked queen from Snow White is very good."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. Maybe it is a tie between her and Ursula."
