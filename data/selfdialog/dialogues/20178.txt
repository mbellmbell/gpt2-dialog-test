"__MOVIES__ You've seen the original Mad Max, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure I have."
"__MOVIES__ Do you recall ever seeing the poster for it, of the cop wearing a helmet walking down the road carrying a gun?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ That isn't even Mel Gibson, that's the guy who played Goose."
"__MOVIES__ How could anybody tell that?"
"__MOVIES__ Goose's helmet was a little different from the other cops, and he's the only one who wore knee and elbow pads."
"__MOVIES__ But I guess since the helmet visor is down, you couldn't tell."
"__MOVIES__ The guy who played Goose was a roommate of Mel Gibson's in film school."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool."
"__MOVIES__ They wanted to use unknown actors, but they still wanted to go for a strong worldwide audience."
"__MOVIES__ They certainly got that."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know until recently that all of the actors were dubbed until a DVD release not very long ago."
"__MOVIES__ Why did they dub them?"
"__MOVIES__ At the time, Americans weren't very much exposed to the Australian accent and couldn't understand it."
"__MOVIES__ I never realized it was dubbed."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it's amazing to realize that you've been fooled all these years!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard the movie wasn't originally shown in New Zealand and then was given the harshest rating for violence."
"__MOVIES__ Why? They don't really show much violence. It's implied"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently an officer in New Zealand was murdered by bikers in a somehow similar manner as Goose is murdered. So they thought it would be distasteful."
