"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw Lady Gaga at the Super Bowl."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What did you think?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ First time I ever heard her.  Probably the last time too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm sure she'll be heartbroken."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Just not my thing.  And what was she wearing?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think they're called clothes."
"__LADY_GAGA__ They barely fit her.  It wasn't kid appropriate."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Kids should usually be playing outside during Super Bowl anyway."
"__LADY_GAGA__ All I know is I will not let my kids listen to or watch her from this point forward."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Whatever you want to do, it's your life."
