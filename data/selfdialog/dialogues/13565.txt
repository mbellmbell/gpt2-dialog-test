"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Watching these reruns of Hard Knocks is making me excited for this season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was it the one with the LA Rams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that series. It's such an interesting look into the locker room"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't make it a point to watch them, besides the season with the Jets"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That season was legendary for the show."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rex Ryan's temperament really made that series hilarious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does. It's a shame that series is from when the Jets were competing in AFC title matches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That collapse happened so quickly. I feel your pain to a degree being a Bengals fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their history is probably nearly as bad my Jets history. We still cling onto Namath from the late 60s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you ever think that Namath was probably one of the most overrated Hall of Famers ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, yes. He wasn't a good player at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a few seasosn where he led the league in passing yards I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe he did, but if you look at his statistics they were brutal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't he finish with more interceptions than touchdowns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ .That's an understatement my friend. He had a 173:220 Touchdown to interception ratio."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he couldn't even manage a 1:1 ratio?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope. They always say it's because the football of the 20th century was a lot more physical, especially with defensive backs, but come on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People like Mel Blount would abuse you at the line, but jeez that means you look elsewhere if hes mugging your receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. Namath's stats just mean he slung the thing regardless. You don't nearly 50 interceptions more just because of an era of football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He seems like an overrated version of Favre, except Favre threw more TDs than INTs."
