"__MUSIC__ Why is the Enya Paint the Sky With Stars album up on your phone?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I was playing it last night in bed. Sometimes I like to fall asleep to it."
"__MUSIC__ Just like you used to like to do when you were little."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, same exact album. A few of the songs, like Orinoco Flow and Anywhere Is are more upbeat for trying to fall asleep to, but overall it does the trick."
"__MUSIC__ I just don't like that I can never make out the words in Enya's music. It all sounds the same to me."
"__MUSIC__ I don't blame you, after all the stuff they do to Enya's voice... It gets drowned out by the effects and the music you can't hardly make it out."
"__MUSIC__ That's not her voice?"
"__MUSIC__ No, her natural voice sounds nothing like that. It's way more frail than you would think listening to the albums."
"__MUSIC__ She makes it work though."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely! I mean, consider how many albums she's sold over the years."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favourite of hers?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Paint the Sky With Stars just because I used to listen to it all the time with my mom, it's special. I have a few favourite songs that aren't on it though, Flora's Secret and Long Long Journey."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not familiar with those."
"__MUSIC__ Flora's Secret is very happy sounding, it's a song about lovers and I just feel like frolicking whenever I hear it. Long Long Journey in contrast is very somber and encourages me when I'm going through a hard time."
"__MUSIC__ Because it's somber?"
"__MUSIC__ No, because of the lyrics 'but what are sighs and what is sadness to the heart that's coming home'. It reminds me that I'm on my way home and these current troubles pale in comparison."
"__MUSIC__ You must have looked up those lyrics online."
"__MUSIC__ I mean I can make out more of the words than you can, but I still had to look them up before."
"__MUSIC__ I had that trouble with her Christmas album, so I couldn't tell when one song ended and another started."
"__MUSIC__ I can understand that, that was a tough one even for me."
