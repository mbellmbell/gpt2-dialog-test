"__STAR_WARS__ When does The Last Jedi come out anyway?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think around Christmas time. Lots of people go to the movies during the holiday season."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's kind of sad that Han Solo is gone. I just got used to him as a character again and then boom, he's dead."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope Ben aka Kylo Ren gets what he deserves."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet Luke serves up some serious payback in this one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Luke still has what it takes? He looked a little rough in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ He has to. Han was his boy. You can't let Kylo get away with killing your best friend."
"__STAR_WARS__ And it was patricide also. Man that was dark."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Finn and Rey are going to get together?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Actually I do. Star Wars needs a new love affair."
