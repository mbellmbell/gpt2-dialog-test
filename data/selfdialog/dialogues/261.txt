"__MUSIC__ I read today that Weird Al Yankovich is getting a star on the Hollywood walk of fame."
"__MUSIC__ I thought only actors got those?"
"__MUSIC__ No, all kinds of artists are eligible!"
"__MUSIC__ So he's getting a star for his musical achievements?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I think Amish Paradise is a great song."
"__MUSIC__ It is. And he is a great satirist."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think a whole generation was raised laughing along with his music."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I can get on board. What other musicians have stars?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I know the Beatles all have two--one as a band, and one for each of them as an individual."
"__MUSIC__ They are larger than life. That makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it depends on what matters to you, like, what makes a musician deserving of recognition?"
"__MUSIC__ Isn't it enough that you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but lots of people have to like them for them to get a star. It's crazy to me that it has taken Weird Al so long to get one."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe he didn't care about getting one."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. But does Lady Gaga have one? Or Ke$ha?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they deserve them?"
"__MUSIC__ I think if Weird Al gets one, they probably should too."
"__MUSIC__ He's probably parodied both of them already."
"__MUSIC__ If not, it's only a matter of time."
