"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you like to win the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Every discussion starts and ends with the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but they aren't necessarily gonna win again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but they are favorites for a reason. Tom Brady is just the ultimate winner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Cowboys have a shot to come out of the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see some regression with Dak Prescott and they are in a pretty tough division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Houston is also in a good spot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely are well coached and have a great defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Green Bay this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Aaron Rodgers obviously. It just seems that they can never stop anyone in a big spot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For some reason I also think Pittsburgh can make one last run with Ben."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely have a bunch of playmakers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If their defense can hold they can put up a lot of points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Big Ben, Brown, and Bell are a a really solid top 3 offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be the worst team in the league this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has to be the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets? Why do you think they are going to be bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems to me they are tanking on purpose. They've added no one and don't have a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait to start researching my fantasy team and the start of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Hope it's another exciting year and my hometown Lions can stay competitive."
