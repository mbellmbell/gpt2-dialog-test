"__STAR_WARS__ Hey have you seen The original release of Star Wars Episode 4?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Which version?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The one where Han shot first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh you mean the original release before George Lucas Added all the extra computer graphics?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  I really miss the original version.  I feel it made the star wars universe more believable."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I really love that part where Luke gets a kiss from Leia on the cheek for luck."
"__STAR_WARS__ I always thought that was weird because they were brother and sister."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's really weird is when ObiWan denies ever owning a R2 unit."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah once you watch the prequels, you realize what a liar ObiWan was.  He doesn't seem like the most moral Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ The jedi were never really about morality.  If they were moral they wouldn't use the Jedi Mind tricks to lie and manipulate people to get what they want."
