"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So tell me what you think of the Browns this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'll still be at the bottom of the league without a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But their defense is going to be a lot better, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would think so based on their new draft picks. They have one of the best defensive ends in Myles Garrett now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the NFL, if you have an elite player at defensive end, you can survive in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's one of the 2-3 most important positions in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they're still so weak at the top position: quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really don't have to win this year. All they have to do is improve on last season, and that will give fans hope."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And then in the next draft they can target a starting quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's really all it's about: giving fans hope. Not every team is making the Super Bowl, but giving hope that you can make it in 2-3 years is a good thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What other positions did they improve on?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a really good safety in Jabrill Peppers. He was taken #25 in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll keep games close thanks to their offense, but they still won't be able to score."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Cody Kessler can stay healthy, and if David Njoku proves he can catch and block, they may be better on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your outlook on how many games they can win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 4-5 would be a great achievement, especially if they keep the other games close."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Being competitive in games that you lose can be a good thing. Like you said, it gives fans hope for the next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did also draft a QB in the second round, but he's not ready this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Kessler did look good last year when he was able to stay on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, they still need to get a game changing QB in the 2018 draft to complete their transformation."
