"__DISNEY__ The original Beauty and the Beast was pretty overrated."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, now I know you're trying to pick a fight."
"__DISNEY__ I'm ready for it.  1991 was just a weak year for movies."
"__DISNEY__ That movie was a classic tale with great songs and great animation."
"__DISNEY__ Was it really though?  There are tons of better Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ How can you not love Belle?"
"__DISNEY__ Belle is bratty and selfish."
"__DISNEY__ You are completely crazy.  She's brave and strong and independent."
"__DISNEY__ To you maybe.  To me, she'll always be a dumb girl who shouldn't run off to the woods."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure we can be friends anymore."
