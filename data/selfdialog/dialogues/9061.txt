"__BEATLES__ What are you hearing?"
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles!!! Do you like them too?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh wow, I heard a lot of them but never heard that song."
"__BEATLES__ It's called We can work it out! I think it came out in 1970,"
"__BEATLES__ Sounds a little different from the others, why is that?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh probably because that's from the time Lennon and McCartney worked together, they composed the best lyrics but then Lennon left and things changed."
"__BEATLES__ They were great after that too but I have to admit they were better when they had Lennon."
"__BEATLES__ They also wrote for other singers, Fame sung by David Bowie was written by Lennon and McCartney too!"
"__BEATLES__ Sad times for the company that turned them down before they got famous!!! What a money machine!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah Decca's bad move there, Parlophone had the best move and signed them."
