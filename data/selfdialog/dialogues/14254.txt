"__HORROR__ So, what genres of movies do you get into other than comedy and action?  Do you watch horror?"
"__HORROR__ Not in general, though I did like the Evil Dead series and I also liked the Hellraiser series."
"__HORROR__ Oh, that's interesting.  Evil Dead is comedy-horror and Clive Barker is supernatural horror and body horror."
"__HORROR__ Wow I didn't know that.  I just thought of it as creative horror."
"__HORROR__ Well it has to do with what is causing the feeling of horror in you."
"__HORROR__ The thing is, it doesn't cause horror as much to me.  Now The Ring, that was more scary to me."
"__HORROR__ Yes, that was scary.  I guess different strokes for different folks when it comes to horror."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I think it was visually creative with Pinhead and those other guys."
"__HORROR__ So, what else do you remember from the Hellraiser movies?"
"__HORROR__ I remember the part at the end of one of the movies when that guy said, 'What is your pleasure?', and he was on that rotating thing."
