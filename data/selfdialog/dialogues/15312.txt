"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's Harry Potter weekend, are you going to watch?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, definitely. I really love Neville."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Neville! Out of everyone at Hogwarts, you like Neville. I bet you are going to tell me you like Luna too, huh?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is wrong with that? Neville got so brave at the end standing up to Voldemort."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He did, he really grew as a character. My favorite is the Weasley's mom!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah! I just loved that way she defended Ginny from Bellatrix."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, that fight scene was so powerful. I really loved it. I can't wait to watch now."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know I'm so excited. I don't think I'm leaving my couch."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry Potter here I come!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Don't forget those tissues, Dumbledore dying is very sad."
