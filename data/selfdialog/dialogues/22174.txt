"__DISNEY__ Is it just me or is Ariel mean?"
"__DISNEY__ What are you talking about?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, maybe not mean, naive would be better."
"__DISNEY__ She's like 15 years old though."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but she's immature and goofy."
"__DISNEY__ Again, she's 15 years old."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I just think she should act more her age."
"__DISNEY__ She lives underwater and her father's a king.  Why are expecting realism?"
"__DISNEY__ I never said anything about realism, I just don't like her as much as I should."
"__DISNEY__ You really need to get out more and stop focusing on mermaids."
