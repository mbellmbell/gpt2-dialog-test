"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite character from all of Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Han Solo, for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not Luke Skywalker?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nah, he's too whiny.  Like when he whines to Uncle Owen about getting converters in A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he was whiny.  My favorite character is Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah.  He's so cute-- and pretty bad, considering his fight scene in Attack of the Clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it was pretty awesome seeing him flip around."
"__STAR_WARS__ Speaking of Attack of the Clones, what did you think about Boba Fett being a clone of Jango Fett?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was kinda lame, honestly.  Boba was one of my favorites, but I thought that backstory was weak."
