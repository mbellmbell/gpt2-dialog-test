"__HORROR__ Were you ever a fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street series?"
"__HORROR__ Was I? Most definitely, since I was 6 years old and saw part 1 for the first time."
"__HORROR__ That's the best one in my opinion, all the others were not so good."
"__HORROR__ You're right, that was the best one but I liked part 3 also."
"__HORROR__ That was The Dream Warriors right? The one with the kids in the mental hospital?"
"__HORROR__ Yes that's a classic to me. That's the last of the series that actually had some scares in it."
"__HORROR__ I agree with that. Did you see Freddy's Dead? Part 6 I believe."
"__HORROR__ Yes when the woman found out she was Freddy's daughter? That was a fun movie, not scary but entertaining."
"__HORROR__ Yes I loved the cartoonishness of it, and that we got to see Robert Englund out of makeup."
"__HORROR__ That rebooted version of Nightmare on Elm Street was terrible. They should have left it alone."
