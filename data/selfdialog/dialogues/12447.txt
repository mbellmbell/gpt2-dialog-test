"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Miami Dolphins are going to do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not expecting much out of them as usual. They're always kind of mediocre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it must be disappointing to be a Dolphins fan. It's like the organization doesn't even try."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From my experience, Dolphins fans aren't as passionate about their team as other fanbases."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I've been to a game at Hard Rock Stadium and it almost felt more like a social event than a football game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Miami has some pretty good player on their roster though. That's something for their fans to get excited about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ryan Tannehill is a really good, underrated quarterback in the NFL I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget Ndamukong Suh on their defense. He's actually the highest paid player on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of the three NFL teams in the state of Florida, which do you think is going to have the best season in 2017?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't been following those teams too closely but I would actually say that the Dolphins will do the best in 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? You don't think Tampa Bay will have a good year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like I said, I haven't been following too closely but I think that Miami has the stronger roster and a slightly easier schedule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Miami and Tampa Bay actually play each other in Week One of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That might be an interesting game. I'll predict that Miami will win by a touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that the Dolphins have a chance to beat the Patriots when they play later in the season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely not. Unless New England has a lot of injuries, I cannot see any way that Miami wins that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what is a game on Miami's schedule that you think they have a chance to upset someone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll predict that they have a good chance to win when they play at Atlanta."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a bold prediction that they'll defeat a team that went to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just have have a good feeling about the match ups in the game."
