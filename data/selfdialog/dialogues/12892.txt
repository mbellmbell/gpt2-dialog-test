"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Browns are going to do this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You already know the answer to that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they could improve."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are the worst team in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brock Osweiler might start as quarterback though, and he was pretty good for the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cleveland Browns only won one game last season. They are hopeless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're being so cynical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only time the Browns were enjoyable to watch in the past decade was when Brian Hoyer played for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. They almost won half of their games when they had him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you're right. The Browns aren't a very good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They can't seem to get it together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just wish they would at least win against the Steelers every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ah, the old Steelers vs Browns rivalry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's so frustrating whenever the Steelers win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder when Ben Roethlisberger is going to retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. How old is he now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's got to be close to 40. He's played for a while now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I wonder who was the oldest football player to retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. Peyton Manning seemed pretty old when he retired at 39."
