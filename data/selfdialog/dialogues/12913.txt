"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My wife asked me last week if there was anything special I wanted for my birthday next month."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Happy early birthday! How old are you going to be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 45. For her last birhday, my wife wanted something really special. So she was checking to make sure in case I wanted something big too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did your wife want for her birthday?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A fancy ring with gemstones and diamonds she saw at the mall. It cost over two grand."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, and you bought it?! You're a really great husband."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, so don't you think if I wanted something nice I should get equal treatment?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, what did you ask for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know how I love football, and the Pats, and Tom Brady. I want an autographed football helmet they have listed online in the official NFL shop that's signed by Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like a great present for you! What's the problem?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My wife refuses to buy it. She said it is way too much money for something that sits on a shelf."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh oh, how much is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fifteen hundred dollars. But it's authentic. It's hand signed by Brady, and has a certificate from the NFL that it's authentic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would it lose value later if someone suspected it wasn't authentic?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has a special hologram with a number that will show if it's tampered with. This helps guarantee it's the real deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you try telling your wife it could actually increase in value after Brady retires?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I tried to tell her it was an investment and could always be sold later, but she thinks the value will go down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Generally that might be true, but when you're talking about one of the great, well known players like Brady, the value should at least hold even."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a Super Bowl Champions helmet, signed by a five time Super Bowl Champion, so I'm sure it would still retain its value."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the only thing you can do is just keep mentioning over and over how you bought her the ring she wanted, but if she isn't going to reciprocate, then in the future you will just get her small sensible gifts, and that will scare her into getting you that helmet."
