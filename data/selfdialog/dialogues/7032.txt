"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who do you think will end up in the finals"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I say Preds and Pens"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think Senators and Preds"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I like the Senators too but the star power is going to be too much for them to handle."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I just think Anderson is out of his mind."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ While I do agree for the most part, Fleury is just as able"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Being able and being on fire are two different things."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah but this isnt Fleury winning games and giving up 4 goals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ True, but it took them to 7 with the Caps."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Caps were a good team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I dont think so, Ovi is a cancer to them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Thats a seperate issue, Im talking about Pens and Caps."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ OK even so, I think that you will see that series built character for them and they got through it."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Crosby is on that team but for how long."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He is injury prone but they can cloak that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Malkin needs to shoulder the team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Another Russian you could say is better as second fiddle rather than the main star."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I dont know what to say to that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You can say hes not an elite player."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But he is, even as a by product of Crosby"
