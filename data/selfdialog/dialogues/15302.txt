"__HARRY_POTTER__ I re-watched all of the Harry Potter movies last week."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Awesome! Which one is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love them all, but if I had to pick one, I guess Goblet of Fire."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like that one too, but I always cry when Cedric dies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too! He is such a good character. I think the Tri Wizard tournament is fun to watch though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it is. I think my favorite movie is the first Deathly Hallows."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is a good one. I'm glad it was spit up into two movies so the whole story could be covered."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Agreed! I like both of them for sure. Of course I knew Snape dies, but it is still always sad to see."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why do so many characters we love have to die?!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know! I get so emotional!"
