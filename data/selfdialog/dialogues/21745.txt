"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Toy Story That Time Forgot?"
"__DISNEY__ No! I didn't realize there are more Toy Story movies than 1, 2 and 3!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! Remember Bonnie from the third Toy Story movie? It's from her perspective!"
"__DISNEY__ That's awesome! I'll have to watch that one!"
"__DISNEY__ It's so good! It's not as long as a movie so I don't think it gets the credit it deserves."
"__DISNEY__ That's disappointing. I know other movies have done short spin offs but I didn't know about Toy Story!"
"__DISNEY__ Woody and Buzz actually have small roles in this one. Bonnie has multiple toys that were at the Daycare in the third one and one of those is the main character."
"__DISNEY__ Interesting! Which toy is the main character then?"
"__DISNEY__ It's the dinosaur named Trixie. It mainly has dinosaurs in it! It's definitely worth watching."
"__DISNEY__ I think all of the Toy Stories are definitely worth watching!"
