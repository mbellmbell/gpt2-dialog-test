"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The year the Jets make the Superbowl is almost here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not even in your dreams I'm afraid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No need to rub it in. You know I'm just kidding."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Jets are looking to be legitimately one of the worst teams this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read that some executives stated that they may be fielding one of the worst teams in recent history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That team could legitimately go 0-16."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That 0-16 Lions team was not that bad at all. They just ran into some serious bad luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. They were a lot better than this upcoming Jets team is"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm scared about the quarterbacking situation. We seem so lost."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who even is on the roster? Hackenberg and Petty?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. I don't even know who our third quarterback is. Assuming we have one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's pretty unsettling to have those two as your top quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't heard very much that was good about Hacky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last I heard he was apparently so inaccurate that he was pelting reporters in the back on accident."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard about that story to. I really wanted to hope it was a joke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They always said he was a huge project. It's showing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It grows tiresome that we seemingly keep drafting projects. I want prospects, not projects."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the difference?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Projects can take years to develop. Time you don't have. Prospects can contribute instantly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh so basically someone like Tebow was a project, while someone like Newton would be a prospect. I understand."
