"__BASKETBALL__ Hey do you follow basketball at al?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Kind of, but not much recently. Why?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Just curious if you've been a fan of the celtics!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess I'd say I am, but i haven't been watching lately."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why not?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I haven't been an avid fan since the 90s. I feel like they've gone downhill since then."
"__BASKETBALL__ You haven't been watching lately then, have you!?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I haven't, why?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They've been doing awesome, they won tonight like 111 to 106 or something like that!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow, it's been a while since bball has been going on in the Garden still this late in the season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Tell me about it! Why haven't you been watching since the 90s?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They were great then. When they ha Larry Bird. I've kinda lost hope since then."
"__BASKETBALL__ They did suck for the past several years."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I'd hear scores hear and there and realized I wasn't msising out on anything."
"__BASKETBALL__ I went to a game like 4 years ago and more than have the crowd left before the end."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who did they play?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't even remember, guess that's a sign of how memorable the game was."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'll say!"
"__BASKETBALL__ But you should really start watching again!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe I will- maybe we'll see each other at the Garden!"
