"__DISNEY__ what disney movie do you think has the best bad guy?"
"__DISNEY__ oh that is a tough one, but im going to go with aladdin"
"__DISNEY__ oh Jafar from aladdin was bad to the bone"
"__DISNEY__ yeah he was, and he was super powerful once he got genie under his control"
"__DISNEY__ that is true, but there is a lesson to be learned from that"
"__DISNEY__ and what would that be exactly?"
"__DISNEY__ too much power is not a good thing, because that was what led to his downfall"
"__DISNEY__ yeah you are right, he became stronger than genie and it came back to hurt him"
"__DISNEY__ exactly now if only i could find a magical lamp"
"__DISNEY__ well if you do let me get at least one wish!"
