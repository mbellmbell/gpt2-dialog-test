"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only sixty three days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sixty three days? Sixty three days till what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sixty three days until football season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously, I mean don't you follow baseball?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I cannot wait. The Steelers are going to bring home the Championship this year for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think so huh? Aren't you forgetting something?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean are you forgetting that New England is also going to be playing this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that is an issue, but I think this is the year that we win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you beat Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is all about the defense's ability to get to him. He can be shaken and beaten. If you can get to him a couple of times he tends to lose his temper and then you can beat him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is going to do that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Cam Heyward was injured last year and he will be back. Bud Dupree was also hurt for a while and he should be back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think those two guys are enough?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will definitely help but the secondary is also going to have a lot more experience working as a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How does an experienced secondary help you get to Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they have got their men covered then Brady can't release the ball and our front four has more time to apply the rush."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see, so it is all about teamwork."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right, unless of course you are the New England Patriots.  Then it is all about Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got that right."
