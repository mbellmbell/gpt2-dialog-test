"__BASEBALL__ One thing I will never forget in my lifetime is the night in 2004 when the Boston Red Sox won the world series. I remember waking up at 3-4AM and literally pinching myself and asking if that really happened."
"__BASEBALL__ One of my earliest memories is baseball ffrom the early 80s. My brother's favorite player was George Brett."
"__BASEBALL__ When Vince Coleman broke in with the Cardinals in 1985, I had never seen anything like him. He was the fastest human being I had ever seen."
"__BASEBALL__ The Red Sox were always my favorite team. No other team was even close."
"__BASEBALL__ When the Red sox lost the World Series in 1986, it broke my heart. Even though the games were on too late for me to watch the whole thing."
"__BASEBALL__ The Red sox were big underdogs against the Mets. The Mets were probably the best team in a decade."
"__BASEBALL__ The ALCS between the Angels and the Red Sox was a classic. I remember distinctly game 5 which the Red sox won when they should of lost."
"__BASEBALL__ Dave Henderson hit a homerun in extra innings in that game. That ultimately broke the Angels spirits."
"__BASEBALL__ Several years later the pitcher who gave up that homerun committed suicide. What a tragedy!"
"__BASEBALL__ The 1986 Red Sox had Wade Boggs and Rogel Clemens. They were two of the best young players in the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Several years later, it was found out those 2 players had alot of personal demons. They are still HOF players."
"__BASEBALL__ Wade Boggs was addicted to sex. Roger Clemens was addicted to himself!"
"__BASEBALL__ Both players eventually won WorldSeries with the Yankees. That made me sick."
"__BASEBALL__ Though I hate the Yankees, I have to respect them. They won so many World Series titles."
"__BASEBALL__ Especially in the late 1990s, the Yankees were good. The 1998 team was the best I ever saw."
"__BASEBALL__ They had so many gritty players. They were not superstars."
"__BASEBALL__ They just played well as a team. And they found a way to beat you."
"__BASEBALL__ Pedro Martines vs. the Yankees of the 1990s was much see TV. I could not keep my eye of those games."
"__BASEBALL__ Though honestly, Pedro vs. anyone was much see TV. He was that great."
