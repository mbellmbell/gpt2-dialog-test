"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, which team do you think will be the biggest surprise of the season in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Browns have a decent chance this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'er always so bad!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but this year might be the year they get things together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are they going to pull it off?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, hopefully their off season acquisitions and new signings will help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it will take much more than that, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, their coaching staff will have to put in a lot of work."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and luck plays a pretty big factor in team success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but given a clean slate of health - the Browns may surprise some people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well then I will be on the lookout for them then!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You heard it hear first!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think that the Jets have a shot to make a splash."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they did shake up their coaching staff within the last couple years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be another year of building on what they are now establishing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This year - we may see many surprises in the NFL."
