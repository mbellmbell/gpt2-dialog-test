"__BEATLES__ So, I heard you like The Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ They're fine, yeah. Kinda grew up on them, my dad was a fan."
"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite song, then?"
"__BEATLES__ Hey Jude."
"__BEATLES__ Okay, you're not a real Beatles fan."
"__BEATLES__ Who are you to say?"
"__BEATLES__ If your favorite Beatles song is Hey Jude then you don't even know The Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ You're what I like to call a music snob, not worth my time."
"__BEATLES__ What next, Here Comes The Sun?"
"__BEATLES__ That's a good song and you know it!"
