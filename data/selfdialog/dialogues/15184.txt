"__HARRY_POTTER__ So my wife want's to watch Harry Potter tonight but I feel i'm too old to watch the movies what do you think?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No way those movies are actually just as good for adults"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really?  I thought it looked pretty lame on the trailers"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No there is a lot of cool magic and visual effects"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess I can give them a try"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just keep an open mind, even though kids are doing the magic there are also teachers that are adults and some pretty notable actors are in the series"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Like who?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Gary Oldman is in at least 3 or 4 of them"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really, he's a great actor, you may have sold me on him alone"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ there you go, now go and enjoy the movies with your wife"
