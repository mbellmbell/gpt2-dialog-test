"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So what's your favorite Fast & Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I have to give that to Furious 7."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Same here. What's your reason?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ For me, it holds a special place in my heart because it was the sendoff film for Brian."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Was he your favorite character?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, ever since the first one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was a really touching sendoff to see him go off and be a father."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah. I'm tearing up just thinking about it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Man, you're gonna make me cry by saying that!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm not crying, you're crying!"
