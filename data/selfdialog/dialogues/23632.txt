"__DISNEY__ I think a new Wreck-it Ralph is coming out soon?"
"__DISNEY__ I heard."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder when though because I have been hearing this-"
"__DISNEY__ Since last year! I know!"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know how much longer I can wait."
"__DISNEY__ I think it is either coming out later this year or at the beginning of next."
"__DISNEY__ Cool, I can't wait to see Vanellope again."
"__DISNEY__ I know, any idea what it's about."
"__DISNEY__ No details yet from what I here."
"__DISNEY__ I think it will be awesome nonetheless."
