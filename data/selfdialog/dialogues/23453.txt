"__DISNEY__ I read that The Incredibles 2 is supposed to come out next year!"
"__DISNEY__ Really? How old do you think Dash and Violet will be in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably the same age, would be a big risk having them be older."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think Jack Jack will finally use his powers in front of his family?"
"__DISNEY__ I really hope so, especially after watching Jack Jack attack."
"__DISNEY__ Because I liked the first Incredibles so much I'm a bit scared to watch the second one."
"__DISNEY__ It could be like finding Dory; interesting but not nearly as good."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, hopefully nothing like Cars 2, which was terrible."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed, Cars 2 was nowhere near as good as Cars 1."
"__DISNEY__ I suppose we will have to wait and see how good the new movie is then."
