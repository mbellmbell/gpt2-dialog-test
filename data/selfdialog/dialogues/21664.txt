"__DISNEY__ I think my favorite Disney movie is Hercules."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm, mine is probably Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ Oh man, everyone loved that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the songs really get stuck in your head."
"__DISNEY__ My daughter couldn't stop singing 'The cold never bothered me anyway!'"
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha! I couldn't stop singing it either. It drove my husband crazy!"
"__DISNEY__ Hercules had some great music too! Remember when Megera sang, 'I won't say I'm in love!'?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh right! The muses were great in that film! I loved that they were all shapes and sizes."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! I swear, that song was my theme song. I never thought I'd get married!"
"__DISNEY__ And look at you now! A Disney-esque princess... turned Queen. Congratulations!"
