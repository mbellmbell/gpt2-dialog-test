"__SUPERHERO__ Did you ever see the movie version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I have not. I watched the TV show. Was it any good?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think its fair to say it wasn't very good."
"__SUPERHERO__ It probably wasn't Joss Whedon, then."
"__SUPERHERO__ Actually, it was. He changed a lot of stuff for the studio, they wanted it to be funny."
"__SUPERHERO__ So, is it set at the same time?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, it's set before buffy moves from LA. None of the TV cast are in it."
"__SUPERHERO__ What about Giles?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Not even Giles, she has a different Watcher."
"__SUPERHERO__ She's always been my favorite superhero, i'll have to watch it just for that reason!"
