"__MUSIC__ Which do you prefer, old Incubus or new Incubus."
"__MUSIC__ Old Incubus. Hands down."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I feel like after the Science album, they totally sold out!"
"__MUSIC__ I liked the Morning View album a lot, but yeah its totally different than Science."
"__MUSIC__ I just don't understand how you go from crazy funk to...whatever they are now."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Brandon had all the funk in his dreads, so when he cut them off, he cut out the funk."
"__MUSIC__ Pun intended?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe a little bit."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I understand wanting to make it as an artist, but I can't understand changing your whole musical style."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I kind of get it."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, let me ask you, do you like only one kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ You know I listen to everything."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I'm sure those guys do too. Maybe they just felt it was time for a change."
"__MUSIC__ A change is one thing, this is an entire turn around!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you're not wrong, but I think as long as they're still making music and getting it out there, you have to at least respect them."
"__MUSIC__ I guess so."
"__MUSIC__ I'd give at least Morning View another chance, I think you could really like it."
"__MUSIC__ You think so?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I do, just take the time to listen to not just how the songs are played, but the meaning behind the lyrics."
