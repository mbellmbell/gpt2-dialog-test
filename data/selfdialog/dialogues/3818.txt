"__MUSIC__ Are you going to Glastonbury this weekend?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I can't wait!"
"__MUSIC__ Which bands are you hoping to see?"
"__MUSIC__ The Foo Fighters of course, and Ed Sheeran, and I thought I might check out some of the bands playing the Other Stage."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, I think British Sea Power are playing on Saturday afternoon."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard their recent stuff, but I liked the old album The Decline of British Sea Power."
"__MUSIC__ And it's a funny album name! I think they are playing quite early so it could be quite chilled out."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know what stage BadBadNotGood are playing?"
"__MUSIC__ In my programme it says they are at the West Holts Stage. I am going to need to check the site map!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, they are playing on Saturday afternoon. Didn't they win the RAdio 6 album of the year last year?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, and the Avalanches are on the same stage a bit later. That might be worth checking out."
"__MUSIC__ There are so many good bands, it is hard to choose which ones to see."
"__MUSIC__ I quite like to see one or two bands I have never heard of to see if they are any good."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but there are so many I want to see that I can't fit it all in."
"__MUSIC__ I found an app to help work out what to see and when with maps of the site"
"__MUSIC__ That sounds brilliant. Does it give recommendations too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it suggests bands you might like based on ones you have selected."
"__MUSIC__ Can you send me a link?"
"__MUSIC__ No problem. Let's try and meet up at one of the stages on Saturday."
"__MUSIC__ Great plan. I'll send you my programme so you can see where I am planning to be."
