"__DISNEY__ Did you see that the Moana movie is now on Netflix?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, my daughters watched it the other night."
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad because my daughter requested it for her birthday and now I don't have to buy it."
"__DISNEY__ Those Disney movies are so expensive but I worry that they won't be on Netflix forever. What are you getting her instead?"
"__DISNEY__ She also requested Moana's necklace, the one with the heart of Tafiti. It lights up. I grabbed the last one at Wal-Mart."
"__DISNEY__ You know what else you should get her? The Moana soundtrack. The music in that movie is so catchy."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good idea. We're also getting her her first tablet so I could buy the soundtrack online and put it on there for her."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, she'll love it. That song with the hermit crab who likes shiny things was my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I loved that guy too! Make sure to watch after the credits of Moana because he has an extra little scene where he talks about Sebastian from the Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I didn't know that! I will have to tell my girls."
