"__SUPERHERO__ Aren't you about sick of superhero movies by now?"
"__SUPERHERO__ A little bit.  I never saw Dr. Stranger."
"__SUPERHERO__ It was okay, but I'm losing track of all these Marvel movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think Black Panther is coming out soon."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why am I not surprised.  Are they even trying at this point?"
"__SUPERHERO__ That could be an interesting one since he's from Africa."
"__SUPERHERO__ Look, I'll see it, just getting a bit repetitious."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, but when they make hundreds of millions of dollars, who's going to stop them?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I know, I know.  Just hope they start making better quality and not quantity."
"__SUPERHERO__ Me too.  Maybe this will turn the tide."
