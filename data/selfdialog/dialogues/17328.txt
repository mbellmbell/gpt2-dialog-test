"__MOVIES__ Do you like the Coen brothers films?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. No Country For Old Men is my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Mine too. I didn't appreciate it the first time I saw it, but 10 years later it's one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ It's very different than other action/suspense movies but it leaves a lasting impression on you."
"__MOVIES__ There are so many things to appreciate rather than just the story: the cinematography, the acting, the characters."
"__MOVIES__ The villain in that movie is one of the most menacing people in a movie I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ It's a perfect Coen brothers movie. The ending is ambiguous and the movie isn't for everyone, but if you like it, you love it."
"__MOVIES__ That's a perfect way to put it. The good guy doesn't always win, or maybe never wins in a Coen flick."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like Fargo?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's one of my favorites as well. It's probably their second best movie."
"__MOVIES__ Again, it's another one of their movies that doesn't have a happy ending, or maybe even a satisfying ending."
"__MOVIES__ It's morally corrupt characters who can't seem to catch a break, and it's difficult to watch them constantly mess up."
"__MOVIES__ I love the settings in their movies. In Fargo, the town and landscape is equally as big of a character."
"__MOVIES__ Same thing for No Country For Old Men. It's like the old west in Texas."
"__MOVIES__ I also love the setting in terms of the date in No Country. It feels so authentic to 1980."
"__MOVIES__ I've watched that movie over 15 times. There's not a single mistake or imperfection in the film."
"__MOVIES__ I only use they wouldn't have killed off Moss so quickly."
"__MOVIES__ There was still 30 minutes in the film by the time he was killed."
"__MOVIES__ If they could make the movie more perfect, it would be to extend the total time of the film 30 more minutes and follow Moss around more."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The most suspenseful part was following Moss around while he's being chased throughout Texas."
