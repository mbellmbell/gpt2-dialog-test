"__MUSIC__ So have your kids finally gotten that 'Frozen' song out of their heads."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, finally, but now they're singing that one from 'Moana.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it can be a bit much."
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha ha, which song."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ What are you going to make me guess?"
"__MUSIC__ Now, I've got the lyrics stuck in my head."
"__MUSIC__ You're welcome."
"__MUSIC__ NOT FUNNY!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you're laughing on the inside, and you know it."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever."
"__MUSIC__ Well, we could start singing that old favorite from Frozen."
"__MUSIC__ Don't you dare."
"__MUSIC__ You should learn to lighten up."
"__MUSIC__ You are despicable."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you should just let it go."
"__MUSIC__ I hate you."
"__MUSIC__ No, you don't."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever."
