"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's that time, NFL season is closing in. Who in your eyes will be the team to beat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well not much of a shocker here but I see that the Patriots will be that team you want to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did go 17-2 last season and gathered up their fifth Lombardi trophy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Indeed, and with the additions of a few players they look even better on paper for this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Better than a 17-2 winning season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I am not saying it will be a better record but it is going to be just as good maybe a game better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see another team being right there and that is Okland. Snapping their 13-year playoff drought, might have ignited the fire in this franchise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, with a playmaker like Marshawn Lynch and Amari Cooper, not to mention a 100% Derek Carr....this could be their year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin, their edge rush defense is going to be one to watch out for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, Raiders are as talented as any team out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about those Green Bay Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With a man like Aaron Rodgers, having an NFL history with career passing efficiency rating over 100! I don't see much trouble for them to grab another NFC North title this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a weapon within itself but lets not forget he has a new weapon in tight end Martellus Bennett! Mix him in with Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, NFC North is pretty much booked unless a team can step up to the challenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So with those teams in the spotlight who do you think will turn out on top?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Each team will win 13 games, that I can say."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You did not answer the question as to which team do you believe will do it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will have to say that the Atlanta Falcons will do it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait wait! We did not bring the Falcons into the mix."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that I must explain another time."
