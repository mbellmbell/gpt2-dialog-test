"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest X-Men movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one called Apocalypse?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is."
"__MOVIES__ I did. I rented it on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it in the theater when it came out."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't been to the theater in a long time. It's become an unpleasant experience."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ There are always people talking, or they forget to shut off their phones."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that is a problem."
"__MOVIES__ The food is overpriced, and they don't let you bring in outside food or drink."
"__MOVIES__ When I was a kid, my parents used to sneak in soda in their jackets."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot to do that last time. How did you enjoy Apocalypse?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was rather average."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I recently had seen Civil War, and that was so good I think it spoiled me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Civil War was great. Apocalypse just didn't hold up."
"__MOVIES__ I think Sony made a mistake releasing it so soon after Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, no one beats Marvel at their own genre."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad they're working with Marvel on the new Spider-man."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
