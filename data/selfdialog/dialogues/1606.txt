"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Swing music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really. Do you have any suggestions?"

"__MUSIC__ Big Bad Voodoo Daddy? That sounds fun"
"__MUSIC__ They are! They have a cover for the Jungle Book song 'Wanna Be Like You'"
"__MUSIC__ Great, I'll have to check them out."

"__MUSIC__ Jump Jive n' Wail? I think it was in a Gap commercial then"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's it. I liked that one. What about Benny Goodman you mentioned earlier?"
"__MUSIC__ Benny Goodman was an original, but so great. I think his most popular song was 'Sing, Sing, Sing'"
"__MUSIC__ Hm, I don't think I know it."
"__MUSIC__ You would if you heard it, there are no lyrics, but it's a definite feel-good song.  It has to be one of my all-time favorite songs."
