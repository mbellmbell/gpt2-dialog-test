"__MUSIC__ What was the best concert you've ever been to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well that's hard to say, I went to a lot when I was growing up and a few really made an impression on me."
"__MUSIC__ Pick one of those then."
"__MUSIC__ Well a friend of mine as a kid was a big Prince fan, he had every record, was a member of the fan club and so on."
"__MUSIC__ Oh Prince! I loved him too as a kid!"
"__MUSIC__ So when my friend was 16 he found out that Prince was playing a gig in a city hundreds of miles away, so on the spur of the moment I said 'Let's go'."
"__MUSIC__ I bet it was expensive."
"__MUSIC__ I can't remember, probably. We took the overnight train and wandered around the city until it was time for the concert."
"__MUSIC__ So what was it like?"
"__MUSIC__ He was incredible! The stage show was so over the top with all these props, but when he started playing guitar the place went crazy!"
"__MUSIC__ What year was this?"
"__MUSIC__ Around 1988, just at the end of his 'purple patch' as it were."
"__MUSIC__ Ouch, what a terrible pun. So he played all the hits?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes as far as I can remember. I think it was nonstop for at least 2 hours, in fact we were starting to get worried that we'd miss our train back."
"__MUSIC__ So the stage show was what was so memorable?"
"__MUSIC__ No it was him. He took turns playing different instruments, singing, playing basketball, and was great at everything!"
"__MUSIC__ Basketball? But wasn't he tiny?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes he had a hoop set up on stage and would spin a ball on his finger then get it in the hoop every time."
"__MUSIC__ Now I wish I'd got a chance to see him live now. You weren't even a fan!"
"__MUSIC__ I was after that concert though, I went out and bought loads of his records."
