"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So let me ask you, which conference do you think is stronger: AFC or NFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFC. It has so many strong teams. Packers, Cowboys, Giants, Seahawks, Cardinals...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? ! I think it's the AFC. It has the Patriots and the Broncos!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, and those are two great teams compared to many great teams in the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ AFC has won the last three Super Bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but in the last four Super Bowls, AFC has only sent two different teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that is a fair point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And if you look at the last 10 Super Bowls, NFC has sent 8 different teams, AFC only 5 different teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both conferences are even on Super Bowl wins for those last 10 Super Bowls, though: 5 each."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. The top AFC teams - Patriots and Broncos - are super strong teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think makes them able to stay so strong over multiple years?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least in the case of the Patriots, they are a very steady team. Same coach, same QB, year in and year out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bill Belichick is a very smart coach, yeah. He knows how to manage a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's probably the greatest head coach in NFL history, to be honest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is really saying something when the NFL has had coaches like Lombardi, Landry, Walsh, Shula and Noll."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you add Belichick together with Tom Brady..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is without question the greatest quarterback of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. You add them together and you have a strong leadership for the team that other players can believe in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely seem to have a winning attitude around them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They believe they can win, they work hard towards doing so, and it pays off for them. Absolutely."
