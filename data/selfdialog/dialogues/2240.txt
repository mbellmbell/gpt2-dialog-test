"__MUSIC__ Hey, guess what?"
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ I have tickets to see Little Mix in concert!"
"__MUSIC__ Little Mix?"
"__MUSIC__ Excuse me? You haven't heard of Little Mix?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I can't say that I have."
"__MUSIC__ They are the best girl group in the world right now. Period."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I like Fifth Harmony."
"__MUSIC__ Fifth Harmony has nothing on Little Mix. Not choreography, not vocals, not talent."
"__MUSIC__ I think they're pretty good, and have some catchy songs."
"__MUSIC__ They can't even get along with one another, that one girl already left the band."
"__MUSIC__ They just made the band even tighter and better since she left."
"__MUSIC__ I have to introduce you to Little Mix. You won't ever look back."
"__MUSIC__ I'm always open to try new music, but I love Fifth Harmony."
"__MUSIC__ Just try their new single 'Power'."
"__MUSIC__ I'll try it later. I just wish you could see Fifth Harmony is doing great too."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I'm not doubting that. I'm sure they are. I just feel like Little Mix is better."
"__MUSIC__ They can both exist and be good. We shouldn't pit them against one another."
"__MUSIC__ You're right, I apologize."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, it's fine. I just would like to not pit women against each other is all."
