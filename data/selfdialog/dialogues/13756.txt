"__BASKETBALL__ Did you hear about the game between the Celtics and the Wizards?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It was a really close game!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, I really thought the Celtics were going to close out the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea me too, I didn't expect that."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Wizards are hard to beat at their home stadium."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you planning to watch the Spurs and Golden State Warriors game on Sunday?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, I think that'll be a really interesting game to watch."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, that'll be Golden State's toughest test to date in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hopefully Kawhi Leonard will be healthy for the game..."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea that'll give the Spurs a better chance to beat the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lemarcus Aldridge needs to play well in this series also."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, he is starting to pick up his productions in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, this may help them have a chance against the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Also, the Spurs need better bench productivity as Tony Parker is hurt."
"__BASKETBALL__ I concur. They need to rely on their back up point guards to play well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Patty Mills has to run the team effectively in Tony Parker's place."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think so too. Patty Mills needs to run the offense well and continue to shoot well."
"__BASKETBALL__ However, with that being said I still think Golden State will win easily."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea I think the series will not go past five games."
