"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, something is bothering me about Neville, maybe you can help."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sure, what's up?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, if Harry died or wasn't around, Neville would be the one to fight the Dark Lord, correct?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, it seems to be so in the books, yes."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, is Neville being weak in the first few books a sign that Voldemort chose incorrectly?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you mean chose?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, Voldemort chose Harry the moment he killed his parents and left him with a scar."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right, but that didn't really affect Neville did it?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It did actually. If that hadn't happened, if Harry didn't match the criteria, he would have chosen Neville."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, would Neville be as powerful as Harry if he'd been selected? I honestly have no idea"
