"__DISNEY__ Hi Sara, i saw you at the movie theater last night."
"__DISNEY__ Really? i was clueless, i didn't see you there."
"__DISNEY__ No problem, i was with Mark, which movie did you watch?"
"__DISNEY__ Cars 3, it was awesome!"
"__DISNEY__ Omg, i watched too!"
"__DISNEY__ I really wasn't expecting the end to be honest with you."
"__DISNEY__ I know right? It seems that this movie is more mature than the previous ones."
"__DISNEY__ I totally agree with you."
"__DISNEY__ McQueen will still be my favorite character!"
"__DISNEY__ Mine too, i hope there will be a 4th movie, i can't wait."
