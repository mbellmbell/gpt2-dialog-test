"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite artist currently alive?"
"__MUSIC__ I would pick rolling stones. I think they are classic yet still in style."
"__MUSIC__ They are more of a  band than a single artist but great band."
"__MUSIC__ They sure are great. I have been to 4 concerts including the sars feast in Canada."
"__MUSIC__ oh that is neat. How was that sars fest concert?"
"__MUSIC__ It was pretty packed, so many people came. A lot of artist performed as well, which was cool."
"__MUSIC__ It was because of what illness again?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember swine flu? Well Toronto had affected ,(I think) and so they had this charity concert."
"__MUSIC__ What other bands were there? Did you see them?"
"__MUSIC__ I was there for most of it . AC/DC, Justin Timberlake and Stones."
"__MUSIC__ How was justin seems a weird mix."
"__MUSIC__ At the time he was not as popular or respected yet, or at least by this crowd."
"__MUSIC__ what makes you think that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well he was actually somewhat booed. One guy threw something on stage at him."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That seems aggressive and awful."
"__MUSIC__ I felt badly for him. i liked his performance. But when most are there to see AC/DC  and the stones not always a justin friendly crowd."
"__MUSIC__ It just takes one bad apple to spoil it. Too bad."
"__MUSIC__ Keith Richards was on stage at the time and threatened the guy who threw the bottle."
"__MUSIC__ Really ? that is funny and cool. Got to love Keith."
"__MUSIC__ Ya, Keith yelled something and did the slow cut across the neck with his finger at the guy."
