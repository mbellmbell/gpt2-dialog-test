"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you plan on watching the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. I am really sad that the Oakland Raiders are moving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The San Francisco 49ers moved to Santa Clara. The Bay Area is losing its second team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So true. What a shame it is! I think the Broncos and Patriots will make it to next year's super bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm. I could definitely see that. The 2016 super bowl with the Broncos and Panthers was a very good watch. I thought the Panthers would win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was shocked, as well. I love watching football though it's such a good sport. Very technical!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, I have to agree with you. I hate when refs favor a team though. They need more honest referees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your all time favorite NFL player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely Joe Montana. He was the best football player of all team, even though Tom Brady beat some of his records."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I didn't know that. So Tom Brady is the best player in the NFL right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say so! Based on his age and stats he still has a few good years before retirement and has many super bowl rings already."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know that Tom Brady is married to Gisele Bundchen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The model? No I didnt! What a small world. Do you have a favorite football player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, Marshawn Lynch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is he your favorite player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because he is fast, funny and righteous. He is a good loser and an even better winner because he is a good person."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where do you usually buy your football tickets?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From tickethub.com you can pay using PayPal it's really easy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you send me the football 2017 page link?"
