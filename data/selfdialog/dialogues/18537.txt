"__MOVIES__ Power Rangers!"
"__MOVIES__ Umm... what?"
"__MOVIES__ Go go Power Rangers!"
"__MOVIES__ Ooohhhh you must have seen the new film. How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, surprisingly good. I was EXTREMELY skeptical when it was announced, being a hardcore fan since its release, but they actually captured the spirit perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ That's awesome. I'll have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You should. So what's up?"
"__MOVIES__ Not much just on my way to Guardians of the freaking Galaxy volume 2."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup. Been dying to see it but have been uber busy for weeks now. This is my first day to myself in forever."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely a great way to spend your day. You should make it a double feature if it's been that long."
"__MOVIES__ Y'know... I really should. Any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Tons. Beauty & The Beast was fantastic but your wife would kill you if you saw it without her... um... Wonder Woman. Definitely Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Really? But it's a DC movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I know... but they got it right this time."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously?"
"__MOVIES__ Completely. This is where they get their shit together and start catching up to Marvel in quality."
"__MOVIES__ Dang, that good eh?"
"__MOVIES__ The only thing better are the dc animated universe movies but unfortunately they don't get a theatrical release."
"__MOVIES__ It's a shame. Under the Red Hood and Teen Titans: The Judas Contract deserve a big screen treatment."
