"__MUSIC__ Do you remember 'Hit Me Baby One More Time'?"
"__MUSIC__ That song was my JAM! Oh, Britney."
"__MUSIC__ Right? I think 'Toxic' was my favorite, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Back in high school, whenever that song came on during dances everyone would race onto the dance floor."
"__MUSIC__ It was pretty fun. I kinda miss bubble gum pop."
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't that bad. It was offset so well by the super sad rock music that was coming out. Staind was my favorite..."
"__MUSIC__ Oh gees, Staind! I wonder what happened to that guy. I liked Blink 182. Their lyrics mocked Britney Spears' stuff at the time..."
"__MUSIC__ Like they should talk, though. I mean their stuff was sort of just as happy as Britney's."
"__MUSIC__ Except for that divorce song they did."
"__MUSIC__ What divorce song?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember? The one that was raising awareness for 'broken families'? Hold on I'm going to look it up. Oh! Stay Together For The Kids."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha. That's DEFINITELY a song about divorce, judging by the title. I think I remember it. I remember 'I Miss You.'"
"__MUSIC__ That was a sad song, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Remember that dramatic song with Lindsay Lohan and her family?"
"__MUSIC__ Rumors!?"
"__MUSIC__ No, no. Confessions of a Broken Heart."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I remember the music video for that one. She was like... huddling in a corner of her room because her dad was scary or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can't remember if it was about actual abuse or not."
"__MUSIC__ Grim. I did like Rumors, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Rumors was fun."
