"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen all of the X-Men movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I have! My favorite is Days of Future Past."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh I loved that one! Quicksilver made his appearance in that one and became my favorite character of the series."
"__SUPERHERO__ My favorite of the series is Jean Grey or Phoenix. She was really the most powerful of them all."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's true but she had trouble controlling her powers. If you could have one of their powers which would it be?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh definitely Professor X. I'd love to be able to see into anyone's mind."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'd have to say Mystique for me. I'd love to be able to sneak around and blend in as I pleased."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's true, that's a good choice. I think Jennifer Lawrence did an awesome job in that role."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. She and McAvoy had good chemistry."
"__SUPERHERO__ Right and she had good intentions in Days of Future Past but she just wasn't thinking clearly, and she didn't know what they knew about the future."
