"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why do you think the students started wearing more Muggle-like clothing in the Prisoner of Azkaban?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know it was a deliberate choice of the new director, and I think they wanted to make the characters more relatable."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They definitely succeeded in doing that! My favorite part of the movie is when Hermione punches Draco in the face."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love that part too. I have one huge question about the movie though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why do they use a Time Turner to fix small mistakes, such as making sure that Buckbeak the Hippogriff doesn't get executed, but don't do it to prevent something like Harry's parents getting killed?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really don't know. I've always kind of wondered that too. I think it might be because if they take too big of a risk with events, there's a bigger chance they'll get seen by themselves."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That does make sense. Plus, they probably wanted to make sure that the Prophecy involving the chosen one would still come true."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But couldn't Neville have been the chosen one, since he and Harry were born on the same day?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hmm, that's true. And Neville's parents didn't die, they just got tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange."
