"__MOVIES__ Who was the best Batman?"
"__MOVIES__ Christian Bale and it wasnt even close."
"__MOVIES__ I think Keaton killed the role as well."
"__MOVIES__ But you think it was better than Bale?"
"__MOVIES__ They match up evenly."
"__MOVIES__ No way, you could feel the passion with Bale."
"__MOVIES__ His voice was a little irritating in the film."
"__MOVIES__ Thats what made it so good."
"__MOVIES__ Bale also had a strong supporting cast in all his Batman films."
"__MOVIES__ Ok but I dont know if thats why he was good."
"__MOVIES__ So switching gears who was the worse."
"__MOVIES__ George Clooney I think."
"__MOVIES__ Val Kilmer was pretty terrible too."
"__MOVIES__ I think that era that made the Batmans look a bit cartoonish just ruined the franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I would agree that was a low point."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face?"
"__MOVIES__ I could barely tell it was him."
"__MOVIES__ How about Jim Carey?"
"__MOVIES__ He played a good Riddler"
