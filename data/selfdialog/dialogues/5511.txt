"__STAR_WARS__ I wa thinking about doing a Star Wars marathon this weekend."
"__STAR_WARS__ That sounds cool. What order?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I haven't decided yet. Release order or numerical order, what do you think?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm a traditionalist. I like to start with A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's how I usually do it, but I was thinking about starting with The Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have the original movies or the remastered ones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Both! I collect every DVD as soon as it comes out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. Plus I see them in theater as soon as they open."
"__STAR_WARS__ Same here. I only missed one of them, and that's because I was a baby."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lucky you."
