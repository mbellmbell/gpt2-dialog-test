"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see Identity with John Cusack?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh my goodness that was a wonderful movie. I never saw the twist coming."
"__THRILLER__ I don't think anyone did. They did such a great job of separating the characters."
"__THRILLER__ I love movies where the main character has a split personality and thinks he's interacting with separate others."
"__THRILLER__ Me too. John Cusack did a great job in 1408 also."
"__THRILLER__ Oh that's the movie based on the Stephen King book right?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes it is. I have to say he did a really wonderful job of displaying fear in that movie."
"__THRILLER__ That's one I haven't seen yet but I need to check it out."
"__THRILLER__ It'll have you on the edge of your seat, trust me."
