"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen any of the fast and the furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, I saw the first couple I think."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How did you like Tokyo Drift?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was not my favorite."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea. It felt a little out of place to me."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Same. Did you see all of them?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ All but the last one that just came out."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's cool. Does Tokyo Drift fit in the series better after you have seen most of the movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea it fit in better. It helps you understand the characters more."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh ok. I will have to watch them."
