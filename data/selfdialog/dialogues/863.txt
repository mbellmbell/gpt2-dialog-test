"__MUSIC__ I can't stop listening to Meatloaf lately."
"__MUSIC__ Like... the food?"
"__MUSIC__ No, Meatloaf, he is a singer from the 80's and 90's."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I have never heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ You should really listen to some of his stuff, if you like classic rock or songs that tell a story, you'd probably love him."
"__MUSIC__ Well that does sound good."
"__MUSIC__ It is, each song of his will take you on a journey for about 5 minutes or so."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you were not kidding about it telling a story, that is pretty long for a song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that is actually on the shorter side for some of his things."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow."
"__MUSIC__ Bonus points if you watch the videos for them. They generally add a lot to the experience."
"__MUSIC__ Music videos are a bit of a lost art form."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I'd definitely recommend checking out his works like 'Bat out of Hell' and 'I Would Do Anything For Love'"
"__MUSIC__ Will do."
"__MUSIC__ The song that really got me listening to him was Paradise by the Dashboard lights though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh? What is it about?"
"__MUSIC__ It is one of those stories of young love, and then turning into spiteful love at the end in a goofy turn. I love it."
"__MUSIC__ Hah... that sounds like a fun listen too."
"__MUSIC__ It is, Any of his albums are a good listen too."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I will check into him."
