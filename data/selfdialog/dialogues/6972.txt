"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like Anakin when he was an adult?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought he was sort of flat."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. They should not have cast the guy they did."
"__STAR_WARS__ He should have been less of a complainer."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes and they should not have had that love story."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. I also did not like making him a kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ They should have just left that story altogether."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that character only works as Darth Vader. Keep his history a mystery."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. It was a mistake to try to go through his journey."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. But, at least we can forget the prequels."
