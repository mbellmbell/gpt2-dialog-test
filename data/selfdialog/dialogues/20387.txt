"__MOVIES__ What is your all time favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's a hard one.  There are so many movies out there."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know.  I think mine might be 'Casablanca'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that is a good one, but I think my favorite is 'Moulin Rouge'"
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ I like it for a couple of reasons.  First the music."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the music is good, I like that they used modern music we listened to already."
"__MOVIES__ Right?  When I first saw it I found that quite jarring, but knowing the words and music makes the experience better for me."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not really distracted by something that I already know so it lets me concentrate on the storyline...and the dancing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Also, the dance sequences in Moulin Rouge are great, ESPECIALLY the 'Roxanne' number."
"__MOVIES__ That is a good routine."
"__MOVIES__ I have it on DVD, so you can see it from other angles, it is amazing."
"__MOVIES__ How did you like the dance sequence at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you mean the Bollywood number?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, when they were giving the performance."
"__MOVIES__ I like that a lot, it had a lot of nuances in it that you don't see in the theatre version.  If you watch their rehearsal you see more of it."
"__MOVIES__ Oooh, I think I am going to have to buy the DVD."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me, you won't regret it!"
