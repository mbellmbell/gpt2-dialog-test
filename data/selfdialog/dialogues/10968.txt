"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So it loks like the Bucs want Ali Marpet as the center lineman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not happy with that decision."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kevin Pamphile should be center lineman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look as his stats last season and in 2015, superior numbers each season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but Ali is looking really good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah in training camp. It will be different come pre-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will shine, give him a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that;s the problem too many seasons have elapsed to create a good team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It takes time to do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but with the Bucs they shave off people every season and it's like starting over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see what you mean, they cant gel as a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactally. Times up. lets win games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear ya but i think theres more to it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, these are sports experts and they know more about this than we do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but like with everything there is a bit of common sense with everything. Somethings they do make no sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I share your frustration. Hopefully this season will be different"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hoping so as well."
