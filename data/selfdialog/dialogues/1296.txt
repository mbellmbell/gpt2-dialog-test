"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the latest album from the band Phoenix?"
"__MUSIC__ No, actually, I've never heard of that band before."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? I think you'd like them."
"__MUSIC__ What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a rock band that's from France and their songs are somewhat poppy and unique."
"__MUSIC__ Oh so do they sing in French?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they sing in English mostly.  Every once in a while, they'll throw a French word into the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. Are they more well-known in France or in the U.S.?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure but in the U.S. they have a decent-sized following.  They have been on Saturday Night Live before as the musical guest."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I must have missed that episode."
"__MUSIC__ It aired a year or two ago, when they were supporting their last album."
"__MUSIC__ So which album of theirs should I listen to first?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a fan of the album they have called Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, but really all of their albums are good."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I'll try looking for that one first."
"__MUSIC__ Another neat fact about Phoenix is that the singer for the band is married to Sophia Coppola."
"__MUSIC__ The director?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. She's related to Francis Ford Coppola, who directed The Godfather."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's neat. Anyway, check out their music.  I think you'll get a kick out of it."
"__MUSIC__ Okay I will."
