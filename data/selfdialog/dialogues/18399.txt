"__MOVIES__ I wonder what ever happened to Don Bluth."
"__MOVIES__ Who?"
"__MOVIES__ Don Bluth, the guy responsible for movies like The Secret of NIMH and All Dogs Go to Heaven."
"__MOVIES__ Is that all?"
"__MOVIES__ He also did An American Tail, and The Land Before Time. He was big in the '80s."
"__MOVIES__ So what happened?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he was originally a Disney animator who didn't like the direction the company was taking, you see?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ So, he decided he'd make his own movies and bring back high-quality animation. He was so successful it kicked Disney back into gear, too."
"__MOVIES__ If he did all that, where did he go?"
"__MOVIES__ The '90s came and none of his films were classics. Then he killed traditional animation."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, what?"
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't just him, but him and Disney. They were in a competition to see who could get out their sci-fi animated film out first."
"__MOVIES__ What movies were those?"
"__MOVIES__ Don Bluth had Titan A.E. with Fox, and Disney had Treasure Planet. Neither film did well at all, and it killed traditional 2D animation."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's quite a legacy. Being the guy who sort of brought 2D films back only to kill them off a couple decades later."
"__MOVIES__ I think he's trying to get a Dragon's Lair film made now. He hasn't made a movie since Titan A.E. in 2001."
"__MOVIES__ He did the Dragon's Lair video game? Crazy."
"__MOVIES__ He also had another animated game that was similar called Space Ace. It wasn't as successful though."
"__MOVIES__ Even if he's not doing much now, seems like he did accomplish quite a lot once."
