"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think that The Last Jedi is going to repeat The Empire Strikes Back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure. What makes you think that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The trailer seems to share imagery with that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, did you mean the AT-AT battle portion?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. That's one part."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think that it is going to be the same."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite character out of all of the movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Emperor Palpatine is a great villain, but I'd have to go with Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed. However, I kind of hate what they did to him in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ What should they have done?"
