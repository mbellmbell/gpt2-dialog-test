"__LADY_GAGA__ Can you believe Gaga ever had a weight issue?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It is hard to believe she looks so petite."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It is weird to think of her as fat kid, but guess she was."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think it makes me like her more."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Why would that make you like her more?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think because she is really real. Very human to struggle with weight."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I do like that she is honest about it. Probably helps some girls out there knowing she went through issues too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly. I was a concert and she addressed this about herself and I thought that was very brave and helpful to many."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That is cool. She had so much impact on her fans nice she sends out positive helpful messages."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I respect her a lot for that and her talent of course."
