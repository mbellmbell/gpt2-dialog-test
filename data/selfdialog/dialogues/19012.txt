"__MOVIES__ Did you get around to seeing the Revenant?"
"__MOVIES__ I wanted to see it so badly! I haven't had the chance yet. Tell me more!"
"__MOVIES__ You know who directed it? Alejandro Iñárritu!"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't realize that! We talked all about him in my Mexican cinema class."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What did you see of his?"
"__MOVIES__ Amores Perros, of course! I've seen that movie four times now."
"__MOVIES__ It's an incredible film. I love how it keeps going back to one fateful encounter."
"__MOVIES__ The car crash? More than an encounter, I'd say. More like an accident."
"__MOVIES__ Obviously. Well, he did an amazing job of intersecting all those lives at that one point."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know he was a DJ before he was a director? That's why the music is so awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Now that I didn't know! It shows in the Revenant, too."
"__MOVIES__ What's the music like in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a lot of classic music, but it's all incredibly epic. Not your classical music at a picnic with your grandparents."
"__MOVIES__ Classical music doesn't need words to say what it wants to say."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. I've listened to this soundtrack alone, and just, wow. You relive every moment in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ And what did you think of Leonardo DiCaprio in the Revenant?"
"__MOVIES__ Nobody else could have played that role like him. Survival, frontiers, the wilderness. He embodies what his character faced."
"__MOVIES__ It looks like a very engrossing movie. Is it one you can't get out of your head?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, for sure. I haven't stopped thinking about it since the day I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Might not be 'Mexican Cinema' per say, but I think I'll understand even more about Iñarratu by watching the movie!"
