"__BASEBALL__ Hey man, why do you always root against the KC Royals."
"__BASEBALL__ It's only because I'm not a Royals fan. They aren't that good."
"__BASEBALL__ You know where you live right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes I know. But since I live here doesn't mean I have to like them."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure... Whatever. Who is your team then?"
"__BASEBALL__ I like the Detroit Tigers."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh really? They aren't that good either."
"__BASEBALL__ But in my case they are better than the Royals."
"__BASEBALL__ They play at Kaufman on the 29th of this month you down for going?"
"__BASEBALL__ Of course. And I will wear my gear."
"__BASEBALL__ I think Justin Verlander is pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ I sure hope so . He's playing really good now. And I hear that he always plays good against the Royals. Might be an easy win."
"__BASEBALL__ Not if Eric Homer is playing. He's a guaranteed all star this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Eric is good but he isn't a Miggy (Miguel Cabrera)"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm excited we will be able to talk trash as well as root for our teams."
"__BASEBALL__ I am too I haven't seen the Tigers play since I was a senior in high school."
"__BASEBALL__ Is Ian Kinsler back?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes I think he's back on the field and playing great."
"__BASEBALL__ Well this will be a good game. Let's go ahead and by the tickets soon."
"__BASEBALL__ Awesome I will look for some great deals."
