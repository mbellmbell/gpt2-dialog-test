"__DISNEY__ Do you know what new Disney movies are coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ Um, I can't remember. I remember Frozen was an OK one, but I was never a big fan of singing in movies."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm, that's probably why we haven't ever talked about Disney movies before."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, there's The Good Dinosaur! That one got good reviews. Is there singing, though?"
"__DISNEY__ If there's only one song, would you still see it? We could go see it this weekend!"
"__DISNEY__ I guess I could suffer through it, just because you're my friend!"
"__DISNEY__ What do you want to see if that one is sold out? My only rule is that it has to be a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ What about Zootopia? I'm up for animated animals in a big city any day!"
"__DISNEY__ I think that one is a couple of months old. What about Finding Dory?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I loved Finding Nemo, I think I'd love Finding Dory too!"
