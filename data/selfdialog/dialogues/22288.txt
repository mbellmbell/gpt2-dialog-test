"__DISNEY__ What do you think about the movie 'Pocahontas' from the 1990's?"
"__DISNEY__ I enjoyed it when it came out."
"__DISNEY__ I just saw it, and I was a little disappointed."
"__DISNEY__ Why, what was the disappointment for you?"
"__DISNEY__ Well I thought that it was disrespectful to Native Americans."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I didn't catch that when I was a child watching it."
"__DISNEY__ Plus it got a lot of the history and facts wrong from that colonization period."
"__DISNEY__ Well that's to be expected of a kid's movie."
"__DISNEY__ I guess you're right, because they don't want to be too gritty or realistic for the kid's sake."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, they need to keep a softer tone for the young ones until they can understand the complexities of history."
