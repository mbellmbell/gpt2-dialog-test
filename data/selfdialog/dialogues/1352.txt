"__MUSIC__ Hey what kind of music are you listening to these days?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I just discovered this artist, he's been around since like 2009 but his name is Watsky."
"__MUSIC__ Watsky, that name sounds familiar. Oh, he was on the Hamilton Mixtape!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he did that song 'An Open Letter,' that's actually how I discovered him."
"__MUSIC__ Okay cool, how many albums does he have?"
"__MUSIC__ I think like four studio albums and a couple of mixtapes on the website Bandcamp."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so he's more underground?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean I guess so, I haven't really heard much of him until now. But his rhymes are so sick!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, what's your favorite song of his I should give a listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow this is a hard one. Okay a really touching song is 'Tears to Diamonds.'"
"__MUSIC__ Interesting title."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it's actually pretty deep, all about Big Pharma."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of like that Macklemore song, Drug Dealer? His drug dealer is a doctor."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it's the same concept! Watsky has to take medication for his epilepsy, so he gets it."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, he sounds like a really interesting guy!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, another song kind of like that is Chemical Angel."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so he always makes really serious music!"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all! He is such a comedian, he's got these really funny songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah check out Going Down and the Legend of Hardhead Ned for some laughs."
