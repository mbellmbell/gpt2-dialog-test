"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen the latest Fast and the Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Which one is that? Fast 10?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No it's The Fate of the Furious!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So, Fast 8? Which one is the one that Paul Walker was in?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was Furious 7, this one's the 8th one or something like that since they're numbered weird."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How did they handle the lack of Paul Walker?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They just mentioned Brian and Mia but that they're retired and not apart of the team anymore."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh that's nice, and I guess a respectful way to deal with him being gone instead of dying like other characters."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah! Its a different tone I think, but not that bad."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Okay, I'll watch it!"
