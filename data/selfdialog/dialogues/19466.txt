"__MOVIES__ Did you get to see La La Land yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No but I am wanting to, did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, we should find out where it is playing and go see it this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'm in. I think Ryan Gosling has this thing about him. I can't put my finger on it."
"__MOVIES__ I know, if you saw him on the street you probably would not look twice at him but at the end of a movie he seems so handsome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I felt the same way about Barbra Streisand, She was not attractive at the beginning of a movie but beautiful by the end."
"__MOVIES__ I like Emma Stone, she has sort of the same thing about her."
"__MOVIES__ Her sense of humor seems to come through no matter what role she is playing."
"__MOVIES__ She has that cute factor."
"__MOVIES__ She got an Academy Award for her role in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ It got a lot of awards didn't it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, best motion picture, best director, best screenplay and more. I can't remember all of the awards it got."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess that makes it a must see movie for the weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it  to me."
"__MOVIES__ Do you want to take the husbands?"
"__MOVIES__ It may be a chick flick. Does your husband like chick flicks?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really if someone isn't getting shot or ran over he gets pretty bored."
"__MOVIES__ Mine likes cartoons. I swear all we watch at home together is cartoons."
"__MOVIES__ Thank goodness, these days most people have a television in every room."
"__MOVIES__ Your right about that, I just go to the bedroom and watch what I want to watch."
