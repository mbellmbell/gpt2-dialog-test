"__DISNEY__ What's the first Disney movie you ever saw?"
"__DISNEY__ Whoa, that's a hard question! Do you remember what you first saw?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know if it's technically the first movie I saw, but the first one I remember seeing is Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that movie is so sad!"
"__DISNEY__ I know, especially for a little kid, right!?"
"__DISNEY__ It's been awhile since I've seen that movie, but I still remember the line 'If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all', or something like that."
"__DISNEY__ Thumper, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yup, I think it's what his mom taught him."
"__DISNEY__ A lot of DIsney movies involve talking animals, don't they?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think a lot of them do."
