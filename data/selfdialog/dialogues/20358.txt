"__MOVIES__ Do you like romantic comedies?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! In fact I just watched There's Something About Mary with my girl the other day."
"__MOVIES__ That's a classic! Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz are amazing in it."
"__MOVIES__ And Matt Dillon. Have you seen him in Drugstore Cowboy?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what's that about?"
"__MOVIES__ He and his crew of addicts rob pharmacies and stuff to get prescription drugs."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting. Have you seen any other movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Hm, as far as rom-coms go, not really. I saw Rough Night, though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the one with Scarlett Johansson?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was entertaining. Not the best. Scarlett's been in better movies, like her Woody Allen movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I really liked Match Point. She was really good in that."
"__MOVIES__ It was kind of like Crimes and Misdemeanors, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, totally. I'm surprised there wasn't more buzz about it, it was really well done."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Scoop?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was ok. I like how he weaved the magician part into it."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Vicky Cristina Barcelona. I wish I could have been in that one!"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see it. Have you seen Scarlett's earlier movies, like Ghost World?"
"__MOVIES__ That is one of my favorites. I felt so terrible for Steve Buscemi in that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he gets used by Enid. I wish Scarlett had had a bigger role in it."
"__MOVIES__ She was just starting out then. I want to see Lucy now because we've been talking about her movies."
