"__SUPERHERO__ Who is your favorite Spider-Man actor?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Definitely NOT Tobey. I think they keep getting better."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why not? He's fine."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, fine, and the original, but not spectacular. Plus, he was emo for a movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ At least he played the character well."
"__SUPERHERO__ True. My favorite would probably be Andrew Garfield. He's fantastic in everything."
"__SUPERHERO__ What about the new guy?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't know anything about him, really--he was just briefly in Civil War."
"__SUPERHERO__ Trust me, he's a great actor and perfect for the part."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'll have to take your word for it."
