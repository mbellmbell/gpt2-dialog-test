"__FASHION__ Those sunglasses the rapper Pitbull made famous are still popular. It's amazing."
"__FASHION__ It sure is, I see them everywhere I go. But I saw them on Amber Heard first."
"__FASHION__ Did you really? Everybody calls them 'Pitbulls.'"
"__FASHION__ I  know that. That's because he wore them first?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, and at one time he endorsed them."
"__FASHION__ You mean he doesn't any more?"
"__FASHION__ No, he definitely doesn't. He's fighting with the company that produces them."
"__FASHION__ So he's wearing some other kind?"
"__FASHION__ I guess so."
"__FASHION__ I wonder if people will wear the ones he used to wear because of the publicity, or his new pick."
"__FASHION__ Because of that publicity, you mean."
"__FASHION__ Well, people always want to wear the newest thing."
"__FASHION__ That's true. The latest style is what they want."
"__FASHION__ So you're supposed to constantly update your look."
"__FASHION__ Sure. To show that you know what's going on in the world."
"__FASHION__ Well, I guess I don't. I wouldn't even recognize Pitbull."
"__FASHION__ But you'd recognize his sunglasses."
"__FASHION__ Yep. And I'd wear them, too."
"__FASHION__ Well, that's fashion."
"__FASHION__ Yes it is."
