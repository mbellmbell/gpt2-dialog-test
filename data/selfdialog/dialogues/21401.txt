"__THRILLER__ What do you think of that one new movie about a guy with split personalities?"
"__THRILLER__ You mean the movie Split by M. Night Shyamalan?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah that movie was pretty freaky in some ways. I found the Beast and Hedwig personality to be the most creepiest."
"__THRILLER__ No kidding. James McAvoy's portrayal of that character and all the personalities was pretty amazing."
"__THRILLER__ What did you think of the twist at the end?"
"__THRILLER__ I was a bit surprised since I didn't realize it was in the same universe as unbreakable. I would definitely like to see another sequel where David Dunn goes after The Horde."
"__THRILLER__ Do you think Casey told the cop lady at the end of the movie about what her uncle did when they found her from The Horde?"
"__THRILLER__ I think so because she gave them this look as if she was going to."
"__THRILLER__ If they do make a sequel to this movie about The Horde played by James McAvoy, would you see it?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah I definitely would since it did keep me in suspense a lot with this one."
