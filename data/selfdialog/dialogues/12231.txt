"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you guys going to do a Fantasy Football draft again this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We do. Why? Do you want in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was considering asking if there might be a slot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I can make one this year. Are you sure?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I'm even willing to do research for draft picks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. I've been looking at some of what's out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you thinking so far?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't tell you everything! I've gotta keep some stuff close to the vest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least give me something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I know that the way NFL points work, you never draft a kicker first."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a no brainer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. So I guess I might still be at the starting line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, you're picking NFL players. Who do you think will do well?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe Antonio Brown?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a pretty reasonable pick. People would say that's a smart choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and I'm a big Steelers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again with the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't help it! I like them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, good for you!"
