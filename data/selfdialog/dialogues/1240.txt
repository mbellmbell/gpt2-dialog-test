"__MUSIC__ I was thinking today about some obscure songs and artists from the 1990s that I haven't heard in years."
"__MUSIC__ What songs and artists were you thinking about."
"__MUSIC__ Nobody in particular. Just some bands like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sponge."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Wow, I forgot all about them."
"__MUSIC__ They were a good band. They had a unique sound."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely were a good band. They kind of had a 1940's sounding style combined with a punk rock vibe."
"__MUSIC__ That's one way to describe them."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely liked the song Rascal King. That song brings back some good memories of the 90's."
"__MUSIC__ That song was good. Thinking about other bands, do you remember Sponge?"
"__MUSIC__ I vaguely remember Sponge. I remember the Song Plowed."
"__MUSIC__ That was definitely the song that came to mind when I was thinking about them today."
"__MUSIC__ What are some other bands or songs you were thinking about?"
"__MUSIC__ Temple of the Dog, and The Cranberries."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the Cranberries. I loved them during High School. They were really unique. I also loved Temple of the Dog."
"__MUSIC__ I think I was thinking about Temple of the Dog because of the news of Chris Cornell's recent passing."
"__MUSIC__ Probably. He was only in his early 50's. So many artists succomb to either depression or drugs and go away so early."
"__MUSIC__ He seemed to be a little depressed in some of his music writing, especially on his stint with Temple of the Dog."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely in the Song Say Hello to Heaven."
"__MUSIC__ That song was really depressing but had a lot of soul. Sometimes artists seem to speak through their music about how they are feeling."
"__MUSIC__ I believe so. But I think he was writing that song as a tribute to another artist who passed away at an early age. Either way, you are right."
