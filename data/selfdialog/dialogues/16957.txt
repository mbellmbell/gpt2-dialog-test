"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Diary of Anne Frank?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it depends on which one."
"__MOVIES__ The one from 1959"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen it but I read part of the book."
"__MOVIES__ You would probably like it. Do you like historical movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but not always the sad ones."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. What is your favorite genre then?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, like the 'Saw' series?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, those are just about gore."
"__MOVIES__ True, what do you look for in a good horror movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I like have a villain that is relatable, it makes me think anyone can be the killer."
"__MOVIES__ That makes it even scarier!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I also like to stay away from aliens or fantasy stuff too."
"__MOVIES__ So it makes the movie more relatable?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! It keeps me on edge even after the movie is over"
"__MOVIES__ So what's a good example of a movie like that?"
"__MOVIES__ I like The Strangers and Hush"
"__MOVIES__ Both movies that happened in cabins right?"
"__MOVIES__ Both happened in the woods, but they both had normal people attacking at night. So scary!"
