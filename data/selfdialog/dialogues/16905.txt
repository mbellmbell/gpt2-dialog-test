"__MOVIES__ That new Predator movie looks interesting."
"__MOVIES__ What's the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ Some military guy is trying to convince his friends that the creature exists."
"__MOVIES__ More marines, huh? Is Schwarzenegger in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. I don't think he has a major role."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it can't be any worse than that last one."
"__MOVIES__ I liked Predators. It was good."
"__MOVIES__ Not as good as the first two."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the second movie the best."
"__MOVIES__ I wish Hollywood would follow up on that ending."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ You saw the samurai sword and the gun from the old west in the alien ship?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, so?"
"__MOVIES__ The Predator likes to hunt where there's conflict doesn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ That's what I heard."
"__MOVIES__ So, why can't they do a movie set in the Feudal period? Or the old west?"
"__MOVIES__ That would be different."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I mean, the set up was there."
"__MOVIES__ I would love to see a Predator dual a Samurai. That would be cool."
"__MOVIES__ It would be alot better than that joust in Predators, that's for sure."
