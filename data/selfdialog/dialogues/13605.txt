"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, are you ready for the NFL season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course! I can't wait!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Saints fan, how about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh oh! I'm a Falcons fan, haha. Sorry about the beatdown we put on you guys last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! Good one! We'll se if that happens again now that we have Adrian Peterson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, AP is pretty good. At least he used to be before that ACL injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he recovered quite well from that injury, actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, in any case, I wish him the best for you guys next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks man! Hey, can I ask you a question?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, what's up buddy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How in the world did your Falcons blow a 25 point lead in the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We don't like to talk about that anymore haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see why. I guess Tom Brady and the Patriots were just too great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really were! The Patriots have been so good for so long, we knew it would be hard keeping them down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's for sure. I really enjoyed that Super Bowl though, both teams played well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I was really enjoying the game right until the 4th quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahaha, maybe you'll get them next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah hopefully, as long as we have NFL MVP Matt Ryan on our team, you can't count us out!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but you're going to have to beat my Saints first!"
