"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Lions will do this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they might make the playoffs but only if the key players stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a big if - they already lost their best offensive lineman in practice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're talking about the left tackle, right?  He'll be back at some point and I think they got someone decent to fill in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure about that.  Left tackle is a key position because it protects the quarterback's blind side."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true enough.  And Matthew Stafford has taken his share of hits over the years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of Stafford, with Calvin Johnson retired he really needs to spread the ball around more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The big missing element is a consistent running game to compliment that passing game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year their best running back missed most of the season and the running game was mediocre at best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree.  And the problem with that is that other teams can focus on stopping that passing game rather than worry about both."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Abudullah is their best runner and he's coming back this season and looking good so far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Trouble is that he's prone to injury although when he's healthy he is a real threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the other side of the ball - how's is the defense looking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to develop a consistent pass rush to be effective."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  Their defensive ends were missing in action last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't know what happened with Ziggy Ansah but he was a disappointment last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The secondary has improved over the last couple years but never can get the job done against the best quarterbacks like Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why the pass rush is so important because it helps the defensive backs when the quarterback is under pressure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if they can pull all the elements together they have a good shot at the playoffs with the schedule they have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And once you're in the playoffs you're only a few wins away from the Super Bowl, which would be a first for the Lions."
