"__MOVIES__ How come we never go to the movies anymore?"
"__MOVIES__ You keep saying it's a hassle."
"__MOVIES__ Well I want to go now."
"__MOVIES__ Fine, what did you have in mind."
"__MOVIES__ One word: Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ Done. I heard it's going to be amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I heard the same, but what else can you expect from Ryan Reynolds?"
"__MOVIES__ He does have a great track record. I know it wasn't anyone's favorite, but I liked Green Lantern."
"__MOVIES__ So did I, I never understood why so man people had a problem with that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Fan-nerds, that was the problem. They nit picked it into oblivion."
"__MOVIES__ Well I don't care what anyone will have to say about Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ You shouldn't, I heard he breaks the fourth wall basically the whole movie."
"__MOVIES__ I did too, I was told it's not a hero movie for those that want a typical hero."
"__MOVIES__ Deadpool has never been a typical hero, he's Wolverine with not reservations."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad they aren't using the X-men Origin's Deadpool for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was just creepy."
"__MOVIES__ As long as he has his kitanas I'll be fine."
"__MOVIES__ That's the same thing you said about Ninja Assassins."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it is, so what? That movie was awesome too."
"__MOVIES__ I never said it wasn't, but I expect Deadpool to be heavily armed with something a little bigger than some swords."
