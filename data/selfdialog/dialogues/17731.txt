"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the Rocky movies?"

"__MOVIES__ I will say though that the first Rocky, really led the way for them all."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that was a classic."
"__MOVIES__ Introducing each character like Pauly, Mickey and Adreinne."

"__MOVIES__ Yes and his wife really changed."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I thought she was pretty, even in the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, Appollo Creed was good too."
