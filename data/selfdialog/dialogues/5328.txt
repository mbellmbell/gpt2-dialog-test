"__STAR_WARS__ Do you believe that Han Solo shot first?"
"__STAR_WARS__ When I saw A New Hope before it's remaster, I think I remember that Greedo shot first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, I can't believe they edited it like that!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I think it's a dishonor to Han Solo's character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think Han Solo would of killed someone first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, in my opinion it was self-defense."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am just glad that Han Solo didn't get hit with the bullet lazer."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, otherwise the movies would of turned out differently."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't even imagine Star Wars without Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me either!"
