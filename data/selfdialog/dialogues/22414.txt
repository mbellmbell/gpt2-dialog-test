"__DISNEY__ What did you think of Moana?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was well put together, if not a little cliche'."
"__DISNEY__ I liked Maui because at first he's like, I'm the greatest, thank you very much, but then changes so that he's helping of Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, me too, even though he left her, he came back when she really needed him."
"__DISNEY__ I was sad when Moana's grandma died."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Moana was better for having known her and believed what her grandma taught her."
"__DISNEY__ Moana's dad was a big jerk at the beginning of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ But, he was afraid that Moana would get hurt; he was just protecting his child."
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad Moana followed her heart, though, because her people were better off because of it."
"__DISNEY__ Even if we're afraid to strike out and do what we were made to do, when we do it, everybody is better for it.  Wait, was that the moral of the story?"
