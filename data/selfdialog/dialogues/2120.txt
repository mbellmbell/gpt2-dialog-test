"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Richard Cheese?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ He is this parody singer."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of like Weird Al?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, kind of, but not really."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what's the difference?"
"__MUSIC__ Weird Al keeps the melody and kind of changes the words."
"__MUSIC__ And this Richard guy does the opposite?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much.  He keeps the lyrics and turns the song into lounge music."
"__MUSIC__ Lounge music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it sounds like something people would have listened to in a casino decades ago."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that sounds so cheesy.  Actually like it would be funny, though."
"__MUSIC__ It is cheesy.  That's probably why he used Cheese as his name."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I forgot you said that!  So, it's like pianos and trumpets?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, stuff like that.  And the songs are everything from Michael Jackson to Rage Against the Machine."
"__MUSIC__ Oh gosh.  Rage Against the Machine with pianos and trumpets?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and it's hilarious."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a copy of this?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually have some of his music on my phone."
"__MUSIC__ You'll have to let me hear this!"
