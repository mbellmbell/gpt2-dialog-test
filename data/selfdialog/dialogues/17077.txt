"__MOVIES__ Are there any movies that you loved as a child which you still enjoy as an adult?"
"__MOVIES__ Quite a few, yes. I can happily watch The Princess Bride every couple of years."
"__MOVIES__ I love that one! It had an amazing cast."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed. It featured real actors like Mandy Patinkin, not just comedians."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Billy Crystal?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Also Andre the Giant and Fred Savage when he was a little boy."
"__MOVIES__ I remember my parents shouting out quotes from The Princess Bride."
"__MOVIES__ I still do that! 'Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's right! And the prince had a catch phrase."
"__MOVIES__ 'As you wish.'  He was always saying it to Princess Buttercup."
"__MOVIES__ Buttercup, ha ha! That name would never work in any film nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ No, but it was the 80s. That decade was corny beyond belief."
"__MOVIES__ My favourite was The Neverending Story."
"__MOVIES__ With Atreyu and the luck dragon?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. He was called Falcor."
"__MOVIES__ I always thought he looked like a giant guinea pig."
"__MOVIES__ Now that you mention it, yes he did. Ah well, the budget was very low."
"__MOVIES__ The producers made sequels of Neverending Story."
"__MOVIES__ They were terrible! Such a waste."
"__MOVIES__ I'm pleased that The Princess Bride was never ruined with a sequel."
