"__SUPERHERO__ Did you like Catwoman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, not at all."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why not I kind of liked it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well I thought they did a bad job at bringing the character to the big screen."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well they made her out to be this overly sexy character which isn't the worst thing but her character just wasn't like how she was in the comics."
"__SUPERHERO__ I never read comics as a kid so I wouldn't know."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well just my opinion on it though."
"__SUPERHERO__ I keep hearing it sucked but I think it was good I liked the movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ Glad someone did."
