"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a huge Atlanta Falcons fan.  Do you follow the Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the past I have not, but last year they grabbed my attention."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  They had a great year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe they blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl. Very frustrating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  Of course, my Atlanta Falcons help Tom Brady continue to build his legacy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's so frustrating.  As if Tom Brady doesn't get enough love as it is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Tom Brady will be known as the best ever for sure now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, at least Matt Ryan had is first MVP season. He was fun to watch last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Matt Ryan to Julio Jones connection was on fire last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unfortunately, the Falcons lost their offensive coordinator after the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kyle Shanahan will definitely be hard to replace.  He did a very good job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he did.  Who did the Falcons hire to replace Shanahan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They hired Steve Sarkisan.  He used to be the head coach at USC and he was the offensive coordinator there before that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok.  Who do you think the biggest competition for the Falcons will be in the NFC this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  I know the Cowboys and Seahawks should be good again.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Panthers rebounded from last years poor season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I was thinking the same thing.  I think the Panthers are a real threat in the NFC South."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the AFC?  Who are the contenders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, the Patriots will be right there.  I'm curious to see if the Oakland Raiders can have another good season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really. That should be interesting.  I hope to see Derek Carr have another good season and stay healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  He will need to stay healthy to earn that big, new contract."
