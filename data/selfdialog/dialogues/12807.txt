"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you like watching football more at the stadium or at home?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I like watching it more at home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because I like watching more than one game at a time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If a game is bad or boring, I can watch a different one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that's a good reason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can also eat whatever I want, and drink whatever I want."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those $7 beers do get kind of old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can invite whoever I want over to watch it with me, and we don't have to pay a ridiculous amount to get in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are all good points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, why were you asking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had an extra ticket for the Cowboys game, I thought maybe you would be interested."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am interested!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought you said you prefer to watch it at home?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, unless I can go to a game with my best friend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, good save."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What time should I be ready?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How's around 10 sound?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ sounds perfect!"
