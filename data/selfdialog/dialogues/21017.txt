"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see American Psycho with Christian Bale?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes that's one of my favorite movies. He definitely was psycho in that movie."
"__THRILLER__ I definitely liked him better in that than I did The Dark Knight."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah that's for sure. I love that he would play Phil Collins whenever he got ready to kill."
"__THRILLER__ I know right! I wonder how Phil Collins felt about that."
"__THRILLER__ I'm sure he didn't feel too bad. He got paid royalties off of it."
"__THRILLER__ Oh of course how could I forget that. I'm sure he was fine with it."
"__THRILLER__ Did you think he was ever going to have a change of heart while you were watching it?"
"__THRILLER__ At one point I did, when he was confessing."
"__THRILLER__ Turns out he was just having a meltdown but he went right back to his old self."
