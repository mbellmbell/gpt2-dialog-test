"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hey, did you hear that there is a Harry Potter marathon this weekend?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No! When? What channel?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ ABC network! I think it's called Freeform now, but it comes on friday through Saturday Starting with Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Awesome! It's been so long since I watched them all back to back, but I'm not sure if I am ready to see Snape die agai."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Good point. He was such a deep character with so many angles. Remember when he smacked Harry and Ron on their heads during Potions Exams?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, so funny! My favorite line of his was always 'Turn to page 394'."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is an iconic quote. Much like Hermoine's 'It's leviOsa, not leviosar'."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, Hermoine, she's another great character with a lot of depth and character. I'll never forget when she punched Draco!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that punch was what made Ron truly fall in love with Hermoine."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think you're right. Man, it took him forever to finally realize that he loved her."
