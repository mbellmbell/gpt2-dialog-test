"__MUSIC__ You do? What kind?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a little girl. She's a teacup poodle!"
"__MUSIC__ Is that really a dog or is it a mouse?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course she's a dog!  She's so cute, and she reminds me of Taylor Swift!"
"__MUSIC__ The singer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!"
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ She sings so well, and she looks good in a collar! I'm gonna name her Taylor."
"__MUSIC__ Taylor....Ok.  I'vre heard worse names for a puppy."
"__MUSIC__ My cute little Taylor!  The cutest puppy in the world!"
"__MUSIC__ I thought Taylor Swift was more of a cat person?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. THere's that YouTube video of her being smothered by her mother's big dog...she was traumatized and that's why she's a cate person!"
"__MUSIC__ I bet the Taylor haters out thee wish they were that dog..."
"__MUSIC__ Not funny!  Besides, I think Taylor Swift would love my little Taylor!"
"__MUSIC__ Why? Because your poodle weighs 12 grams?"
"__MUSIC__ No. Because my doggies loves to dance to Taylor's song, 'Shake It Off!'"
"__MUSIC__ I can't."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ My puppy only dances when I put her in spandex."
