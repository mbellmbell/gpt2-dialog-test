"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, I just reread the entire series, let's talk about our least favorite characters!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I absolutely hate Bellatrix."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, she's a horrible woman, but not a bad character. I mean characters that don't have much of a purpose."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, then it would definitely be Lupin."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Shut your mouth, wow. Lupin is a saint."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I hate the force Tonks and Lupin storyline, and I think Lupin is just kind of weak."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He taught Harry how to do a patronus. And was a good teacher and friend."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, he literally just did nothing and stayed in the background most of the time. Who's your least favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wow, you're delusional! My least favorite character would have to be Molly Weasley."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, we can't be friends."
