"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you think about the current state of rap music?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's very popular, but it all seems like it's the same kind of songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It doesn't seem like the average listener should relate to the content, most of them rap about making lots of money and driving fancy cars."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, rappers like Tupac, and even others like Dr. Dre really rapped about stuff that told the listener what they experienced."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, a golden era in rap for sure. There were a lot of songs about butts, though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Nothing wrong with that! Rump Shaker was always a classic."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yup. Sometimes I'd wish some of these current guys would sing about it without being so degrading and nasty."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It sells, though. Current rap always seems to hit it big on the charts."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wonder if there's any good underground hip hop artists looking for a break."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There's plenty! You just have to know where to look."
