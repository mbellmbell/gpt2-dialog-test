"__HARRY_POTTER__ So I had a Harry Potter marathon the other day."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? How many did you watch?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I watched all eight, it took all day."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is crazy, which one is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like the last one, the battle at Hogwarts is just so epic!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like that one too, so much better than the Deathly Hallows Part 1."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes! That one was so boring, all they did was talk and camp."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I almost fell asleep the first time I watched it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, they made up for it with part 2."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, it was such a great movie to end the series."
