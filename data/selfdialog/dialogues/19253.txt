"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any movies that portray the Jane Austen books?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course I have, they are all classical!"
"__MOVIES__ Which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I´m going to sound very cliche but it´s Pride and Prejudice."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Because it´s so romantic, Mr. Darcy the whole scenario, it´s just like a farytale."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know there is a movie with Keri Russell called Austenland?"
"__MOVIES__ No I did not, what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ This girl is obsessed with Jane Austen so she goes to a place called Austenland where they pretend to live in the era of the books."
"__MOVIES__ What! No kidding, I would like to go there. What else happens?"
"__MOVIES__ Well she gets somewhat disappointed that reality is not as magical as the books."
"__MOVIES__ Oh it figures, did anything else interesting happened in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well she did get her happy ending. She met someone spectacular."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I envy her so much. I love those kind of movies."
"__MOVIES__ Is just that Jane Austen gives you so much, there is also an Indian movie version of Pride and Prejudice."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding, what is it called? I want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ It´s called Bride and Prejudice. It´s so cool, it´s the same story but with Indian theme. Would you like to see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! I would not miss it for the world."
"__MOVIES__ Well in that case I will add one more to the queue it´s called Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! I did heard about this one, crazy right! Same story but they are surrounded by zombies. Sounds good!."
