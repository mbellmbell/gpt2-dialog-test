"__DISNEY__ Did you hear that Disney bought the rights to Anastasia?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I did not. I thought that was already a Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ A lot of people, my self included, thought the same thing but apparently not."
"__DISNEY__ Hey! Doesn't that mean she's officially a Disney Princess?"
"__DISNEY__ I suppose you're technically right. I mean, I don't see why not."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they'll give her a live action movie like all these other classics getting remakes lately."
"__DISNEY__ Well... actually... they announced the live action remake at the same time of purchase."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder who they'll get to play the role of Anastia."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't mind seeing Emma Stone to be perfectly honest."
"__DISNEY__ I could see that or possibly Karen Gillan even if her contract would even allow her to. I don't think it'd be a problem her working on Guardians of the Galaxy and another Disney project."
