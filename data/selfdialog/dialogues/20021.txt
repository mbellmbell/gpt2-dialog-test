"__MOVIES__ Have you ever heard of a movie called The Untouchables?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Kevin Costner?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one I'm thinking of."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw that movie. Are you going to watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought I might because I like Kevin Costner, but I hadn't heard of the movie before."
"__MOVIES__ It's about an FBI agent who can't be touched by bribes like most officials were back in the prohibition era."
"__MOVIES__ Is it based on a true story?"
"__MOVIES__ It's based on a real life character, and I know how he takes down Al Capone is based on real events."
"__MOVIES__ Is it one of those shoot em up movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of, but it's more than that because it gets into the way they had to get clever in taking down Capone since he never left any evidence of his crimes."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I liked the movie, and you know I like movies with deeper plots."
"__MOVIES__ I know you do, that's why I wondered."
"__MOVIES__ I liked watching the strategy of how they worked, and the loyalty of the close inner circle of agents."
"__MOVIES__ So it gets into the characters more than a typical gangster movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it does."
"__MOVIES__ Kevin Costner plays the FBI agent you were talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Elliot Ness, I think is his name."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I can watch it when I get some free time then. It sounds like I might like it."
"__MOVIES__ I think you will, especially since it's a period movie."
