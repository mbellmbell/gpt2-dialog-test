"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, how's it going?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good! What do you think about the Lions this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they can maintain the momentum from last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree. They didn't lose much and only added some depth around the foundation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their GM is the real deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He absolutely is, molded from the Pats foundation, I think he's building something behind the scenes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like his drafts too, seems to put in the work to find the diamonds in the rough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wasn't so high on his draft this year, seemed to make a lot of reaches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like those are the ones that have such a high ceiling though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Elaborate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guys that other teams aren't high on, get called reaches, but maybe that's because he's seeing something special that others aren't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously, that WR they got in the 3rd, could be a bust, but on the surface, has all the tools you need to be a great redzone target."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess I could see where you're going with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like the best teams play safe early, and then go big in the mid/late rounds, that's really when the draft is won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess only time will tell!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Got that right and hopefully it'll tell us we're going to the Super Bowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haa, we can only hope!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's get down the field and gain, a Lion's victory!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Go Lions!"
