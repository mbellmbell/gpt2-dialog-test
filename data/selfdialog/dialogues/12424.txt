"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you looking forward to the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you placing your money on this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The team is just, not so good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They just have to pull together like any other team. Look they have some really good players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like who? Don't say Dez Bryant, who I think is over paid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That maybe so, but the man is a good wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Please, he played in 13 games last year and his defensive game was not so hot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll give you that, But I wasn't banking on him, Ezekiel Elliott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I think the 'Zeke' has a lot of potential."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. He is an awesome running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like I said, 'he has potential.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, listen. In 2016 he was the starting running back; ahead of veterans Alfred Morris and Darren McFadden."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what are you trying to say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That Zeke got game, and the coach knows real talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'll make sure to keep an eye out for him this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You already know, I'll be infront of the tv."
