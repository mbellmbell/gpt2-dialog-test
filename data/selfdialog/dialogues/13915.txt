"__BASKETBALL__ So, you tell me you hate the NBA. Why?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, a massive multitude of reasons. I'll tell you over the course of 9 turns."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, that's weirdly specific, but go ahead."
"__BASKETBALL__ The referees don't penalize flopping."
"__BASKETBALL__ What's that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ When a guy gets lightly bumped on the shoulder and somehow manages to fall about 20 feet. They do it in soccer too, but not as dramatically."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ha, LeBron is good at that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sadly, yes. And it's not punished. Sadly, you can't confirm or deny when someone is off-balance naturally or not."
"__BASKETBALL__ How else do you hate the NBA?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They don't call traveling. The players pretty much can do whatever they want and it's all good."
"__BASKETBALL__ And?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Even bigger, if a guy gets fouled, then throws a ball up and it goes in, it counts as it's part of the shot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it is."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, it's not. Unless he's actively shooting with the ball over his head, he's NOT shooting."
"__BASKETBALL__ What is it, then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He's throwing up the ball AFTER the foul, and getting rewarded for it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ahh, yeah that's a bit annoying."
"__BASKETBALL__ Plus, these guys make tens of millions acting like babies and being awful role models."
"__BASKETBALL__ All for playing a game..."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wish I could be a professional Cards Against Humanity player. Same level of being a jerk, but no rules."
