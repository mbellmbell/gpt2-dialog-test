"__MUSIC__ Who's your favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ I love Fall Out Boy. I've been following their music ever since their band got together."
"__MUSIC__ You mean you know their first album, 'Take This To You Grave'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, of course! They really started out as a hardcore punk band."
"__MUSIC__ The first Fall Out Boy album I heard was 'Infinity on High'."
"__MUSIC__ 'Thnks Fr Th Mmrs' was probably one of their most popular songs back then."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think most of my friends who knew Fall Out Boy only did because of that one song."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard 'Folie a Deux'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I used to listen to 'I Don't Care' on repeat during my high school years."
"__MUSIC__ That was a really catchy song."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of their recent songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Like, 'My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, or 'Immortal'. I personally feel like they sound like a mainstream rock band now."
"__MUSIC__ I'd have to agree. They're not as eccentric as they used to be."
"__MUSIC__ But it seems like the media really likes their work, and they're very famous now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I supposed it's alright that they sacrificed a bit of individuality to become more famous."
"__MUSIC__ But on the bright side, they still produce songs that embrace their old style, such as 'American Beauty/American Psycho.'"
"__MUSIC__ Good point! That song does still capture their style from back in their inception in 2003."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if they'll release any new songs soon."
"__MUSIC__ Apparently their new album, 'Mania' is coming out in September!"
