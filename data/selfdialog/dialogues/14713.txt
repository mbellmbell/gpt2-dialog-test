"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, I haven't seen you in ages, how have you been?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not too bad, just got back from my vacation."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Awesome, did you do anything fun?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I did, yes.  I spent a lot of time at the movie theater."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Did you see anything good?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, I did.  I absolutely loved the new Guardians Of Galaxy movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh cool.  I've heard really good things about it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It was really good, I saw it twice."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's a sequel, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, the first one came out a couple of years ago."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I remember watching that one, I think I liked it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You should check this one one, I think you'll like it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, why's that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It has more of an emotional story line.  It's easier to get involoved with the plot."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hmm... I might have to go see it this weekend."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You should, I was actually thinking about seeing it again."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow, that good, huh?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes!  You should see it in IMAX 3D, it is so much better that way."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok.  Is there anywhere around here that shows that?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, there are a few theaters the next town over that do."
