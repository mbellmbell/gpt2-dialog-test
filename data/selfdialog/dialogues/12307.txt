"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, with these NFL rule changes and protections, I think it's time to see more of the run-option in playbooks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard announcers talk about that and, I hate to profess my ignorance, but what is the run-option? Isn't it just the QB sneak?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, the run-option is all about creating a traditional handoff play, but the QB decides after the hike to actually hand off or run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, and that's different how?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The sneak is a designed play like the draw or scramble because the play is designed to go either way defending on the action taken."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why? How does the QB choose?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the QB reads the outside rush and, if they bite on the run and move to stop the RB, he keeps it, if they move to sack him then he hands it off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sounds like every play should be the option, I have no idea how to defend against it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it rests on discipline of the defensive team. Rex Ryan wrote the book on defending the option."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ryan, is he the Bills Coach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and before that he was the Jets coach, great defensive mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did he defend against it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Usually, you don't commit the rush until the handoff is complete or not. If the defender is patient, they can stuff it for a loss every play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why did Tebow beat him on that awesome Jets game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, with most rushes, you only have to guard against the outside run, a QB normally doesn't run up the middle"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because they can't churn up yards there I'm guessing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That, and you can take more hits, less chance to slide."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That make sense, so Tebow was able to beat it because the threat was in all directions and that's just tough to defend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ryan almost won that game, they did shut down that offense pretty solidly with his awesome coverage and safeties"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was pretty raucaus and a good defensive match."
