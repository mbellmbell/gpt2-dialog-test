"__MUSIC__ Hi, have you listened to the newest Sia album?"
"__MUSIC__ 'This is Acting?' Well, it was released last year; year 2016."
"__MUSIC__ I am sorry that's what I meant. How do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, as usual I love Sia's songs."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! Why do you love her songs?`"
"__MUSIC__ Well her songs are usually inspirational. It is not the typical; pardon me, cheesy love songs."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. It is about life and how to survive in this world."
"__MUSIC__ That is correct. This is because she had her own demons."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well she used to be addicted to alcohol and certain illicit drugs. As the results, her songs relate to how she managed to break through."
"__MUSIC__ Wow I never knew that! Well I know her song 'The Greatest' is to respect the massacre victims in Pulse Nightclub in Orlando."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. That is correct."
"__MUSIC__ If you look at the music video, people say that the amount of dancers represent on how many people were killed during the tragedy."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I did not know that! But I know at the beginning of the music video, Maddie the dance smeared her face with paint that resemble LGBTQ flag."
"__MUSIC__ That is correct. The song has so many level of interpretations!"
"__MUSIC__ Right! Going back to that album, I heard that alot of the songs in that album are reject of other singers."
"__MUSIC__ That is true! I head that 'Alive' was for Adele. Adele rejected it at the last minute."
"__MUSIC__ Oh well, I feel Sia's raspy voice is more suitable for the song anyway."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Same with the song 'Summer Rain.' Rumor says that Christina Aguilera rejected it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow. Again I feel that Sia's voice is more suitable for that song."
