"__MOVIES__ Do you like horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually love horror movies. It's hard to find anyone to watch them with me though."
"__MOVIES__ What ones do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't like really gory films, but more suspenseful/scary ones."
"__MOVIES__ They're coming out with a new 'IT' movie in September 2017."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I am definitely going to go see it. I loved the first one."
"__MOVIES__ The first one was awesome. It'll be hard to top it."
"__MOVIES__ One of the scariest scenes is when the kids look through the photos and Pennywise appears in them."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was scary. The sewer parts were always super scary, too."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, except for the ending with the spider. Looked too fake to me."
"__MOVIES__ I can see how you'd feel that way. It was harder back them to make things look super realistic."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think anyone will play a better Pennywise than Tim Robbins. I mean, he was exceptional in that part."
"__MOVIES__ He was. His facial expressions give off so much character."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember him in the movie, 'Home Alone 2'? He was the hotel concierge?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he was funny."
"__MOVIES__ Do you like the 'Home Alone' movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I did when I was a kid, but not really anymore. Do you?"
"__MOVIES__ They're alright. I'm not a huge fan of Macauly Culkin to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ Neither am I."
"__MOVIES__ I think no matter what, the 'Home Alone' movies will always remain holiday classics."
