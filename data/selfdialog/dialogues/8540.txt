"__BEATLES__ Hey, what do you think of the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know much about them. I think they are not from my mother's generation."
"__BEATLES__ You might have heard their music somewhere, in the bar, parties, etc."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, can you sing something that I might have heard?"
"__BEATLES__ Can'y buy me love...love...."
"__BEATLES__ Oh I know that one. Do you know another one?"
"__BEATLES__ Twist and shout! Baby baby baby..."
"__BEATLES__ I am not sure about that, but the melody sounds familiar."
"__BEATLES__ You should check Beatles out. They are really cool."
"__BEATLES__ I hope they are still giving concerts."
