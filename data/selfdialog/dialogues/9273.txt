"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the Braves and Blue Jays last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, Braves looked terrible, and now Freeman is out."
"__BASEBALL__ It was dumb for Braves to retaliate against Bautista"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, all that happened was that he got a free base and that started a big inning"
"__BASEBALL__ If you're going to throw at someone, just scare them I guess. Why put them on base?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah what good does it do to put baserunners on for no reason? I never understood that"
"__BASEBALL__ Both those teams are terrible anyway."
"__BASEBALL__ The whole NL East is bad except for the Nationals, how many games will they win that division by?"
"__BASEBALL__ Jeez at least 20 probably. Even the Mets are way under .500."
"__BASEBALL__ And weren't they in the playoffs last year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, and the World Series the year before."
"__BASEBALL__ Well the Royals won it that year and they are even worse I think."
"__BASEBALL__ I tell you, small market teams have to do everything right to stay relevant. They need too much luck every year"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the Royals caught the breaks but now they're not. Big market teams can rebuild much quicker"
"__BASEBALL__ Look at the Pirates, they had to lose for 20 years just to get enough good players to finally make the playoffs"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and now they're in last place again. Hopefully it's not another 20 years"
"__BASEBALL__ Other than the Rays for a few years and the Royals for a few years, it seems like there are about 10-15 small teams that are invisible."
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Twins and Brewers are actually in first place, but how many people realize that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Probably cause their stays won't be long. I can't see the Indians and Cubs not winning those divisions."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they have both struggled for 40 games now. Still asleep at the switch."
