"__STAR_WARS__ You know what's weird in Star Wars? People that support the Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's weird about rooting for the Empire?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess nothing, as long as you know they're pure evil. But some people try to justify it."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not that different from rooting for the Rebels. They both have legitimate reasons for doing what they do."
"__STAR_WARS__ But that's the thing, they don't. The Empire is literally just Space Nazis."
"__STAR_WARS__ At least you can say they're the legitimate government. Some Rebels are basically just terrorists, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, there are some morally gray Rebels, but it's not like rooting for the Separatists over the Republic. The Empire is just evil through and through."
"__STAR_WARS__ But the Separatists aren't evil?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Both sides are controlled by the same Sith Lord. They both have real reasons to fight, though it doesn't matter since they're both pawns."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see what you're saying. In that case it doesn't matter who you root for since the end result is the same."
