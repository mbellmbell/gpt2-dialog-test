"__DISNEY__ I have the song Let it Go stuck in my head!"
"__DISNEY__ I love that song! Idina Menzel has such a beautiful voice."
"__DISNEY__ I love the scene in the movie where Elsa sings the song. I like watching everything turn frozen."
"__DISNEY__ I like the fact that Olaf is the same snowman from when Elsa and Anna were little kids."
"__DISNEY__ The scene with Anna and Elsa when they were little makes me sad."
"__DISNEY__ When Elsa accidentally hits Anna with ice?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! It makes me so sad after their parents die and Elsa stays locked in her room."
"__DISNEY__ I feel like their parents did a bad job though. They should have tried to teach Elsa to control her magic, rather than locking her up."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think they did a bad job, they just wanted to protect Anna."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think they should have locked Elsa away though. That's not fair."
