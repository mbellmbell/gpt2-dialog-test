"__MOVIES__ So you told me you don't  like traditional Hollywood musicals, but you like Phantom of the Opera and Mama Mia."
"__MOVIES__ Right."
"__MOVIES__ So any other movie musicals that you like."
"__MOVIES__ Fiddler on the Roof."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ The music and the story line are wonderful."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, how the father bends and bends to accept his daughters' choices..."
"__MOVIES__ And finally can bend no more."
"__MOVIES__ Topol was amazing as Tevye."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw a stage version with Zero Mostel, who was known for the part, but to me, not as good."
"__MOVIES__ I have seen Topol without the beard and you can hardly see him as Tevye."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he looks so different and I don't think he's done anything nearly as memorable in his career."
"__MOVIES__ What about the movie daughters."
"__MOVIES__ They were all beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Tzeitel was plain but you come to see her as beautiful, but Hodel was a beauty."
"__MOVIES__ And Chava; you had to love her."
"__MOVIES__ And has there ever been a funnier scene than when Tevye thought the butcher wanted his milk cow when he actually wanted his daughter."
"__MOVIES__ I still laugh and laugh every time I see it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know that movie was made over 45 years ago?"
"__MOVIES__ We are getting old my friend."
