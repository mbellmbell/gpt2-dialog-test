"__MOVIES__ What genre of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like comedies and horror films."
"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite comedy of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely 'Grown Ups 2' with Adam Sandler, Chris Rock and Kevin James."
"__MOVIES__ That was such a good movie! Did you like the first 'Grown Ups' movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, but not as much as I liked the second. Adam Sandler is a great actor, he's so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'Billy Madison'? Adam Sandler was pure gold in that."
"__MOVIES__ That's a favorite of mine. I love the field trip part of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That part was funny. What horror movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like the 'Scream' series the best, and also 'Halloween', 'Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'It'."
"__MOVIES__ The 'Scream' series is great. I was never able to guess who the killer was until the end of the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. I thought they did a great job putting it together. It was hard to determine the killer."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that Julia Robert's niece, Emma Roberts was in the final 'Scream' movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she turned out to be one of the killers. She's a great actress, like her Aunt."
"__MOVIES__ 'It' was also a great movie. Stephen King is the master of horror."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, 'It' is a terrifying movie. It is a long movie, but keeps you on the edge of your seat."
"__MOVIES__ I was always scared of the sewer parts. You knew 'It' was there, but never knew when he'd pop out."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree. When he turned into a spider, I thought the spider looked a little fake though."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, it did. But the movie was made so many years ago, they probably didn't have the best effects."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know they're coming out with a new 'It' in Summer 2017?"
