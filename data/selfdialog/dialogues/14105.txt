"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been keeping up with the playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, somewhat who do you think will win it all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I like the cavaliers chances a lot, with lebron its just hard to count them out."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes thats true, but the warriors may have even more power seeing that they just added kevin durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, true that was a crazy move by them they have like three stars now it's crazy."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true it seems like lebron is better at getting his group motivated."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, I believe the warriors gelled pretty well though seeing that they made it to the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they did as well but we are yet to see how they can come together on a big stage."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea thats true, also lebron has most of the people he won a championship with back for this run."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, and they all have experience with winning the championship so I believe it will be less nerves."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true, Steph has a lot of experience with this too as well as his teammates."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, but kevin durant has not even been to a championship before so how do you think he will fair?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I didn't think about that, he has usually choked in the playoffs so hopefully he can get it together."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think he will, I believe if they do win it all he will have to get carried by the team."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hope not, that would be a big embarrassment, I believe he will be able to turn it on if it came down to it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe he will, Draymond Green does hold him accountable they have been seen getting into arguements on the sideline."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yea! I saw that, yea he is not having it this looks like it will be a good championship if they are both in it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Definitely, I can't wait how many games do you think it will go to?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It would be very surprising if its a sweep, I see it going seven games."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, I hope it does I know I will not want it to end."
