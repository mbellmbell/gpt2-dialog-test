"__MOVIES__ Tell me you've seen Wonder Woman!"
"__MOVIES__ Six times! I was so excited about it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's more than me. I've only seen it twice."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'll have it memorized before it's out on DVD."
"__MOVIES__ Worth it. Wasn't Gal Gadot fantastic?"
"__MOVIES__ She really was. Nobody can replace Lynda Carter, but Gadot is a great second."
"__MOVIES__ And Chris Pine made an excellent Steve Trevor."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so. All the casting was well done."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Except for Ares. Just couldn't picture it."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Thewlis just doesn't say 'god of war' to me."
"__MOVIES__ But the Amazons were all perfect, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Totally! Can you believe Robin Wright as Antiope?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I was in love with her! So strong and commanding."
"__MOVIES__ She was a great general."
"__MOVIES__ I could have watched a whole movie of Antiope and Diana training to fight."
"__MOVIES__ Those moves were almost frightening! The way they flipped around."
"__MOVIES__ And that 'Shield!' manuever. I loved how Steve remembered that."
"__MOVIES__ Helping Diana jump up that tower? That was great."
"__MOVIES__ But the best part to me was Diana using her bracelets."
"__MOVIES__ Bullet-proof bracelets! Classic Wonder Woman, so glad they included that."
