"__THRILLER__ What are you watching?"
"__THRILLER__ Misery."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, one of my favourites! Let me know how you think it is compared to the book."
"__THRILLER__ I've never actually read the book. Not a big Stephen King fan."
"__THRILLER__ But you like the movies?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I just meant I'm not a fan of his books. I like the movie adaptations just fine."
"__THRILLER__ I gotcha. I thought the book was great, though this is probably the only instance where I thought the movie was just as good."
"__THRILLER__ Ah, good to know. Is there anything I should know from the book?"
"__THRILLER__ Not really? I mean, it's more detailed of course but there's nothing major that comes to mind."
"__THRILLER__ Okay. Plus, the book doesn't have Kathy Bates in it and I like her in this."
