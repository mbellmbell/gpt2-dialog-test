"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like the middle three Star Wars films that I guess you would call the first three."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean episodes 1-3, the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah man, little orphan Annie and all that."
"__STAR_WARS__ The first one stunk, but Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith were decent."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, those two were alright but just too much computer animation in all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, they didn't look anything like the original films."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do though think Abrams did a good job getting back to the original look and feel of the brand with Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, but he's not directing The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson is."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I know, but I like that dude, he's done some cool films and I think it will end up looking like Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ Man I hope so, Empire is still my favorite out of all of them."
