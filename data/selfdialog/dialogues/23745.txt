"__DISNEY__ The song 'A Girl Worth Fighting For' is totally ruined by the ending, I think."
"__DISNEY__ Wait, what ending?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, don't you remember from the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No."
"__DISNEY__ They're marching along and singing that song, and then they suddenly stop singing because they see the village that's been destroyed."
"__DISNEY__ Oh now I remember! Yeah, that's so sad."
"__DISNEY__ The little girl's doll! I cried, probably."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah I felt so bad for her."
"__DISNEY__ Disney movies make me cry all the time though."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Tarzan...The Lion King...ok, they've all made me cry probably."
