"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Gladiator?"
"__MOVIES__ The old movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did why?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it was an accurate interpretation of the times?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was more accurate than most but it's hard to say since we don't really know what it was like."
"__MOVIES__ I just love the story of the man who stands up against an empire and fights back."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's a true david vs goliath story."
"__MOVIES__ I also love how he had to prove himself against all odds up to the very end."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't he fight a lion too?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe so."
"__MOVIES__ I seem to recall that."
"__MOVIES__ He had to fight his way through so much to get close to the ruthless king."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't he injured too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes the king weakened him because he knew he couldn't defeat him fairly plus he just wanted it over with but quietly not to damage his reputation."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think this is a true story?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so but it's hard saying if they were just stories or if it really happened."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough."
"__MOVIES__ Wonder if they will ever do a remake of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I doubt it."
