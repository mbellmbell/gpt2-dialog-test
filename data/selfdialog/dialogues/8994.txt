"__BEATLES__ What was the first song ever recorded by the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, the first song they ever recorded was a cover of That'll be the Day. This was way back when they were known as The Quarrymen."
"__BEATLES__ OK, but that was a cover. What about an original song? What was their first original release?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, that would be the song Love Me Do. It was released in 1962."
"__BEATLES__ Which Beatle wrote that song, do you think?"
"__BEATLES__ I am pretty sure it was written by McCartney. I think I read somewhere that he wrote it in the late fifties when he was playing hooky from school!"
"__BEATLES__ It was an awesome song. It was released as a single with the song P.S. I Love You, which I didn't like as much."
"__BEATLES__ Really? I love that song, too. Even though it was on the B side!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, well, the single only got to number 17 in the United Kingdom. When it as released in the United States, I think it got up to number 4."
"__BEATLES__ Fans in the U.S. must have liked the songs a lot more than the Brits, then."
