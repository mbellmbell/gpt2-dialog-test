"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you feel like any rappers are overrated at all?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, I can definitely think of one."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who would that be."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Jay Z. In my honest opinion he's the most overrated rapper in history."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really? He's seen as one of the best."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But realistically, he's just average."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's silly! How can you say that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He barely has any flow and his lyrics are too all over the place. The only reason people put him on such a pedestal is because of his wife."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I still don't buy it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You need to recognize average rap when you hear it."
