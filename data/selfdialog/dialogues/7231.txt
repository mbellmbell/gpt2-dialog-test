"__LADY_GAGA__ I used to really like Lady Gaga, but her music has been different lately."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think you're right. She's just not the same as she was when she first became famous."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you remember Poker Face? It was one of my favorite songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, it had such a good beat! It was really similar to Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That was a good one too, but those two sounded almost like the same song to me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I used to blast the radio and sing along with those songs when I was in high school."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, her songs just aren't the same anymore."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't think they're bad though."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't either."
"__LADY_GAGA__ We should look up her newest song!"
