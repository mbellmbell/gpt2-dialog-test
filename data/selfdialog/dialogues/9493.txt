"__BASEBALL__ Man the Cubs are really struggling this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I know it's like they have a hangover from last year."
"__BASEBALL__ But can you really blame them? I mean they finally won the World Series"
"__BASEBALL__ True. And they will probably get a pass for the next 100 years."
"__BASEBALL__ You are probably right, but with that being said, they should be winning."
"__BASEBALL__ With all of the young studs on this roster, you would think they would get it together."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but their starting pitching has to better."
"__BASEBALL__ No doubt about it. Their starting pitching is holding them back"
"__BASEBALL__ Guys need to forget about last year and focus on the present"
"__BASEBALL__ Why not focus and try to win a championship in back to back years"
"__BASEBALL__ That would be phenomenal and the city of Chicago would go crazy!"
"__BASEBALL__ True, but probably not as crazy as last year."
"__BASEBALL__ True. Those Cubbie fans were outrages last year."
"__BASEBALL__ But hey they deserved it. They came back from a 3-1 whole to win it all."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah what an epic comeback agains the Indians"
"__BASEBALL__ Now their city hasn't won a world series in like forever"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly. But I think there time has passed. The Yankees are the team to beat this year"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah looks like the Yankees have re-tooled."
"__BASEBALL__ That franchise doesn't stay down for long"
"__BASEBALL__ You're right about that."
