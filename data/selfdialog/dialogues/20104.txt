"__MOVIES__ I think it's about time the Academy recognizes Andy Serkis."
"__MOVIES__ I am in full agreement with this."
"__MOVIES__ His motion capture work is truly incredible."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe there is no category for that yet."
"__MOVIES__ Time and time again, he's proven that it's an art in it of itself."
"__MOVIES__ Which role stands out the most to you?"
"__MOVIES__ I love him as Caesar in the current 'Planet of the Apes' franchise."
"__MOVIES__ So many emotions conveyed through his facial expressions and voices."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, and isn't that the core of acting?"
"__MOVIES__ It really is.  If we can award someone for gaining or losing a lot of weight for a role, then Serkis should surely get one for his performance."
"__MOVIES__ I recently read that there used to be a Special Achievement Award that is no longer around.  Would be a perfect category for him."
"__MOVIES__ Especially if motion capture isn't going to be a category yet."
"__MOVIES__ Which was your favorite Andy Serkis role?"
"__MOVIES__ I think of course I'd have to go with Smeagol from 'Lord of the Rings.'"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, that is classic."
"__MOVIES__ Not only did he bring Smeagol to life, he also gave us that trademark Gollum voice."
"__MOVIES__ It's universally recognized."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's only a matter of time before they recognize this as a category."
"__MOVIES__ Especially with more CG roles and more actors doing the same."
"__MOVIES__ Even Benedict Cumberbatch did this for his role as Smaug in 'The Hobbit.  It is only a matter of time."
