"__DISNEY__ I finally watched Fantasia"
"__DISNEY__ Dude where have you been?  That movie is so old."
"__DISNEY__ I never really knew about it."
"__DISNEY__ Why not?  Did you live under a rock as a kid?"
"__DISNEY__ No We just weren't really into Disney back then.  I did think it was cool to see Micky Mouse as the sorcerer."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that was pretty cool.  I like the ballerina hippos."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't it have like a trippy vibe to it though?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah like you Alice in Wonderland type vibe you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes just like that.  Just weird things that don't happen normally."
"__DISNEY__ I think it was because they were trying to give sound a visual.  I think the music was written first then they drew the movie to fit."
