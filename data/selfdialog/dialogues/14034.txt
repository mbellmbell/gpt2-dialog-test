"__BASKETBALL__ NBA playoffs are unreal this year. Are you watching it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes I am. I can't believe all that has happened so far."
"__BASKETBALL__ The only problem is that all the top seeds are winning. Exciting games but boring results on paper."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm actually not a fan of upsets."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you serious? Don't you find this stuff boring when no under dogs win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ From what I see, under dogs winning makes for exciting first couple of rounds. But boring in the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Good point. At least the games are exciting. Game winning shots, big players stepping up."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see John Wall hit that three last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know! He isn't even a three point shooter!"
"__BASKETBALL__ That shot, with the game on the line is amazing. The guy has ice water in his veins."
"__BASKETBALL__ Have you ever hit a game winning shot in a basketball game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No. When I was in high school I took a shot at the end of a game to win, but I missed it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Heart breaker! What position did you play in basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ I was shooting guard."
"__BASKETBALL__ Were you a good shooter?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Not really. I wasn't a very good dribbler so I couldn't be a point guard. But I also wasn't tall, so I couldn't be a power forward or center."
"__BASKETBALL__ I played center. I was tall but not very coordinated."
"__BASKETBALL__ I still like to play basketball. I just don't have as much time."
"__BASKETBALL__ Same with me. I try to watch the NBA whenever I can though."
"__BASKETBALL__ I sure hope it is the warriors and cavs in the finals."
