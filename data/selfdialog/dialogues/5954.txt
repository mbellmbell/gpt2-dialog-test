"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is definitely Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he's great. Do you think they will do an origins movie that shows him when he was young?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They announced a Han Solo spinoff story already, but it would be great to see a young Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what he was like when he was younger and if he was always a Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well in The Empire Strikes Back, he does mention that he's been training Jedi for 800 years."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh that's right. And he told Luke Skywalker that he was 900 years old in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ We might not see an origins movie about Yoda, but maybe we will see him in the upcoming sequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, he is a Force Ghost now."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, and you can bet that Luke Skywalker has been speaking him during his exile since after the fall of his new Jedi academy."
