"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen any of the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I've only seen the 6th one, and the end of the 7th one.  Do you like them?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think they're pretty fun.  Dumb but fun."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I liked what I saw.  It's always fun to watch Dwayne Johnson throw people around."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh yeah, the scene in the interrogation room?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah - jeez, that was a lot of damage!  The light fixtures too?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, that's what you get when you mess with Dwayne."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I can tell!  How about that scene with the plane?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was great!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How did the plane stay at such a low altitude without crashing?"
