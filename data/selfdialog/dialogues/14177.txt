"__HORROR__ How do you feel about Scream?"
"__HORROR__ For its genre it was not that bad"
"__HORROR__ I liked the ensemble cast"
"__HORROR__ Yeah that helped with the acting"
"__HORROR__ I think that it really did a great job but they should have stopped at the first one."
"__HORROR__ Why  the second was better!"
"__HORROR__ I think the scenes in the 2nd one relied too much on the first."
"__HORROR__ Yeah well it was almost the same premise."
"__HORROR__ Thats why they should have just done 1"
"__HORROR__ Well thats not how they do it in horror movies in Hollywood"
