"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the romantic comedy Just Friends from 2005?"
"__MOVIES__ The one with Ryan Reynolds, right? You know, I never saw that!"
"__MOVIES__ I rewatched it over the weekend, and I realized how different gender portrayals have become!"
"__MOVIES__ Feminism hadn't really hit the cinematic mainstream back then in 2005..."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, it's not so long ago, but things were so different! The humor isn't really that funny."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the same thing when I saw 50 First Dates. I remember that being hilarious...."
"__MOVIES__ But in hindsight? Sexism and gay jokes just make you cringe."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! So what did you see in Just Friends?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the Anna Farris character is so flat. Just a silly, whiny, superficial woman."
"__MOVIES__ All the women in those movies were definitely seen through the male's eyes."
"__MOVIES__ The male gaze is definitely a thing! It's all about how they appeal to the men."
"__MOVIES__ And what's funny to the men. I think women in today's TV and movies are much more interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Like they could be real people! And studios know better now than to use women as cheap laughs."
"__MOVIES__ It helps bringing more women into the production process. Like Wonder Woman!"
"__MOVIES__ A female director making such a female-oriented movie? We're moving into the 21st century!"
"__MOVIES__ And the box office numbers are showing that type of movie appeals to more than just women."
"__MOVIES__ Men might want to know what women really think? Who knew?"
"__MOVIES__ Representation matters so much--at every point of filmmaking."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. But how about representation with women of color?"
"__MOVIES__ Still got a ways to go in some areas. Let's make a movie?"
