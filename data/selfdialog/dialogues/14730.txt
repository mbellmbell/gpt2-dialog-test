"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hello, is this Bill Eversteen?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, it is, how may I help you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, I wanted to see if you had a moment to talk about Robocop."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It just so happens I do have a moment to talk about Robocop, but I'd like to talk a bout the sequel, too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm sure that can be arranged."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Then I agree completely."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Great, lets begin.  Do you note a certain aspect of social satire that only Verhooven could interject into an action film?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I absolutely do. This is accurate"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you think the sequel was able to capture it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I actaully think they id an alright job of it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But the human aspect of Robocop is what really grounds it. The question of his existance, his memories, whether Murphy is man or machine, correct?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, Robocop is a much more nuanced film than one would think."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How well do you think the sequel did with the human aspect of the first."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Great question. A lot of people feel that the sequel didn't handle that as well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you feel this sway?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, I find it pretty obvious that since the first film dealt so heavly with this part, then they wanted to move on rather quickly. But they did address it early on, and in a couple more places throughout the film."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The stuff where Murphy keeps showing up at his wife's house."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ after all this is a recurring character in comics with many stories to tell.Yeah they needed to move on"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Last question, who wasthe better villan, Kurtwood Smith or Tom Noonan."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Eh, I liked the little kid from the second one. That was pretty cool."
