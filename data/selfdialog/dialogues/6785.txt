"__STAR_WARS__ Did you hear about what happened with the Han Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No what happened with the Han Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Kathleen Kennedy fired the directors working on the Han Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Why? They were already shooting the film!"
"__STAR_WARS__ The directors were removed due to creative differences."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow! So who is the director now?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The new director is Ron Howard, it was just announced today."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ron Howard, I would not have expected that at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Its not a complete surprise. Prior to filming Episode I, he was one of three directors that George Lucas asked to help direct Episode 1."
"__STAR_WARS__ Neat, I never expected Ron Howard to be a Star Wars fan. Hopefully, this won't affect the release date for the movie."
