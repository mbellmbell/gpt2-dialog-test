"__STAR_WARS__ Remember Luke's landspeeder in the first Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that thing was cool"
"__STAR_WARS__ He seemed like he had a lot of pride and joy in it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, until he had to sell it to pay for passage on the Millennium Falcon"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh right, he was upset that he couldn't get more money for it since the new model came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, but Ben told him not to worry about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what ever happened to that money. Do you think Han kept it"
"__STAR_WARS__ Absolutely. He was all about the money."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's sad though. Weren't they friends in the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can't cash someone's check"
