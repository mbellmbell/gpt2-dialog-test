"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen Momento?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh my God yes, hardly anyone knows that movie but it was great."
"__THRILLER__ I know what you mean.  They used the plot device of an unreliable witness to mastery."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and how that girl tricked him into killing his friend the cop."
"__THRILLER__ And how that cop was getting him to kill other people."
"__THRILLER__ One of my favorite lines from the movie was a funny one though."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, when he was like 'Why am I chasing this guy' and he tries to shoot him."
"__THRILLER__ Then he's like 'Oh no, he's chasing me'"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah that was good."
"__THRILLER__ His tattoos were pretty good too."
