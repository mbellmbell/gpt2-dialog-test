"__ROCK__ So, you listen to rock, still?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, 60's, 70's, and 80's. That was the high point in rock music."
"__ROCK__ Wow. It sounds like wailing and screaming to me. Who are some of your favorite bands?"
"__ROCK__ Led Zeppelin, Rush, Van Halen, Areosmith, AC/DC...all the usual suspects."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I like Aerosmith's song 'Don't Wanna Miss a Thing.' I'm kinds interested in getting into more rock music."
"__ROCK__ In my opinion, start off with the Rolling Stones, Credence Clearwater Revival...those 60's bands. If you go year by year, you hear a progression of sound."
"__ROCK__ What about the British Invasion?"
"__ROCK__ Definitely go with The Who, Rolling Stones, even the Beatles. Read about some of their influences and you'll expand your horizons, musically."
"__ROCK__ Thanks. I'll check them out."
"__ROCK__ Good deal. The best thing to do is put in earbuds, lie back, close your eyes, and feel the music...something you can't do with most music today."
