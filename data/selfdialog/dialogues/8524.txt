"__BEATLES__ I know a lot of Beatles songs, but I didn't grow up with them like you did. What are some interesting things about them I might not know?"
"__BEATLES__ Let's see, I've forgotten a lot of things--did you know they made two movies?"
"__BEATLES__ Really?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, 'Help' and a 'Hard Days Night' and they weren't too bad."
"__BEATLES__ Anything interesting about Ringo Starr?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, he was the drummer, of course, but  he was not the first--they fired some guy named Pete Best I think, who could have been famous."
"__BEATLES__ Poor guy, anything else?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, Ringo actually had the lead on some Beatle songs, such as Act Naturally. and Yellow Submarine."
"__BEATLES__ I've heard them--not classics, but not too bad."
"__BEATLES__ I've never thought Ringo was that talented but he's still going."
