"__MOVIES__ My boyfriend and I watched Pride and Prejudice last night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool, that's such a good book."
"__MOVIES__ Jane Austen right? I really liked it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was Jane Austen. Which film adaptation was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. It looked recent."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know which actors or actresses were in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that girl from Pirates of the Caribbean, and that guy who plays the monk in Pillars of the Earth."
"__MOVIES__ That's Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen. I know which film that was."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right, I remember her now. So you've seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's probably the best one. Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it! It had the most wonderful soundtrack."
"__MOVIES__ It really did. I think that was Dario Marianelli. He works with that director a lot."
"__MOVIES__ What other films has the director done."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Awakening? It's also Keira Knightley, and the same creative team."
"__MOVIES__ No, but now I want to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ What I really liked was the cinematography in those films."
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely, I noticed all the detailed shots. They were so immersive in the time period."
