"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. The Broncos, Patriots, Bills, Chiefs... There are a bunch, they had their own league until 1970.Before that, they were totally separate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is why Joe Namath is in the Hall of Fame. He brought respectability to the league. He beat the NFL Colts with his AFL Jets. He even guaranteed the outcome beforehand."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was ballsy. The Jets were the upstarts, but they kick Baltimore's butts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really changed the adversarial dynamics of the league. The AFL gained respectability. They wont Super Bowl IV too.The chiefs Walloped the Vikings!"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That stupid cruise down Miami during the playoff layoff was foolish!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Odell Beckham has to grow up and think! He is such an enormous talent.But, he has to grow up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would you take him over the Cowboys Dez Bryant?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No.Dez seems to have settled down. There age difference is small.As much as I like Odell's talent, I would keep Dez."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like that the Cowboys drafted Ryan Switzer. Do you think he will replace Beasley?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they should keep both.I thought Cole had his best season last year. Why jettison him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that is just the scuttlebutt. I heard it through the grapevine!"
