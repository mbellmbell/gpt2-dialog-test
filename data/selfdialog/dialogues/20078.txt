"__MOVIES__ What did you think about 'Spider-Man 3.'"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was the worst 'Spider-Man' movie ever made."
"__MOVIES__ I really disliked it too."
"__MOVIES__ What was the biggest sing the movie made you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's the fact that they tried to shoehorn too much into one movie."
"__MOVIES__ My thoughts exactly."
"__MOVIES__ I mean why have three excellent Spider-Man villains in one movie?"
"__MOVIES__ There wasn't enough focus on any of the villains to develop them fully."
"__MOVIES__ I think even having two of them would not have been as bad."
"__MOVIES__ Topher Grace's Venom just wasn't menacing."
"__MOVIES__ Venom in that movie was also so one-dimensional."
"__MOVIES__ You're right.  That scene where he's praying at the church for god to kill Peter Parker was absurd."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of absurd, the dance scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was insane.  It happened right after they showed us 'Emo-Peter Parker.'"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think Tobey Maguire will ever live that scene down."
"__MOVIES__ That movie almost ruined the franchise."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that explains why it was rebooted twice since then."
"__MOVIES__ I have high hopes for the new one."
"__MOVIES__ You mean 'Spider-Man: Homecoming?'  Me too."
"__MOVIES__ Yea.  I think Tom Holland will be awesome as Spidey."
