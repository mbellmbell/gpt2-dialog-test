"__MOVIES__ I really enjoy most Samuel L. Jackson films, and I am glad he is a staple in Tarantino films."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool, how was Jennifer Leigh?"
"__MOVIES__ I think she was great in the movie, but I really don't know all that much about her. Prior to this, I can't say I saw say I saw any of her films."
"__MOVIES__ How can you have never seen any of her films before- she is not Jackson big, but she's a pretty big star."
"__MOVIES__ Really, what movies has she been in before that I might have or should have seen?"
"__MOVIES__ She was big in weeds- I know you watch a lot of television, so you should have seen here in that, and she was the voice of the tempest in Hercules. I know you watch Hercules back in the day."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I guess I have seen some of her work. That was just a voice over though. What are some of her more recent works that I have seen?"
"__MOVIES__ She's mostly in television and does voice over acting, and she has done some memorable movies like Me, and Welcome to Me."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like she does movies about 'Me.'"
"__MOVIES__ That was just a coincidence. They were good movies though."
"__MOVIES__ What does she have that is coming out recently- I would prefer to go see her in the theaters next time she comes out rather than watching an older film."
"__MOVIES__ What do you have against older films? She is in Road to Perdition- that is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ I don't have anything against classics, but I don't have all day to sit around and watch movies- I try to cram my social life, exercise, and entertainment experiences all into one evening."
"__MOVIES__ That is kind of sad- you can't do all that in one night. Anyway, she is going to be starring in a movie called 'Good Time.'"
"__MOVIES__ You want to go see that when it comes out- I am sure the others will want to go."
"__MOVIES__ You have not even asked me what the movie is about."
"__MOVIES__ I just wanted to see one of her movies to say I did."
"__MOVIES__ Hm, well it is about a bank robber who can't seem to shake the people who are following him- I think it's different from other bank heist movies in the sense that the people who are chasing him are like specters rather than cops in a high speed chase."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that does sound fun. Any idea what her role is in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I dunno- she is probably his girlfriend or something."
