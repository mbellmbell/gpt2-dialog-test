"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, how are you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good thanks, how about you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Great! I finally just saw the movie La La Land."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's the musical one right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes! It was great. Like a throwback to the days where many movies were musicals."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I've heard it was really good. How was the music in it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The music was great. City of Stars is a beautiful song and I really like We Can Start a Fire."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I think I've heard City of Stars. Isn't there a famous artist that sings too?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, John Legend. He's the main voice on We Can Start a Fire."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Awesome. I wasn't so sure about it because of the lead actors."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You mean Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. They aren't singers so I didn't know how that would be in the movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They actually aren't bad at all. They sign surprisingly well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's good to hear. Maybe I'll try to see it then."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'd definitely recommend it. The music is very jazzy but I think even if you aren't a fan of jazz you can enjoy it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I actually do like jazz so many it would suit me pretty well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ If you like jazz then you really need to see it. Ryan's character is a jazz musician and a lot of the movie centers around that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't know that. I guess I didn't really know what it was about."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's both a love story, kind of, and the journey of the jazz musician finding his way back to performing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well I will see if I can get it on demand or rent it from Red Box. Sounds like I'd really like it."
