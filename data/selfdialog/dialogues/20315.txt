"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen that movie Nine Lives?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I did see the trailers.  How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the critics reviews weren't so hot, but we really enjoyed it!"
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about this businessman who's a real jerk, and he gets trapped inside his cat's body.  It kinda brings his ego down a bit."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting.  Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Kevin Spacey is the businessman and Jennifer Garner is his wife."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I love Kevin Spacey!  He's a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and he's really funny in this movie.  The cat is hilarious, too."
"__MOVIES__ I love cat movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it doesn't disappoint.  Plus it kinda has some good morals about family and what's really important in life."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it.  I wonder why it got such bad reviews?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea.  Maybe just because the idea seems corny."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.  The critics can be so harsh sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they really can.  I think family comedies get a bad rap too sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they are underrated.  I love movies the whole family can watch."
"__MOVIES__ Well this is definitely a good one, and it's appropriate for the whole family."
"__MOVIES__ Is it funny?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's hilarious.  We were laughing out loud throughout the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Good, maybe we will rent it tonight."
