"__MOVIES__ Did you ever go see Moana when it came out in theatres?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't but I saw it on Netflix just the other night."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was so cute! I thought for sure that the piggy would be her mascot throughout the whole movie, but she got stuck with a derpy chicken."
"__MOVIES__ Haha! That chicken was brilliant."
"__MOVIES__ I like that they made her body look different than all of the other Disney princesses, too."
"__MOVIES__ I noticed that! Not all women look like an hourglass, and they did a great job with her appearance."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the grandmother was really a nice touch, too."
"__MOVIES__ She reminds me of Grandmother Willow from Pocahontas, somehow."
"__MOVIES__ She does! There's always a parent who orders the princess around, and then someone who gives good advice."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like Sebastian from the Little Mermaid, Mrs. Potts from Beauty and the Beast..."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. but one of my favorite elements of all movies is the interactions that people have between each other."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MOVIES__ I enjoy seeing the way people support each other. Like family and friends do in reality."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I can see that. I prefer there to be a good plot, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Like a quest."
"__MOVIES__ Quests are the ultimate plot, haha."
"__MOVIES__ Remember Quest for Camelot?"
"__MOVIES__ I do! It was basically Beauty and Beast but not Disney, and in Camelot instead of a 'little town' in France."
"__MOVIES__ You can't beat a medieval setting when it comes to children's movies."
