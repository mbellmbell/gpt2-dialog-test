"__HORROR__ Did you know that Johnny Depp was in the first Freddy Kreuger movie?"
"__HORROR__ What?  This is news to me!"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I think it was one of his first ever movie roles."
"__HORROR__ This had to be during his 21 Jump Street years, right?"
"__HORROR__ I think so.  It sounds about right."
"__HORROR__ That's so weird, I don't remember him in that movie at all."
"__HORROR__ Well, spoiler alert he actually dies in it."
"__HORROR__ Oh, maybe that's why I don't remember him."
"__HORROR__ Still, he had a pretty big role in the movie."
"__HORROR__ I think I should rewatch it to see him."
