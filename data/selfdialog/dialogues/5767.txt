"__STAR_WARS__ Did you hear about how a Star Wars character caused a school lock down last month?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, did some creep go to the school dressed like somebody from Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was a student dressed as a Star Wars Storm Trooper. A passerby saw him going into the school and called police, saying somebody was wearing a mask and body armor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why was the student dressed up like a storm trooper? It's not Halloween."
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently the school was celebrating Star Wars Day, May 4th, called :May The 4th Be With You."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did the student get in trouble?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, they said it was a 'lapse of judgement.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I'm glad he didn't get punished."
"__STAR_WARS__ The police said the bystander still did the right thing in calling in."
"__STAR_WARS__ Better safe than sorry as they say."
