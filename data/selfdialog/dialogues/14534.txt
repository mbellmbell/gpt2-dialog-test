"__HORROR__ Seen any good zombie movies lately?"
"__HORROR__ Yes! I just saw a Korean film called Train to Busan that was insane."
"__HORROR__ Really? What sets it apart from other zombie movies?"
"__HORROR__ It all takes place on this bullet train so its confined and claustrophobic. And the zombies are fast so when people try to move between trains all hell breaks lose."
"__HORROR__ Was it gory?"
"__HORROR__ Extremely gory but in a unique over the top way. They had some set pieces like I've never seen but it also has a heart so you care about the people who are in jeopardy."
"__HORROR__ Caring about characters in horror movies is so rare. They're usually so disposable."
"__HORROR__ The director, Yeon Sang-ho, obviously spent time getting the characters right so there is more at stake."
"__HORROR__ Korea has done some really great horror films like I Saw the Devil and Tale of Two Sisters. They bring something new to the horror table."
"__HORROR__ I totally agree! Kim Jee-woon's I Saw the Devil is probably one of the best horror films in the crime genre out there."
