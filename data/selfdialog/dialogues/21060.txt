"__THRILLER__ Are there any new thriller films coming out that you are excited for?"
"__THRILLER__ The Stephen King’s IT remake is a big one for me. That first trailer was great!"
"__THRILLER__ I completely agree with you. It definitely looks like it has potential. Have you seen the original TV movie?"
"__THRILLER__ I have, yes, a long time ago. Unfortunately, it hasn’t aged well, in my opinion."
"__THRILLER__ I can’t disagree with that, but Tim Curry was still amazing as Pennywise."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, it definitely seemed like he was enjoying himself behind all of that makeup."
"__THRILLER__ What do you think of the new actor and look for the remake?"
"__THRILLER__ I think it looks good, for the most part. I have read that they are going to make the film more like the book."
"__THRILLER__ I have heard that, too. That could make the film a huge success."
"__THRILLER__ For sure, and it could also make it more popular for the Stephen King fans."
