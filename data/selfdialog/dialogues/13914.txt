"__BASKETBALL__ I am having withdrawals since the NCAA tournament wrapped up."
"__BASKETBALL__ No kidding. College basketball is the best. Especially ACC!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see that Grayson Allen is coming back for his senior year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, what a jerk. I'm sure no NBA team would touch that cheater baby."
"__BASKETBALL__ He definitely needs to mature. UVA lost some of their guys that weren't getting enough play."
"__BASKETBALL__ Tony's pack line defense is a thing of beauty, but it's not for everyone."
"__BASKETBALL__ Have you ever been to a game at JPJ?  What a great venue."
"__BASKETBALL__ I went to the Virginia Tech game last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Don't you love Buzz?"
"__BASKETBALL__ For sure. He has turned Tech's program around. Have you ever been to Cassell?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I haven't. Too far to drive down and back for a game. Evan goes to the games when he remembers to get tickets."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sweet. It looks so small compared to JPJ."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are there any other teams you follow?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure. I follow Mason and VCU.  I was really bummed when Shaka went to Texas. He was such a great coach."
"__BASKETBALL__ We did go to Richmond to see a VCU vs. Mason game. VCU's fans are rabid."
"__BASKETBALL__ No kidding. I know just what you mean. Loved seeing him coach."
"__BASKETBALL__ I follow Iowa State too. Monty Morris graduated this year so not sure what their team will look like next year."
"__BASKETBALL__ They'll need some Hylton Magic for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ready for football? We've got our tickets for the VT/WVU game in September."
"__BASKETBALL__ That will be a great game. Looking forward to seeing them play at Fed Ex Field. Go Hokies!"
