"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that Disney owns Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's been a thing for years now, hasn't it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. Some weren't too happy about it at first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did they think that the films would be marketed towards kids again?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but thankfully that wasn't the case."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed. The latest two were still great films, even under Disney's name."
"__STAR_WARS__ It shouldn't come as a surprise, either."
"__STAR_WARS__ What makes you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Disney owns Marvel, and Marvel Studios has been killing it with their films."
"__STAR_WARS__ This is very true."
