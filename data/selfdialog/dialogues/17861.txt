"__MOVIES__ Whats that movie with the boy who makes the rockets?"
"__MOVIES__ Rocket man?"
"__MOVIES__ No its about a boy who builds rockets for a contest and his dad is a coal miner."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, October Sky! I love that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Thats the one, did you know Jake Gyllenhaa is the brother of Maggie Gyllenhaal?"
"__MOVIES__ Really? Which movies is she in?"
"__MOVIES__ She was Rachel Dawes, Batmans girlfriend."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, thats right. 'WHERE'S RACHEL?!'"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't realize those two were related until recently. Its so odd how common it is for families to be involved in film."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it must have to do with the genes. If you have the good looks and that magic presence on screen its most likely in your family I suppose."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I think there are some other prominent cases of that as well."
"__MOVIES__ Julia and Eric Roberts, there is another brother sister duo."
"__MOVIES__ Or Joan and John Cusack."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how their relationship is with each other once they become famous?"
"__MOVIES__ Like is there a fight or competition between them over who is more famous?"
"__MOVIES__ I bet there is, in the very least it has to be awkward when they see each other."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so, I think they probably get a long fine. After all they probably grew up together."
"__MOVIES__ Thats a good point, I still think it would be a lot of awkward pressure if you were getting big film jobs but your sibling wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ Well in that case you better stay on good terms with your brother or sister and hope they can get you some movie roles if they become famous."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I would do, I would have no problem helping out family."
