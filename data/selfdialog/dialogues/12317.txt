"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what's going on in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems to be the same every summer, guys see these NBA contracts and all of a sudden they think that their underpaid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right? When does it stop?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is always the same type guys too, the free agents or the rookies that just signed big contracts saying they could have gotten more if they played basketball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they should just go play basketball.  They thought making a 53 man roster was hard.  Try 15."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Makes me feel like they don't want to share with their teammates."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Makes me wonder if there is a point where you don't think about money and what that dollar amoutn is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have seen guys get guaranteed rookie contracts of more than ten million a year think that they are underpaid. And they haven't even played a single down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really is hard to believe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Basic differences don't seem to mean anything. I mean 15 players versus 53, 82 games vs. 16.  What don't they understand?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, there are just more opportunities for a team to make money during a long basketball season and less people to share it with."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that NBA money sure is unbelievable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  Those guys are killing it. But the NFL players get paid pretty well compared to how it used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know Jim Thorpe used to play for $250 a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I lot of guys that got drafted in the early years never even signed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your'e right. I know of a number one pick that took a job selling foam rubber instead of playing football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could you imagine that today?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I can just hear some saying 'No, thanks for the offer but I would rather go work at the plant.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not going to happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely not."
