"__SUPERHERO__ Sooo I watched the movie 'Logan' again last night."
"__SUPERHERO__ Haha how many times have you watched it dude? Like 50?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I lost count at this point. It keeps getting better everytime I watch it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ohhh I'm not disagreeing dude, that movie gave me the feels."
"__SUPERHERO__ You can say that again! I cry at the end everytime. It's kind of pathetic lol."
"__SUPERHERO__ Real men cry too brother hah. I hope they keep the movies coming even though Wolverine is dead."
"__SUPERHERO__ They have too!!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah I think you're right. Logan is going to become her father's prodigy."
"__SUPERHERO__ I hope you're right! I dont know if I'll be able to live myself not knowing what happens."
"__SUPERHERO__ Psh haha imagine how much of baddass Logan is going to be when she gets older."
