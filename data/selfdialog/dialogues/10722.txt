"__FASHION__ This new trend of barely wearing your coat seems silly to me."
"__FASHION__ Barely wearing your coat? Isn't that defeating the purpose of wearing a coat?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah. First they came out with that editor's cape foolishness."
"__FASHION__ I think I remember that one. That was the one where you wore your coat like a cape."
"__FASHION__ Yeah. The look of oh-so-casually wearing your coat perched atop your shoulders without your arms slung through the sleeves."
"__FASHION__ I tried that one. I didn't like it much."
"__FASHION__ Why would anyone like it? It left your arms free to do whatever buy you couldn't raise your in editors' shoulders."
"__FASHION__ That look was way too restrictive."
"__FASHION__ The editor's cape is fading into distant memory and is being replaced by something even less practical."
"__FASHION__ Let me guess. The laid back look of  shrugged shoulder?"
"__FASHION__ Oh. So you have seen that one?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah.  That is worse than the editors' cape."
"__FASHION__ I think so too."
"__FASHION__ I mean. Your shoulders and parts of your chest are exposed to the cold."
"__FASHION__ There is no way you can stay warm on a chilly day dressed like that."
"__FASHION__ Makes me shiver to my bones just thinking about it."
"__FASHION__ Especially with the below freezing winters we have had over the past five years."
"__FASHION__ Yeah. You would freeze to death if you tried that look in our part of the country."
"__FASHION__ It could work in a state like Florida."
"__FASHION__ I don't think so.  They don't get all that cold there."
