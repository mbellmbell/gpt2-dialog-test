"__STAR_WARS__ In what sense?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe kill her off."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why does it have to be like that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What other option do you have?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You could have her retire."
"__STAR_WARS__ That does not work with the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lucas could unfold another angle."
