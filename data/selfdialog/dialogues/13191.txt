"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think was the best TD in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Packers wide receiver Max McGee back in 1967."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa!! You went way back with that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I did. But he did a one hander in 37 yards. I never seen nothing like that since then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I think when Odell Beckham Jr made a TD with 21 yards. No that was a TD!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that. That was actually a few recent years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it was actually back in 2015 when his team played against the Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You sure it was 21 yards?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh course it was. He is one of my favorite player so I certain it was 21 yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok. But I got one even better than Odell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. Tell me about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember when AJ Green of the Bengals did a TD with 48 yards?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I actually don't remember that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it was incredible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I do remember when he scored an 80 yard TD when they played against the Ravens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No that TD was even better. Now I did watch that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and the 66 yard TD when AJ Green played against the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I almost pissed in my pants during that game out of excitement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was watching it at a friends home and it was the highlight of the night."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now I can agree with you on that one. AJ Green is one of the best WR of the NFL."
