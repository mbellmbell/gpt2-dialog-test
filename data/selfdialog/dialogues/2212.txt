"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of rap or hip hop?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, I like 2 Pac and the like, what about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh so you are like a 90s fan of hip hop, like Biggie Smalls."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, there is something about that era of hip hop and rap where it was all about being influence by crime and ballin"
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Snoop Dogg? I would say I am a fan but limited to certain tracks."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I like Snoop Dogg as much as I like Mac Dre. Andre Hicks really defined what bay area rap is."
"__MUSIC__ Totally Mac Dre is legit. Did you know he was one of the predecessors of the hyphy movement?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but what is the hyphy movement?"
"__MUSIC__ It is when music became more aggressive and it was all about a gangster lifestyle. Money drugs and cars, so many rap songs just based on those."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like the Pharcyde? Such early 90s west coast rap."
"__MUSIC__ I never really understood how west coast rap became it's own genre."
"__MUSIC__ Well it was partly territorial and partly a response to the huge success of many east coast rappers."
"__MUSIC__ Are you into like new hip hop and rap like Gucci Mane?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and no, like with any era of music there are the good and the bad and the ugly."
"__MUSIC__ One of my favorite older groups is Grayskul."
"__MUSIC__ I am not sure I have heard of them. Tell me more."
"__MUSIC__ Well they where formed from the large and popular group OLDMINION. They had there big breakthrough in 2005 when they where signed with a label."
"__MUSIC__ So what is the style of that band?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say that they are very synth based rap but have that classic rap beat."
"__MUSIC__ They sound I would very much enjoy."
