"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ice hockey players are exceptional athletes, it's like they're playing football while wearing ice skates."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Can you explain the basics of hockey to me?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well in hockey they divide the rink into three zones."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Like how in football the field is divided in half by the 50 yard line?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, sort of like that. The objective is to hit the puck into the net."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I've seen them do that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The area where the goal net is in is called the defending zone."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are both the goal nets in defending zones?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, the goal net for the team that has the puck is called the offensive zone."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think I understand. The name of the zone depends on which team is in possession of the puck at that point in time."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes. And there's a section in the middle of the rink that is called the neutral zone."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Is that the area between the blue lines?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes. The game begins or resumes whenever the players fight for possession of the puck in the neutral zone."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Is that called the face off?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Exactly. Each team has six players. One of them is the goalkeeper, who guards that team's goal."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do the other players have positions, like in football?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, there are three forwards and two defensemen."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And the teams can take players out and put others in, just like in football."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's sort of like that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But they can never have more than 6 players at a time."
