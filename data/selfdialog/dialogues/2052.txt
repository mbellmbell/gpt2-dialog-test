"__MUSIC__ What do you think about bands playing to a backing track?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it is pretty lame"
"__MUSIC__ Me too"
"__MUSIC__ I wish they just played what they have live"
"__MUSIC__ I understand doing it on an album, but not live"
"__MUSIC__ I especially don't like it for the voice of the singer"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah we cannot tell if he is really that good, or not"
"__MUSIC__ It's not as bad as lip syncing though"
"__MUSIC__ I agree"
"__MUSIC__ There are some organic bands out there though"
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Iron Maiden doesn't do that"
"__MUSIC__ They are just pure music"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and they are the real deal"
"__MUSIC__ I saw them live once"
"__MUSIC__ Was it fun?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and no backing track"
"__MUSIC__ That is awesome"
"__MUSIC__ I think no metal bands should ever have a backing track"
"__MUSIC__ Of course they shouldn't. No band should"
