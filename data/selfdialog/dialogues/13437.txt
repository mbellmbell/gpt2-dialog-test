"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Minnesota Vikings will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will be good, I'm hoping they can make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, although I have learned not to get my hopes too high."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same. Such is the life of a Vikings fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least we're not the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I have a good feeling about our new rookie RB Dalvin Cook."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, I can't believe he fell to us in the second round. Great value for one of the best backs in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rookie of the year, calling it now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would make me so happy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Teddy Bridgewater will play at all this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he will, but I think he will be healthy enough to play if needed. Sam Bradford will play well and be the starter for the entire season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Sam was pretty good for us last year, even though we had a terrible offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why I think we will be improved this year. Adding o line players in free agency will really help our offense out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's all about who stays healthy though, we were saying the same thing last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah good point. I guess we will just have to see what happens when the season starts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you been to any games at US Bank stadium yet?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not yet, but I toured it last year. It's incredible"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep we have one of the best stadiums in the league for sure. Love it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope tickets won't be too expensive this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if they are, it means we are playing well. Good problem to have!"
