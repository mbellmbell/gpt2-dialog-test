"__MOVIES__ Hey, so what is the best movie of the year so far?"
"__MOVIES__ Tough question. I really liked Wonder Woman!"
"__MOVIES__ Shockingly, its up there for me too."
"__MOVIES__ I was blown away."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well DC has been a travesty up until this film"
"__MOVIES__ Another top level superhero film was Logan"
"__MOVIES__ I thought Logan was fine. Not crazy about it"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it was the best X-men movie"
"__MOVIES__ It might be, X-2 is up there. I just lost interest once we had the monster party at the end"
"__MOVIES__ X-men sure love to come up with random mutants. Its weird"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I mean, Jackman is great and their relationship is sweet"
"__MOVIES__ So, what is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Get Out. It was masterful"
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that. So restrained, tight, and funny given the material"
"__MOVIES__ We knew that they were all bad, but thankfully their motivations was a crazy surprise"
"__MOVIES__ Totally nuts. Did you have a good crowd for that?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. It was me, and like two other couples."
"__MOVIES__ I had a packed audience that was into it!"
"__MOVIES__ Lucky. I've had bad crowds or dead ones"
"__MOVIES__ I'll happily take the latter. Sheesh"
