"__MOVIES__ You know what movie that I saw recently? The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai."
"__MOVIES__ Across the 8th Dimension?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that's the one. One of Peter Weller's finest films."
"__MOVIES__ What exactly was the 8th dimension?"
"__MOVIES__ Beats me. I never figured it out. But he drove through a mountain."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Christopher Lloyd in that as well?"
"__MOVIES__ He was. I think he played John Bigboote."
"__MOVIES__ Who else was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, John Lithgow played the villain."
"__MOVIES__ That's a heck of a cast. What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Beats me, I was drunk through most of it. But it was a ton of fun. Something about aliens trying to destroy the Earth."
"__MOVIES__ What was the best moment?"
"__MOVIES__ This doesn't sound like much, but I really liked the scene when Buckaroo and his rock band are performing and he stops the performance because he hears someone crying in the crowd."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds really stupid."
"__MOVIES__ It was, but it worked."
"__MOVIES__ So how did it end?"
"__MOVIES__ Buckaroo saves the day, of course, and Lithgow blows up in his spacecraft."
"__MOVIES__ What about Bigboote?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in the spaceship with Lithgow."
"__MOVIES__ Next time I feel like drinkin', I'll check it out."
