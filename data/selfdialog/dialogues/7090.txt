"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see that the Carolina Hurricanes traded for Scott Darling a couple of weeks ago?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah I think it's because of Chicago's cap problems."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Probably, Carolina signed him to an extension too. They're hoping he can start for them."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How much was that deal?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's a $4.15 million cap hit each year for the next 5 years."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's a pretty big deal. Don't they already have some goalies?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They do have Cam Ward and Eddie Lack already."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Those guys the past couple of years haven't been amazing. I guess it makes sense."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And don't forget that the expansion draft is looming."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Very true. They might be hoping Vegas takes one."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yep, and the other guy can just back up Darling."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well I guess it might not be that black and white. Lack did end the season well."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're not wrong, but goalies get hot a lot of the time too. He might not keep it up."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I guess we'll see. If their goaltending improves they could really make the playoffs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Definitely helps their chances. But they might need some offense too."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe they could trade some of their defense to improve up front? They're kind of stacked there."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ There are some names out there on the trade market this year like Duchene and maybe Drouin."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Either one of those guys could work. And those teams would want young dmen back too."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I guess we'll see. Next year should be really interesting for them in any case."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ For sure. I'm looking forward to it."
