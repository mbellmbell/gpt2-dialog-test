"__HORROR__ I been looking into some movies wondering if they are scary or not"
"__HORROR__ let me know what they are called"
"__HORROR__ Well they are made by some little company and were straight to VHS"
"__HORROR__ Okay then"
"__HORROR__ They were called puppet master"
"__HORROR__ Oh those movies those are cult classics"
"__HORROR__ So they are good"
"__HORROR__ Yeah they are good horror but not really scary"
"__HORROR__ Oh why not"
"__HORROR__ Just the theme is scary but never hits the mark but they are good"
