"__DISNEY__ Hey what was the name of red hair girl in The Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ I think her name is Arial."
"__DISNEY__ Arial was the fish wasn't it?"
"__DISNEY__ Nope i'm almost a hundred percent sure that Arial was the name of the main character."
"__DISNEY__ Hey when you think about it Arial was a fish so I am technically right."
"__DISNEY__ No she was a mermaid not a fish there's a difference."
"__DISNEY__ Oh come on she had a fish tail and breathed under water."
"__DISNEY__ But she did have a human top half so I think it's still different"
"__DISNEY__ How about we agree to disagree on that."
"__DISNEY__ Nope you are wrong she is and never was a fish."
