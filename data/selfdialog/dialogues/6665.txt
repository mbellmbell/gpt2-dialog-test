"__STAR_WARS__ Where you suprised that Aniken Skywalker is Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Totally. In revenge of the sith I can't belive he killed all of the Jedi recuits."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I was suprised. That is when I understoid why Jedis were not supposed to have romantic relationships."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah someone that powerful would do anything for the person they love."
"__STAR_WARS__ But would you ever be temped to go to the dark side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Totally they have no rules. Jedis have too many rules."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know. That's what keeps them in check."
"__STAR_WARS__ Too many rules. If they didn't have all those rules Qui Gon Jin could have had a second apprentice and maybe Anikien would not have gone to the dark side."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is very interesting. Do you thing Obi Wan was not ready?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. They gave him a powerful boy who was too old."
