"__MUSIC__ Have you ever seen The Story So Far live before?"

"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite CD by them?"
"__MUSIC__ Their first one was good, but I think 'What you don't see' is a masterpiece."
"__MUSIC__ That CD is really good. I'm actually partial to their self-titled."
"__MUSIC__ I've only listened to that one a couple times."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it takes a couple listens but it really grew on me."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite track on it?"
"__MUSIC__ It's probably 'Heavy Gloom'."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to go back and give it another listen."
"__MUSIC__ If you like them, you should check out Four Year Strong."
"__MUSIC__ Four year Strong is awesome."
"__MUSIC__ When they came out, their sound was so original."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there weren't too many bands doing that style at the time."
"__MUSIC__ I think Set Your Goals was the only other band in that category."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I would say A Day to Remember was a bit similar."
"__MUSIC__ I could see that, A Day to Remember had more heavy parts though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah definitely. I think their heavier sections were what set them apart."
"__MUSIC__ Those do seem to be the parts that everyone remembers."
