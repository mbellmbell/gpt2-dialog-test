"__BASKETBALL__ Which teams do you think will meet in the Finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That is pretty obvious, considering how the playoffs are going."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're right. So do you think the Cavaliers have a chance?"
"__BASKETBALL__ With the way Lebron is playing right now, I certainly believe they'll give the Warriors a good run."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron looks amazing right now, but the Warriors seem unstoppable."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. The Cavaliers barely edged out the Finals last year, and that was before the Warriors picked up Durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is certainly a game changer."
"__BASKETBALL__ Absolutely! The best team in the NBA last year acquiring one of today's greatest players has certainly elevated them to another level."
"__BASKETBALL__ That makes four All-Stars in one team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the Cavaliers have three: Lebron, Kyrie and Kevin Love."
"__BASKETBALL__ Let's be realistic. They are Eastern Conference All-Stars."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is very true. There is a big competitive gap between teams from the Eastern Conference and teams from the Western Conference."
"__BASKETBALL__ There is almost no comparison."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the Cavaliers certainly had an easier road to the Finals than the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ That, however, gives the Warriors much more experience against high level competition."
"__BASKETBALL__ That experience will certainly play a role."
"__BASKETBALL__ I believe the Warriors will close it out in six games."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is if they don't sweep the Cavaliers."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's hard to imagine. The Warriors will almost surely take the crown, but Lebron and the Cavaliers are too competitive to lose four games straight."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true. They'll put up a good fight."
