"__MUSIC__ I was just thinking of that song 'Firework' by Katy Perry."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song."
"__MUSIC__ It's very motivational and empowering, don't you think?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally. I get pumped whenever I hear it."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that it just written just with algorithms, though."
"__MUSIC__ What? That's crazy."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I heard."
"__MUSIC__ I don't trust that at all. It can't be right. That song has such powerful, motivating lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ It does. I play it when I need an ego boost."
"__MUSIC__ The video is amazing, too."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've ever seen the video."
"__MUSIC__ I won't give it away, but there are fireworks in it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that makes sense!"
"__MUSIC__ Her song 'Roar' is another good one."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like that one as much, but I think it's the same sort of message."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, empowerment and self-esteem."
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen that video?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. Is that the one on a jungly island or something?"
"__MUSIC__ It's probably just a fake set or the zoo or something, but yes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It was pretty cool. That's a good ego-boosting song, too."
