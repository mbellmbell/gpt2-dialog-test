"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite comedic moment in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Kylo Ren throwing temper tantrums was pretty sweet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I loved the storm troopers walking away. And the general reporting him had the 'crap, we have to fix that, again' like it's common."
"__STAR_WARS__ You?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Finn and Han."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ The whole audience cracked up. See if you can finish it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay..."
"__STAR_WARS__ 'I'm going to use the force!'"
"__STAR_WARS__ '... THAT'S NOT HOW THE FORCE WORKS!' hahahah I loved it."
