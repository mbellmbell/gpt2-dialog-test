"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think was the best move this off season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Marshawn Lynch coming back and going to the Raiders is a big deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, he is kind of up there in age, I don't know how productive he will be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should do well, he took time off after all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see, so you're saying he should be rejuvenated for the coming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think he has taken the time to get healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really also want to see how Adrian Peterson does on the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I wonder if he can have a good season, the Saints are an explosive offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, if he can play the whole season I think he will perform well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of a former Viking, how well do you think Minnesota will be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good question, I think they will miss the playoffs because the Packers and Lions will both be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I agree with that, it will be tough to win that division this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least they have a good young core."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, they just need to find that franchise quarterback to lead them to the promised land."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do wonder though how the Vikings will be without Adrian Peterson, it's kind of crazy not seeing him in that uniform."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I don't think they were on the best terms, it will be strange if they Saints and Vikings play for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes that is true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well hopefully he can earn me some Fantasy points as a dark horse, I am willing to bet on Peterson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good luck, that can payoff if he goes off for some good numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, well either way this season's going to be great."
