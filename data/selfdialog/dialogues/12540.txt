"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What a fan of the Los Angeles Rams I am!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! At least I was a fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no! What happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They left Saint Louis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, yes they did. Are members of your family still fans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some are, some aren't. I couldn't imagine still being a fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must be hard on the family."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, it's not as hard as some other things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think Geoff will do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope well. We spent a first round pick on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How has he done so far?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not well. He has a losing record overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that his fault or Fisher's?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It could be the coach but I think it's more his fault than anything else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He can run the plays, Fisher cannot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Is he a good game manager?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's more of a leader than a Russel Wilson manager type."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Should they be a run-first team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. The running back isn't good either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I certainly wish them the best, even with Gurley as a running back."
