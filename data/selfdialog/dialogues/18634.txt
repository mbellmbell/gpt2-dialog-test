"__MOVIES__ What movie did you end up seeing this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ I finally ended up watching Braveheart, believe it or not."
"__MOVIES__ Braveheart?! That movie is pretty old!"
"__MOVIES__ I know. I just never saw it before, somehow."
"__MOVIES__ It's a long one if I remember correctly."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I think it was like three hours long."
"__MOVIES__ So, did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! I can see why everyone always says such good things about it."
"__MOVIES__ I loved it. I think it's really what made Mel Gibson such an unforgettable actor."
"__MOVIES__ He was great in it. The whole thing was so well done."
"__MOVIES__ I recently saw a scene from another movie where the guys are in kilts and they have sword fights."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I think it was Rob Roy."
"__MOVIES__ I heard of that. It's with Liam Neeson, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I saw a scene where he actually is about to lose a sword fight."
"__MOVIES__ Don't ruin it for me."
"__MOVIES__ I won't."
"__MOVIES__ Liam Neeson was in Star Wars, too, I think."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. He's had lots of roles."
"__MOVIES__ He was in an old movie called 'Nel' too, I think."
