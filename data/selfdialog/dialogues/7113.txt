"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are you a fan of the Kings or the Ducks?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm a Ducks fan! Of course, go Antoine!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You think they'll win the conference?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You bet, we'll kill the Predators!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ To me it's unbelievable to think of an NHL game between Anaheim and Nashville! When I grew up, and ate, breathed and slept ice hockey there were only six teams!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Boring, dude."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Seriously, real hockey cities! When the Kings got a franchise it was just awesome to be able to see Montreal Canadiens play in LA. Jean Beliveau, Maurice Richard, man, that was hockey! Toronto even has a goalie who played without a mask!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No way! Who was that?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The guy played for the Kings after the Leafs, have you ever heard of Terry Sawchuck?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That was way, way back. He played for the Kings? Who else did they have?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Look up these guys, Eddie the Jet Joyal, Bill Cowboy Flett, Real Lemieux... those first years of hockey in LA were the best. But now, too many teams! The talent's too diffuse."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But the King's sucked back then, they lost every game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ All the new team did, it took a long time for the league to even out. The St. Louis Blues were the only good new team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who did they have?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ They had an awesome goalie, Glen Hall. I don't think he wore a mask either."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who was the first goalie to wear a mask?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think it was Jacques Plante with the Canadiens, and I remember he took over for this old time goalie Gump Worsley. There's a great hockey name - Gump."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Were all the players still Canadians back then?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh yeah. No Russians, no Czechs...definitely no Americans."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think I like it better now. It's cool that it's an international sport."
