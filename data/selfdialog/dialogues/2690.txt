"__MUSIC__ Here, try this. Ever been to a Willie Nelson concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, thanks. I shook his hand."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too. That's beautiful, the way he shakes everyone's hand."
"__MUSIC__ The way he performs is gorgeous too. Much better than his recordings."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Kind of vaguely reminded me of Sinatra though."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I noticed that too. It's like he falls back on Sinatra-type phrasing."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he could do worse."
"__MUSIC__ True. Did you notice the herbal smell when you shook his hand?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure did. But then, there was a light haze all through the Mountian Winery. And it's an outdoor stage."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, he encourages it, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, I went to a John Prine concert where he was pounding Jack Daniels right on stage."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think he does that any more."
"__MUSIC__ He's still good though, I hear."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's at Red Rocks in June. Great venue."
"__MUSIC__ Big, though. He's in Napa in October, that's where I'm going."
"__MUSIC__ Everybody's seen Joey Cocker puke on stage. Not from smoking pot, man."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't he dead now?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it wasn't drinking, it was smoking tobacco. Lung cancer."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, man, a great loss. I loved that guy."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Good stuff man, thanks."
