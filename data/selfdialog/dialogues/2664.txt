"__MUSIC__ I absolutely hate the Cannibal Corpse."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's not for everyone. Especially girls."
"__MUSIC__ I mean even for dudes, why would any dude want to listen to that unless you have issues?"
"__MUSIC__ I've listened to some, I don't have issues."
"__MUSIC__ Yes,but you listen to them as a study."
"__MUSIC__ So what? I still listened and actually enjoyed a few songs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, my God. i can't believe you just said that."
"__MUSIC__ What? Some of their songs really highlight their talent."
"__MUSIC__ Screaming and playing cacophony isn't a talent."
"__MUSIC__ Well, playing cacophony to that extent does require some skills at their instruments."
"__MUSIC__ And what about the message in their lyric, it' just disgusting."
"__MUSIC__ You know, people said the same thing about the composers from the Romantic era."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ A bunch of them. Liszt, Paganini, and others. They all had references to the devil, and fire and things which we no longer find offensive, but back i those days, it was a big deal."
"__MUSIC__ Fire is pretty tame. Devil, maybe. A bit offensive."
"__MUSIC__ Well, fire as in burning in hell fire. But Liszt did write many pieces with certain macabre references like the Totentanz, the dance of the dead., or the Mephisto waltz, named after the demon in German Folklore."
"__MUSIC__ That was the end of the age of Enlightenment, so I can see something like that becoming more common."
"__MUSIC__ Well, there were still a significant Christian reaction to them at the time."
"__MUSIC__ Christians react to all things they consider offensive. Even other Christians."
"__MUSIC__ True. But to say the least, we shouldn't just dismiss musicians for what they portray on stage. We should evaluate them at their face value as musicians. And as musicians, the Cannibal Corpse is a talented group."
