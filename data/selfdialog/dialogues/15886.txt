"__ROCK__ What is the best rock concert you ever saw?"
"__ROCK__ I went to see AC/DC on their Who Made Who Tour and they knocked my socks off!"
"__ROCK__ Angus Young is an amazing performer, who opened up for them?"
"__ROCK__ Guns N Roses opened for them, and they were great too."
"__ROCK__ Oh sure, and now Axl Rose is singing with AC/DC, isn't he?"
"__ROCK__ I believe so, now that Brian Johnson left the band for medical reasons."
"__ROCK__ Brian Johnson is a hard act to follow, his voice is so distinct."
"__ROCK__ It is, but Axl has put his own spin on things."
"__ROCK__ All of the other members of AC/DC are phenomenal, but you first notice that lead singer."
"__ROCK__ You're right, I don't know how diehard fans of AC/DC are going to feel about Axl singing lead."
