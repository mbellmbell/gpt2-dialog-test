"__MOVIES__ Which summer movie will make the most money this year?"
"__MOVIES__ I think Guardians of the Galaxy 2 will do the best."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I'm not so sure about that."
"__MOVIES__ Which one do you think will then?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the new Spider-Man movie will be a huge hit."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that one will do well. But don't you think people are tired of all these Spider-Man movies?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a fair point. But this is going to be a proper Marvel film."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it will also have Robert Downey Jr. in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that will definitely give it a boost."
"__MOVIES__ Which summer movie are you looking forward to the most?"
"__MOVIES__ I really want to see Dunkirk."

"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm excited for that one as well."
"__MOVIES__ Which film is your most anticipated?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm looking forward to Valerian."

"__MOVIES__ It's going to be a fun summer. There are lots of big movies coming out this year."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait."
