"__DISNEY__ Did you grow up on Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure. I'm from the olden time when there were no movies on video or DVD, so the only way to see a movie was in theaters."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, going to the movies was a much bigger deal back then, more special."
"__DISNEY__ I grew up in a big family, so we hardly ever went to walk-in theaters, too expensive. We did the drive-in movie thing."
"__DISNEY__ I'm from that time also. I think I saw every Disney movie there was, in a drive in theater."
"__DISNEY__ I remember we would make tons of popcorn, put it in paper shopping bags (remember those?) and take them to the drive in to munch on during the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Do you remember any particular movie experience?"
"__DISNEY__ There was this live-action movie, In Search of the Castaways, from 1962. I went with my best friend, and my sis and her bestie."
"__DISNEY__ I think I remember that one. Maurice Chevalier was in it."
"__DISNEY__ I liked it because my mom always told me I looked like Hayley Mills when I was a little girl. So it's one of my favorite Disney movies."
