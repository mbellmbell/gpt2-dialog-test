"__MOVIES__ Are there any movies that you'll always watch if they're on?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! There are lots that fit that bill."
"__MOVIES__ For me, it's Happy Gilmore, or Billy Madison, or any of the early Adam Sandler movies."
"__MOVIES__ My answer is kind of similar - It's the early Judd Apatow movies. 40 Year old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad."
"__MOVIES__ I think those might be better movies than the Adam Sandler movies, but I think the Sandler ones are more re-watchable."
"__MOVIES__ Because they don't even try to be serious at all?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think so. It's just pure goofy fun."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of pure goofy fun, what about Stepbrothers."
"__MOVIES__ That movie didn't really do it for me."
"__MOVIES__ That surprises me - Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly killed it in that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess. It just got too weird for me at a certain point."
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely weird, but I thought it was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I just come from an earlier generation of comedies. I've never been as into the Apatow or Adam McKay movies as you."
"__MOVIES__ That might be what it is."
"__MOVIES__ I will probably always watch Shawshank Redemption, thinking about serious movies rather than comedies."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, me too. That one is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much any movie with Morgan Freeman narrating is worth watching."
"__MOVIES__ His voice is so amazing and resonant."
"__MOVIES__ I still think my #1 re-watchable movie is Happy Gilmore, though."
"__MOVIES__ And for me, it's Knocked Up."
