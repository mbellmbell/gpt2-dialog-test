"__MOVIES__ Do you know how many times they've made a King Kong movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I can think of at least 3."
"__MOVIES__ What are the ones you can think of?"
"__MOVIES__ There was the original old-school one made in the 30s, the Naomi Watts one, and then one I didn't see that took place entirely on the island."
"__MOVIES__ The one with John C. Reilly?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one!"
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of amazing that they've done the story as much as they have."
"__MOVIES__ I guess people enjoy a movie with a giant Ape!"
"__MOVIES__ The crazy thing is that there have actually been 8 King Kong movies."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, I had no idea!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there was a sequel to King Kong that they made in the 1930s, and then some various Kong movies in the 60s through 80s."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! There was the movie where King Kong fights Godzilla."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that was made in the 1960s."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I underestimated how often movie makers have gone back to well with that story."
"__MOVIES__ It's obviously served them well financially, if they keep making movies on the topic."
"__MOVIES__ The funny thing is that for me, I don't even find the concept that cool."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not super excited to see a random King Kong movie, but I've found them to be kind of fun."
"__MOVIES__ There is something surreal and entertaining to see an ape the size of a building fight a dinosaur."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, here's to another 8 King Kong movies in the future!"
