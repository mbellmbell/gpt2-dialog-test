"__MUSIC__ Have you gone to see any bands lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I went to go see Motorhead a while ago."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's cool! I love them!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they're really good, a lot of very popular stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I know Ace of Spades."
"__MUSIC__ Everyone knows that one at least, they hate to play it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure. What does some of their other stuff sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty much the same kind of vibe, the same singer and similar guitar stuff."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds good to me at least."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like it a lot also. The singer is really tall."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. He also has a very raspy voice."
"__MUSIC__ That's one of their signature sounds, it wouldn't really be Motorhead without the singer."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame that he passed away recently."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was very sad. Tons of people are broken up over it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, at least they got a lot of good years in."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, they have been around for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ They've been around since the 80's right?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, though I'm not too sure."
"__MUSIC__ I bet I could find all kind of interesting stuff online about them."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure, I bet there's a lot of interesting stories with people in the band too."
