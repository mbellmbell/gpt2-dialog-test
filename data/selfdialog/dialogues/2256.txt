"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you listened to Lorde's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't really like her."
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding? Lorde is brilliant!"
"__MUSIC__ I thought Royals was sort of vapid, and a little too pop-y for my taste."
"__MUSIC__ Well, her new album is about a break up, and it's anything but vapid."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, a break-up pop album? Everybody does that."
"__MUSIC__ Lorde's lyrics are pop genius, though."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think that she could be better than Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ Just listen to Melodrama, it'll break your heart."
"__MUSIC__ I'm telling you, I'm not a huge Lorde fan!"
"__MUSIC__ The lyrics to 'Liability' are so personal, you'll really like it, I promise."
"__MUSIC__ Beyonce decided to go personal with Lemonade and now everyone is trying it!"
"__MUSIC__ Look, I'm telling you, Lorde confronts some difficult things on this album."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ She talks about her mental illness, her obsessions, how love is hindered by fame."
"__MUSIC__ That is a little more impressive than her critiquing pop music with 'Royals.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, on this album she's using the medium of pop to express her own story and grief."
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe I'll have to give her a shot!"
"__MUSIC__ Though, 'Green Light' is a really fun party song."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like a party song every once in a while!"
