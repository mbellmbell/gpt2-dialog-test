"__MUSIC__ What groups did you listen to growing up?"
"__MUSIC__ Rusted Root, Crash Test Dummies, Lisa Loeb..."
"__MUSIC__ Those are all terrible. I haven't heard of any of them."
"__MUSIC__ Of course you haven't, thanks fort the judgement. You know their music."
"__MUSIC__ So name some songs by them."
"__MUSIC__ Rusted Root has 'Send me on my way' which is from a lot of movies, most well-known as being in Matilda."
"__MUSIC__ Ooooh yeah! They performed at my school a few years ago."
"__MUSIC__ How were they? They're getting old."
"__MUSIC__ They were great for me, but got booed a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Why did they get booed? They play to hippies who are high the whole time."
"__MUSIC__ They hated that they couldn't form a mosh pit."
"__MUSIC__ A bunch of college bros went to a Rusted Root concert and freaked out? Ha!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they weren't too smart. What about Lisa Loeb?"
"__MUSIC__ Her big song was 'Stay' which is still on the radio every once in a while. Crash Test Dummies had 'Mmm mmm mmm mmm'"
"__MUSIC__ That was such a weird song!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's kind of silly, like a folk song. No real plot, just silliness."
"__MUSIC__ His voice was crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, did you know they got rejected by a lot of labels because they felt his voice was too low for pop radio?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, at least they did well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have a LOT of music, but had a couple years where they change their sound and were hated."
