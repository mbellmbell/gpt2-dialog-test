"__MOVIES__ Have you watched Patriot's Day?"
"__MOVIES__ The Mark Wahlberg and John Goodman movie about the Boston marathon bombing?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the movie. I watched it recently and really liked it."
"__MOVIES__ I did see it awhile back in theaters when it was still out. I thought they did a really good job of showing us how that event happened as well as the investigations leading up to the findings on the bombers."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was so suspenseful and touching for a devastating movie based on real events."
"__MOVIES__ I hated Kevin Bacon's character in that movie at the start, he seem like such a know it all as the lead investigator."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I almost forgot Kevin Bacon was in it. Remember when Kevin Bacon was in every movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I know, that's where the sixth degrees of separation stuff from Kevin Bacon was from."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked how they gave tribute to the victims and survivors. Some of those scenes were so painful but powerful."
"__MOVIES__ Mark was really good in this movie as the cop that loved his city so much."
"__MOVIES__ This was really such a pro Boston movie, but in a good way, and one that made you feel pride for your country seeing the city band together."
"__MOVIES__ It was a strong movie. Surprisingly pretty action packed too."
"__MOVIES__ That scene in the neighborhood with the shoot out as they trapped one of the bombers was so intense and suspenseful."
"__MOVIES__ The explosions and gun shots definitely sounded really realistic."
"__MOVIES__ Oh did you catch the cameo from Supergirl?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean Supergirl?"
"__MOVIES__ The main bomber, the older one, his wife with the child, that was Melissa Benoist, also known as Supergirl."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, Melissa Benoist was in this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! She was the bombers wife, I was mind blown when they interrogated her out of the mask and hood. I had no idea it was going to be her. The real life person she played was also similar to her."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I didn't even recognize her!"
