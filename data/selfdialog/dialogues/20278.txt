"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favorite Steven Spielberg movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's a really tough one. Do you?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I have an all-time favorite, but I do have favorites within genres."
"__MOVIES__ That's the thing - Spielberg has done such a massive array of movies."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, I'm not sure any other director has done as many different types of film."
"__MOVIES__ So what's your favorite Spielberg action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It has to be 'Saving Private Ryan', but 'Jaws' is a close second."
"__MOVIES__ I saw 'Jaws' in the theater a few years ago, and it was so much scarier in that environment."
"__MOVIES__ I'd love to see it in a cinema. I saw 'Saving Private Ryan' in a cinema."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, and that was quite an experience. I'll never forget it."
"__MOVIES__ I've always loved the partnership with Tom Hanks, too."
"__MOVIES__ Hanks is my favorite actor still working, so I couldn't agree more."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have a favorite Spielberg movie with Hanks in?"
"__MOVIES__ Again, difficult, but 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Catch Me If You Can'."
"__MOVIES__ DiCaprio was great in that movie. Did you see 'Lincoln'?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't, even though I love Daniel Day-Lewis. Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it, even though it was kind of slow."
"__MOVIES__ Some Spielberg movies are though - 'Schindler's List' is somewhat slow."
"__MOVIES__ Such an incredible movie though."
"__MOVIES__ Oh completely. The slow place makes it so much more emotional."
