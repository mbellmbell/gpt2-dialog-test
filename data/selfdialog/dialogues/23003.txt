"__DISNEY__ With the new Beauty and the Beast movie out, did you happen to re-watch the original Disney animated version again?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I did. I had too. I wanted to compare the two movies."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. I loved the Disney animated movie better."
"__DISNEY__ So did I. I think Belle was my favorite character out of them all."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, really? I always liked Chip and Mrs. Potts the best."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like Gaston's character?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, not really. I think he was kind of a boring character."
"__DISNEY__ At the end, Gaston was the one who died right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he fell off the wall of the castle when he tried to kill the beast."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah. I forgot what had happened in his final scene."
