"__MOVIES__ Let's talk Star Wars!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, my. This could get violent. We'll probably unfriend each other after this."
"__MOVIES__ I already unfriended you. Check your Facebook. Anyway, thoughts on the prequels?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, boy. So, I don't hate them."
"__MOVIES__ But, do you love them? Do you like them?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they're overly hated because of snobs that are part of the Star Wars superfandom. Ask someone who isn't a meganerd and they'll like them."
"__MOVIES__ True, they all had positive reviews..they just don't stand the test of time."
"__MOVIES__ So you like the original trilogy a lot, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Clearly."
"__MOVIES__ Well, defend it."
"__MOVIES__ Ready and waiting."
"__MOVIES__ If Luke was a fully-trained Jedi why couldn't he use the force on the Rancor? You can lift a plane, but not a monster?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, um... he was just throw into something unexpected and it was his first test as a jedi."
"__MOVIES__ Sure... then how was it that a bunch of clones of a BOUNTY HUNTER who easily killed Jedi were helpless in battle?"
"__MOVIES__ They weren't, it's hard to fire in closed quarters."
"__MOVIES__ If Leia always knew that Luke was her brother, as she admitted in VI, why did she kiss him anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ That was just bad writing after-the-fact. Maybe she finds Luke hot?"
"__MOVIES__ WAIT A MINUTE."
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ What if Rey in Episodes VII-IX is left on a desert planet by herself because of shame? What if she is Luke and Leia's offspring? My god..."
