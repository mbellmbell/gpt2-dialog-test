"__ROCK__ I have tickets for the Smashing Pumpkins concert this weekend, do you want to go?"
"__ROCK__ No, I used to like that band, but I didn't like it when they broke up and got new band members."
"__ROCK__ I know what you mean. Jimmy Chamberlin was a great drummer, and that new kid doesn't compare."
"__ROCK__ They were great in the 90s, but now their music is ho-hum."
"__ROCK__ I know, I still go to their concerts just hoping they play some old songs."
"__ROCK__ They used to have great music videos back in the day when MTV used to play music videos all the time."
"__ROCK__ Oh man, I MISS MTV music videos. They were the best!"
"__ROCK__ 80s rock music videos were even better than the 90s. Remember 'I Want My MTV?'"
"__ROCK__ OH, and remember when Beavis and Butthead used to do the commentary on music videos?"
"__ROCK__ Beavis and Butthead ROCKED."
