"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey do you think anyone can beat New England this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will lose a couple games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will win the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't think anyone can beat them in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is when things get serious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  They might get so far ahead in the regular season that they rest players so they might lose those."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  They lost Gronk last year and still won the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  If they lose Brady, the other teams might have a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Atlanta came pretty closing to beating them in the Super Bowl though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Atlanta sure did blow it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they did.  You can't let teams that good hang around like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to put them away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ New England didn't have Gronk either and still won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Atlanta head coach used to be the Seahawks' defensive coordinatior."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you know how good the Seahwawk's defense was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  The legion of Boom."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They held New England in check through the first 2.5 quarters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then they must fell apart."
