"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Leia is a Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Doesn't she have to be?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, being Force sensitive doesn't automatically make you a Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Force Awakens was the only movie in which Leia doesn't use a weapon."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, that's because she didn't need to."
"__STAR_WARS__ What if it's because her weapon is now a lightsaber, and that's the big reveal for Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be amazing, and would explain why Carrie had to get into shape."
"__STAR_WARS__ And, Luke had plenty of time to train her if Force Awakens is 30 years later, and her son is in his 20s."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they will kill her character in Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ If they do, it better be in an amazing lightsaber battle."
