"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the Yankee's at all this weekend?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they were supposed to play on Saturday but it got rained out."
"__BASEBALL__ When are they having the make-up game?"
"__BASEBALL__ They actually had it the next day, on Sunday."
"__BASEBALL__ But didn't they already have a game scheduled on Sunday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yep, they ended up having a double header."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, a double header on Mother's Day?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not only that, it was Derek Jeter day."
"__BASEBALL__ Isn't he already retired?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, exactly.  They had a ceremony to retire his number."
"__BASEBALL__ How long ago did he retire?"
"__BASEBALL__ About three years ago.  It was a long day of baseball, but it was really good."
"__BASEBALL__ What did they do for the ceremony?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, they actually gave him a stone in Monument Park.  His whole family was there and they gave him a plaque that was a mini-version of his Monument Park stone."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, I did't realize he was that influential of a player."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure, he's up there now with all the greats.  Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle..."
"__BASEBALL__ I know he was really well known, but was he actually that good?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh for sure!  He's their all-time leader in hits, at-bats and stolen bases."
"__BASEBALL__ I had no idea.  So did they win the games?"
"__BASEBALL__ They won the first but lost the second.  It was pretty close at the end though, it looked like they were gonna come back."
