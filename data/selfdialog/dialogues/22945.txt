"__DISNEY__ Did you hear that Tarzan is the brother to the princesses in Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ No way!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes way, they even got people from Disney to speak on it."
"__DISNEY__ I can't believe that. Isn't he in the jungle though?"
"__DISNEY__ That's what I thought. But maybe they just sailed really far away."
"__DISNEY__ I guess so. They don't have the same coloring though."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I guess Tarzan just got really tan."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they'll ever make a movie where Tarzan and the princesses meet."
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm, that'd be interesting to accomplish."
"__DISNEY__ I'd definitely go watch it though."
