"__DISNEY__ I just can't believe it!"
"__DISNEY__ What?"
"__DISNEY__ They are remaking Mulan."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I haven't even seen the original to be honest."
"__DISNEY__ Really?  It's really good.  You should watch it instead of the live action one."
"__DISNEY__ I will check it out.  Remakes usually make me really mad."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, especially if it's really bad.  It disrespects the original."
"__DISNEY__ I think it's weird to remake cartoons, but this is Disney we are talking about."
"__DISNEY__ They will remake anything for the mighty dollar."
"__DISNEY__ It's a shame.  Let's just hope it's good."
