"__DISNEY__ Did you see the new Cinderella movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't but I really want to!"
"__DISNEY__ I don't think it was as good as the animated one, but the acting was decent."
"__DISNEY__ What about the new Beauty and The Beast, have you seen that?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Emma Watson was phenomenal!"
"__DISNEY__ I thought so too!"
"__DISNEY__ She actually reminds me of the animated Belle, which I think was even better."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I thought that was a really good choice."
"__DISNEY__ Do you remember who played the beast?"
"__DISNEY__ No, not really but the CGI to make him look like a beast was unreal!"
