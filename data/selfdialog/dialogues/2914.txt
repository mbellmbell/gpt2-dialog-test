"__MUSIC__ Hey man, do you like pop music?"
"__MUSIC__ No I don't, not really."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ It feels like a lot of the same kind of thing, you know?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes I guess. Anything in particular you don't like?"
"__MUSIC__ I really don't like how things are very major sounding, it feels recycled."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I can see what you're saying."
"__MUSIC__ That's the biggest thing for me, but there are some really good pop songs that I like."
"__MUSIC__ Can you think of any?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really know the names, but Daft Punk I know did a good pop song lately."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that one, yeah that one is really good."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I like that one a lot, until the radio played it to death anyways."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they played it for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ That's something else I don't like about pop music, you hear the same stuff over and over again and you memorize every note."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that fun though?"
"__MUSIC__ No I like to be kept on my toes and expect something new. Pop music is predictable."
"__MUSIC__ That's what makes it so good though, you can dance easier to it."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like dancing. Maybe that's why I don't like pop that much."
"__MUSIC__ That could be it, a lot of pop music is written to be danced to."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to find some good pop songs that I like and let you know which ones I think are better."
