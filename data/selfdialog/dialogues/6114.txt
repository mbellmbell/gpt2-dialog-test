"__STAR_WARS__ I hope they give Snoke a good backstory and motivation, Star Wars movies aren't always good at that."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Darth Vader? He's a villain with a good backstory."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's one, and you know what, I'll even throw in Emperor Palpatine, but that's it."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's gotta be more than that? Tarkin?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's just a guy who is Vader's superior and runs the Death Star according to the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about the expanded universe?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Then he's a guy who rose through the ranks of the Republic Military during the Clone Wars, and eventually became governor of the Outer Rim. Not particularly deep."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Count Dooku? He was a Jedi idealist who left the Order and went rogue to fight against the corruption in the Republic."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and outside of that little tidbit of backstory he's basically just the evil leader of the Separatists. His buddy Grievous is no better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, I'll give you that. Star Wars is good at making cool villains, but they don't have a lot of depth."
