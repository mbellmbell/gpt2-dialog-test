"__ROCK__ So, how do you feel about the '60s psychedelic rock scene?"
"__ROCK__ Well, I like it a lot, really."
"__ROCK__ I know some people would say it hasn't held up too well."
"__ROCK__ That it's super dated? Yeah, but that's part of the appeal for me."
"__ROCK__ Sure, I mean, I don't need my music to be timeless."
"__ROCK__ Looking at music as a historical document is much more interesting for me."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, and '60s psychedelic rock shows a lot of what changes were happening with the postwar generation."
"__ROCK__ And honestly, if you look past some of the dated production and stuff, I think its messages are pretty timeless."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, the idealism and optimism!"
"__ROCK__ Exactly, and we need a lot of that today, if you ask me."
