"__ROCK__ Do you ever listen to Radiohead?"
"__ROCK__ I know a few of their songs, such as Creep. Do you listen to them?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah they are my favorite band. Creep is a decent song but the album it was one wasn't the best."
"__ROCK__ Wasn't it their first album?"
"__ROCK__ Exactly. Their next album, The Bends, was a much better effort. You should listen to it!"
"__ROCK__ I will, but I have to be honest the lead singer's voice is somewhat annoying."
"__ROCK__ A lot of people say that. It takes a little getting used to. But give the album a chance I think you'll like it."
"__ROCK__ Oh! Is this the album with Fake Plastic Trees on it?"
"__ROCK__ It is! That song has great lyrics!"
"__ROCK__ I agree... it's one of my favorites from the 90's"
