"__STAR_WARS__ Do you prefer the original trilogy or the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I definitely like the originals more but I really like Revenge of the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do too, it is probably my third favorite movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite? Mine is The Empire Strikes Back"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite is actually A New Hope, but Empire comes next."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the new movie at all, I thought it was alright but not great."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it but thought it was only better than The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ I could agree with that, it was trying too hard to be the originals."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that's true, and it didn't have any real significant moments besides Hans ending."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I do look forward to the next movies though."
