"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey there, how have you been?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good man, good to see you."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Same! I've been meaning to tell you about this band that I think you'll love."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ooooh, I always love getting recommendations from you. Hit me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The band is called Elder."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Never heard of them; what are they like?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ They're basically like doom metal, which I know you love, but they're a little bit proggy too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I kind of hate prog rock though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I promise, you'll like these guys. The prog elements are pretty subtle and they just give you a nice break from all of the riffs."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ OK, fair enough, I'll check them out."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What else have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Lots of Fleet Foxes, believe it or not."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah? You were into them a while ago, I remember."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I kind of burned out on them and that sort of folk-y stuff, but I think it's been enough time that I'm ready to get back into it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You know they have a new one coming out soon, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, that's kind of what got me back into them. I'm pretty pumped about that new one."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Which album of theirs should I start with if I was going to check them out?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'd start with the first one, the self titled one. It's solid."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Cool, I'll check it out."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You should - I think you'll like them."
