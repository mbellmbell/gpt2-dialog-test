"__DISNEY__ A new Cars movie is coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ I heard. It has been a while since the last one."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. My kids are older now but I think they will still want to see it."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I though it was for younger kids?"
"__DISNEY__ That may have been the intention, but we seem to enjoy it as a family."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I need to revisit them and take a second look."
"__DISNEY__ The people they chose to do the voices were the best. They really compliment each other. Mater was hilarious."
"__DISNEY__ He was the tow truck, right? He was funny."
"__DISNEY__ Not sure what kid of story line they will go with."
"__DISNEY__ Hope they can pull it off. Sometimes sequels are not the best!"
