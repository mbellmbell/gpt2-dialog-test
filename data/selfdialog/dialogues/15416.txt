"__HARRY_POTTER__ I want to go to Hogwarts!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well we passed eleven and it's fictional but we could watch the movies if you want."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Very true. But I still wish it was real."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too, I heard a joke about people who've read the books and watched the movies are Purebloods."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh that is funny, so people who only read the books are Half-bloods?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hilarious! Let's call the people who only watch the movies muggles."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What should we call people who've never done either of them?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How about Deatheaters? They are people that just suck the happiness out of life!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is way too funny. So what about dumb people who hate Harry Potter all together?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Let's call them The Dursleys!"
