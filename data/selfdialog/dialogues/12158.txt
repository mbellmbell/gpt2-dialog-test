"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which LA Team are you rooting for this upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chargers. The Rams are done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Chargers are AFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was back in 1970. They've been NFL since."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Woa. I guess the Rams better get their act together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Coach Fisher got axed last season. That should help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the Chargers' coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chargers coach is Anthony Lynn. He used to play in the American League and he doesn't mess around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which stadium are they going to play at?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, first off, the Chargers only have a 1 year approval to relocate. They are required to negotiate with the Rams on a new stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Rams aren't going anywhere then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're supposed to be joining the Rams at the new Inglewood Stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think an inter-conference game -- Chargers against the Raiders would be awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not so fast, the move has some restrictions. The Chargers won't be able to play road games against the Broncos or the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?!??!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now the Chargers are considered beneficiaries of league scheduling policy. Rules are rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Rams better get their stuff together for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chargers have better fans. They have their own mobile app that streams their games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They could very well take over LA."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Raiders filed paperwork to move to LA too, can you imagine having 2 NFL teams and 1 AFL team in Los Angeles?"
