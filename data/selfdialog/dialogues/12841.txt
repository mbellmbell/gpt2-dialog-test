"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you excited for the upcoming Raiders season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah absolutely! We now have Marshawn Lynch to pick up the slack in the running game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe he came out of retirement to come back and play for us!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't think he was gonna stay idle for long, he still has some left in the tank."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think Beast mode will be a great compliment to the offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Carr no longer has to rely solely on the passing game as he can now just hand it off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just hope that none of these guys get hurt and ruin the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We shall see, nothing we can really do to prevent that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think this is finally our season. I am tired of watching a build up and then fall off from the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's just hope some of the other teams in the west don't make any blockbuster moves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Seattle is still really good, and you can't ever count out Russell Wilson and the Legion of Boom"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they seem to always make the right moves and always stay in the playoff hunt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Arizona Cardinals are always good too. I just don't think Carson Palmer will lead them to the promised land."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think its him we need to worry about. David Johnson had an amazing season and will test teams with his style of play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Goff and the Rams this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should have a bounceback season, but I don't think the Rams will be much of contenders this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone else we should be worried about in our division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, not really. The niners are done for, and with Kapernick's antics, that team is doomed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for this season to start!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. Black and silver all the way!"
