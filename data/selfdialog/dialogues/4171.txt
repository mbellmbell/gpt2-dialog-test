"__MUSIC__ I think that song helped his career tremendously."
"__MUSIC__ Ya he should definitely thank pink."
"__MUSIC__ He should do more than just thanks her, send her a fruit basket, lol."
"__MUSIC__ You know it would be neat if they did a duet version."
"__MUSIC__ That would be cool."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if one exists and we just don't know of it."
"__MUSIC__ It is possible. I love pink."
"__MUSIC__ She is great. I like how tough she is."
