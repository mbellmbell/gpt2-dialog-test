"__MUSIC__ What music do you listen to when you exercise?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, there are many tunes in my jazzersize arsenal!"
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like to begin my exercise time with slow, gentle warm-up music, like a piano or guitar soloist playing elevator music."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't it amazing how elevator music has changed over the years?"
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, when we were young, elevator music was this boring, ancient tunes with a nerve-deadening tempo and complete lack of energy."
"__MUSIC__ The girl from Iwojima?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, something like that. Or maybe some Back concherto in E minor."
"__MUSIC__ Yawn!"
"__MUSIC__ That's right. Made your blood pressure drop 10 points."
"__MUSIC__ Like that hilarious scene from the movie, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'!"
"__MUSIC__ Right! But now, more often than not, I find myself swaying to the elevator music."
"__MUSIC__ Rocking?"
"__MUSIC__ Almost dancing! And one time I found myself singing to myself..."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's not so bad!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah? How would you feel if you were doing the 'Copacabana,' complete with full body cha cha footsteps and head movements to the beat."
"__MUSIC__ SOunds like fun."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but you did not totally embarrass yourself in front of the building receptionist. Soon everyone in the building will know."
"__MUSIC__ It could have been worse. You could have been wearing a feather boa."
