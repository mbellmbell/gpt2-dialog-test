"__MOVIES__ They should re-release older movies."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Can you imagine seeing John Wayne on the big screen in any of his movies."
"__MOVIES__ That would be cool.  I saw Independence Day in theaters when it first came out."
"__MOVIES__ I bet that was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ It was.  Maybe they could re-release it and make it 3D like they did for Titanic."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but they spent money to make Titanic 3D."
"__MOVIES__ True, but I bet it would make money."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think if they re-released the Superman movies with Christopher Reeve or the earlier Batman movies would interest anyone?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the Superman movies would.  However the earlier Batman movies pale in comparison to the ones Christopher Nolan did."
"__MOVIES__ They are good but I thought Michael Keaton made a better Batman and Bruce Wayne."
"__MOVIES__ So, is he your favorite Batman?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so.  I like Adam West in general but his Batman was just.."
"__MOVIES__ Know-it-all dingbat?"
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't going to go that far.  Oh and great pun."
"__MOVIES__ Just thought of it.  Maybe I should have said Holy Dingbat."
"__MOVIES__ What was up with saying holy this and holy that?  He never did that in the movies."
"__MOVIES__ I guess to show how young he was or make him stand out."
"__MOVIES__ Holy lame to the max"
"__MOVIES__ Eh, I'd work on that if I were you."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I should re-watch Batman and Robin.   Remember what real cheesy Batman is like."
