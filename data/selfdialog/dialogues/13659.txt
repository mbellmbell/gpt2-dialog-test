"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you have between the Spurs and Rockets tomorrow?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Spurs all the way, I can't stand Houston."
"__BASKETBALL__ My heart says San Antonio, but my mind says Houston is going to take this series."
"__BASKETBALL__ What makes you say that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Houston offense is just too much for the Spurs. It's too fast and too strong."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the Spurs did win 3 out of 4 during the regular season."
"__BASKETBALL__ The regular season doesn't matter anymore though, the playoffs is its own season."
"__BASKETBALL__ You don't think Kawhi Leonard can outplay James Harden?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe he can, but what about the rest of the team? In the last game, the Rockets were looking like they had too many weapons to stop."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure, but the two games before that were all San Antonio."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true, but as the series goes on, I think the Spurs get more tired. They have some old players."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, but I think there are enough young players that can get minutes and be effective, too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Only if Popovich decides to play them. He is stubborn about going with his veterans."
"__BASKETBALL__ That does frustrate me at times, but he has shown that he knows what he's doing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Anyway, I will be rooting for the Spurs, even if I don't think they'll win. I can't stand Harden."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me either. The NBA really needs to look into how he tries to bait the refs into calling fouls and change the rules this season."
"__BASKETBALL__ That would be nice, but it would be even nicer to have him embarrassed by the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Amen to that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Anyway, whatever happens in this series I still think Golden State will destroy either team in the next round."
"__BASKETBALL__ Unfortunately, I think you're right."
