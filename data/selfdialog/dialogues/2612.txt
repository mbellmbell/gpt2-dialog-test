"__MUSIC__ A talent for music is obviously inherited. Look at the Marsalis family. Look at Bach."
"__MUSIC__ Or families can have family businesses, such as making music, or cars, or muffins. or teaching math, like me and my family."
"__MUSIC__ So? They hand down a family business because what's what the members of that family are good at."
"__MUSIC__ Or because the children of musicians get lessons from the age of three, and are brought up to regard themselves as natural stars."
"__MUSIC__ Or they learn to play with their parents because they have a natural aptitude."
"__MUSIC__ There were many Bachs, but only one J.S. Bach."
"__MUSIC__ People still listen to many of the Bachs"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, most people don't even listen to Bach."
"__MUSIC__ True. But among the people who listen to real music, many choose works from musical families such as the Bachs."
"__MUSIC__ Because Bach is a brand name. It's Bach, it's certified high quality, even if you don't  actually like those icy cascades of abstraction."
"__MUSIC__ That's a whole other question. Music teachers generally have musical children."
"__MUSIC__ Everyone in my family considers themselves musical, and they all play. I am utterly not, and can't. Can't even sing in the shower, unlike you."
"__MUSIC__ I'm talking about tendencies, not certainties. And  you have a musical speaking voice."
"__MUSIC__ That's a whole other question too. A question of taste--stick to the subject."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. You can see that mathematical ability is sometimes inherited."
"__MUSIC__ If you say so."
"__MUSIC__ I do. Science does."
"__MUSIC__ Really? So?"
"__MUSIC__ Everybody also says that music is an application of mathematics."
"__MUSIC__ And that's inherited. So, that's why you want me to bear your child."
