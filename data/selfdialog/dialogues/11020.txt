"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been thinking about NFL referees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Having a pretty exciting day, are you?  I can't even name one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody can, except for the logo guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jim Tunney?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I think he's retired, but what I wanted to say is they are part time workers--work on Sunday and go back to teaching high school math."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So,there's only one game a week--you want them to to work college, high school, and occasional Pop Warner games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very funny, but they could do film study and even promotional events.  As much as the NFL makes, they can afford to pay them for full-time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K. I agree and you probably would get better officiating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and the officiating is so crucial--a holding or pass interference call can determine the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right and speaking of pass interference, the pro rule should be changed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Make it like college--a fifteen yard penalty, not spot foul."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, now there can be a 50 yard penalty on a long pass.  But how do you prevent a defender from tackling a receiver breaking free?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't; if it occasionally happens, it's a 15 yard penalty--no one can predict it would have been a touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right, maybe the quarterback doesn't see that receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or he overthrows him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ O.K--got any other rule changes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the illegal contact rule is tricky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, no touching the receiver after the first five yards--I wish they'd call it consistently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There you go--that's why you want full-time referees."
