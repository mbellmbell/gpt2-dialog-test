"__SUPERHERO__ What is the most unbelievable scene in a superhero movie for you?"
"__SUPERHERO__ For me, it's anything where the human body doesn't crumble under physics: like Iron Man smacking into the ground."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, his insides should be mush after that."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yours?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Everything about the pit in The Dark Knight Rises."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why's that?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, we learned the medical technique of using ropes to repair a broken spine!"
"__SUPERHERO__ That's not all, though."
"__SUPERHERO__ What else?"
"__SUPERHERO__ You can't actually break someone's back like that. It'll hurt but your spine will curve naturally."
