"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey I just saw the NFL draft a few weeks ago. You ready for the season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I am going with my team as always - Washington!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They lost too many players like Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson. They won't be able to replace them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe - but we have some good young players coming up like Josh Doctson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True - and that Kirk Cousins is the man at QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he is good. Hope they can keep him under contract and get him signed long term."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ that would be good for y'all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who you rooting for? I know you like Dallas but..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah I am still a Cowboys fan always. Dak Prescott and Zeke Elliott are the Boys these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah the rookies turned that mess around in Dallas. I'm glad Tony Romo is gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we got an upgrade with Dak - hope he avoids the sophomore slump"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah thats what you have to hope - that he can produce like he did this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I hope I can get to the Dallas / Washington game this year. Tickets are going quick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We should go - you know its going to be a battle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it will be - I am down for going if the tickets aren't super crazy expensive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know they will be - but I will keep my ear to the ground and if I hear of some cheap ones I'll get them so we can go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bet. I would like that a lot. And I will pay you back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am looking forward to the games this season - there is always a new team on top. Like where did the Oakland Raiders come from last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know - I hope its just my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well my team is already there!"
