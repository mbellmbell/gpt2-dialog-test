"__BASKETBALL__ Who is your favorite to win the finals this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Cavaliers will win it all"
"__BASKETBALL__ Really???? I thought you would've been a Warriors fan.  Steph Curry is a beast"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I agree, but I THINK Lebron is too much for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Between Curry, Green, and Thompson, the warriors are unstoppable."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, that's what alot of people said last year when the Warriors lost."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but they didn't have Durant either.  He's going to be the game changer in this series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Durant is a good addition, but I still think the Cavaliers will win."
"__BASKETBALL__ I will definitely be a great series whoever wins, don't you agree?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes I agree.  If the Cavaliers win this year, Lebron will cement himself in history as one of the greats of all time."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true.  Lebron is the best player in the league right now and has been for awhile."
"__BASKETBALL__ The crazy thing is that he's still got some good years left in him."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's the advantage he had coming straight outta high school."
"__BASKETBALL__ I still don't think he will ever be as good as Jordan though."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know about that.  Lebron has already surpassed and broken many of Jordan's records."
"__BASKETBALL__ But Michael Jordan was one-of-a-kind. Lebron never won a dunk competition, never got defensive player of the year, etc."
"__BASKETBALL__ There are alot similarities between the two.  They are both astounding players ."
"__BASKETBALL__ Too bad Lebron never went to college. I would have loved to see him play for a college team"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it would've been nice to see Lebron win a NCAA championship or 2 or 3. lol"
"__BASKETBALL__ At least he has already won 3 NBA championships"
