"__DISNEY__ I want my daughter to see the classic Disney movie, 'Cinderella'."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I think she'll like that. Especially the dancing at the end."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I'm sure she'll like Prince Charming. What do you think she'll say about the mice?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure she will especially like Gus. He's funny."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, he is. Do you remember anything scary in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Not really, just the mean stepmother. Especially when she locks Cinderella in her room."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, I'll have to be sure to watch that part with her."
"__DISNEY__ I think she'll like the movie. However, I'm sure she'll want glass slippers afterwards."
"__DISNEY__ Good point. I better be ready for that."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, get the credit card ready for shoes and dresses!"
