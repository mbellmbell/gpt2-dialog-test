"__STAR_WARS__ In Phantom Menace, what did you think about Darth Maul?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was a good villain but but died too easily. That was a little disappointing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I thought he was going to be the main villain for the whole trilogy so it was a little surprising that he was killed in the first movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ They build him up to be this ultimate fighter and extremely powerful but in the end he wasn't so much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well to be fair he was fighting against two Jedi knights. That's pretty impressive so I'd say he was extremely powerful."
"__STAR_WARS__ He even killed Qui-Gon Jinn who was a Jedi master."
"__STAR_WARS__ He made dumb mistake when he had Obi Wan Kenobi hanging over the pit. He stood there to gloat instead of finishing him off."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it's hard to believe this skilled warrior would do something so stupid, thus allowing Obi Wan to best him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe Darth Maul didn't die."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was cut in half so I think it's safe to say that Darth Maul is dead."
