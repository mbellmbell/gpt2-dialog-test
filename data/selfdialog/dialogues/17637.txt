"__MOVIES__ I want to see the new Blade Runner in IMAX."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that seems like a movie that's definitely worth seeing in IMAX."
"__MOVIES__ There aren't many that I'll spend the extra money on but the shots in the new Blade Runner look so beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely one of those films that you want to just wrap yourself in for the duration of it."
"__MOVIES__ The only things I've seen in IMAX are Avatar and Captain America: Civil War."
"__MOVIES__ Why did you see Civil War in IMAX?"
"__MOVIES__ Friends wanted to go and I figured seeing all these heroes clash on a screen like that would be cool."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it, I thought it was definitely worth seeing in IMAX."
"__MOVIES__ I imagine the airport scene was quite the sight to behold."
"__MOVIES__ Oh it was, seeing all of them make their entraces, including Spider-Man was a spectacle."
"__MOVIES__ I want to see The Last Jedi in IMAX."
"__MOVIES__ Any kind of science fiction romp would be beautiful to see on that screen."
"__MOVIES__ Let's make a deal then, we will see the final Star Wars movie in the new trilogy in IMAX."
"__MOVIES__ You have yourself a deal, that will certainly be an event."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah one of those releases that is worth the extra cash on pedigree alone."
"__MOVIES__ Those don't happen often, usually it's a compromise."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah movies being seen on pedigree alone is a lot less common."
"__MOVIES__ Even respected directors like Ridley Scott are pumping out garbage these days."
"__MOVIES__ Please don't remind me that he has a Gladiator sequel in the works."
