"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey what team do you support in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love my Redskins, I've been a fan since birth!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Redskins?! Their front office is a total wreck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, its honestly embarrassing. But I believe in Kirk!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats fair, Kirk Cousins is a great QB. Completely honestly though, I much prefer Matt Ryan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a falcons fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I am a proud Falcons supporter!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That Superbowl must have been really rough, I thought you guys were going to win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I was really hurt. But this season I just have a good feeling about them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will be playing with a chip on their shoulder thats for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Plus they have a new stadium, which should give them some motivation as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it looks really nice! And they have the lowest beer prices in the country which is awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bought tickets to go to the new stadium when the Falcons play the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That will be a great game! Drew Brees is getting older but hes still awesome. He just needs more pieces around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats very true, he cant carry the team anymore like he used to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I think the best QB in the league will be Brady again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's the ageless wonder, I don't know how he does it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might honestly be the greatest QB of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't doubt that, although I'd through in an argument for Dan Marino."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The man never won a superbowl but I can see why you are saying that."
