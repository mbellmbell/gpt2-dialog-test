"__STAR_WARS__ There were three large battle stations in the main Star Wars movies. Which would were you the most interested in?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Let's see there was the orginal Death Star, then a rebuilt Death Star under construction, and then the Starkiller Base in The Force awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's a common thing in the Star Wars universe. Which of those three was your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well obviously the Starkiller Base was the most powerful but as far as which one was the most entertaining in the movies, I'm going to say the original Death Star from Episode Four."
"__STAR_WARS__ What makes that one better than the other two?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I'm going more by the story and not the Death Star itself."
"__STAR_WARS__ Personally, I would say that Starkiller Base is my favorite. It was amazing and powerful, plus the lightsaber duel between Kylo Ren and Rey took place there."
"__STAR_WARS__ True but in the original you had Hav, Luke, Chewie, R2D2, and C3PO on their rescue mission to save Leia. That was a really good section of the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right, that sequence is one of the more memorable ones in the Star Wars series."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's also where Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader met again and had a duel. The first Death Star was the best."
