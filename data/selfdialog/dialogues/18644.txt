"__MOVIES__ What's the funniest movie you've seen in recent years?"
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't stop laughing during '21 Jump Street.'"
"__MOVIES__ That's a great choice.  I didn't think Channing Tatum would be so good in a comedic role."
"__MOVIES__ He's really leaned into it in recent years.  Now I see him in so many similar roles."
"__MOVIES__ He and Jonah Hill were a great comedy duo.  I loved that the movie's vision of modern day high school was so accurate."
"__MOVIES__ You're right.  I never liked that high school movies in the 90s and 2000s keep playing on the jock-nerd bullying trope."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, no one gets stuffed in lockers anymore."
"__MOVIES__ The popular kids in the movie focusing on college and grades was way more accurate in terms of our own high school experiences."
"__MOVIES__ The dialogue was also perfect."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ The sequel was fun too.  Definitely more meta than the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ The end-credits sequence with the fake movie promos was my favorite part."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that.  Who knew the end-credits of a movie could be that entertaining?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I laughed that much since 'Pineapple Express.'"
"__MOVIES__ Now THAT, was an underrated movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's probably because it came out in theaters around the same time as 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall.'"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  That's rough, because 'Pineapple Express' was way better."
"__MOVIES__ James Franco was another surprise comedic actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, you wouldn't assume he'd be that funny because he's in such serious roles."
"__MOVIES__ It demonstrates his range as an actor."
