"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch the movie called Major Payne?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have, starring Damon Wayans right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he played that ROTC major that was helping those kids win the military games."
"__MOVIES__ Yes,that movie is so funny. I just watched it the other day."
"__MOVIES__ I have not seen that movie in at least 15 years or so."
"__MOVIES__ That was the last time I saw it too up until a few days ago."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot a lot about the movie, did you find it as funny as you did when you were a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and I understood it a little better now that I am older as well."
"__MOVIES__ The little kids in it are funny too."
"__MOVIES__ Especially the little boy who is only 5. He is a riot!"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the end where they are at the military games, and they do the dances with their rifles."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed that part as well, and when Major Payne made them be in the rain and mud."
"__MOVIES__ I need to see it again, it has been so long!"
"__MOVIES__ I think it has been playing on tv, I can't remember which channel though."
"__MOVIES__ I think the movie has a good moral to it."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, the ending was really good."
"__MOVIES__ I do not remember the ending much."
"__MOVIES__ Well then, you need to watch it again!"
"__MOVIES__ It is worth the watch, I am going to see if I can find it on TV."
