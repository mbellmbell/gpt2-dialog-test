"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been watching the NBA playoffs this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sort of, but it hasn't been very interesting yet."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know.  The Celtics might as well just stay home."
"__BASKETBALL__ They must be dreading the next game.  How embarrassing!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I used to really like watching the Celtics back when Larry Byrd played.  I guess that was 30 years ago or more."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too because my ex-husband was a huge Celtics fan. His whole family loved anything IRISH!"
"__BASKETBALL__ The NBA seemed so much more interesting back then.  Have we changed or has the NBA changed?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, I know my love for sports hasn't changed, so maybe it's the NBA."
"__BASKETBALL__ That was back when the OTHER Isaiah Thomas played for the Pistons. But I think his name was spelled differently."
"__BASKETBALL__ But I heard he IS named after the Pistons' Isaiah. I think because his father lost a bet or something like that, and then his mother changed the spelling."
"__BASKETBALL__ I got interested in the NBA again last year when I saw Seth Curry making so many 3 pointers. I would tune in just to see how many he made."
"__BASKETBALL__ He definitely made it entertaining."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess it will be Golden State and the Cavaliers again this year in the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're right.  If not I would be shocked."
"__BASKETBALL__ Which team would you want to win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess I would want Golden State this year.  I'm getting a little bored with LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ He sure is great though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Really I just hope they are good games.  I miss the old days when I really cared!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am going to watch the next Celtics game.  I'm just curious if they can even compete."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's kind of like watching a train wreck!"
