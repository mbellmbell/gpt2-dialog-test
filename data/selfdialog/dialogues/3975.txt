"__MUSIC__ Did you see that the new Fleet Foxes album came out a few days ago?"
"__MUSIC__ What's it called, 'Fool's Errand'?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, that's actually just a song on the record. It's called 'Crack-Up.'"
"__MUSIC__ So, what are your thoughts on the album? What's different?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's still very quintessentially Fleet Foxes. You wouldn't mistake it for anyone else."
"__MUSIC__ Does that mean they've grown? Or 'Helplessness Blues' all over again?"
"__MUSIC__ To me, it's an even more ambitious project, trying for more emotional range. You get it all here."
"__MUSIC__ Is it electronic-y or all hushed folk music?"
"__MUSIC__ See, that's the thing. They're trying to combine it all. I'd say it mostly works."
"__MUSIC__ ...but doesn't all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Like the title track, for instance. It starts with this super mumbling choir sound. Then peaks into full on Fleet Foxes."
"__MUSIC__ And you think it's a little jarring? I read that in a review, too."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, was that in Prefix Magazine? I read that too."
"__MUSIC__ It was. The author compared the quieter moments in the song to 'deep ruts in an otherwise flat country road.'"
"__MUSIC__ That's a totally fitting analogy. There's all these moments that are just like, 'huh, that's a curious artistic choice.'"
"__MUSIC__ What do you think is the strongest song on the album?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say 'Kept Woman.' It's classic Fleet Foxes with really floaty, poetic lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ The kind of song to start a Sunday morning?"
"__MUSIC__ Spot on. Or the last thing you hear on a Friday night."
"__MUSIC__ Pull up Spotify! Let's give the album a spin."
