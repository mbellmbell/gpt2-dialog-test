"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that, what songs has she done?"
"__MUSIC__ She's had a bunch of songs, but I don't think any were major hits."

"__MUSIC__ She actually did a duet with Elvis, it's called Don't Cry Daddy"
"__MUSIC__ I will have to check that out, I've never heard of it!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to keep thinking about what song I want to use for our dance, but I do know that I want Sugar by Maroon 5 played!"
