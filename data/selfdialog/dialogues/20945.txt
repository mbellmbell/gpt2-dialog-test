"__THRILLER__ Are any new thriller or horror movies coming out this week?"
"__THRILLER__ No not this week."
"__THRILLER__ Well that's a bummer."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah but that new movie Death Pool came out last week I think."
"__THRILLER__ And what is that movie about?"
"__THRILLER__ I want to say that a young kid almost drowns to death during his childhood and when he gets older he has flashbacks of the event and he turns into a serial killer."
"__THRILLER__ Well that sounds dramatic."
"__THRILLER__ Ya I know. But hey, it does sound pretty exciting."
"__THRILLER__ Do you want to go see it with me sometime this weekend?"
"__THRILLER__ Sounds good."
