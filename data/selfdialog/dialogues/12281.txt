"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, there are a lot of good teams in the NFL now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, many have a shot. Some of the same ones and some new ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, theres a few teams lately that think they can win with just defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I know exactly who you are thinking of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Denver and Houston. What are they doing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, I know defense is important, but you need a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, can you tell those teams that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, especially Houston. I mean, I guess they tried and struck out with Osweiler, didn't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, the joke is on them for that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that was one smart decision that the Broncos made. Letting him walk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that was one contract there were fortunate enough to not have given out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that was a tough one. Not a good deal for Houston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yea and now they still have to find a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! Its hard to win without one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, even with that stellar defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, thats not usually enough if you do not have a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Denver won it all with subpar quarterback play, but that was still Payton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly! At least he still brought something to the table."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he had leadership qualities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that goes a long way toward winning as well."
