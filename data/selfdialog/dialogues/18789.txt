"__MOVIES__ So what did you think about that new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Dead Men Tell No Tales was pretty good, although I thought that the series had been going on for a bit long."
"__MOVIES__ To be fair the last one was released in 2011, 6 years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Still, when you think about it the series has just been going on for a very long time now."
"__MOVIES__ Johnny Depp does a good job in it though, you have to admit."
"__MOVIES__ He does!  I actually only really watched the latest one because of him; he fits the character perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Javier Bardem in it, too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he's the main villain.  I loved him in No Country for Old Men."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that one yet.  It's a Coen brothers movie, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup.  It's a slow one too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm not sure how well I would do with a slower movie."
"__MOVIES__ Some people like the bombastic stuff that Michael Bay puts out, but I think having a slow burn is much better."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any other movies that have come out lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder Woman just came out today!"
"__MOVIES__ Ah, are you interested in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm unsure to be honest.  That universe of movies hasn't really grabbed my attention yet, but the trailers have looked awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Really I would just want to watch it for Robin Wright."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I loved her in House of Cards.  i'm just concerned because of previous movies like Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, those ones were not so good at all."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think that Zach Snyder kind of ruined the nice story that Batman v Superman would have had."
