"__MUSIC__ So I am putting my son in music therapy."
"__MUSIC__ Music therapy, I didn't know that was a thing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there are different kinds even, this course is just supposed to help with anxiety."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like holistic hippy stuff though."
"__MUSIC__ It has science behind it and if you use a trained professional, results can be pretty amazing."
"__MUSIC__ So do they just like, have him listen to music?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, yes, but while doing other things, and the music itself is special, they don't just turn the radio on."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, interesting, honestly though, I'm not too convinced."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it doesn't always work, but at this point we'll try anything to help him, and I don't see how it could hurt"
"__MUSIC__ I guess if you think about it, we do use music as our own therapy in a way."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and it can make you feel great emotions, so why not try to capture and control that response?"
"__MUSIC__ Good point. You will have to let me know how it works."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he starts Monday then it's twice a week, plus exercises at home too."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, for how long?"
"__MUSIC__ As long as it's effective, they can keep changing the part of his life they are targeting."
"__MUSIC__ So he could do this forever?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe not through a paid therapist, but yeah, why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I don't know, I just think it sounds exhausting to start something you will never get to stop."
"__MUSIC__ But it's music, it's not like a rough and bad therapy."
"__MUSIC__ I guess."
