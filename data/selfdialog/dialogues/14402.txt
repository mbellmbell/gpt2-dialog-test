"__HORROR__ Ok, so horror flicks.  What's your favorite?"
"__HORROR__ Got to be Nightmare on Elm Street. All of them."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I really liked the first one.  Thought Freddy Kruger was real creepy."
"__HORROR__ What is your favorite?"
"__HORROR__ Oh, I'm more of a horror of the mind kind of guy.  Like Hannibal and the Wolfman."
"__HORROR__ Anthony Hopkins kind of stuff."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, horror but makes you think too.  Another one is The Rite."
"__HORROR__ Seen that.  It's pretty intense. Keeps you on the edge of your seat."
"__HORROR__ That's the kind I like.  Where you are biting your nails but still trying to figure just what's going on."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, but still nothing like a big old clawed hand coming at you."
