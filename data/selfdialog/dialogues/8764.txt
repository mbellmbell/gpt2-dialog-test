"__BEATLES__ So, it's crazy, my boyfriend said he doesn't like the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ Wait, are you serious? How can you not like the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ I know, I asked him the same thing."
"__BEATLES__ What did he say?"
"__BEATLES__ I guess he said it's because they played the song Yellow Submarine a lot at one of his jobs and he just got tired of it."
"__BEATLES__ I guess I can see that. That song could get annoying, but what about the other songs?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm not sure. I think maybe he just doesn't like them because he thinks they're over-rated."
"__BEATLES__ Well, they are pretty great, but I guess people do kind of worship them."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah that's true. Good thing they're not my favorite band or something."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I hope my future boyfriend likes the Beatles!"
