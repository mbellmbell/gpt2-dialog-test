"__HARRY_POTTER__ Did you see the first Harry Potter movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I did, I thought it was good but probably the weakest one."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can see that.  But you have to start simple in a series, after all they were just kids."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah I know.  I still like it, just not as much as the later movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was pretty cool how they hid Voldy in that guys turban."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah that was pretty amazing, I would have never even expected that in a million years."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And that guy acted like such a putz the whole time.  Turns out he was much smarter than anyone let on."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, and a lot stronger."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It also shows how wizards are seduced by Voldy and his promises."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And that there are plenty of enemies waiting in the winds."
