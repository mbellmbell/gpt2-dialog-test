"__MOVIES__ Outside of The Godfather Parts 1, 2, and 3, what's the best mob movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ That's easy. Goodfellas. Best mob movie of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Outside of the Godfather movies, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Naturally.  No mob movie does what Goodfellas does. It shows why it's enticing to be in the mob."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it kind of busted the myth of the mob living wealthy."
"__MOVIES__ 'I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup. I'm an average nobody.'"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, I love that quote. 'For us to live any other way was nuts.' But, man, there was no movie like it a the time. It set the new standard for mob pictures. For crime pictures."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was so fast paced. It moved at breakneck speed."
"__MOVIES__ But what really made the movie, what really made it so memorable, was the narration."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god, Ray Liotta. Wall to wall narration."
"__MOVIES__ It all goes back to the writing and directing.  Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese. Brilliant."
"__MOVIES__ They worked on 12 drafts together, starting with Pileggi's book."
"__MOVIES__ One thing the speed of the movie did . . . it moved so quickly that we and even Henry Hill didn't realize how deep he was in things until it was too late."
"__MOVIES__ How about how Joe Pesci turns from funny mob lightweight to total psychopath?"
"__MOVIES__ That was brilliant, too. Easy to argue that Pesci stole the movie his performance was so brilliant."
"__MOVIES__ We've not even mentioned DeNiro."
"__MOVIES__ My good! He was great. And a connection to The Godfather."
"__MOVIES__ But again the breakneck speed. At the end, when Henry Hill was on speed, it's like the movie was out of control."
"__MOVIES__ It think I was actually sweating at that point. Can we agree this is the best mob movie every?"
"__MOVIES__ Totally. Best ever. Outside of The Godfather Parts 1, 2, and 3."
