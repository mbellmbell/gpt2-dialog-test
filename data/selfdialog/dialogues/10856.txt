"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey do you watch football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yes, I love Manchester United."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I mean American football, not soccer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, well we call our game 'football' in England, not 'soccer.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well do you want me to explain American football to you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, go ahead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, despite the name 'football' only the punter and kicker really kick the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whats the difference between the punter and the kicker?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the kicker kicks field goals and the punter punts the ball to the other team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is a field goal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When a team kicks the ball through the big yellow uprights they get three points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see. Why does the punter punt the ball to the other team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well if the team with the ball doesn't advance it 10 yards in 3 tries they can either punt it to the other team or try again to get the needed yardage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why don't they try again every time instead of punting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they don't make it on the fourth try the other team gets better field position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's field position?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a measure of how close a team is to the end zone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the end zone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the other way to score, if you bring the ball to the end zone it's a touchdown worth 6 points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That seems a lot more complicated than our football!"
