"__MOVIES__ Since most people have, I assume you saw Deadpool from last year?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely saw it in the theaters and I enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Some friends and I went and saw it, as well. Were you a fan of the comics?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually was not and not very familiar with the DeadPool character at all."
"__MOVIES__ Same here, actually. The only thing I remember seeing from DeadPool was his brief role in the X-men movie back in 2009."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I remember that, too and was not too impressed."
"__MOVIES__ I remember going last year with my friends with an open-mind. I didn't even it was rated R."
"__MOVIES__ Same here! Once the credits started rolling and the jokes began, I had an idea of what kind of a movie it was going to be."
"__MOVIES__ I think so many people enjoyed it, because it's simply something different."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely agree with that. It's not your typical super hero movie and is very funny."
"__MOVIES__ The movie was just fine and you can't help but love Deadpool. I also liked the fourth-wall breaking throughout."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. Ryan Reynolds definitely reedemed himself!"
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite scene or funny line?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually loved the scene where it's a cutting to different parts of him looking for Francis."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was great. The part where he is interrogating Jeremy, the pizza boy, was real funny, too."
"__MOVIES__ I think, as a whole, it was an all-ground enjoyable movie."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the trailer for the sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the teaser, yes, where he takes forever in the phone booth?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think the sequel will live up to the original?"
"__MOVIES__ I definitely hope so but all we can do is wait and see."
