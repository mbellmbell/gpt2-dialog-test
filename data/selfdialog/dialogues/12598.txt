"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that head trauma is a serious issue in NFL football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but maybe overstated?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overstated in what way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, these players know what they are getting in to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But we only recently had the technology and understanding to be aware of these issues."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I somewhat agree. They still get millions of dollars per year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is true, but is it worth it if you can't walk at age 45?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a good point - does that take away from the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes and no - I just think we need to take more preventative measures."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully they can increase padding and teach more fundamentally sound diving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see - both of those would be nice options."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it may take years, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think a solution would be to obviously encourage less head-based collisions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, but they already do that to an extent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but perhaps not enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe the referees could be even more strict."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that would help some."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They already do so much though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the issues of head injuries will continue to plague the modern NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it will - but it is beautiful nonetheless."
