"__HORROR__ Did you like The Ring?"
"__HORROR__ American or Japanese?"
"__HORROR__ American. We all know the Japanese originals are superior."
"__HORROR__ Of course. And yes, I really liked it."
"__HORROR__ I couldn't buy Naomi Watts in it. She was irritating."
"__HORROR__ Point taken. But Samara was awesomely creepy."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, is that where she crawled out of the screen?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, but that's not what bugged me the most."
"__HORROR__ What part was?"
