"__BASKETBALL__ So what happened with the dream team?"
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you mean? What happened with it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess I mean why was it such a big deal?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh. it was a big deal because it was the first time professional athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics."
"__BASKETBALL__ That kinda goes against the spirit of the olympics."
"__BASKETBALL__ Says the losers."
"__BASKETBALL__ No. The Olympics has always been a forum for dedicated amateur athletes."
"__BASKETBALL__ Says the losers. And no, Olympic athletes have national, corporate, and other supports. How is a professional athlete any different. they just make money"
"__BASKETBALL__ Anyway the dream team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ahh yes, the dream team. They won every game by an average of 44 points over their opponents. an din the finals they beat Croatia by 117 to 85."
"__BASKETBALL__ That seems reasonable seeing as how they're pros"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep. In the 1988 Olyimpics, we only took 3rd place, because we sent in college kids. To play against national teams from all over the world. Now that's what's unfair."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well our national team made up of college kids still got the support they needed, I bet."
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ So it WAS fair."
"__BASKETBALL__ No it wasn't, Because we weren't allowed to send in our best."
"__BASKETBALL__ So... Unless you send in your best, it's not fair for you. Is that it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's exactly how it is."
"__BASKETBALL__ So who was the best player on the team?"
"__BASKETBALL__ So get this, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Larry Byrd, Patrick Ewing, Scotty PIppen, Clyde Dexter, Christian Laettner, Chris Mullens, Karl Malone, And David Robinson all played 8 games. of all of them Barkley had the highest FGM stat at 59. HIs percentage was the highest too. 0.711."
