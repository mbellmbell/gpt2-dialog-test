"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song from a Stephen Sondheim musical?"
"__MUSIC__ Does it have to be a musical in which he wrote the music and lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I guess not."
"__MUSIC__ Then I'd say 'Tonight' from West Side Story. I think it's beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ It is beautiful. I prefer the songs with really clever lyrics, though."
"__MUSIC__ Such as?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard 'Getting Married Today' from Company?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so."
"__MUSIC__ It's sung by a woman on her wedding day. It's all the reasons she's NOT getting married today."
"__MUSIC__ I'll look for it. Isn't Company the one with 'Ladies Who Lunch'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. It's probaby the most famous song from that show."
"__MUSIC__ I saw somebody sing that a long, long time ago on Johnny Carson's show."
"__MUSIC__ Another great song from Company is 'Another Hundred People.' It's about all the people who move to and live in New York City."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, then I definitely want to hear that one. I like the music from 'A Little Night Music'."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's a beautiful set of songs. It has what is probably Sondheim's most famous song--'Send in the Clowns'."
"__MUSIC__ Most of the songs are waltzes, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. It has some songs with clever lyrics, too. Remember 'Now/Later/Soon'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! That's the one where the father, his new wife, and his son take turns singing about their frustrations."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but getting back to West Side Story. My favorite song when I first heard the album (as a kid) was 'Gee, Office Krupke.'"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Did you understand the lyrics?"
