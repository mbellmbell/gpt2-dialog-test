"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I finally saw the movie La La Land."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ About time. What did you think?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do you mean what did I think of the plot, the music or the whole thing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well tell me what you liked or didn't like about the movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It wasn't what I expected after all the hype"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like how?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I thought it was going to be like a modern take on an old fashioned movie musical."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There was a lot of music. I liked a couple of the songs a lot."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I didn't HATE La La Land. It's fun. It's cute but I don't think it compares to a good movie musical."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ In a good movie musical, you can take away all the songs and dances and it will still be a great story with great dialogue and performances."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I see what your saying. Like Grease, Chicago, West Side Story-the classics."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Exactly, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were very good, but I wanted more."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ More what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ More development in the characters, better dancing....I kept waiting for the next dance scene, more connection between the main characters."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, did you like the music?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I did actually, especially the song Audition and City of Stars"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What did you think of the La La Land theme music. I thought that was cool."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, I do like that too and I really liked how it looked-the cinematography? Gorgeous."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I know what you mean-  it was dream like sort of like dreamy vintage postcards of LA"
