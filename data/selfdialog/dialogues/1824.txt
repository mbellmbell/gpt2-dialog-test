"__MUSIC__ Hey have you head of Lil Dicky?"
"__MUSIC__ What who in the world is that?"
"__MUSIC__ He is a comedian but he is also a really good song writer and rapper."
"__MUSIC__ Really what kind of stuff does he rap about?"
"__MUSIC__ All sorts of stuff. Some of it is really funny since he is a comedian and other times the songs are more serious."
"__MUSIC__ Well what is one of his funny songs about?"
"__MUSIC__ He raps about saving money. Which is hilarious for a rapper to talk about."
"__MUSIC__ That does sound really funny. Does he make music videos too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes he does. That song I just told you about is call Save Dat Money and his YouTube video for it is really funny."
"__MUSIC__ What is so funny about the video?"
"__MUSIC__ He walks around asking people to barrow their house and boat and things like that to shoot his video."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow this guy really does sound funny. I will have to look him up."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and like I said he does some other stuff too. Not all of it is funny."
"__MUSIC__ Well what is another song that I can look up that is more serious?"
"__MUSIC__ He has a song called Molly. It is about the love of his life and how he lost her because of his career."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm that sounds a little too corny but I will look it up."
"__MUSIC__ No it is actually really well written and the lyrics are great. It is surprisingly one of my favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, you talked me more into I will look that song up as well."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome. There is a music video for that song as well. Just YouTube him and you will find all his songs."
"__MUSIC__ Okay cool. I will let you know what I think once I looked him up. I have been wanting to listen to some new music."
