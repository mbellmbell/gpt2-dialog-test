"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the live version of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ No I have not seen it yet."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was great but still like the animated version better."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Where there a lot of differences in the two?"
"__DISNEY__ Just a slight few, nothing too major I thought."
"__DISNEY__ Who plays Belle again in the live version?"
"__DISNEY__ Belle was played by Emma Watson."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, she seems like a perfect fit for the part."
"__DISNEY__ If you have a chance to see it I would recommend it, I think you will enjoy the Beast who is quite handsome."
"__DISNEY__ I think I will have to rent it although I hear it is quite long so I need to free up some time."
