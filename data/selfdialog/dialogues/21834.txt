"__DISNEY__ So I finally saw Milan today."
"__DISNEY__ For the first time in forever!"
"__DISNEY__ Wrong movie, dude."
"__DISNEY__ I know, I was joking around."
"__DISNEY__ Anyway, it was okay.  I think it's the last time I remember Eddie Murphy in anything."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he hasn't exactly done much lately, has he?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought the movie was pretty good, a bit violent in parts."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I disagree.  It wasn't violent at all."
"__DISNEY__ We just have different tastes, I guess."
"__DISNEY__ Or you're just over-reacting to a cartoon."
