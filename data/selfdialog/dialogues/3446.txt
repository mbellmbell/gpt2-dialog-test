"__MUSIC__ You ever think it's weird that so many Disney channel stars can sing?"
"__MUSIC__ What, you mean like Miley Cyrus? Wasn't that the whole point?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, but I mean like the others that were just actors at first, like Selena Gomez."
"__MUSIC__ She was the chick on Wizards, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and then Demi Lovato too. They were originally meant to be just actors, I thought."
"__MUSIC__ And Hillary Duff was an actress too, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and she sang. I wonder if it was just an accident or if they did that on purpose?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but I'm a huge fan of Demi."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Her old stuff or her new stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ New; I haven't really heard much of her old stuff."
"__MUSIC__ She got big when I was in high school, so I listened to a lot of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ Which one was your favourite?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I was a big fan of Don't Forget back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, a classic break up song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, super angsty and cliche, I know. But I liked it."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, wasn't she on Camp Rock?"
"__MUSIC__ Dude, I totally forgot about that!"
"__MUSIC__ She sang in that, right? So they must have known she could sing."
"__MUSIC__ I really liked the acoustic version of her song, too. What was it called?"
"__MUSIC__ 'This is Me,' I think. I'll pull it up now."
