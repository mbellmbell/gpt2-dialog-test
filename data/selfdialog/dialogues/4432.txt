"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite type of music?"
"__MUSIC__ For me it's classical."
"__MUSIC__ How can you listen to that stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a beautiful genre, it can express more feelings than any other genre can."
"__MUSIC__ What are you talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ The point of classical is that the music is what tells you the story."
"__MUSIC__ I never understood that."
"__MUSIC__ You just need to embrace the melody and open your mind."
"__MUSIC__ It's easier just hearing the words someone wants to say."
"__MUSIC__ That's the problem right there?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean that's the problem?"
"__MUSIC__ Words are limited to those that understand their meaning about a specific intent."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's how words generally work."
"__MUSIC__ And that is why they are limiting."
"__MUSIC__ You really aren't making sense."
"__MUSIC__ Well depending how you hear the music, one song can have many meanings."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not getting what you're talking about, sound is sound."
"__MUSIC__ Like with me, if I hear Bach when I'm happy, it's uplifting, inspiring; but, if I'm sad then it mirrors my emotional state and allows me to grieve."
"__MUSIC__ That seems like a lot to ask from a piece of music."
"__MUSIC__ It's all about how you listen to it, I'll show you, let me play you a piece by Vivaldi."
