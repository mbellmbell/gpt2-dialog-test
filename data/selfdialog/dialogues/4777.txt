"__MUSIC__ I cannot believe you are listening to that Barry Manilow music again."
"__MUSIC__ What can I say, his music was the soundtrack to my youth. He has an impressive play list."
"__MUSIC__ I have to admit when I hear those songs played back to back he did stack up an large amount of hits."
"__MUSIC__ He really did. I think he is very under appreciated."
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite song or do you simply love all of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Boy that is a hard one. I loved Weekend In New England and Somewhere in the Night."
"__MUSIC__ Those were pretty. I preferred Elton John and Neil Diamond from that time period."
"__MUSIC__ They have great tunes too. I loved some of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Music is so different now. I wonder if a song like Forever in Blue Jeans would be a hit these days."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. The three of them have created some classics for sure."
"__MUSIC__ I think Elton John has done a decent job of staying on top of trends. I think he has a few more hits in him."
"__MUSIC__ He may, I would love to see him do a duet with someone more current."
"__MUSIC__ I really like his duet with Celine. Now there is a woman who can hit a note."
"__MUSIC__ That is a fact. I can live without ever hearing My Heart Will Go On again, but man, can she belt out a song."
"__MUSIC__ I do have several of her albums. They are pretty timeless if you ask me."
"__MUSIC__ I agree 100%. A person who can sing with that kind of tone and range will never go out of style."
"__MUSIC__ She still has a beautiful voice. I don't like her quite as much as Lady Gaga but she is close."
"__MUSIC__ Lady Gaga is much better to dance to or do a workout to. I love the beats in her music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but some of her songs, once played, keep repeating in my brain over and over."
"__MUSIC__ She sure does know how to create a hook. I will never tire of her music."
