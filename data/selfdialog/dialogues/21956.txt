"__DISNEY__ I can't believe they are releasing another Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ I thought the last one was the final one?"
"__DISNEY__ Nope!  They are making another one.  It's coming out next year."
"__DISNEY__ What could the storyline possibly be?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it's about how Woody and Bo Beep fall in love."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, okay.  I guess that's alright.  Still, I think they need to just end it."
"__DISNEY__ I know!  It's hard to believe the first one was out when I was a kid."
"__DISNEY__ It's crazy to think about several generations of people loving the same franchise."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that's how you know a movie is really great."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it's has a timeless quality to it."
