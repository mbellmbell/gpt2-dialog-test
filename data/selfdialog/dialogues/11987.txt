"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A good ground game is still critical. Just not in vogue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't know...look at the Patriots and the Falcons. Both teams have fantastic ground games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not everyone is Zeke and not everyone has Cowboys O-line, though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see in four or five years if he is still around"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The shelf lives of RB's may have gone down, but Zeke has shown backs can still do more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just because Zeke was an exception to the rule doesn't mean the rule still isn't true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gurley went in the top 10 the year before and that was too high."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok...that's only one"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Trent Richardson went in the top 3 in 2012 and that's just downright laughable now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Forgot about him..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lol. Good one"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everything goes in cycles..... running backs fell out of favor over the past decade."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Zeke is special player.  Yes, he has benefited for excellent line play, but if you don't take advantage of your opportunities you don't become special."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a special player though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup...he the only reason I watch Dallas play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. And I hate Dallas"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell them how you really feel man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ HAHAHAHAHA Yep."
