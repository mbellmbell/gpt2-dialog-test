"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL preseason is almost here! Who do you think is the best kicker in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there are lots of underrated kickers and punters in the NFL, but some of my favorites are Mason Crosby and the punter Johnny Hekker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mason Crosby had a really good year last year, he led the Green Bay Packers to a couple of close wins!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's hard to believe a few years back the Packers were considering getting rid of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read that Mike McCarthy designed a performance based contract for him the following year and something about that help set him straight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Incentive based contracts for kickers are pretty tough to design, since they don't determine how often they are on the field, but they do help the player get focused."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's too bad Green Bay couldn't have done that with their punter, it seems like a revolving door of punters there the last few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know they had Masthay forever, but then they brought in competition at camp and ended up keeping Schum."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't seem like they improved much on special teams, but luckily, Crosby didn't mind him as a holder for kicks, so it wasn't that disruptive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the way those NFL kickers and punters practice, I'm not surprised that they eventually got into a good rhythm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think that's why Johnny Hekker is so productive for the Rams, consistency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also has a heck of a leg and can really move the ball down the field, as well as do some crazy directional kicking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably why he was selected to be the punter at the Pro Bowl last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is definately one of those guys in the league that stands out in a good way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've seen him in games completely flip the field and get good position for the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder why it didn't lead to many Rams wins last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that was a product of bad coaching on the part of Fisher."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It wasn't all Fisher's fault, they had not one consistent quarterback on the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jared Goff is the future of that franchise, but the jury is still out on how the future will shape up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He just needs to be able to ignore the pressure and execute the game plan, because her can throw."
