"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite music genre?"
"__MUSIC__ I will listen to pretty much anything except for probably heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ You even like classical?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes. If I'm in the right mood for it, I'll listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I was not expecting that answer!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I played a lot of instruments so I have an appreciation for what goes in to composing and playing classical music."
"__MUSIC__ That's understandable. I don't really care for it, but then again, I really only like pop music."
"__MUSIC__ That's sad! You need to expland your horizons."
"__MUSIC__ Pop isn't that bad."
"__MUSIC__ Some of it is okay. Who is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Of all the pop singers out right now, I'd have to say Lady Gaga."
"__MUSIC__ I like her too. There are just so many younger pop artists now that I really don't care for."
"__MUSIC__ Who?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara, and Ariana Grande are a few that come to mind."
"__MUSIC__ I love all of them. I just can't help it!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, to each his own I guess. I will say though that I thought what Ariana Grade did for Manchester was amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, she really showed a lot of maturity. What are your thoughts on Miley?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't really care for her as a country artist and I don't really care for her as a pop artist either. I just don't think she has the best voice."
"__MUSIC__ I just think it is interesting to see how much her music as evolved."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. She's really managed to cover several genres since she started."
