"__BASEBALL__ Did you hear that Toles is out for the Dodgers."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I heard he tore his ACL."
"__BASEBALL__ It looks like Cody Bellinger will get more playing time."
"__BASEBALL__ Is he any good?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's been mashing so far since he was called up last month."
"__BASEBALL__ How's his D?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not sure. He was mostly a first baseman in the minors, but the Dodgers are using him in the outfield."
"__BASEBALL__ That doesn't always work out too well."
"__BASEBALL__ Nah, he'll figure it out. He's still young. I'm not too concerned."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, maybe. What about Yasiel? He got off to a hot start, now he sucks again."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. I can't figure that guy out."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe they should trade him."
"__BASEBALL__ His trade value is pretty low right now. I'd stick with him for now."
"__BASEBALL__ Would be nice if we could get something for him. We need a second baseman."
"__BASEBALL__ We get Forsythe back soon."
"__BASEBALL__ He's not that good!"
"__BASEBALL__ He can play man! He's a great defender."
"__BASEBALL__ Overrated. Check out his UZR."
"__BASEBALL__ Man, I don't trust the metrics."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm telling you, he's totally overrated. We need Cano!"
