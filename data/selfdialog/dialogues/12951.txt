"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what team are you backing next season for NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm backing the Seahawks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didnt expect you were the type of person to jump on a bandwagon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No offense but I feel like over the past few years everyone who doesn't know much about football is hopping on the Seahawks train"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone likes the underdog! What do you have against them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have nothing against them. I think they're doing well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Keep in mind as well that I may not be from Seattle, but I am from the northwest. Seahawks is pretty much all we have over here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe that's why I don't like them. My team is the 49ers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the San Francisco 49ers are a bit of the hawks' rivals at this point, because of that whole mess with the coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been to any of the games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle is nowhere near close to me so unfortunatley not. I hope to one day though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure. Seahawks fans seem to be some of the most passionate in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We are for sure! We have a world record to prove it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We are actually in the guineess book of world records for being the loudest crowd at a sporting event."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cool! I'm sure you wish you were there at that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish. It was back in 2013."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet you I go to a 49ers game before you do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's go to a game where they play each other and we'll settle the score once and for all."
