"__HORROR__ Did you watch the Friday the 13th movies growing up?"
"__HORROR__ Not really.  I've probably seen them all though."
"__HORROR__ Oh, but you didn't like them?"
"__HORROR__ No, I found that Jason was pretty boring."
"__HORROR__ He kills everyone.  How is that boring?"
"__HORROR__ It's just a cycle of death."

"__HORROR__ Well, he did go to Manhatten that one time."
"__HORROR__ Oh, that one wasn't so bad!"
