"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Will Ferrell movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No question, Anchorman."
"__MOVIES__ Not Step Brothers?"
"__MOVIES__ Don't get me wrong, Step Brothers was great. However, Anchorman is way more quotable."
"__MOVIES__ I think that my problem with Anchorman was that he basically copied the same character for many of his subsequent movies like Talladega Nights and Blades of Glory."
"__MOVIES__ Please explain."
"__MOVIES__ You know, the arrogant dumb guy who excels at an eccentric profession."
"__MOVIES__ True, but at least he's great at that role. I bet that tons of actors wish they could do that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Zach Galifianakis tries to do his Alan character from the Hangover in other movies like Due Date, but it always falls flat."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'd say that the Hangover is the only good Zach Galifianakis movie."
"__MOVIES__ I hope you just mean the first Hangover movie and not the franchise as a whole."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely think that the first one was far and away the best one. However, the second one unfairly receives a bad reputation."
"__MOVIES__ The Hangover Part II was essentially a direct copy of the first one, except it took place in Thailand."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it was still really funny."
"__MOVIES__ Agree to disagree. However, I think that we can both say that the Hangover Part III was terrible though."
"__MOVIES__ No argument here. That one was definitely trying to build off of the nostalgia from the first one. Also, I found  Melissa McCarthy's character annoying and not funny."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't say that it was her best role, but I think that you're being too harsh on her."
"__MOVIES__ I love Melissa McCarthy and think that her role in Bridesmaids is one of the best comedic performances of this decade. I just found her to be terrible in the Hangover Part III."
"__MOVIES__ That's fair, although I felt that Melissa McCarthy received too much credit for her performance in Bridesmaids, which overshadowed my favorite part of the movie, Kristen Wiig."
"__MOVIES__ She was also good in Bridesmaids. Too bad she hasn't had another hit movie since."
