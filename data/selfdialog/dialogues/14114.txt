"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think Lebron is going to win the NBA Championship this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am not sure, I do not think the Cavs have enough good players around him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but they added Kyle Korver and have been shooting threes great."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is the key if they can shoot well I think Lebron can win another championship."
"__BASKETBALL__ More threes than the Golden State Warriors at least."
"__BASKETBALL__ You think the Warriors will make it to the Finals?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I think the Spurs will lose to the Rockets, and the Rockets cant beat the Warriors even with James Harden."
"__BASKETBALL__ I would love to see that Western Conference Final of Harden against Curry."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think is the better 3pt shooter?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I definitely think Steph Curry is the best shooter in the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ You think he will do better this year in the Finals if they play the Cleveland Cavaliers again?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that was a fluke for Curry to play that poorly last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know I still cannot believe that they lost after being up 3 to 1 in the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ That was an epic comeback from the Cavaliers to be able to do it."
"__BASKETBALL__ There is no way that even with Lebron they come back without Kyrie Irving."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree Kyrie Irving was the most important and valuable player in that series."
"__BASKETBALL__ If he plays like that again I think the Cavaliers would beat the Warriors in the Finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not if Curry and Thompson play at the same level, the Warriors have to many weapons to only the Cavs Lebron and Kyrie."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but Lebron is like three of the Warriors players, he is the best in the world."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree he is the best in the world, if they play in the finals again it will be a great match."
