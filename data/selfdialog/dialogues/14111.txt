"__BASKETBALL__ James Harden has disappointed me this playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I could see that."
"__BASKETBALL__ I was hoping the Rockets would roll on to the Western Conference Finals behind him."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah it would have been really fun to watch."
"__BASKETBALL__ The problem is I think he finally got tired."
"__BASKETBALL__ It sure looks that way."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can't really blame him though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah his usage is through the roof."
"__BASKETBALL__ Only Westbrook makes him look like he is underutilized."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah and that man is a psycho."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah a psycho I do not enjoy watching play."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah his game is too him-centric for me."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too."
"__BASKETBALL__ At least with Harden he is getting others involved."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah his assist numbers don't even adequately show how much he helps that offense."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he is the spoon that stirs the drink for that team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah which is why I think it is disappointing that he isnt shining more."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah plus everyone is ready to jump all over him when the team struggles."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah hopefully they turn it around."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah lets hope so."
