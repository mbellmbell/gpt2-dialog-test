"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What team that made the playoffs last year do you think will miss them this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that the Atlanta Falcons are in for a rough season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? They were just in the superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't think they have added much during the offseason to change any outcomes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that you're right about the offseason additions, but I'm more worried about if they can shake that superbowl loss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would definately be a tough thing to go through, losing a 25 point lead late in the game, but I think enough time will have passed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You do realize that the Falcons have a history of not bouncing back, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do know that they rarely have two good seasons back to back in recent history, but this team is well-rounded and they didn't lose many players to other teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just that Matt Ryan is so talented, but the defense and offense don't always play well in the same games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's how it is for a lot of teams, though. Ryan is an elite quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is one of the more talented in the NFL, but I think there needs to be some successes in his career before calling him elite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, now that they have the brand new stadium in Atlanta, it's important to bring a new chapter of success to the franchise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their division is a toss up this year. So many teams could be contenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why I think they might not make the playoffs, it depends on how Carolina performs and if Tampa wins a few more this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We are forgetting about the biggest wildcard of them all, the Saints!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Saints had the most offensive yards in 2016 of any team in the league. Drew Brees is a monster on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It could be a four way race most of the season, considering Atlanta and New Orleans both have such explosive offenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's so true, but the falcons have an insanely better defense than the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if Atlanta's defense is as good as Tampa Bay's though, they kept Tampa in so many games this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think their defenses stack up nicely together, but it will make for some good division game watching this year!"
