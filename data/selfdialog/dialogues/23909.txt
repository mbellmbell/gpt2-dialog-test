"__SUPERHERO__ How did Kryptonite became a thing anyway?"
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I mean Krypton blew up. right? So how did they find the rock that's only supposed to exist on Krypton?"
"__SUPERHERO__ it was first mentioned in 1943 radio show so that the actor playing the Superman can take a vacation."
"__SUPERHERO__ What? That's so stupid. That's how it all begin?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, The Superman creator actually had written about a rock that drains his power, but it was only used in order for the actor to get some vacation time"
"__SUPERHERO__ So what did they do instead?"
"__SUPERHERO__ They had a stand in actor groan once in a while as they explained that Superman was trapped in Kryptonite cage. That was in 1943."
"__SUPERHERO__ This is the dumbest origin story there is. That still doesn't explain where it came from."
"__SUPERHERO__ Only because the planet blew up doesn't mean the rocks disappeared. And yep, the entire Kryptonite thing began because dude wanted to take a vacation."
