"__COMEDY__ Would you rather watch a silly comedy or a romantic comedy?"
"__COMEDY__ It really depends on my mood. I most like silly comedies."
"__COMEDY__ So maybe something like Happy Gilmore or the Waterboy?"
"__COMEDY__ Pretty much anything with Adam Sandler or Will Farrell works for me!"
"__COMEDY__ I'm much more into romantic comedies, but sometimes I like the classic goofier ones."
"__COMEDY__ Have any examples?"
"__COMEDY__ Anything done by Mel Brooks, like Spaceballs!"
"__COMEDY__ That movie is so funny! Rick Moranis as a Darth Vader clone is genius."
"__COMEDY__ I know, they couldn't have done that movie any better."
"__COMEDY__ They should really do a sequel."
