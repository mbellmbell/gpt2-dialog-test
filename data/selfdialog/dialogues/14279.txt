"__HORROR__ What are your thoughts on the shinning?"
"__HORROR__ I watched this on tv when I WAS VERY YOUNG AND IT HAS SCARED ME SILLY EVER SINCE."
"__HORROR__ How young, not that it isn't scary at any age..."
"__HORROR__ Maybe 8-9, too young. It really impacted me."
"__HORROR__ That is very young. There is so much to this movie, you probably did not fully grasp it at that time."
"__HORROR__ Very true. so much went right over my head. The more times I see it the more I notice like references to native tribes."
"__HORROR__ Yes there is a lot more than first meets the eye. They even have a documentary on the making of the shinning."
"__HORROR__ I heard stephen king really did not like the film version and felt it was not his original vision."
"__HORROR__ Ya King was not a fan of the film at all. I however am a huge fan and especially of shelley Duvall's performance."
"__HORROR__ She was great in this film. I also thought Jack nicholson's performance was oscar worthy."
