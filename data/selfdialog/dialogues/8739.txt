"__BEATLES__ What is the first Beatles song you remember?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know. Probably Hey Jude."
"__BEATLES__ That was an early one for me, too, but my earliest was Hello Goodbye. We had the single from when it first came out!"
"__BEATLES__ Very cool!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I thought it was a children's record! I can still remember listening to it on the little record player by the fireplace in our family room."
"__BEATLES__ Totally cool. I remember Hey Jude from the radio."
"__BEATLES__ Same here! Everyone in the car shut up when it was playing."
"__BEATLES__ Well, that's rare!"
"__BEATLES__ So true! We had that single, too, and my neice, Liz, used to go crazy at the 'Hey Jude-a Jude-a Jude-a Jude-a' part at the end."
"__BEATLES__ Kids are so funny!"
