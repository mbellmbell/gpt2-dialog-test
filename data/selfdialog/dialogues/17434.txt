"__MOVIES__ Hey have you seen the Resident Evil Final Chapter?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet."
"__MOVIES__ The main character is going back to the hive."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ It turns out that there is a cure there and she has to get it out before time runs out."
"__MOVIES__ Does everyone get cured?"
"__MOVIES__ Well no, it kills the T-virus and leaves healthy tissue."
"__MOVIES__ What does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It means that all the zombies and animals will die but the rest of the people not affected will be saved."
"__MOVIES__ OK, what happens when she gets there?"
"__MOVIES__ Well she is captured and drug behind a vehicle like a tank, attracting zombies on the way bringing thousands."
"__MOVIES__ She escapes right?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah and she leads a team of people to the hive to get the cure."
"__MOVIES__ Many people get killed?"
"__MOVIES__ Most of them die but the hero gets the bad guys, it turns out she is a clone of the daughter, of the scientist that invented the T-cell."
"__MOVIES__ So she was engineered?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. The Umbrella Corp. was really nasty and had thousands of top execs and wealthy people frozen, They were going to take over when everyone was dead."
"__MOVIES__ Did she stop them?"
"__MOVIES__ She stopped them and eliminated the frozen ones too."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I gotta see that."
