"__ROCK__ I bought tickets for Lollapalooza this summer, but now my boyfriend can't go. Do you want to go with me?"
"__ROCK__ Did you buy a single day pass, or a four day pass?"
"__ROCK__ It's a single day pass for Friday. The tickets were $120 each."
"__ROCK__ Okay, I can go. I can pay you for the ticket next payday."
"__ROCK__ That's fine. It should be a lot of fun, I love seeing all the different bands."
"__ROCK__ Me too. Who's playing Friday?"
"__ROCK__ I specifically got Friday tickets because Blink 182 is playing that day."
"__ROCK__ I LOVE Blink 182. They have so many great sing along songs."
"__ROCK__ I hope they play All The Small Things."
"__ROCK__ I like Adam's Song, even though it's incredibly sad."
