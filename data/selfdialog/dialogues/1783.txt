"__MUSIC__ Uhhh, this looks like a bad band, actually."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, why?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I just realized that this band doesn't have that many remixes!"
"__MUSIC__ Ohhh, yeah, I agree."
"__MUSIC__ How so? You don't know any music!"
"__MUSIC__ True, true. All I hear is the new stuff, like Trap, and some EDM remixes here and there."
"__MUSIC__ Well, have you ever heard of Baroque music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, what is Baroque?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, basically it's some old music type of stuff, so it's a little classic."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ I actually listened to a bunch of music genres, especially Jazz, Blues, Disco, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, speaking of which, when did Disco come out?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty early in the 60s and 70s."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, wow, I think my girlfriend is acutually interested in it!"
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ She has to do a project on the history of disco, and other things."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmmm, not sure."
"__MUSIC__ Does she have to perform some disco moves?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and she has to do it in a crystal fox fur coat, too!"
