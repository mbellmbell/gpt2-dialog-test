"__LADY_GAGA__ Holy Moly, did you just see what 'Lady Gaga' was wearing on the award show?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, What kind of crazy thing did she wear this time?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It was an outfit made out of meat!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Are you serious?  Even her shoes?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes the shoes too, that is one nasty thing to wear."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I can only imagine that flies were all over her"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I used to think Bjork was nuts when she wore that dress that looked like a swan but I think the meat suit wins hands down"
"__LADY_GAGA__ no kidding I wonder if she was making a statement or if she is just being eclectic"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well one thing is for sure it couldn't have been for PETA"
"__LADY_GAGA__ (chuckles) yeah maybe she is just stating that meat is awesome."
