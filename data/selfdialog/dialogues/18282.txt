"__MOVIES__ Time travel is so weird in movies. It's hard to keep track of what's what."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that. Some time travel movies are pretty easy to follow."
"__MOVIES__ Well, let me give you an example: The Terminator. That's a movie with a hard to follow mythology."
"__MOVIES__ Actually, The Terminator is pretty straightforward."
"__MOVIES__ The first one is, but after that it gets confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Break it down for me."
"__MOVIES__ The first one is a closed loop, right? Machine goes back to kill Sarah Connor, fails, but creates Skynet in the process."
"__MOVIES__ And John Connor, too, of course. You forgot that."
"__MOVIES__ Right, well, come the second film, apparently time travel allows you to create history. The rules of the first film don't apply anymore."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, they do prevent Judgement Day in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but then in the third film, it turns out you can't change the future, you can only delay it. What's inevitable will always happen."
"__MOVIES__ That does seem to kind of conflict with both prior films, honestly. What happens in the fourth?"
"__MOVIES__ A lot of weird Terminator-Human hybrid stuff, but nothing time travel related, so we can skip right to the fifth film."
"__MOVIES__ What happens in that one? I've never seen it."
"__MOVIES__ In that one, following the events of the other four films time travel happens, and the past is changed, meaning none of them ever happened."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. That's confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, but Judgement Day is still happening, but in modern time when Kyle Reese is a child. And he remembers the events as they happen to him as a child as an adult."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, just stop. Just stop, that's too much."
"__MOVIES__ Now you finally see my point. Time travel in movies is weird, and Terminator is only one example."
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to hear any other examples. This is making my head spin enough as is!"
