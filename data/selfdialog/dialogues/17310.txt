"__MOVIES__ What are your favorite types of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I like comedies, but I'm really into horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I love horror movies. What is your favorite horror movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I have a few favorites, but the Exorcist probably tops the list."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen the Exorcist once when I was younger, I couldn't watch the whole thing."
"__MOVIES__ I saw parts when I was younger too, but I watched the full movie for the first time when I was in my 20's."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about 'IT'?"
"__MOVIES__ The movie with the clown?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That is one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I've never seen the movie."
"__MOVIES__ There is a new version of the movie coming out."
"__MOVIES__ I actually saw that! The clown looks very creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I'm not sure it will be as good as the original but we should go see it."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! I should probably see the original one first so I can compare the two."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have the original one dvd. You can come over and watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. but don't tell me the ending!"
"__MOVIES__ I won't. It's a pretty long movie though so we will watch it when you have a lot of time."
"__MOVIES__ ok. That sounds good. I can come over on Saturday."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. maybe we can squeeze in exorcist."
"__MOVIES__ We will see how scared I am after 'IT' first."
