"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you looking forward to the NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure am.  It's going to be a great year for football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a Patriots fan, and they're always good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm...last time we were together you were a Bronco's fan.  What's up with that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, well, since Peyton Manning retired, they haven't been very good, so I switched to the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow.  What happens when Tom Brady retires?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Patriots don't do good, I will find some other team to follow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?  Who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dallas Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm...They just got good a few years ago too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I was a fan of them when they were terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's true.  There are pictures of me as a kid wearing Dallas Cowboys shirts and stuff."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  I guess that's impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they are my team, and even though I like for them to win, I will cheer for them when they lose too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good for you.  Maybe I should just stick to one team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that would be a good idea.  Who will you pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, lets see who wins the Super Bowl this year, then I will decide."
