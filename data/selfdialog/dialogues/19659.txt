"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new 'Clash of the Titans' movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was kinda strange."
"__MOVIES__ Strange? How?"
"__MOVIES__ When compared to the older , original version, it just lacks something."
"__MOVIES__ Really, how so, like in plot or visually?"
"__MOVIES__ Visually the new version is beautiful to watch, has some cool effects as far as the CG went, but it just lacked the granduer  of the original for me."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. The original made one feel like it was truely a trial and journey, the new one just felt like a story unfolding."
"__MOVIES__ For me, the original felt like it engaged the audience more."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it was more a casting choice issue?"
"__MOVIES__ maybe, I mean the cast did a good job, just not a dazzling one."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ For example, when he goes to kill Medusa, in the original, the fear of getting turned to stone looked real in his eyes, like he embraced the role."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too. In the new one, it was just like, oh well one of my guys is a statue not, no big deal."
"__MOVIES__ Also, when the statue of Athena came to life, in the new one it was just a stiff delivery. The original , despite the effects, made it feel like her spirit had overtaken an inatimate object."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, an this is where i think that the lack of cg actually made the scene better."
"__MOVIES__ The kracken in the new version was epic!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree, visually more explosive. The original looked more like king Kong and swamp thing had a baby."
"__MOVIES__ hahaha that would be awesome."
"__MOVIES__ What did you like aboput Posiden?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked him better in the Newer version, and it expalined his role better in the plot."
