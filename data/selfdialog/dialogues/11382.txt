"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a Denver Broncos fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Denver? Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. I have been since John Elway was quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a long time ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was probably 8 or 9 when I started following them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet you were happy when they hired Payton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really I don't like the guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who doesn't like Payton Manning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me apparently. I just think he is an amazing football player but he is a crappy person."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember when he was out for the year from the Colts with neck surgery?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the same year his brother Eli won the superbowl right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. When his brother won it was a major accomplishment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was and I was glad to see he won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So was the nation but instead of letting his brother bask in that glory and allowing him to celebrate his accomplishment, Payton made it all about him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Payton was in front of every camera he could find talking about his contract with the Colts. It took the spotlight away from Eli which was sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't that just sibling rivalry?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe but Denver capitalized on it an Payton fueled the fire so to say."
