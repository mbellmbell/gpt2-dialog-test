"__DISNEY__ Did you know the Lion King came out the year I was born in 1994?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I did not know that. Did you here they are making a live action remake of it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and I am not sure how I feel about that. It was always one of my favorite Disney shows."
"__DISNEY__ I always liked Timon and Pumbaa. They were so funny."
"__DISNEY__ I must have sang Hakuna Matata so much, it drove my parents crazy."
"__DISNEY__ That was my favorite song of the whole show. I was always sad though when Mufasa died."
"__DISNEY__ I could not believe his own brother, Scar, killed him."
"__DISNEY__ Then poor Simba thought he was the one that killed his father."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but if not for that, he would never have met up with Timon and Pumbaa."
"__DISNEY__ They do make the whole show so funny."
