"__STAR_WARS__ Who is the better villian, Darth Vader or Kylo Ren?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, Darth Vader.  Can't even compare yet. 6 movies versus 1."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, but I think he has potential."
"__STAR_WARS__ He did kill his father."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, I didn't like him being all emotional."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's a bit more realistic."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess. I hope that he isn't that one girl's brother."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I think she's his cousin."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope Rey is related to Obi-Wan instead of Luke and Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like that idea!"
