"__MUSIC__ I am in here just trippin'."
"__MUSIC__ Why? What's up?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm listening to Whitney Houston."
"__MUSIC__ Which song."
"__MUSIC__ I Have Nothing."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that from The Bodyguard Soundtrack?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ I love that movie."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I'm actually watching the video with it hooked up to my stereo."
"__MUSIC__ I know the sound is off the chain."
"__MUSIC__ I got my sound processor on mountains, that thing sound right."
"__MUSIC__ Whitney could sing her behind off."
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't feeling her when I was younger. But now."
"__MUSIC__ You crazy. I was feeling Whitney ever since I'm Your Baby Tonight."
"__MUSIC__ I feel you. Man this video making me want to cry."
"__MUSIC__ Awe. Probably because you know she's gone."
"__MUSIC__ Whitney was gorgeous. And she could sing."
"__MUSIC__ And she was with Bobby Brown."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that lucky son of a gun."
"__MUSIC__ Well her music will live on forever. Rest in peace Whitney."
