"__DISNEY__ You know... there's days I completely forget Disney owns Star Wars and Marvel."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean. I never imagined either being anything more than their own company."
"__DISNEY__ It was quite ingenious though. They make an incredible team."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, with Disney's financial and creative resources they're really killing it with all the new films."
"__DISNEY__ Not just that but have you heard about the theme parks?"
"__DISNEY__ No, what?"
"__DISNEY__ Both Star Wars and Marvel are getting their own lands now. They might even be opened already or opening soon."
"__DISNEY__ No way! That's like a nerd's dream come true!"
"__DISNEY__ So in the real world we get truly the most magical place and in the cinematic universe we have Episode VIII, Boba Fett, Han Solo, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel to look forward to also."
"__DISNEY__ Don't forget some really great sequels: Thor Ragnarok and Ant Man and the Wasp. Which other than Infinity War is one I'm looking forward to most."
