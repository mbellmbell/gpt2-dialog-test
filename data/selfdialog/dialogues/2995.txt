"__MUSIC__ What's up with that guy from Soundgarden dying last month?"
"__MUSIC__ I know, too many musicians commit suicide."
"__MUSIC__ Kurt did the same thing."
"__MUSIC__ Kurt?"
"__MUSIC__ Kurt Cobain from Nirvana."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, that band."
"__MUSIC__ What's that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, just Nirvana weren't the first to be signed out of the scene."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Soundgarden were."
"__MUSIC__ Yup."
"__MUSIC__ It's sad he's dead now."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, was he working on a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, you sound like the Soundgarden expert."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know either."
"__MUSIC__ Kurt's lyrics were more poetic, especially on his tapes."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I agree, Soundgarden were more pop."
"__MUSIC__ Kurt wrote 'School' from Bleach about Soundgarden"
"__MUSIC__ Oh? How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's all about conformity, in high school and on the record label. He said he could have called that song 'Pearl Jam' or 'Soundgarden' as well."
"__MUSIC__ You can hear the Tad influence in that album."
