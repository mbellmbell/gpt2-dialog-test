"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the Disney movie The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad."
"__DISNEY__ I watched it when I was a kid but I really don't remember what it is about."
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't it based on Sleepy Hollow?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was two different movie segments."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, there was the Wind and the Willow part about Mr Toad?"
"__DISNEY__ Do you remember what that one was about?"
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't Mr Toad an adventurer that never paid attention to costs."
"__DISNEY__ Yes but I haven't seen it in so long that I do not remember the plot."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe we should watch it again."
"__DISNEY__ Good idea, how about Friday night?"
