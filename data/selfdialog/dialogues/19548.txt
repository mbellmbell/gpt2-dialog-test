"__MOVIES__ Free Fire was such a fun movie to watch!"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the latest Brie Larson movie with Armie Hammer and Sharlto Copley?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one, they're all trapped in this warehouse after a guns deal goes wrong."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds intense. Is it an all out action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's has a lot of humorous comedic tones as you can imagine with the cast, there's a lot of shoot outs."
"__MOVIES__ I like the cast a lot and think I will look for this. Tell me some more about it."
"__MOVIES__ Well the whole movie sets place in the warehouse and aside from the shootouts there's a lot of fun dialogue between the huge cast."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Cillian Murphy, Jack Reynor, Sam Riley, Noah Taylor and more!"
"__MOVIES__ That's a huge cast! I think I've seen all of Cillian Murphy's movies and I really like Jack Reynor as an up and coming young actor. Sam Riley is so underrated and so is Noah Taylor!"
"__MOVIES__ I think for Cillian my favorite movies of his are between Sunshine and 28 Days Later. Those were so good."
"__MOVIES__ Those are my favorites too. Have you watched Sing Street? Jack Reynor is really good in there even though he's not the main actor."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't watched Sing Street yet, but I remember Jack from Transformers Age of Extinction as the boyfriend character."
"__MOVIES__ That was such a forgettable movie but yeah he was in that."
"__MOVIES__ Check out Free Fire I think you'll really enjoy it. There's a mystery element too. They're trying to figure out who set them up and who's trying to steal the money involved in the deal."
"__MOVIES__ I like these types of movies. They remind me of Quentin Tarantino movies."
"__MOVIES__ I think this director was really going for the Tarantino vibes. There's a heavy focus on the dialogue and the fun moments. I did have to admit the injured crawling around got a little tedious after awhile and the space they were in felt very enclosed."
"__MOVIES__ I would imagine so, but watching those performances going on kept things exciting. Brie's also in an action movie! I can't wait to see how she does."
"__MOVIES__ She was also in Kong Skull Island but she didn't get much to work with even though I enjoyed that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's right I forgot about Kong Skull Island. I'll try to look for Free Fire, that sounds like a really fun movie to watch."
