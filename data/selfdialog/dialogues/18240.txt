"__MOVIES__ What movie scares you silly?"
"__MOVIES__ Ah, stephen king's IT!"

"__MOVIES__ Pennywise is such a creepy character."
"__MOVIES__ I can only watch it if it is day time."
"__MOVIES__ Good call. certain films call for daylight viewings."
"__MOVIES__ What is an example for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Again stephen king, but the shinning."
"__MOVIES__ He is like the master of horror writers."
"__MOVIES__ Ya he owns that genre. His dark tower series is coming out soon."
"__MOVIES__ Those books are less horror."
"__MOVIES__ They are still dark. Have you seen the trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ Ya, I don't know what to think yet."
"__MOVIES__ I think it looks incredible. what are you unsure of?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't love the casting choices."
"__MOVIES__ I do think they have taken some liberty in casting but all seem good to me."
"__MOVIES__ I would rather seen matthew mcconaughey as Roland."
