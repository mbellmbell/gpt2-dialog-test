"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I expect business as usual, Patriots, Seahawks, Falcons, Cowboys dominating the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No surprise teams coming out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Raiders might end up doing good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think that the Titans are going to be a force this season."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to attend any Texans games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so, I am so busy with work, are you going to go to any games this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I will head to a Cardinals game when I visit home around Thanksgiving."
