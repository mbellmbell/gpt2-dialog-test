"__ROCK__ Do you like those top ten lists that people do?"
"__ROCK__ It depends on that they are ranking..."
"__ROCK__ I was looking at one for best frontmen of rock groups- guess who was number one?"
"__ROCK__ Probably Prince... or Chris Cornell from Soundgarden.... or Michael Hutchence from INXS."
"__ROCK__ Nope, number one was Freddie Mercury from Queen, then Robert Plant and Mick Jagger."
"__ROCK__ Mick Jagger was rated higher than Prince or Chris Cornell?  They must not have been judging by their vocals."
"__ROCK__ I just looked it up on my cell phone. Prince was ranked 51. Hutchence was 53, and Cornell was 24."
"__ROCK__ You're kidding. So who was ranked at the bottom?"
"__ROCK__ Number 100 was Syd Barret from Pink Floyd. Apparently even creepy Marilyn Manson was better than Pink Floyd since he came in number 88."
"__ROCK__ Now you see why I don't pay attention to those kinds of things. Everyone knows the lead singer of Pink Floyd was better than Marilyn Manson."
