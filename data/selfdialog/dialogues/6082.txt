"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Poe or Finn are force-sensitive?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No."
"__STAR_WARS__ Finn, for sure, I don't think is. But Poe has to be."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He took down something like ten clone troopers in a super short time in the battle."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was pretty sweet, but I don't think that a humanoid can survive the G-force of those turns."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's why he's a force-sensitive. He CAN survive what others can't."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but maybe he's just good."
"__STAR_WARS__ He also survived in a desert and relocated his entire fleet somehow without detection and without dehydrating."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe. Looks like he can survive some crazy things."
