"__MOVIES__ So I recently saw the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I've heard good things about that movie, but what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was amazing! All around a really great movie."
"__MOVIES__ I can believe that. Marvel are usually at the top of the game when it comes to superhero movies."
"__MOVIES__ Totally. Nobody does superhero movies like Marvel. They just know how to tell a good story with good characters with awesome visual effects."
"__MOVIES__ It's too bad, because DC does at least one of those pretty well, but everything else is all over the place."
"__MOVIES__ People tend to blame Zack Snyder for that."
"__MOVIES__ Who's he, again?"
"__MOVIES__ He's the director."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right. Wait, did he direct Suicide Squad?"
"__MOVIES__ No, and people thought it would be a good movie because of that."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was an alright movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, but they could have done so much more with it."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Leto's Joker was such a disappointment."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it had potential, especially since he had a really unique look, at least for the Joker."
"__MOVIES__ All of that potential was ruined whenever they decided to give him literally 5 minutes of screen time."
"__MOVIES__ Did you think he could top Ledger's Joker?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding me? Nobody can top Ledger's Joker!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought as much. That's still one of my all-time favorite performances in any movie."
"__MOVIES__ Mine too!"
