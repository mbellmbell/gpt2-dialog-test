"__STAR_WARS__ So, here's something interesting, I'm told there's some fans who are working on editing a re-release of the original Stars Wars movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait, you mean, A New Hope?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but they're trying to get the version that was shown in theaters BEFORE it was retitled 'Star Wars: A New Hope'.  Reportedly, that subtitle was only added in later on."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, didn't that film get release pretty much as is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not exactly, for instance, they had the Special Edition which added several scenes, including Han confronting Jabba and whatnot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, yeah, I remember watching that in the theaters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but a lot of fans prefer the original and they've been working on their own to get a cut of the film based on the original print.  I'm told it's a rather painstaking process."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is that even legal, I wonder?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's kind of a grey area... they're not doing it for profit, and it's not the first time a Star Wars film has been edited.  Consider, for example, the so-called Phantom Edit that came out around  in the year 2000."
"__STAR_WARS__ Remember hearing about that... never did get to see it though."
