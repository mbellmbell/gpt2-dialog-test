"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite singer?"
"__MUSIC__ That's really hard to say.  I really love women who have a beautiful voice, no matter what they are singing."
"__MUSIC__ I bet you love watching The Voice then."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, very much."
"__MUSIC__ Who was your favorite artist from the Voice, so far?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, having said that about vocalists - my favorite so far is Laith al-Saddig."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ He sings real gritty blues, which I love. And it's unusual to find a new voice in the blues that is so unique but still definately the real thing."
"__MUSIC__ I think I remember him. I think my favorite so far was Alisan Porter."
"__MUSIC__ I liked her, but I think the real reason she won was everyone loved her comeback story."
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, because the story and getting to know the singers is really important in The Voice."
"__MUSIC__ She does have a powerful voice with a lot of range though - that impressed me. I loved it when she did that Janis Joplin song."
"__MUSIC__ Cry Baby.  I remember that."
"__MUSIC__ You're too young, probably, to remember hearing Janis sing it.  I was surprised to hear anyone else bring that emotion out like Alisan did."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I have heard the recordings of Janis Joplin singing it.  My Mom was a fan."
"__MUSIC__ Alisan did a decent cover."
"__MUSIC__ So what is she doing now - Alisan Porter?"
"__MUSIC__ She is working on an album and also, I think, performing at some smaller venues."
"__MUSIC__ It's great to see her having so much success after having so many problems in her life."
"__MUSIC__ She makes it a real goal to reach out and touch people with that story and give others hope, which is cool."
