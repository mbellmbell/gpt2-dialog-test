"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the rule changes the NFL has made?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like some of them, but not all of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which ones don't you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like how you can't hit a quarterback anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but they are trying to protect them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get that, but it's football.  They are gonna get hit."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why don't you think the NFL will win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There has been evidence for years the football causes concussions."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would you let your kid play football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, there are too many other safer sports."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree it's a tough sport but I'd rather my kid play basketball or baseball than football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many NFL players get concussions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Almost all of them at one point in their career."
