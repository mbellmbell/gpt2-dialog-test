"__MUSIC__ Which decade had the best music?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough one. I'd say the '60s."
"__MUSIC__ Why the '60s?"
"__MUSIC__ It started with great pop songs from The Beach Boys, and it covered the entire career of the Beatles. The Stones. The Doors . . ."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's all true. But I'd say the '90s."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ You had the grunge movement. Who was better than Nirvana?"
"__MUSIC__ Didn't grunge start in the '80s?"
"__MUSIC__ Technically, yes. But it exploded in the '90s. I don't think there's ever been a better song than 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.'"
"__MUSIC__ 'Losing My Religion'? That's my favorite song from the '90s."
"__MUSIC__ Sure. REM is great. Pearl Jam is great. But Nirvana was in a category of its own."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but were they as great as the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. The Beatles had some great songs but their early stuff was so simple. Nirvana was always deep."
"__MUSIC__ We'll have to agree to disagree. The Beatles were revolutionary. They redefined popular music."
"__MUSIC__ OK, so what about the '70s and '80s?"
"__MUSIC__ The '70s started out great. It was really just a continuation of the '60s. But then came disco."
"__MUSIC__ Don't remind me."
"__MUSIC__ The '80s were better. But it seems like the music from the '80s was mostly about creating a great video to get on MTV."
"__MUSIC__ I used to love MTV. I watched it all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. My favorite bad video was 'I Ran' by a Flock of Seagulls!"
