"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who is your favorite rapper of this generation?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would have to say that Lil Wayne is my favorite rapper these days."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really, I just can't seem to get into any of his songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah man! I just really enjoy the comentary of his songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean, to me, the lyrics just seem vulgar and disgusting."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean, if you're listening to the wrong songs, I could see your argument."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Just look at 'Lollipop', it has no message at all other than pure vulgarity."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He may not have a solid message like rappers from the past, but I can still appreciate his music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean, to each his own, I just can't see past how empty his music sounds."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Perhaps it's more a general fault of rap today, rather than purely Lil Wayne, that skews your perception of his music as being empty."
