"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you see The Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Is that the newest Fast and the Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, it was pretty great, one of my favorites."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I have not seen any of those movies since the third one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really?  Since Tokyo Drift?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You picked the worst time to stop, it got way better after that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought it got pretty silly so I couldn't get myself to keep watching them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The newer ones are pretty much action movies, less about racing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That is interesting, all I remember were the racing scenes."
