"__BASKETBALL__ I think Lebron is better and Jordan was."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think you are wrong."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well just watching him he sees more dominant."
"__BASKETBALL__ I could see that but when Jordan took over there was nothing like it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Is that all you have to go off of?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well what else?"
"__BASKETBALL__ How bout the rings, the points, the historical moments, the fact he never ran to other teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ Those are better arguments."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hate hypothetical though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah as a whole I am sure the athletes now are better than the athletes were back then."
"__BASKETBALL__ Right, but they have so much more at their disposal."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the teams put them in the best possible position to be successful."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah the training and health is way better now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah and the athletes are under such scrutiny it matters if they take it seriously."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, so maybe Lebron is better."
"__BASKETBALL__ Thank you."
"__BASKETBALL__ But only because of the advances in medicine."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not so sure of that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well you are never going to convince me that Jordan is not the greatest ever."
