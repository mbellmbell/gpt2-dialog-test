"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite song from any Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Lion King has always been very memorable for me with Elton John's Circle of Life song."
"__DISNEY__ Lion King is always on everyone's top list because of the memorable songs in there plus it's one of Disney's most powerful animations too!"
"__DISNEY__ I also think it's underrated but I liked Phil Collins song in the 1999 Disney Tarzan movie."
"__DISNEY__ You mean You'll Be In My Heart?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that one! It makes me irrationally choke up every time I hear it!"
"__DISNEY__ That's funny. I don't want to say the cliche response, but Frozen's Let It Go is really, really good."
"__DISNEY__ Let it Go will be always so memorable because of how great Frozen was as a whole. Disney really knocked it out of the ballpark with that film."
"__DISNEY__ I think the songs relate to how good and memorable the Disney movie is."
