"__MUSIC__ I wonder when the next Madonna album will come out."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard any news about her being in the studio with anyone, so it is likely not anytime soon."
"__MUSIC__ Well, a lot of artists have managed to pull off surprise records lately, so she could be doing that."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose. I haven't really liked her last couple albums anyway though."
"__MUSIC__ I thought they were pretty good. Rebel Heart especially had some great tracks on it."
"__MUSIC__ It had some pretty bad ones as well."
"__MUSIC__ It could have probably been trimmed down a bit."
"__MUSIC__ Her recent output often feels a little too much like she is chasing trends though, rather than setting them like she used to."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose I can see that. She still writes some really solid pop songs though."
"__MUSIC__ True, but I would really like to see her properly return to form and put out a 100% solid album."
"__MUSIC__ When do you think was the last time she did that?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say the last one that was all great was Confessions on a Dancefloor."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was a great album."
"__MUSIC__ Catchy melodies, and production that was a perfect blend of where pop and dance were heading and where they had come from."
"__MUSIC__ I have to agree there."
"__MUSIC__ But following that up with Hard Candy was a mistake."
"__MUSIC__ I liked some of that."
"__MUSIC__ But you didn't like all of it."
"__MUSIC__ No, I suppose not."
"__MUSIC__ And there you go. All of her output from then on has been like that."
