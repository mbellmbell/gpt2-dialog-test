"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite movie from 2014?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite movie was Whiplash."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with J.K. Simmons playing a musical conductor?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it also has Miles Teller."
"__MOVIES__ Why did you like the movie so much?"
"__MOVIES__ It tells the story of a journey to reach one's maximum potential."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I can relate to that as well, I just thought J.K. Simmons' character was too abusive towards his students."
"__MOVIES__ I disagree, I think that his abusive attitude was necessary in order to weed out those who couldn't make the cut."
"__MOVIES__ So are you saying he was the good guy in the story?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I'm saying that his character personified the extreme challenges that people face in every day life."
"__MOVIES__ I see, so he was a necessary evil then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Think about it this way, would Andrew have reached his maximum potential had it not been for his instructor Fletcher?"
"__MOVIES__ Well now that you put it that way, I can see what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Towards the end of the story when Andrew is finishing his improvisational drum solo, you can see Fletcher smile."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I've heard that the ending might not have been so positive."
"__MOVIES__ Indeed, the ending was totally up to personal interpretation. That's what was so beautiful about the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to watch the movie again now."
"__MOVIES__ You really should. It is one of my favorite movies of all time."
"__MOVIES__ I remember hearing that it won 3 Oscars in 2014."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and all on a shoe string budget of only $3.3 million."
