"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast film?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet. Have you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I thought it was great!"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I'm not sure how I feel about the trend of live action remakes for old cartoon movies."
"__MOVIES__ What other live action remake films are you thinking of besides Beauty and the Beast?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean like the Alice in Wonderland ones with Johnny Depp, or Maleficent, which wasn't quite a remake but still similar."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I thought the Alice in Wonderland films were a bit of a letdown, but I haven't seen Maleficent."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think Maleficent was that good. The live-action Cinderella got good reviews though, I've heard."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I haven't seen that, maybe I'll have to check that out sometime."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I'd like to see it too. So you would recommend Beauty and the Beast then?"
"__MOVIES__ I would definitely recommend it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay! Well maybe I'll go and give it a chance."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of live action remakes, have you heard about the new Lion King film?"
"__MOVIES__ No! They're remaking the Lion King?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep! James Earl Jones will be back as Mufasa for it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, no kidding! Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Donald Glover is supposedly going to be playing Simba, and Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner have been cast as Timon and Pumba."
"__MOVIES__ That actually sounds like a great cast"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'll be very excited to see how it turns out"
"__MOVIES__ Me too. The original Lion King is still one of my favorite films"
