"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite female superhero?"
"__MOVIES__ Easy: Black Widow from Marvel."
"__MOVIES__ Wrong, again."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ She's not a superhero. She's just a human with really good gun and fighting abilities."
"__MOVIES__ She can even take out a room of guys by herself, and choke them out with her legs."
"__MOVIES__ I can do that too!"
"__MOVIES__ You can?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, and I'm not super. Try again."
"__MOVIES__ How about Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ You're just saying her because the movie just came out. Try again."
"__MOVIES__ How about...?"
"__MOVIES__ You're just naming the first person you can think of. Think harder before you speak."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I like Jean Grey."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ She's pretty much the most powerful mutant out there but has a major flaw."
"__MOVIES__ What's her flaw?"
"__MOVIES__ She has a split personality so she's hard to control"
"__MOVIES__ You just want women to be controlled?"
"__MOVIES__ No, no, you're reading into it. Superheros are best when they have a flaw that can be exploited against them to make them more human."
