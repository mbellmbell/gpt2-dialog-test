"__HORROR__ We spoke about Nightmare on Elm Street losing it's luster after Freddy became too much of a comedian, but Wes Craven's return to direct New Nightmare was pretty good!"
"__HORROR__ I think the fact that Wes Craven came back to direct really stood out in that movie. I loved the meta theme of that movie."
"__HORROR__ It was brilliant! He structured the movie to appear as if we've been watching actors in the movie playing actors in a Nightmare on Elm Street movie!"
"__HORROR__ I love Heather Langenkamp, and I'm glad Wes brought her back to play Nancy once again, although this time she played herself as Heather, being the actress Nancy!"
"__HORROR__ The concept of the movie had me sold from the start and when I heard Heather was back I knew I had to check this out back then."
"__HORROR__ I think Heather was last scene in Dream Warriors, the Third Nightmare on Elm Street, which was probably the last one of that was decent and a lot of fans really have that as their favorite."
"__HORROR__ I enjoyed Dream Warriors a lot. It was fun, it was scary, we got a horrifying Freddy, but there were shades of Freddy getting too corny with his lines."
"__HORROR__ Let's not even talk about the next few, but back to New Nightmare, the way the put Freddy in there was so well done. I didn't expect the puppetry to come to life but Wes is a genius. He made this work."
"__HORROR__ New Nightmare to me, is a classic, but I think fans that enjoyed the comical wise cracking one liner Freddy, didn't enjoy it as much. The true fans will hold New Nightmare in high regard though."
"__HORROR__ It's probably my second favorite to the first Nightmare on Elm Street with a young Johnny Depp, don't forget about that!"
