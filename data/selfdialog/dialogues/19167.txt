"__MOVIES__ Why do you think they make movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm that is a hard one."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that?"
"__MOVIES__ Because I think movies are a plot to inform the public of things the government thinks would cause a panic ."
"__MOVIES__ What so you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember when we had movie after movie about an asteroid or meteor hitting the earth."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like the movie Asteroids?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and Armageddon, Meteors, and Judgment Day."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I remember all of those."
"__MOVIES__ Well they were great movies but in all of them the earth survived right?"
"__MOVIES__ Right."
"__MOVIES__ A few years after Armageddon came out the government announced that there was an Asteroid headed for the earth but it would be a near miss."
"__MOVIES__ And you think that was on purpose?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure since it had already been placed in the public's mind that we would survive."
"__MOVIES__ That is a bit of a conspiracy theorist idea isn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe but then it was drug movies and we had a huge influx of drug including the upsurge of Meth. Now Marijuana is becoming legal."
"__MOVIES__ Very true but..."
"__MOVIES__ Then there was Zombie movies, and the incidents with bath salts. Now there are Alien movies where Aliens are champions of the earth and we get along with them."
"__MOVIES__ So you think they will mention we have been working with good aliens?"
"__MOVIES__ Who knows but can you really say we haven't?"
