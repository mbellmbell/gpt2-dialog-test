"__THRILLER__ What is a good thriller movie to watch?"
"__THRILLER__ How about Final Destination? That one always gets me."
"__THRILLER__ Oh I remember that, with Devon Sawa?"
"__THRILLER__ Yup, that's him."
"__THRILLER__ That movie really scared me when I was a teenager."
"__THRILLER__ Of course it scared you, it was a movie about Death chasing a bunch of teenagers."
"__THRILLER__ It wasn't just that though."
"__THRILLER__ What was it then?"
"__THRILLER__ It was how no one really has control. One day you're here, the next you're not, super creepy."
"__THRILLER__ Well, it sounds like you picked your thriller movie then."
