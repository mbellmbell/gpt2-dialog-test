"__MOVIES__ What are some of your favorite funny movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I have so many, Blazing Saddles was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Blazing Saddles, wasn't that kind of controversial?"
"__MOVIES__ Not back then, movie makers seem to be able to get away with more than they do now."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that a Mel Brooks movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was Mel Brooks, the same guy who made Space Balls."
"__MOVIES__ Who was the short guy in Space Balls?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe you're thinking of Rick Moranis."
"__MOVIES__ Rick Moranis was also in Honey I Shrunk the Kids. I think he played the father."
"__MOVIES__ I remember Honey I Shrunk The Kids, it was pretty good. I know there was a sequel, but I never watched it."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I ever saw the sequel either."
"__MOVIES__ Movie sequels are never as good as the originals."
"__MOVIES__ Usually they aren't, but there are some that are just as good or better."
"__MOVIES__ Can you name some that you think are better?"
"__MOVIES__ The second Terminator movie was better than the first one."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, it was quite a bit better. The Godfather part 2 was also better than the first."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, even as good as the first one was, the Godfather part 2 was better."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I ever saw the third one, I wonder how good it was."
"__MOVIES__ Can you think of any other sequels that surpassed the original?"
"__MOVIES__ I think just about everyone agrees that Empire Strikes Back was better than Star Wars, even as great as Star Wars was."
