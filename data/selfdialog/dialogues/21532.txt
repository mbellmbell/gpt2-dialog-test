"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Moana that Disney just released recently?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I have always wanted to see that movie, looks very visually pleasing"
"__DISNEY__ indeed, especially the water, they look so cool"
"__DISNEY__ I have seen the trailer, the big hawaiian dude with a funny girl, I was really intrigued"
"__DISNEY__ yeah, you should go see it, it's really good. Those 2 have a lot of fun lines"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, I would definitely go watch that, just for the fact they have cool sand and water simulation"
"__DISNEY__ I know right, it's pretty amazing what they made in the studio"
"__DISNEY__ All they need is a brilliant idea and a group of artists work together, and voila Moana!"
"__DISNEY__ haha, indeed."
"__DISNEY__ alright, I'll mark that on my schedule"
