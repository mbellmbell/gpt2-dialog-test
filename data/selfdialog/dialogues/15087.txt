"__ACTION__ It is hard to choose a favorite action movie or actor.   Which ones do you like?"
"__ACTION__ I liked John Wayne.  He was in hundreds of movies and always came across as the tough guy hero.  Right to the end with 'The Shootist'"
"__ACTION__ Yeah he sure did the hero role well.  He was even tempered all the time, just don't cross him.  Heck, a real man was like him for real, Ted williams the ball player.  But he made no movies.  The Duke stuck mostly with westerns and war movies."
"__ACTION__ He also did some dramatic roles like in the 'Quiet Man'  where he was a boxer that retired to the Irish countryside.  That was one of his best roles."
"__ACTION__ Sure, 'The Duke' was one of the greatest of all time and Clint Eastwood sure had a good run of it."
"__ACTION__ Who could forget his run with the 'Dirty Harry' series where he was the tough cop rogue who always took out the worst criminals"
"__ACTION__ Then he always got in trouble with his boss.  His line 'Go ahead make my day' was a classic tough guy line used by many afterwards."
"__ACTION__ Then he had some comedy/action movies with 'Every which way but loose'.  Pretty funny with the primate co star.  Clyde they called him."
"__ACTION__ As he got older he leaned to dramatic roles and back to action in 'Grand Torino' where he played a dying old man with little more to lose."
"__ACTION__ He hade the bad guys think he had a gun when he pulled out his lighter and they shot him dead.  A sad ending but he did it for a good cause, defending his unlikely young friend to protect the neighborhood."
