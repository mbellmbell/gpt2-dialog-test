"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Drew Brees?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's good, but he's getting older."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's not as good as he used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right.  I cringed watching most of the games last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even the year before last was kind of tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right?  I really wish they had given the backup quarterback a chance that year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who were the back up quarterbacks over the last couple years?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The ones I remember were Luke McCown and Chase Daniel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah, I remember them both.  Wasn't McCown in that commercial?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the one for the telephone company."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was it.  I had to laugh at that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, why not make the money however you can?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess not.  Even if you have to laugh at yourself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the team as a whole will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully better than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know what you are saying.  Every year it's disappointing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I watch a few games with high hopes, only to be let down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully things go better this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we will see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know when the season starts?"
