"__FASHION__ Sharon,I have been watching the fashion shows and you would not believe what the models have been wearing on their feet."
"__FASHION__ What could it be other than heels, Lexa?"
"__FASHION__ Yes but I have seen them in breathable boots in monochromatic colors at Salvatore Ferragamo."
"__FASHION__ So you think monochromatic colored boots are a hot fashion trend to follow."
"__FASHION__ No, but Erdemâ€™s snakeskin combination with ankle lacing and gorgeous platform heels certainly would make a statement if I ever wore them"
"__FASHION__ Platform heels? Out of the question."
"__FASHION__ You can dress up the plainest of outfits and dresses with a good pair of platform heels."
"__FASHION__ Not with the ones I have seen. Those things are not for me."
"__FASHION__ How do you feel about the flat versions of the platform heels?"
"__FASHION__ Flat version? I have not heard about them."
"__FASHION__ The flat version are a platform and flats combined."
"__FASHION__ So, it's a flat shoe on a platform. Is that what you are telling me?"
"__FASHION__ Yes."
"__FASHION__ Flat shoes are not good for your feet.  I don't wear flat shoes."
"__FASHION__ But they were so cute. There was one that was red and white."
"__FASHION__ You can be cute all the way to the podiatrist if you want."
"__FASHION__ You don't have to wear them all of the time."
"__FASHION__ And you don't have to wear them at all."
"__FASHION__ There's just no winning with you on these shoes is there?"
"__FASHION__ Nope."
