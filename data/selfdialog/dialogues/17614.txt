"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Babadook?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I saw it. Major disappointment."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the reviews said it would be frightening. Hardly! Oh, a haunted book. So scary. The monster was lame, too."
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm...I thought it was absolutely terrifying. The monster was the mother. That's what made it so scary. It resonated with me deeply."
"__MOVIES__ That kid in it was sooooo annoying. I wanted to strangle him."
"__MOVIES__ Yup. That's how kids are. They can really work your nerves. I thought that child actor was excellent. If you wanted to strangle him as viewer, does it not make the movie seem more authentic to you? Because his mother very nearly does strangle him."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah. Point taken. Still, distracted from my movie enjoyment."
"__MOVIES__ Some people think they are dead at the end of the film."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. The magic trick the kid does seems super unlikely."
"__MOVIES__ There is a surreal sense to the closing scene. I understand the theory, but I don't think it's true. I think if they were dead, the father would be there."
"__MOVIES__ And the dog."
"__MOVIES__ I always close my eyes and look away at that scene. I have scene the movie several times, but I have never seen that part."
"__MOVIES__ That was nuts when she pulled her own tooth out."
"__MOVIES__ I read a theory that maybe she started to go insane in part because of a tooth infection. It's a credible theory. When she pulls that tooth out though, you know her transformation into a total beast is complete."
"__MOVIES__ I was not a big fan of the movie, but I will say the mother's acting was good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Her eyes really convey evil and insanity. I felt it was brilliant. I have looked into my own mother's eyes and seen something similar so this was a really poignant movie for me."
"__MOVIES__ I can imagine."
"__MOVIES__ I look forward to more work from this director. I think she has a unique voice."
"__MOVIES__ I will definitely check out her next film and hope that I like it better."
