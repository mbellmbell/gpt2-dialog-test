"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey, did you hear that new rap song?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, I have taste in music and don't listen to rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why not? Rap and hip/hop are the voice of oppressed people."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ When all of the music turns positive, stops demeaning women, other blacks, and quits making up social issues to talk about, I'll consider it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ If you just listen to the lyrics, you'll come away with a much better understanding. The lyrics are deep."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Please. I could put Dr. Seuss's 'Green Eggs and Ham' to a rap beat and have a platinum selling album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You know what it says about you if you don't like rap and hip hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, like I said before, it means I have a good taste in music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Whatever."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Thanks. Try listening to some Rush. THOSE are deep lyrics."
