"__SUPERHERO__ I saw Wonder Woman the other night with my boyfriend."
"__SUPERHERO__ How was it?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought it was pretty good, but not the best movie I've ever seen."
"__SUPERHERO__ What's it even about?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Wonder Woman wants to stop the god of war so World War II ends basically."
"__SUPERHERO__ That sounds kind of cool since it takes place during that time period."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, it was pretty good, but I think they could have done more with it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did you think the movie was too short or something?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, I just felt like it was strange that she came from this weird island in the middle of nowhere. I don't get where Wonder Woman lived I guess."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'll have to see it and let you know what I think."
