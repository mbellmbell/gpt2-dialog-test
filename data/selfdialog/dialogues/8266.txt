"__POP__ What do you think of Lady Gaga?"
"__POP__ Actually I was never a fan of most of her music, but I loved her on American Horror Story."
"__POP__ Did she do a good job acting?"
"__POP__ I think she did, but maybe she just matched her character."
"__POP__ What do you mean by that?"
"__POP__ Well, I think she's a bit odd and her character was odd, so maybe it wasn't a stretch."
"__POP__ Oh, well are there any songs of hers that you do like?"
"__POP__ I really liked You and I.  I loved it and I was surprised when I found out it was her."
"__POP__ Yeah, it shows she can really sing."
"__POP__ Yeah, she can.  She's just a bit peculiar."
