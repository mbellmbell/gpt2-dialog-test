"__HORROR__ You ever see Friday the 13th?"
"__HORROR__ I believe so, the one with Jason and the hockey mask?"
"__HORROR__ Well, yes, but the original one was a bit different."
"__HORROR__ How so?"
"__HORROR__ Well, Jason didn't actually have a hockey mask."
"__HORROR__ Oh really, what did he have?"
"__HORROR__ it was more of a sack with an eye hole"
"__HORROR__ Creepy"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, and the big twist was that his mom was the killer at the lake"
"__HORROR__ I missed that one."
