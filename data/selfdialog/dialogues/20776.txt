"__THRILLER__ Did you ever end up seeing 'Don't Breathe'."
"__THRILLER__ I'm not sure I know what movie that is."
"__THRILLER__ It's the thriller movie where they break into a blind veteran's house."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, now I remember. Was it any good?"
"__THRILLER__ It wasn't that great. It's a shame because I thought the concept was amazing."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, the trailer looked like it had some intense moments."
"__THRILLER__ There were a lot of 'jump scares' in the movie. The acting was pretty bad, though."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, scary movies sometimes suffer from that."
"__THRILLER__ It was cool to see the main villain have a handicap like that, though."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, usually they're just super powerful. It sounds unique in that way."
