"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen Rogue One yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, but I've heard about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Dude, it's awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just saw the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, go see Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's it about?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't want to spoil it, but it's about how Vader becomes the man."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well now that does sound pretty good."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's better than Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Damn, now I've got to see it."
