"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for a good Panther's season this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, Cam Newton has to really step his game up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like Cam Newton gets a bad rap."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean he is a showboat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess for how good he is, he can gloat a little bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All ego aside, even when he was injured, he still played the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, he's really dedicated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he didn't give himself a chance to heal up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That should be  a testament to how much he cares."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems a little selfish to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, they have a stable of other players that could carry the team while he's out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that fair to the rest of the team to keep the star player out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Luke Kuechly could do just a good a job as Cam could and leading."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he would do the same thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Luke was out for weeks with a concussion, and he didn't feel the need to jump back in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't even notice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the point, Cam could have stayed out and came back in at 100%"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you're right. Newton needs to mature a little bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He should stop getting hurt, period."
