"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite album of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Rumours by Fleetwood Mac."
"__MUSIC__ Good choice, although I would say that I preferred their self titled album."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Aside from Rhiannon, I found the album lacking?"
"__MUSIC__ What about Landslide? That's a top five Fleetwood Mac song."
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, I find it too sappy. Besides, I don't think that it is in the same league as Dreams."
"__MUSIC__ Well Dreams is an all time great song. My problem with Rumours is that it's inconsistent."
"__MUSIC__ Please explain."
"__MUSIC__ Well you have a a slower song like Never Going Back Again immediately followed by the more up tempo Don't Stop."
"__MUSIC__ I love that aspect of the album. It shows the complexity and mixed emotions of the band that was experiencing numerous breakups while recording the album."
"__MUSIC__ I would like to agree with you, but I just find it weird that songs as different as Song and You Make Loving Fun can appear on the same album."
"__MUSIC__ To each their own. Although I think that Oh Daddy and Gold Dust Woman are the two most underrated Fleetwood Mac songs ever."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you on Oh Daddy, but God Dust Woman gets its proper respect."
"__MUSIC__ You might be right on that one, I just don't hear it on the radio often."
"__MUSIC__ What are your thoughts on Tusk? You know, the album after Rumours."
"__MUSIC__ I have mixed feelings. The title track is weird because it sounds cluttered."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the song's music video with the USC marching band kind of muffles the song."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed, and Sara doesn't even compare to other Stevie Nicks songs."
"__MUSIC__ Well Stevie Nicks was my favorite member of Fleetwood Mac, so the songs where she has lead vocals tend to be my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Fair. My favorite member is Lindsey Buckingham, so I like a lot of the more guitar heavy songs."
