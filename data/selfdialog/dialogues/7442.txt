"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you know that the name Joanne came from Lady Gaga's aunt?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I didn't know that. I just knew this album felt more personal."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. It's way more stripped down."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That makes sense. I heard she was touring dive bars."
"__LADY_GAGA__ So what's your favorite song from Joanne?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like John Wayne. It feels tough."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like that the album has an almost country music feel in places."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I thought so too. But like, good country music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah. I'm listening to Perfect Illusion right now."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you heard her perform it acoustically yet? It's incredible."
