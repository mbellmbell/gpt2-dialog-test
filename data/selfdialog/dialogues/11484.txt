"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey Shayne what's going on with you today?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just hanging at my pops watching some football tape, you wanna come over?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh definitely man, you watching any teams in particular?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I have to catch my Dolphins man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh right you are a Florida boy before a California boy, even though you live in California."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't root for a team just because I like them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course you can, it is just weird to like a team that doesn't represent the place you live."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I honestly just used to watch Dan Marino all the time and that inspired me to watch the modern era."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is cool, I completely understand having legends inspire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is the same with any sport, I still follow the Bulls because of Jordan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good point, let's watch some Dolphins and classic Titans tape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the Tennessee Titans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh definitely man, I am from California but I always loved the McNair and George combination!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eddie George was  a quick and savage monster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree man, in his hay day he was an absolute beast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you remember McNair was incredible in NFL Blitz?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the best game of all time!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have an old PlayStation, we can actually play it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football and Blitz, classic day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be fun, see you soon."
