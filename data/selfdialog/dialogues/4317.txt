"__MUSIC__ Who is the coolest band ever?"
"__MUSIC__ I can think of some great bands that weren't cool."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! But I'm wondering about the coolest."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, what about some of the early Punk Rock groups? The Ramones or something?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd actually say they weren't cool. They were too edgy to be cool, to nihilistic."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I can get behind that. What about Bob Dylan?"
"__MUSIC__ VERY cool. But not really a band, just one musician."
"__MUSIC__ OK, then what about Nirvana?"
"__MUSIC__ Nirvana was super cool back in their day."
"__MUSIC__ It's hard to think of a band more cool than Nirvana, during the height of the Grunge era."
"__MUSIC__ But at the same time, Kurt Cobain really struggled with success and popularity."
"__MUSIC__ It makes sense, though - He was too cool to be popular!"
"__MUSIC__ Does being cool make your music better or worse, in general?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd probably say it doesn't matter, but that you don't have to be cool to make great music."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed on that - Radiohead, for example."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they don't seem like 'cool' people, really, but they make great music."
"__MUSIC__ I think there are some artists who seem like they're more interested in being cool than making great music."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of a sad thing, I'd say."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely, and a waste of whatever talent they have."
"__MUSIC__ A cool band who makes great music is pretty awesome, though!"
