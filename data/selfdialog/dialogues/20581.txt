"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Captain America: Civil War?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was the best Marvel movie yet."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I especially liked how Spider-man is now portrayed."
"__MOVIES__ The actor was great. I loved his interactions with Iron Man and the others during the big battle in the middle of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That was a great scene. Spider-man and Ant Man added a lot of humor."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the superfluous stuff was boring though, like the scenes with Scarlet Witch and Vision."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
"__MOVIES__ I know they needed something slow between the big action pieces, but it just felt unnecessary."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that. But it's still a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is."
"__MOVIES__ The Spider-man was definitely better than the Garfield or Macguire portrayals."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the first two Macquire movies and the first Garfield one, but the others were pretty bad."
"__MOVIES__ Garfield was a good Spider-man but a poor Peter Parker."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he looks like he's 40 years old. Parker is supposed to be in high school."
"__MOVIES__ Spider-man 3 had to be the worst, though."
"__MOVIES__ Too many villains, too much indulgent garbage."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad Sony came to an agreement with Marvel for the character."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, now we can finally see Spider-man done right."
"__MOVIES__ The upcoming movie does look a lot better than what we've seen in the past."
