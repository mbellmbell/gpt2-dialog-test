"__DISNEY__ Hey, you aren't going to believe this."
"__DISNEY__ What? Tell me."
"__DISNEY__ My husband hasn't seen any of the classic disney movies that we grew up on."
"__DISNEY__ What? You're kidding."
"__DISNEY__ No. I realized it when we went to see the new Beauty and the Beast that he hadn't a clue what was going to happen. He kept asking me obvious questions."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Like, 'Why doesn't she want to be with Gaston? That guy is awesome.'"
"__DISNEY__ No. He was on Gaston's side?"
"__DISNEY__ I kept telling him, no - he's the bad guy. He figured it out in the end."
"__DISNEY__ That's funny."
