"__MUSIC__ What was that band you went to see at the Fillmore in the summer of 2013?"
"__MUSIC__ That was Empire of the Sun!  They are a very good band from Australia."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that they had an outlandish appearance, is that the right band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they look different.  The singer wears a crown-like headdress."
"__MUSIC__ Someone told me they're kind of spacey or something."
"__MUSIC__ Well they're very creative, and they mix electronic and other kinds of music together."
"__MUSIC__ So they have an actual band?  I don't get it."
"__MUSIC__ They have some kind of tape playing and they also have a drummer and a bassist.  The singer plays guitar also."
"__MUSIC__ So that's it, just three people onstage?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they also have four girls who are dancers.  They do all sorts of choreographed stuff and it's interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm.  I imagine they have other elaborate things too onstage, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes they do, absolutely.  There is a screen behind them also which plays videos that have something to do with the song as well."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, so it's a pretty good show and pretty elaborate then."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and they have all kinds of props to do with the songs also.  The girls sometimes are in these mountain things and they come out over the course of the song."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's pretty amazing.  I seem to remember there are only two guys in the actual music videos though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and interestingly enough, only one of them tours, it's the guy with the crown headdress and his name is Luke Steele."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting.  What happens to the other guy?"
"__MUSIC__ He just doesn't tour with them because he's a singer by skill but he doesn't sing on the albums really."
"__MUSIC__ So what kind of duo is that then?"
"__MUSIC__ From what I can tell they are a creative duo but the actual stage show only needs one singer, so it's kind of forced for him to be there on the rare occasions he does show up."
