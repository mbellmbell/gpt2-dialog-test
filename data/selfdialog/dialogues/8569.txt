"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite Beatles Album?"
"__BEATLES__ I think I'd have to go with Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, what about you?"

"__BEATLES__ Interesting. Did you know it's actually not titled the White Album?"
"__BEATLES__ No way - what do you mean?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it's actually a self-titled album."
"__BEATLES__ You mean it's just called 'The Beatles'?"
"__BEATLES__ Yep, exactly. The White Album is just a nickname that has stuck"
