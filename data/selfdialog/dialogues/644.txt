"__MUSIC__ They have seriously got to stop turning movies into musicals."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I dealt with Legally Blonde but they made a musical version of 9 to 5?"
"__MUSIC__ They did. Have you listened to it yet?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I don't think I'm going to. I don't like Dolly Parton."
"__MUSIC__ Ok but you're going to just write the show off without giving it a chance?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the music?"
"__MUSIC__ I have and it's really good."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well a lot of it is really fun and upbeat, including the opening number which is a rework of her 9 to 5 song."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't hate that song I guess."
"__MUSIC__ See? And a lot of the music is like that! There's an office song called Around here which is just like being at work."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I want a song to remind me of being at work."
"__MUSIC__ It's great though, funny but true. The singer on the cast album is Allison Janney which helps make it funny."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't she on The West Wing?"
"__MUSIC__ She was, and awesome there too! She sings this one in that same kind of dry understated way as she acted in that series."
"__MUSIC__ Ha. I might really like that."
"__MUSIC__ And there's another character who has a great song called Get Out and Stay out which is so powerful and strong!"
"__MUSIC__ So it's not a bunch of Dolly songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Well she wrote them but give it a chance. It doesn't sound like you're expecting."
