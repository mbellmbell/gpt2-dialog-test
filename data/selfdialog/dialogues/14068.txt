"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Spurs play the Rockets last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I sure did!  What a crazy game!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I can't believe that the Spurs won by almost 40 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, no one predicted that, especially since they were playing in Houston."
"__BASKETBALL__ And the Spurs won without Kawhi Leonard or Tony Parker!!  Who would believe that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, it's nuts!  And the Rockets just looked terrible."
"__BASKETBALL__ James Hardin looked particularly bad."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, what was wrong with him?  He looked like he didn't want to even be there."
"__BASKETBALL__ So many of the Spurs really stepped up their game.  I was really impressed!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree!  Patty Mills and and especially LaMarcus Aldridge were great!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I can't believe that the Spurs won the series!  My mind is still spinning!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know!  It's so awesome!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think that Kawhi will play in the game against Golden State on Sunday?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know, his ankle seemed pretty bad the other night."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think that the Spurs have any chance of winning the series against Golden State?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Unfortunately, no, I don't think they can."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me neither.  Golden State is just too good."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, no one can beat Steph Curry and Kevin Durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think that Golden State will win the championship then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I think they will face Cleveland in the finals and beat them."
