"__STAR_WARS__ BB-8 is the greatest star wars sidekick of all time!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What are you talking about? Even the Ewoks are better than BB-8."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those fluffy little teddy bears? I don't think so."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Chewbacca?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Chewbacca is no ones sidekick. He is his own man."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's debatable, but even given that, there is no way you can claim BB-8 is a better droid sidekick than R2D2."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sorry, BB-8 just looks cooler."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but R2D2 has much more personality."
"__STAR_WARS__ R2D2 is nothing without C3P0."
"__STAR_WARS__ How can you say that? You are so wrong!"
