"__BEATLES__ Have you seen any of The Beatles movies?"
"__BEATLES__ I saw 'A Hard Day's Night' years ago and enjoyed it."
"__BEATLES__ That's a great movie, they look so young!"
"__BEATLES__ I love their sense of humor in it. The script is great."
"__BEATLES__ Is that the only one you've seen?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, what others are there?"
"__BEATLES__ There's 'Help!' and 'Magical Mystery Tour'."
"__BEATLES__ Oh 'Help!', of course. I've seen clips of it."
"__BEATLES__ And 'Magical Mystery Tour'?"
"__BEATLES__ I haven't seen it but I've heard it's really weird, just like the album of the same name."
