"__MUSIC__ Ironically?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's from the second album, which was reviled in the UK."
"__MUSIC__ Why, that bad?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not great but had the problem of coming after the first album."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ The first album was so perfect, nothing could have lived up to it."
