"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think it's right that tax payers help pay for a new football stadium?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that since it helps bring revenue to the city, then it's kind of a good deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The problem I have with it is that the money never really transfers over back to the tax payers. Only the owners get rich."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose it still benefits the people of the city since they get a new stadium for their team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what about the tax payers who don't care about the NFL? What if they don't watch football or any kind of sport?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess that would suck for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I never did understand why taxpayers had to help pay the bill for a stadium to built."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably because it would be way to expensive for an owner to foot the bill themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if that's the case, then they shouldn't be owning a team in the first place."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't disagree with you there. But like I said, it does benefit the city one way or another."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The way I see it, if the owner of a team wants a new stadium, then they should pay for it themselves. These guys are so rich."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think if that was the case, you would only see a few NFL football teams in a few cities. There aren't that many people willing to spend that much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that would be bad since I actually like watching football. But there has to be a better way than using taxpayer money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess they can compromise by having some of the revenue that teams earn be guaranteed to going back to some of the city's needs like paying for infrastructure and programs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I would be down for that. I just think there has to be more transparency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, considering you're a tax payer, you have the right to bring it up to your local officials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't think that's something I'm gonna have the determination to do. I just thought it was always a weird thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I  agree with you that if I were somebody that didn't watch sports, I would hate to know that my money was going to fund something I had no desire to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they should just tax the people who are football fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would just pretend I didn't like football and not get taxed while I watch secretly in the comfort of my home."
