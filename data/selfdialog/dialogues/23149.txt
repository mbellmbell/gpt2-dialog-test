"__DISNEY__ So many people know Disney for their princess movies, but other ones are great as well."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean. I really liked The Lion King, for instance."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that one is such a classic! I'd say it is one of my favorites, especially since James Earl Jones voices Mufasa."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know that it is based on Shakespeare's play Hamlet?"
"__DISNEY__ I hadn't heard that before. But now that I think about it, it makes sense."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, since his father Mufasa is dead and his uncle Scar tries to take over."
"__DISNEY__ You know, I really enjoyed the sequels to The Lion King as well."
"__DISNEY__ Which one did you like better, The Lion King 2 or The Lion King 1 1/2?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked The Lion King 1 1/2. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious, and I like the whole concept of seeing their side."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it was funny how it was like they were watching the movie with us."
