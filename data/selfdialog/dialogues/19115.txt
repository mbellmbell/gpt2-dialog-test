"__MOVIES__ A lot of people disagree with me here, but I'm a big fan of The Matrix sequels."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I like the first one but I think the sequels are pretty bad."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is a common sentiment. However I think they are underrated."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say so?"
"__MOVIES__ The lore of the Matrix is very deep and interesting and it's expanded vastly in the sequels."
"__MOVIES__ I've never really looked into it, to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ The lore also extends beyond just the films."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ To fully understand the story of The Matrix, you have to watch the Animatrix, which is a anthology film that provides the backstory."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard about that, but never watched it."
"__MOVIES__ You also must play the video game, 'Enter the Matrix' which takes place during the events of The Matrix Reloaded."
"__MOVIES__ I have actually played that game. It's not very good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it got poor reviews from fans and critics. It does however contain over an hour of original footage. So it's worth it just for that, if you're a Matrix fan."
"__MOVIES__ So the story is deeper than, 'Machines enslave humans and plug them into a virtual world?'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, the film series is deeply philosophical and tackles subjects such technophobia, hero-worship, and the essence of humanity."
"__MOVIES__ Are you sure you're not just exaggerating because you're a fan?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's possible, but you should check it out yourself. There are a load of interesting characters."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I will."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention all the amazing action scenes."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give you that. The highway chase scene in Reloaded was pretty amazing."
