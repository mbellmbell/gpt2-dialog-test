"__BASEBALL__ I've never been that interested in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? But you do like some sports, right? I've seen you watching football."
"__BASEBALL__ Baseball is too slow for me."
"__BASEBALL__ Hmm... I guess there's not as much turnover as there is in basketball or football."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly! And I prefer games that score more highly."
"__BASEBALL__ Ha, I have definitely seen low-scoring baseball games."
"__BASEBALL__ But you are a fan though, right? What teams do you support?"
"__BASEBALL__ I support the Cubs primarily."
"__BASEBALL__ What city are there from?"
"__BASEBALL__ Chicago. I also like the Mets."
"__BASEBALL__ Wait, aren't they supposed to much worse than the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ Yup."
"__BASEBALL__ So why do you support them?"
"__BASEBALL__ I like rooting for an underdog. Besides, the Yankees have too many advantages."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean by that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Do you know how huge their budget is compared to some of the other teams?"
"__BASEBALL__ That bad, huh."
"__BASEBALL__ It's like they're playing with a loaded deck. And not even playing with it well!"
"__BASEBALL__ Haha, I see your point."
"__BASEBALL__ Thank you! I'll show you a high-scoring baseball game sometime if you're interested; I have some taped."
