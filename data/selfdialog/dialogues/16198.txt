"__ROCK__ twenty-one pilots are not rock music"
"__ROCK__ what do you mean? the play them on the rock stations!"
"__ROCK__ yeah, but they're obviously pop or rap or something"
"__ROCK__ you could say the same thing about the beastie boys!"
"__ROCK__ um, no. they definitely have a rock edge!"
"__ROCK__ so does twenty-one pilots"
"__ROCK__ the only thing edgy about that pseudo-band is how edgy they think they are"
"__ROCK__ have you even heard stressed out?"
"__ROCK__ okay, yeah. have yOU? because that's clearly a terrible pop song"
"__ROCK__ with a good message, though!"
