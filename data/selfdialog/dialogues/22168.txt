"__DISNEY__ You know, Disney was really good at making me cry growing up."
"__DISNEY__ I know! They had a lot of tear jerkers."
"__DISNEY__ The one that always got me was the Fox and the Hound."
"__DISNEY__ In the scene where she leaves him in the forest? I cry every time."
"__DISNEY__ Even the Best of Friends song will make me tear up when I hear it."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, me too. I can't even play the first notes without my brother yelling at me to stop."
"__DISNEY__ I always wished Todd and--what was the dog's name?"
"__DISNEY__ Copper,  I think."
"__DISNEY__ That's right! I always wished they could have been friends in the end."
"__DISNEY__ Me too; it's a shame they had to leave each other because of their positions."
