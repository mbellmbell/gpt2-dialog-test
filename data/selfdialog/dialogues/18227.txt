"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen The Fifth Element?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I love that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I love it too. I thought the effects were really cool. These days everything is CGI, but they used real props in The Fifth Element."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, mostly. But I think it would be really fun if they remade it with better effects."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know about that. I'm actually really sick of remakes."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I think they're fun."
"__MOVIES__ I just wish we could see more original content out there. These days, Hollywood just seems to be rehashing ideas."
"__MOVIES__ I get that. What about a sequel though?"
"__MOVIES__ I think a sequel might be good, but it's been 20 years since the original. Do you think the original cast could hack it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. Milla Jovovich still looks great and Bruce Willis just has less hair."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I feel like the movie was good by itself. If they made a sequel, they could end up over-complicating the whole story. Maybe even ruining it."
"__MOVIES__ You're so pessimistic!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, look what happens to so many movies that get sequels. The bigwigs in Hollywood just try to milk whatever they can out of successful films, and the quality starts to drop, or the story stops making sense at all. Just look what happened to the Alien franchise."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Didn't you see Alien: Covenant?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a total cop-out, the way that they explained the origin of the aliens. It's like the writers got so lazy. I thought that the aliens were supposed to be this super highly-evolved race. The idea that they were basically bred or engineered is just so dumb."
"__MOVIES__ I think you should lighten up. It wasn't that bad!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'm just more invested into the franchise than you are."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose so. I like it, but it's not my favorite."
