"__COMEDY__ Hey, do you want to come watch The Hangover?"
"__COMEDY__ That sounds like a good idea. I love those movies."
"__COMEDY__ So do I. I can't believe they managed to make all of them so funny!"
"__COMEDY__ I know, I thought they would jump the shark with the third one, but they held strong."
"__COMEDY__ Ed Helms kills me in those movies, he's such a great actor."
"__COMEDY__ I really like how his character progresses throughout all three movies."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, he's like a whole new person by the end."
"__COMEDY__ I loved him in We're the Millers, he was a maniac in that movie."
"__COMEDY__ That movie was all around awesome. That cast was a complete slam dunk."
"__COMEDY__ You're totally right on that!"
