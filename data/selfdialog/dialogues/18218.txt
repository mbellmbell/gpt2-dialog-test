"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they're kind of fun once in a while."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite one?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. If I had to pick, I'd have to say that one movie where the people think they're being haunted by ghosts, but the people actually are the ghosts in the end."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen that movie too! I think it's called The Others."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's it! I love that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I like it too! I never saw that twist coming."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't either! Unfortunately, it's not the best movie to watch over and over because of that though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it kind of reminds me of Shutter Island in that way."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean. Shutter Island was so good though!"
"__MOVIES__ I really liked it the first time I saw it, but the next time it wasn't nearly as scary."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I think I've only seen it twice because of that."
"__MOVIES__ Remember the movie The Village?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that one had such a crazy twist!"
"__MOVIES__ I kind of liked it even though no one else I knew did."
"__MOVIES__ I liked it too. It was original at least."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess I could see how some people might have found the ending a let down though."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of ended up being a scary movie that wasn't really a scary movie in a way."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was only scary the first time and then it's just funning watching it for the foreshadowing."
"__MOVIES__ We should watch that soon. I haven't seen it in forever!"
