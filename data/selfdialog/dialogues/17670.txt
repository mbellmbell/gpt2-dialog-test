"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Arrival?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't seen it. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Amy Adams was the main star. Forrest Whitaker also had a good role."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't that based on an award winning science fiction story?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was based on 'Story of Your Life' by Ted Chiang"
"__MOVIES__ Who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ Denis Villeneuve"
"__MOVIES__ The French Canadian guy? Cool. I liked some of his stuff. What was Arrival about? I heard it was very smart."
"__MOVIES__ It is quite brilliant. The premise is that aliens visit Earth, and learning their language changes our perception of time. But on a deeper level it is about something else entirely."
"__MOVIES__ What would you say the deeper level is?"
"__MOVIES__ It was about being a parent whose child dies young, and asks: if you knew all the pain you would go through, would you still do it? Would it be worth it?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a profound question. But the language stuff, how did that fit in?"
"__MOVIES__ It was based on an extreme interpretation of the Sapir-Worf Hypothesis: the language you speak changes how you experience reality. The alien language caused one to perceive time all at once, so you would know what was going to happen."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds crazy. I heard Arrival compared to Contact with Jodie Foster. Would you agree?"
"__MOVIES__ I have seen Contact and also loved it. There were definite parallels, but this goes in a very different direction."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that Jodie Foster's character was closely based on Carl Sagan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I remember reading his wife said it was like watching him. The curiosity and pro-science aspect of that character was so wonderful to see."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad there are some more intelligent science fiction movies coming out, even if they are few and far between."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, those are the ones I go for, and those are two of the best. I appreciate aliens that are intelligent and caring, and don't just want to kill and smash things!"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, although that can be fun too--take the Alien movies for example!"
