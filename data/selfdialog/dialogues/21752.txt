"__DISNEY__ Have you ever watched the classic Disney movie, Fantasia?"
"__DISNEY__ No. I've heard of it though. Isn't it about a vampire bar?"
"__DISNEY__ HaHa. No. You are thinking of a television series that is no longer showing."
"__DISNEY__ Well, tell me about the movie, Fantasia, then."
"__DISNEY__ Oh gosh, I can't remember what year it was actually made, but it is completely antimated."
"__DISNEY__ Was it made before we were born?"
"__DISNEY__ Uh, yes, we're not that old. (Laughing)"
"__DISNEY__ Speak for yourself. haha"
"__DISNEY__ It's just incredibly amazing. It must have taken the cartoonists literally years to finish it."
"__DISNEY__ You mean every scene, every illustration in the movie was hand drawn by the artists? Wow!"
