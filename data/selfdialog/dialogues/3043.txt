"__MUSIC__ So, what other covers do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I liked Johnny Cash's version of 'Hurt'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Although I do have to admit, I like the original just a bit better."
"__MUSIC__ What?!?  Blasphemy!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know, I know, but I just like the darker edge of the original."
"__MUSIC__ But JC's version really puts a new spin on it.  I mean, Razor's just kind being angsty in general, but Cash, he puts the perspective of a man truly facing the end of his life."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I Know, and it's a really powerful part of the song, but still... I prefer the older one."
"__MUSIC__ Well, fair enough."
"__MUSIC__ oh, interesting trivia fact about that video, by the way..."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, which video?"
"__MUSIC__ The one with Cash."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.  Go ahead..."
"__MUSIC__ Most of it was improvised.  At the scene where Cash is playing the piano and his wife is watching him"
"__MUSIC__ June Carter."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah!  Anyway, June is watching from the... the stair I think, and she's got this concerned look on her face.  None of that was planned or rehearsed, they just capture how she was really looking at him"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's pretty interesting, and a bit sad. I think at the time Johnny wasn't in the best of health, so you're she was probably always worried about him."
"__MUSIC__ That's true but, crazily enough, she ended up passing away before him."
"__MUSIC__ Imagine that must hav ebeen quite a blow."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely."
