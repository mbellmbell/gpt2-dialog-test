"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Requiem for a Dream?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh gosh, with Jared Leto and Jennifer Jason Leigh?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, my bad.  Yes, I have seen it."
"__MOVIES__ It's a Daron Aronofsky movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it came out back around 2000 didn't it? I remember seeing it in high school."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  What a chilling movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it really sticks with you."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was based after a book, wasn't it? I read that somewhere."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm pretty sure I heard that too.  It's really depressing to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I found it hard to watch to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's almost like a public service announcement."
"__MOVIES__ Well it sure does scare the viewer.  I think it's a positive thing to watch, though."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe so.  It's definitely disturbing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  I think it's a pretty accurate depiction of addiction, though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, probably one of the most accurate I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ And at least it doesn't glorify it like some movies do."
"__MOVIES__ That's true!  I can't stand seeing that happen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it should almost be shown as a drug prevention movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it would work as that aside from the inappropriate scenes."
