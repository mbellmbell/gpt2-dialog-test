"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the Cubs-Cardinals series this weekend?"
"__BASEBALL__ I caught two games."
"__BASEBALL__ What is up with the Cubs right now?"
"__BASEBALL__ I know. They are really struggling."
"__BASEBALL__ First it was poor starting pitching this season."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the first inning runs were a huge problem."
"__BASEBALL__ But now that pitching is getting better, the bats are cold."
"__BASEBALL__ It's really baffling. Almost every hitter is struggling."
"__BASEBALL__ You'd think a team that just won the World Series would still be performing well."
"__BASEBALL__ I wonder if that is part of it. Too much pressure on a very young team."
"__BASEBALL__ That is highly possible. But the veterans aren't doing so hot either."
"__BASEBALL__ I really hope it's a temporary slump."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too. What do you think of the bullpen so far?"
"__BASEBALL__ The pen is the only reliable part right now."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. The bullpen is the only reliable part."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, even when they have given up runs, it's not really they're fault that the offense isn't providing run support."
"__BASEBALL__ Hopefully the upcoming home games will help."
"__BASEBALL__ They are playing Cincinnati. The Reds are always good for the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I think we'll see a few homeruns."
"__BASEBALL__ And that could be what they need to get out of the slump."
