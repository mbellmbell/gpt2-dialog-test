"__SUPERHERO__ I honestly feel like Jared Leto's portrayal of Joker was one of the best and wish they had shown more of him."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree but the way they edited him in the movies it makes it hard for some to enjoy him as much."
"__SUPERHERO__ I heard that he is going to be in the next Batman movie with Ben Affleck."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh that will be really cool to see. I hope he gets more screen time and we see how he is with The Joker even more."
"__SUPERHERO__ I just hope it is better than Suicide Squad."
"__SUPERHERO__ I do as well. I felt like the bad guy for suicide squad was too big of a villain for that group."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah and the way they had Dead Shot portrayed was disappointing as well."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. Some of his character didn't make sense for that movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ The best part was seeing Harley Quinn on the big screen."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know. I hope they have her in the Batman movie too."
