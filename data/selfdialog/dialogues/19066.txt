"__MOVIES__ What movies are you looking forward to this year?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm really excited about that new Spider-Man movie."
"__MOVIES__ I thought you hated the Spider-Man movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did because of all the constant reboots."
"__MOVIES__ Yea that was getting pretty annoying."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously, I don't need a new actor playing Spiderman every year."
"__MOVIES__ I can see how that would upset you, so what's different now?"
"__MOVIES__ It seems like they are actually trying to tie Spiderman into the Marvel Universe now."
"__MOVIES__ What does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, before the movie-studio owned the rights to Spiderman."
"__MOVIES__ Why does that matter."
"__MOVIES__ Because you had all the Marvel characters like Wolverine, Iron Man, Thor and whatnot in a completely different box than Spiderman, even though they weren't supposed to be."
"__MOVIES__ So what's changed?"
"__MOVIES__ Now Marvel has the rights to Spiderman back so he can be put in all the Marvel Movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you mean like how he was in Captain America Civil War?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, now he's part of the entire cast."
"__MOVIES__ So that makes you more likely to see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely, knowing that's my spiderman from here on out makes it much more enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ All I want is a little continuity, that isn't such a huge request."
