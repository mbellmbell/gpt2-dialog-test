"__BASKETBALL__ How about that young talent on the sixers?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, but Embiid can't stay healthy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh no, hes healthy and domiant."
"__BASKETBALL__ Idk but if he isnt the core doesnt look as good."

"__BASKETBALL__ What is potential when it doesnt translate to the court."
"__BASKETBALL__ Look, Embiid and Simmons together isn't appealing to you?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, it is, but I'll believe it when I see it."
"__BASKETBALL__ What if we get Lowry. Then will you believe?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I might. That would be a good pickup, but he wants a lot of money."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hes coming off his best year at age 31. Give him the money."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess but dont go crazy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Add Lowry to that core and you're in the playoffs. No?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I dont know about that, but maybe."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Eastern Conference is rough."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, its not the strongest."
"__BASKETBALL__ We'll see how we fare. I wanna see everyone healthy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, lets see it!"
