"__MOVIES__ What movies were never made that you wish were made?"
"__MOVIES__ I definitely wish they made a Chuck movie."
"__MOVIES__ That was such a great TV show!"
"__MOVIES__ I know and there were even rumors about a movie."
"__MOVIES__ I guess something prevented them from making it."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely wasn't Zachary Levi. He really pushed for a movie and he would have been great in one!"
"__MOVIES__ The main reason I would have liked a movie is the show didn't really get justice in the finale."
"__MOVIES__ I know that whole thing with Sarah losing her memory and then not exactly getting it back was a cliffhanger."
"__MOVIES__ They kissed at the end but it's like does Sarah know who Chuck is yet?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a really strange and unnecessary cliffhanger."
"__MOVIES__ At least if they made a movie they could have wrapped up this strange twist in the first 10 minutes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah then the rest of the movie could be crazy missions."
"__MOVIES__ I would have loved to see more missions with Grimes!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes the movie would have been perfect for that!"
"__MOVIES__ He got to tag along with a few towards the end of the show but never really got a big role in the missions."
"__MOVIES__ Imagine if Grimes saved the world in the movies."
"__MOVIES__ That would be incredible."
"__MOVIES__ This movie had so much potential it is a shame it will never be made."
"__MOVIES__ Never say never but it is definitely unlikely."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah if by some miracle the movie gets made I will watch it 100 times."
