"__MOVIES__ Do you like horror comedy movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I've seen a few, why?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw this great movie the other day called Get Out.  Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't but I heard about it.  How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was excellent.  it was funny and scary and thought provoking."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great.  Who was in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams, among others."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I haven't heard of them."
"__MOVIES__ Don't worry about that.  They did an excellent job.  And Jordan Peele, from Key and Peele, wrote and directed it."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  Wow!  I didn't know he did horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was surprising to find out but he did an awesome job."
"__MOVIES__ So what's the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't want to spoil it for you but this black guy is dating a white girl and they go to meet her family and some crazy stuff happens."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I guess I'll have to check it out if I want to find out more, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it will be worth your time.  It's still playing in theaters and it's definitely worth the couple dollars."
"__MOVIES__ Is it too scary to bring my 12 year old to?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, I don't think it was scary or gory in that way but they probably won't understand a lot that is going on.  It may be a bit too complex for a younger kid."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, no problem.  I'm gonna check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Great, I hope you enjoy it!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure I will, thanks!"
