"__DISNEY__ Can you name every one of the dwarfs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course I can. Doc, Dopey, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Bashful, and Grumpy!"
"__DISNEY__ Hey you have a really good memory. I always forget at least one of them."
"__DISNEY__ Well it's one of my favorite Disney movies. 'Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?'"
"__DISNEY__ Did you just quote the Evil Queen?"
"__DISNEY__ You know I did! I was so scared of her when I was little."
"__DISNEY__ Especially when she was disguised as the old lady."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah Snow White was a very nice person because I'm not sure I would have helped her."
"__DISNEY__ Well if she ever learned not to talk to strangers then it wouldn't have been a problem."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure she had the best parental guidance since she was living with 7 kind dwarfs out in a cabin after her stepmother tried to have her killed."
