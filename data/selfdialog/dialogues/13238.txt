"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are examples of wrong teams being in the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The panthers beat the falcons in the 'who is the least crappy in the nfc south' bowl for the honor of facing Arizona's third string QB in the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lindley was our 4th, not 3rd QB. I really hated that season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait what? I remember Palmer -> Stanton -> Lindley. Who else was there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Logan Thomas was just after Stanton"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's Logan 'I only throw 88 yard TDs into tight windows' Thomas to you"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 1/9 81 yards TD. What the heck even was that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The completion was his first throw too I think"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's like the 3rd string qb that was ahead of Brady on the pats. First career pass was a 70 yard Hail Mary, then he was like 2/9 for 20 yards and an int after that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ still better than 0/8, he could have at least thrown an interception, then we would know he was at least throwing near a receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure which was a more hopeless playoff run - you that year or the Vikings with Joe Webb."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did we even lose that game when we beat them in their own house a few weeks earlier. That just ticked me off Matt Ryan didn't even seem pumped"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was my first NFL game. Not a great first game. It was the falcons continuously failing to move down the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My first season was 2010 and I felt pretty slapped in the face with how that ended too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Ryan 'The God' Lindley also almost beat you with 64 yards total in 2012."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Matt Ryan threw five picks he seemed really off that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There was a reason for the attitude in the game. That year the team was basically playing for Coach Smiths job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So we threw the game because mike smith didn't think he would keep his job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The same way the Bucs are gonna keep missing the playoffs: Mike Smith 'Toughness'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, except Mike Smith isn't running crap but the defense and they have improved from an already solid team."
