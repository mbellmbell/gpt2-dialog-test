"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think are the top four favorites for the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to pick four I would say #1, obviously the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obvious, but tell me why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same amazing squad year, and added Cooks, Gronk back to full health."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't disagree with that one, they were dominant last year, and only got better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Barring Injury, lock for the one seed, and lock for the AFC championship game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is #2?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For #2 I would have to go with the Cowboys, but I am not as strong as this one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whys that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Between the #2 and #6 teams, it iust a lot more close, but I'd go with the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea the cowboys were great this year, still have an amazing line, and Prescott and Zeke should only be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ #3 would be the Falcons, offensively dominant team. Julio, Ryan, great backfield."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I might disagree you with you there and say the PAckers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Packers are my #4 team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok I'll take that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ #5 is the Seahawks, the D is still strong, and the offense is improved."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, It seems we both agree that the top half of the NFL is NFC dominant right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely. #6 would even be the Giants after the Marshall pick up, that is really going to provide an open field for both himself, and Odell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Manning is likely to put up superb fantasy numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would def. agree with that."
