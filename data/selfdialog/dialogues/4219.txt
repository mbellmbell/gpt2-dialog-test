"__MUSIC__ I really want to go to more concerts. I just never see anyone I really like coming here."
"__MUSIC__ Concerts are great, you don't have to see just artists you know."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but I don't want to pay the high prices for tickets and end up hating the show."
"__MUSIC__ You know, you might be surprised. I went to a Mike Doughty show once because a friend had an extra ticket, it was amazing."
"__MUSIC__ You hadn't heard him before?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I had no idea who he was, but he was really good. Just see who is playing locally and take a chance!"
"__MUSIC__ I might, but I really can't waste money on chances very often."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe try a free concert. Some parks and businesses host free concert series especially in the summer."
"__MUSIC__ That's an idea, I wonder if there's anything like that nearby."
"__MUSIC__ I once saw Postmodern Jukebox and Lyle Lovett play at LL Bean. Both concerts were fantastic and totally free!"
"__MUSIC__ That's amazing! I love PMJ!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Also local festivals and fairs almost always have live music."
"__MUSIC__ I hadn't thought about that! You're right I had a friend who loved to go the fair because of the music."
"__MUSIC__ You have to pay to get in, but if the band is disappointing, you're at the fair! I saw a bunch of country that way, Bryan White, Blackhawk, and Paul Brandt."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not super into country, but it's still a good idea."
"__MUSIC__ It's not just country. A lot of bands play fairs and festivals, it was just what I was into at the time."
"__MUSIC__ What about like music festivals? Have you ever been to one?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been to a few. They are a great way to see several bands all for one ticket."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a lot of fun."
"__MUSIC__ They really are! We should see if there are any coming up and we could go together."
