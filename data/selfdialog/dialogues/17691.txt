"__MOVIES__ I recently saw Moana."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the singer for Moana was amazing. Such a pretty voice!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree! her songs were really beautiful. What did you think of the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ Eh, not one of Disney's most interesting. I'm kind of trying of the chosen one trope."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too."
"__MOVIES__ It was no Mulan, that's for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Hahaha, you mean no Zootopia."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I love Zootopia! I love the characterization, the humor, the depth of the plot . . ."
"__MOVIES__ It's really amazing, isn't it? Have you seen the Beauty and the Beast remake yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, though I hope to soon."
"__MOVIES__ I won't tell you any spoilers then, but it's definitely worth a watch."
"__MOVIES__ Good to hear! I wasn't super impressed by the Cinderella remake."
"__MOVIES__ Neither was I."
"__MOVIES__ But then again, Cinderella isn't one of my favorite fairy tales anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Same here."
"__MOVIES__ Which Disney movie would you most like a live action adaptation of?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm...Maybe Anastasia?"
"__MOVIES__ That's not Disney! I'd pick Mulan."
"__MOVIES__ Good choice."
