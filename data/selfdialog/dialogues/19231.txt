"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Star Wars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Did you really just ask that question?"
"__MOVIES__ I know it's surprising but some people have never seen any of the movies."
"__MOVIES__ I feel bad for those people!"
"__MOVIES__ I know I can't imagine reaching adulthood never having seen Star Wars or wanting to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Some people are just unlucky to not want to immediately see it."
"__MOVIES__ I also can't stand the people who have only seen the new Star Wars movies and claim they're better then the old ones."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, they claim the new ones are better and they have never seen the old ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I just don't get how they can make such a bold statement."
"__MOVIES__ The new Star Wars movies wouldn't even exist if the old ones weren't made first."
"__MOVIES__ That is a great point. I am sure the new ones have great effects and everything but they can't beat the plots of the original movies."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly better effects never equal better movies."
"__MOVIES__ You are right there have been awful movies with great special effects."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest I've never seen the new Star Wars movies."
"__MOVIES__ Neither have I honestly."
"__MOVIES__ So I guess we are just as bad as the people who have only seen the new ones yet claim they are better."
"__MOVIES__ Yes we should probably watch the new Star Wars movies so we can make a better opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree and we should watch them together."
"__MOVIES__ Great idea let's watch them together soon."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good it was great talking about Star Wars with you!"
