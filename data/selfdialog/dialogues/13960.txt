"__BASKETBALL__ Do you do the whole March Madness thing?"
"__BASKETBALL__ You mean do I try to fill out the brackets?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, that, but also do you watch all the games?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I like basketball, but that's too many games.  I watch a good amount and check out scores and highlights for others."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you have a favorite team?"
"__BASKETBALL__ My alma mater, of course.  College teams change pretty rapidly though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I guess there's a lot of player turnover as they graduate and bring in new talent."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yup.  You like basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's okay.  My brother played in high school and I think it ups the tension and excitement when you know someone playing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it does.  Was your brother any good?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, he was.  Won quite a few games, went to state."
"__BASKETBALL__ Huh, well good for him."
"__BASKETBALL__ He still plays, you know, pick-up games and with his friends."
"__BASKETBALL__ He must really like it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he played football and baseball in school, too, but basketball was always his game of choice."
"__BASKETBALL__ So, he's into March Madness, too, I bet."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, he is.  He will watch games on his phone and honestly I think the screen is just too small to catch everything."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know, with how clear the picture is with phones now, you can see a lot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Basketball is a lot of very quick action that covers a lot of distance on the court, so I think it needs a bigger screen so you don't miss anything."
"__BASKETBALL__ You might be right, but sometimes all th matters is who is winning."
