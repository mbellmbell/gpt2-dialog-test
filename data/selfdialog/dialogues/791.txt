"__MUSIC__ That is a very popular song. What did you say?"
"__MUSIC__ I argued that it is Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynyrd."
"__MUSIC__ That is a pretty good pick actually."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like everyone knows that song. While Billie jean is a great song, I think more people know Sweet Home Alabama."

"__MUSIC__ You could be right, which ones?"
"__MUSIC__ What about Stairway To Heaven by Led Zeppelin?"
"__MUSIC__ I did not even think about that one,nice choice."
