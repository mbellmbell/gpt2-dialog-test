"__ROCK__ do you think emo music even counts as rock music?"
"__ROCK__ yeah, i think so. emo music is kind of a vast genre at this point"
"__ROCK__ true!"
"__ROCK__ it can be anything from bright eyes to taking back sunday"
"__ROCK__ but would you say those are rock bands?"
"__ROCK__ yeah, i would! taking back sunday uses rock instruments, they're clearly a rock band."
"__ROCK__ what about bright eyes, though? is that still rock?"
"__ROCK__ soft rock, but i would say rock nonetheless."
"__ROCK__ songs like cleanse song make bright eyes seem a little closer to baroque pop"
