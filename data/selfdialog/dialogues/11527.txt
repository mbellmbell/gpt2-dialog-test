"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the winningest QB for the superbowl is Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. He's gone to 7 and won 5."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which ones did he lose?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He lost in consecutive apperances in 08 and 12. Both against Eli Manning and the giants."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's gotta sting"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A Giants and Patriots rematch in superbowl is a must. We have to see it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will win if that does happen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who knows, if it doesn't happen this year, we're talking Brady in his 40s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa. Brady is 40 already?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's 39, but the superbowl will be next year, so he will be 40, but if it doesn't happen this season, we're talking about brady being 41 and older"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder who the oldest QB ever to win the superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easy. Peyton Manning. The 50th superbowl last year. He was 39"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's the second oldest?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Elway, he held thast record until Mannning took it away. Elway was 38."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's funny Elway owns the Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it's a good your team won tough, so losing a record isn't really a big deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Guess so. So, wait if Brady is 39 now, and then he was 38 uring the last superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. He doesn't have too many years left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish he'd go this year and at least tie Manning's record"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be a sight to see."
