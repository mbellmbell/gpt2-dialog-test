"__MUSIC__ Did you ever take a music cruise?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, through Cayamo. There's others, too."
"__MUSIC__ You like that country stuff though, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I like good music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, no offense. I like some country too. Just not the twangy stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I like it all. Especially the twangy stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Uh, that makes it easy."
"__MUSIC__ And taking the cruise makes it easier. You dont have to park, or worry about driving, you know?"
"__MUSIC__ Or worry about radicals I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's important these days."
"__MUSIC__ Also, you sometimes actually get to talk to the performers, they say."
"__MUSIC__ Not all of them. But the ones that are building their fan base, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ And you're not in nosebleed seats either, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Nope, you're right up close. And in the middle of the beautiful blue sea."
"__MUSIC__ Do you visit ports?"
"__MUSIC__ You can if you want to. Some people don't bother."
"__MUSIC__ Is it expensive, though?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I mean, you're gonna take a vacation anyway, right?"
"__MUSIC__ And plenty of music."
"__MUSIC__ And you never get dragged through a museum, or a big old church, either."
