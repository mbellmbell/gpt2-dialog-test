"__BASEBALL__ Did you catch the game against the Minnesota Twins and Colorado Rockies?"
"__BASEBALL__ I did! How many strike outs did Berrios have again?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think he had 11 strike outs."
"__BASEBALL__ That's incredible. He's been a real shining star for our team lately."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure has. Especially after that earlier afternoon games with the twins losing 5-1."
"__BASEBALL__ That game was brutal to watch."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure was. Thank goodness we pulled through with the night game. Snapped a losing streak for us."
"__BASEBALL__ Interleague has been a humiliating part of the season for us. No doubt!"
"__BASEBALL__ Could you imagine, 3 losses in a row? That would put us in 2nd place. We need to stay strong this season."
"__BASEBALL__ Hey, at least we aren't as bad as the 3rd place New York Mets."
"__BASEBALL__ Haha! They've been true disasters this year with that pitching scandal and all."
"__BASEBALL__ We have great pitchers this year and Berrios has been a shining star for us."
"__BASEBALL__ Who do we play next?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Twins are playing the Royals next...at home."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh no! Our home record has been awful this year. We need to just keep playing on the road."
"__BASEBALL__ Last I checked Paul Molitor was joking around they will just wear their gray uniforms at home to get in that mindset."
"__BASEBALL__ Ha! They should also display the Royals colors all over the stadium."
"__BASEBALL__ Ha! Good One. I'm looking forward to the game, it should be a good one."
"__BASEBALL__ Luckily it should be a blow out with Kansas losing all 5 games against us this year. We should go to the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Great idea. I'll look at tickets."
