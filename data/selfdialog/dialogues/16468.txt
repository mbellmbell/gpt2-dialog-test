"__MOVIES__ What movie did you see this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder Woman, it was great."
"__MOVIES__ You hadn't seen it yet? It's so good."
"__MOVIES__ No I didn't! It was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's so good. Did you know Gal Gadot was pregnant while filming some of it?"
"__MOVIES__ What? That's crazy, how did she do that?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea. I think they used a green screen to edit out the baby bump or something."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, the technology they have for films these days is insane."
"__MOVIES__ I know! The special effects in the film are super good all around."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, and Themyscira looks so amazing, I wish it were real."
"__MOVIES__ I know, me too. It's awesome that Wonder Woman is literally part goddess."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! It's great they kept her whole backstory like in the comics."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, it's super cool that she's not just a random person like some superheroes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I agree, she really has it all."
"__MOVIES__ None of the other superheroes are nearly as cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, have they already said they're making a second movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they're writing it now!"
"__MOVIES__ Great, I can't wait to see it already."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither, if the first is anything to go by."
"__MOVIES__ Wonder Woman is the best."
