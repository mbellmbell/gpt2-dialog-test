"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen any zombie movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, actually, though I kind of regret them."
"__MOVIES__ Aww C'mon. Which ones where they?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one was World War Z, with Brad Pitt."
"__MOVIES__ Oh isn't that the one where he has to try to save his family or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they wanted to find a cure but he had to go through all these challenges to get it."
"__MOVIES__ And they find out that the zombifier was a disease?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. That was it."
"__MOVIES__ So how did the movie strike you?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a little terrifying at first - all these like bloodthirsty beings coming after you and the girl having an asthma attack."
"__MOVIES__ And then?"
"__MOVIES__ And then I just kind of felt bad for the people that got sick! What a horrible way to die. I'd be devastated if my family went through that."
"__MOVIES__ What was the other zombie movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It was the Maze Runner: the Scorch Trials."
"__MOVIES__ That one is a zombie flick?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it didn't start out that way but then I guess the story line was too boring so they got thrown in about halfway through."
"__MOVIES__ You don't sound too impressed."
"__MOVIES__ Well I'm not. They felt really tacked on and honestly laughable."
"__MOVIES__ So not fear inspiring?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not at all! I just wanted those sequences to be over with already."
