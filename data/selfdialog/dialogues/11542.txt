"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Carolina Panthers this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are going to have a much more dynamic offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea me too, I think those rookies they picked up are going to have a big impact."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam really needs to step it up a bit this year in the passing game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, he's a great mobile QB, but he's fallen off a bit since his rookie season in passing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they certainly do have a lot more targets now for him to throw to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, McCaffrey is just going to be all over the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Devin Funchess hopefully progresses into a bigger role."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea if he can step it up a bit, that would be amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Benjamin and Funchess two twin towers on the outside, with McCaffrey, and Samuel slicing over the field with speed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Greg Olsen of course too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as their offense steps up a bit I think they win the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The defense is solid, a lot just depends on how much the corners and secondary has improved."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, I did like how we brought buck Munnerlyn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember, Worley had 87 tackles as a rookie corner last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I really believe Bradberry is the playmaker, look for him to step up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea if those two can improve upon their rookie season, they will be a solid duo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The front seven bring back Julius Peppers too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So happy we brought back Peppers and Munnerlyn!"
