"__BEATLES__ When's the last time you listened to The Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know, last week?"
"__BEATLES__ Huh. There goes my theory, I guess..."
"__BEATLES__ What's your theory?"
"__BEATLES__ That anyone in 2017 who listens to The Beatles is actually just faking it. Because honestly, there's so much new, good music."
"__BEATLES__ Wow...harsh."
"__BEATLES__ I'm just saying. Why listen to The Beatles when you can listen to Lorde?"
"__BEATLES__ Um...you kind of can't compare The Beatles to Lorde."
"__BEATLES__ Just did, though. So what are you gonna do about it?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm going to blast Ticket To Ride, that's what I'm gonna do!"
