"__BASEBALL__ Hey, let's go to a baseball game. It's supposed to be a nice day."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, ok, darn it. Who's playing?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Twins are playing blah blah blah."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you phrase it like that? I kind of want to know."
"__BASEBALL__ Does it matter? The Twins could lose the Springfield Isotopes."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, ok, let's go. We're here already. Man, that was fast."
"__BASEBALL__ God bless the light rail that only travels in one direction. It was pretty fast though. But it did take us 40 minutes to get to the parking lot at the Mall."
"__BASEBALL__ Twins!!!!!!!!!! Let's go!!!!!  Aaarg! Actually, I want a hot dog."
"__BASEBALL__ I want some beer. Let's grab two or three or twelve. I brought my Mom's credit card."
"__BASEBALL__ We can't carry all of these to our seats. I guess we'll have to stand here and drink them. We can watch on one of the many high definition screens in this beautiful and still clean concourse."
"__BASEBALL__ Hey, everyone is yelling. What happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ Man, look at that tight shirt. You say something?"
"__BASEBALL__ I gotta go. Can you hold my beer?"
"__BASEBALL__ I have to go too. Let's bring them with. The line will be long anyway and standing makes me thirsty."
"__BASEBALL__ Everyone is yelling again. What happened? Hey you, you know what happened? Mauer got on base!?! That calls for a drink."
"__BASEBALL__ He'll get tagged out. He's slower than Denny Green on salad day."
"__BASEBALL__ What happened? I can't hear over my own tinkle. Mauer's headed toward second?"
"__BASEBALL__ Ohhh, he tripped. Well, he did get in sight of second base. He's improving."
"__BASEBALL__ Look at me. I'm drinkin' while peeiing. Weeeee! I'm a filter."
"__BASEBALL__ This is the best game ever."
