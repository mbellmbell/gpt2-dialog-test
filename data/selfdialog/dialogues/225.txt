"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to hardcore punk?"
"__MUSIC__ Back in the day I listened to a bit, but not too much."
"__MUSIC__ Who did you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I loved Minor Threat."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know that band."
"__MUSIC__ Really? They were one of the most famous hardcore bands."
"__MUSIC__ I am just starting to learn about it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they were from Washington D.C. and they started their own record label called Dischord."
"__MUSIC__ Why did they stand out to you?"
"__MUSIC__ They were a straight edge band with energetic and somewhat positive songs."
"__MUSIC__ What is straight edge?"
"__MUSIC__ Basically, it means no living a clean life without drugs and alcohol."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Minor Threat fans used to draw an 'X' on their hand to symbolize being straight edge."
"__MUSIC__ Why an 'X'?"
"__MUSIC__ Not exactly sure. If I remember correctly, it had something to due with the marks given to kids under 21 at all ages concerts."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. Okay. What album do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I recommend the album Out of Step. If you like them, check out Fugazi. It's the lead singer's other band. It's far more melodic. They are one of my favorite bands of that era."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have multiple albums? Which one do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Their self-titled debut is amazing. Get that!"
