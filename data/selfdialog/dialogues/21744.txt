"__DISNEY__ Robin Williams is one of my all time favorite actors."
"__DISNEY__ He was a big part of my childhood but I think I remember him best as Genie from Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ Yes Genie was the best! You know Al really never did have a friend like him."
"__DISNEY__ I see what you did there. Very clever."
"__DISNEY__ Jasmine and Aladdin honestly were very lucky to have someone like Genie in their lives."
"__DISNEY__ I'd second that and add Abu to the list."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah Abu had a good heart, but what about Magic Carpet?"
"__DISNEY__ Man, if I could just have a flying magic carpet that would make me so happy!"
"__DISNEY__ If I could just have Genie that would make ME so happy!"
"__DISNEY__ Would you try to break the rules about wishing for more wishes of would you turn into a power hungry Jafar??"
