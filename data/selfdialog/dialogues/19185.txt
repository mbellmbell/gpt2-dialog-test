"__MOVIES__ Are you going to go see that new Transformers movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The one with Mark Walberg?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea that one."
"__MOVIES__ I might, probably not though."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm not a huge Michael Bay fan in general."
"__MOVIES__ What makes you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ His movies are all the same formula, insert giant explosions, cash out."
"__MOVIES__ Example?"
"__MOVIES__ Independence Day."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's just one if his many movies, they can't all be like that."
"__MOVIES__ What about Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, The rock, Bad boys..."
"__MOVIES__ Ok I get it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Michael Bay does nothing but big budget movies with giant explosions."
"__MOVIES__ Well I like explosions."
"__MOVIES__ There is nothing wrong with that but once you've seen one Michael Bay movie you've seen them all."
"__MOVIES__ Wow you really don't like Michael Bay."
"__MOVIES__ Nope, his movies are almost always bad."
"__MOVIES__ I'll take you off my Michael Bay fanclub list then."
"__MOVIES__ Please do."
