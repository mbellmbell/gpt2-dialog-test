"__DISNEY__ How do you feel about that 'Coco' trailer?"
"__DISNEY__ Is that coming out this year?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's expected to be released on November 22nd."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm... I don't have any strong opinions of it so far since it's so early."
"__DISNEY__ That is true. But the cultural part of it is interesting."
"__DISNEY__ Oh for sure. I think Disney is doing a good job on touching different perspectives."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. It could be just me, but sometimes I feel like Disney movies correlate to specific politics."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, really? What makes you think that?"
"__DISNEY__ Again, it could just be a coincidence but you know how Trump feels about Mexicans."
"__DISNEY__ Ah, I can see why you feel this way."
