"__MOVIES__ Rambo or Rocky?"
"__MOVIES__ For characters or action?"
"__MOVIES__ Both!"
"__MOVIES__ Rocky for characters, Rambo for action."
"__MOVIES__ Why not the opposite?"
"__MOVIES__ Rambo is a horrible human."
"__MOVIES__ That's not nice to say of someone with PTSD."
"__MOVIES__ That's not what I'm saying. He intentionally returned and chose to be a private army-destroying assassin after 'making peace' with his PTSD."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but he was killing the crap out of the evil Russians."
"__MOVIES__ That was a bit rude, but again, it doesn't matter. he has a couple redeeming qualities, but he goes where he isn't wanted and wages war."
"__MOVIES__ So why is Rocky so good?"
"__MOVIES__ He does get brain damage from his own stupidity, but it's his role as a husband and a mentor."
"__MOVIES__ Rambo could have been the same."
"__MOVIES__ But it's not addressed, so you can't assume that."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you, I was just playing Devil's Advocate."
"__MOVIES__ I also like the action of Rocky more."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ It's more believable."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Rocky had to take on one person at a time. Rambo, especially in Rambo II, survives because the other army can't aim. It's sad."
