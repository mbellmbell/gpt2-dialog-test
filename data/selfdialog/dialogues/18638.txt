"__MOVIES__ So, what's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, it's too hard to choose."
"__MOVIES__ Really? For me, it's not hard at all."
"__MOVIES__ Okay then, what's yours?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't care what anyone says, but The Dark Knight is my favorite movie of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Believe it or not, but I've never seen that movie. Is it as good as people say it is?"
"__MOVIES__ It's phenomenal! The plot constantly holds your attention, the acting is fantastic, and the visuals are breathtaking."
"__MOVIES__ I've always heard that Christian Bale is a fantastic Batman."
"__MOVIES__ He really is! I don't think any actor has been as good with Batman as he has."
"__MOVIES__ I heard Ben Affleck did a solid job."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he did alright. It's just a shame that the movie he debuted in as Batman wasn't that great."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Batman v. Superman had so much potential."
"__MOVIES__ I think that a lot of the hype for the movie died with the one trailer."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the one where they basically spoiled the whole movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one! Doomsday and Wonder Woman could have been such big surprises."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of Wonder Woman, what'd you think of her?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked her. I think that Gal Gadot is a good fit for her."
"__MOVIES__ It's at least cool that Wonder Woman gets a proper big-screen appearance."
"__MOVIES__ True. I'm so used to only seeing her on TV. I heard that she's getting a solo film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she is! It's actually coming out pretty soon."
