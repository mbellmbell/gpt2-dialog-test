"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Panthers will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's harder to tell after a losing season than a winning season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have never had back-to-back winning seasons, so it's safe to assume they will have a losing season after a winning season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about after a losing season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ More times than not, it's a losing season, but they they have had winning seasons after a losing season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was their problem last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seemed like 99% of the time, a defender was in Cam Newton's face before he got to the end of his drop back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they did enough to fix the offensive line?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not.  It also didn't help that the receivers dropped passes all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Christian McCaffrey?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he pans out they way everyone expects him too, but I feel he is being over-hyped."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has Netwon started throwing since his surgery?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  I hate how the media made a big deal about when he got his surgery."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean.  Andrew Luck got surgery and still isn't thowing, but the media doesn't seem to care."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, but the Panthers may be the only team in NFL history to never have back-to-back winning seasons, but make the playoffs for three straight years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A few years ago they went 12-4 and made the playoffs. The year after that they made the playoffs with a losing record because the NFC South was so bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The year after that, they went 15-1 and made the Super Bowl."
