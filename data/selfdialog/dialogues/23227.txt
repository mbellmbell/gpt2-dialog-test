"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Not yet, what did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Personally, I liked the old one, the animated one, better."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Doesn't Emma Watson play the live version Belle?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I don't know. I didn't feel the same magic."
"__DISNEY__ Well what was different about it?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm just used to the animation like I said, also the music sounded completely different."
"__DISNEY__ Well I know Emma Watson sang in the movie as Belle."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I just don't think she's that good to be honest."
"__DISNEY__ Well luckily we can always watch the animated version."
