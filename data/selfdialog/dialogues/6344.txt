"__STAR_WARS__ The spaceships always seemed a little funny to me in Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ How so?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, like, x-wings are super cool, they're designed to look like futuristic planes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right. And Luke flies one, so we have to like it."
"__STAR_WARS__ But aren't TIE fighters kind of weird looking?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They do seem like they'd be stiff or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. And Vader flies one and they seem so fragile. They seem outmatched."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the rebels were supposed to win."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, but they're also supposed to be underdogs!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I see your point."
