"__MUSIC__ Do you like Latin music?"
"__MUSIC__ somewhat, there are some artists that I think do a good job."
"__MUSIC__ What Latin artists have you listened to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Shakira, Juanes, Marc Anthony, Enrique Iglesias, Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonsi"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Luis Fonsi, did you see this guy is on the peak position of 'The 100 Hot' on the Billboard?. 19 weeks on the chart, that is impressive for a Latin artist"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you are right, the last time an artist had such success was in 1996, 21 years ago. Los Del Rio were 14 weeks in the No. 1 with their song 'Macarena'"
"__MUSIC__ That was a very catchy song, this guys are from Spain. Fonsi's song 'Despacito' has a catchy chorus too. Do you know what does it mean?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Despacito' translates to slowly and 'pasito a pasito' translates to step by step well actually little step by little step."
"__MUSIC__ What is that music genre that they use lately, it is a mix between Reggae and Tropical or something like that?"
"__MUSIC__ They call it Reggaeton, It a fusion between Latin rhythms, dancehall, and hip-hop or rap. It is a very rhythmic genre."
"__MUSIC__ I have had the opportunity to see some awesome dancers that use Salsa music to do great performances, they dance very fast, it looks like swing dancing."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you are right, The World Salsa Championships. The term 'Salsa' started in New York and one of the most representative artists for this music genre was a group called 'Fania All Stars'."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there is a bunch of Latin music genres: Salsa, Merengue, Bachata, Vallenato. Those are good if you want to meet some Latin girl, but you have to dance well."
"__MUSIC__ That is funny. I recently knew that Justin Bieber was trying to sing in Spanish."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he did well at the recording studio but he forgot the lyrics in Puerto Rico during a concert with Luis Fonsi"
"__MUSIC__ For real? well, it is common for Latin singers to sing in English but not vice versa. What I really like is electronic music, you are full of options to choose from."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I love the energy that you feel when you listen to this music. There are many awesome DJ's: Tiesto, David Guetta, Skrillex, Avicii, Armin Van Buuren, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I would like to have the opportunity to go to one of the best EDM festivals, 'Tomorroland' in Boom, Belgium. Would you like to go too?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, but not just to this, I would like to go to: Electric Daisy Carnival, Sensation, Ultra Music Festival, Global Gathering, etc. I think we have to save some money if we want to go there."
"__MUSIC__ You are right, while this happens we can go to Miami and to spend a great time there."
