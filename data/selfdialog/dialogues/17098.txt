"__MOVIES__ What genre of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Comedies mostly, but some action and drama.  How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I only watch comedy shows.  What's your favorite comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ That's tough.  Probably Step-brothers or Talladega Nights"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow!  Those are two of my favorites too!"
"__MOVIES__ I like Will Ferrell a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, me too.  His style of comedy is right up my alley."
"__MOVIES__ I can't really think of a movie of his I didn't like except maybe the one about time travel"
"__MOVIES__ What's the name of that one?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't remember right now."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me more about the plot."
"__MOVIES__ Will's character is a scientist that falls back in time with his apprentice and they meet aliens and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't sound familiar at all.  It's a comedy though?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, well.... supposedly anyway.  It really wasn't too funny."
"__MOVIES__ I need to go Google that one and see what it is."
"__MOVIES__ It has a lot of dinosaurs in it at first, but there's aliens toward the end."
"__MOVIES__ I just can't place that all.  It's driving me crazy."
"__MOVIES__ It kind of has a 'planet of the apes' feel to it, but that's not what it's really about."
"__MOVIES__ Oh!  I think I kind of remember the ads for that one.  I didn't see it though."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't really bother.  It certainly wasn't his best work."
