"__MUSIC__ Do you like of Monsters and Men?"
"__MUSIC__ I love them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Little Talks was really good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, emotional too.  I had a friend who had a different take on the meaning of that song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, instead of it being about a recent widower, his wife had Alzheimer."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa!  Mind blown because that makes perfect sense."
"__MUSIC__ I know right?  Such a good song though."
"__MUSIC__ You know what else was good?"
"__MUSIC__ What else?"
"__MUSIC__ Mountain Sound.  Really great song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they make some good coffee shop stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder how they are in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No clue, I bet they're just OK.  I mean they're great but it's not like a rock concert where their style is crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I bet you're right."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't they from Iceland or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I think they are."
"__MUSIC__ That's crazy.  Although I heard Iceland speaks pretty good English, at least as a second language."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they do a good job singing in it for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and writing lyrics for it too."
