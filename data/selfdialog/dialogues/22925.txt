"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ That's such a hard question there have been so many good ones, like Up or the classics like Snow White."
"__DISNEY__ Ya I recently watched a documentary about Disney I didn't know with the classics like Snow White all the scenes were painted by hand."
"__DISNEY__ That's really cool when think about all the work that went into each scene."
"__DISNEY__ I think my favorite is with the wicked witch some of her scenes are so detailed it's hard to believe everything was hand painted."
"__DISNEY__ I would love to watch the movie again thinking of that."
"__DISNEY__ I know some of the scenes in the forest are very detailed too."
"__DISNEY__ I think the music is really good in that movie too."
"__DISNEY__ Ya most of those songs are still really popular today."
"__DISNEY__ Whistle while You Work is still one of my favorites."
