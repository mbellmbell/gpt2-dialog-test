"__BASEBALL__ The Texas Rangers have got to do better on the road."
"__BASEBALL__ How bad is their record?"
"__BASEBALL__ They are 6-12 on the road right now. That's not going to get it done."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah winning only 33 percent of your road games is receipe for disaster."
"__BASEBALL__ I mean think about it. They are awful on the road, but they are in 2nd place in the division."
"__BASEBALL__ So just imagine if they could at least play .500 ball on the road they could give themselves a real shot."
"__BASEBALL__ You would think so. You have to think that the Astros won't continue to play this well right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they have to come back down to earth."
"__BASEBALL__ So if they could start picking up the pace on the road this could be an interesting divisional fight."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but something about the Rangers always worries me."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. They can never seem to get out of their own way."
"__BASEBALL__ I would probably give the Angels a better chance than the Rangers"
"__BASEBALL__ I mean you could be right, but both teams have had their screw up moments"
"__BASEBALL__ I can't disagree, but the Angels have Trout and the Rangers do not."
"__BASEBALL__ Point taken but the cupboard is not bare in Texas. They got some good hitters too."
"__BASEBALL__ No doubt. Both Joey Gallo and Nomar Mazara are having some good years"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they just need more consistency away from their home confines."
"__BASEBALL__ Well the good thing is they have time."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but they are already 8 games back. You don't want to fall further behind."
"__BASEBALL__ True but they are in contention for one of the wild card spots if all else fails."
