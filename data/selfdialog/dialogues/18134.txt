"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie yet?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean, Dead Men Tell No Tales?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that one."
"__MOVIES__ I have! My friends and I went to see it last weekend. It was amazing. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched it last night with my cousins. It was exciting. This Pirates of the Caribbean movie is by far my new favorite."
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say it's mine as well. I love how Johnny Depp never loses his touch with Jack Sparrow."
"__MOVIES__ So true! It's as if they started filming this new movie as soon as they finishing filming on the last one."
"__MOVIES__ I never realized how much I missed watching all the old characters until Dead Men Tell No Tales came out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the cast was amazing. I can never get enough of Barbossa, old Gibbs and that monkey named Jack."
"__MOVIES__ There is also the newcomer who plays Henry Turner. I was so surprised, at first I had no idea that he was Will and Elizabeth's son."
"__MOVIES__ It was surprising wasn't it? All in all, I really think Disney is doing a good job with the Pirate movies. Did you know it cost Disney 320 Million to make this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I read something about that, Disney initially set the budget for 250 million but a few problems happened on set which racked it up."
"__MOVIES__ That's quite an amount. But I'm sure the movie itself will pull that budget back in and more."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Hey, did you know that this is the shortest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, being only 2 hours and 9 minutes long"
"__MOVIES__ 2 hours is pretty long for any movie, I never realized the other ones were so long as well. But then, i never pay attention to things like that."
"__MOVIES__ Usually if a movie is under an hour and a half I really won't bother watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Movies that are so short seemed rushed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree with you. Do you think Disney will have plans for another Pirates of the Caribbean production?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea, but it would be amazing if they ever announced one. I can never get enough of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget Barbossa, Jack the Monkey and the rest of the crews!"
