"__MUSIC__ So, I need your help since you're big into music and all."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, what you got going?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm doing a slideshow movie featuring all the pictures I took of my students this year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, cool!  That's awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is.  Buuut, I'd like to put it to some music, need about five or six songs that would be good for it."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I can do that."
"__MUSIC__ Keep in mind these are kindergarteners, so it has to be FAMILY friendly music!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can still do that.  Think I can even get you a variety of songs."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, list a couple."
"__MUSIC__ Well, let's see.. you can always do Walk the Moon's 'Shut Up and Dance'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I yeah, that's a good one!"
"__MUSIC__ And, of course, the girls would probably like it if you put a bit of 'Let It Go' from the Frozen soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, not sure the PARENTS will like it much though."
"__MUSIC__ HAHA!  Also, Rusted Root's 'Send Me On My Way' would be a good one."
"__MUSIC__ Why does that sound familiar?"
"__MUSIC__ It was on the first Ice Age movie."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah!  Anything else?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's see... if you don't mind going old school, you could do 'Living On a Prayer' or even 'It's My Life' by Bon Jovi."
"__MUSIC__ Alright those are possible."
"__MUSIC__ Also, I'd put in 'Can't Behave' by Courtney Jayne."
