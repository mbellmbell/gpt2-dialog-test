"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Whatever happened to MC Ren?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know dude. I haven't heard anything about him for years."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess he's like the lost 5th NWA Beatle. Gone and pretty much forgotten."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What about DJ Yella? Do you remember him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah and he's still around. He works in production and I believe does movies also."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Straight Outta Compton was an awesome album. Nothing like it had ever been created."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who was your favorite member of NWA?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's easy because it has to be Eazy. Cruisin' down the street in my 64."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Rap music was so much better back in the day. And look at what a lot of these guys have gone on to do with their careers."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You're right. Ice Cube is one of the biggest stars in the world and he came.........straight outta Compton."
