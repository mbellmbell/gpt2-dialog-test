"__DISNEY__ Who is your favorite Disney sidekick?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean sidekick?"
"__DISNEY__ Well Mickey had Donald, Goofy and Minnie. Winnie the Pooh had Tigger, Eeyore, Rabbit and Piglet."
"__DISNEY__ Out of those choices I think Tigger was the worst sidekick but still my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean worst?"
"__DISNEY__ Tigger never had a clear thought process to work with. He just did what he wanted when he wanted and never thought of the consequences."
"__DISNEY__ You are right, he was always getting the group into trouble."
"__DISNEY__ Yes but never intentionally."
"__DISNEY__ Very true since he was just a happy go lucky kind of a guy."
"__DISNEY__ Which is why I liked him! He just couldn't help himself."
