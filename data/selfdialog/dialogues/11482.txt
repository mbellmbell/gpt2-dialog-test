"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the Giants chances this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to say.  They've got a tough road in front of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they've got such a killer receiving group."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt.  Gonna be hard to try and guard them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ODB is the best WR in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Top 5 for sure, but hard to say he's the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But looks who's backing him up.  There's enough CB's on a team to stop their WR onslaught."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Signing Brandon Marshall will be interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, and they've got Shepard who was awesome last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they lost Victor Cruz, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he signed elsewhere, but he's done anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened to him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Injuries.  He was robbed of his speed when he blew out his knees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tough break for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli Manning is getting old which won't help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's 35 or so at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he's slowing down quite a bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet the defense will help relieve some pressure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably so.  They'll challenge for a wild card spot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even the division.  I expect Dallas to fall a bit."
