"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whos your under-dog team this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dolphins, hands down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ will we see another Peyton Manning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, that man was a legend"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you had the money, what team would you buy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easy, New England Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why are The Bengals uniforms so ugly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, it hurts my eyes too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have a hard time crowning any QB of this era as 'GOAT'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good thing my pick doesn't need a crown. Only a helmet, pads and a football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't get me wrong marino Montana and fouts are great and all but I have a hard time saying any of these guys are the GOAT. Could you imagine Johnny Unitas playing in a West coast offense? Joe Namath playing in the air coryell? Otto Graham playing after the Mel Blount rule? You can't touch recievers anymore"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think you can really put a value on 'taking a pounding.'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The reason why time of possession is important is to let your defense rest and plan to attack the offense. Defenses tire faster because they move reactively which takes more burst energy and more oxygen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea. Teams want to play games that feature fewer total possessions against elite qb's"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 2018 NFL Hall of Fame Class may be one of the most Competitive"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think Tagliabue is going to get the contributor nod this year. The fact that he wasn't voted in last year after getting it was very telling. It'll be a while before they try that again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are your expectations for Jamaal Charles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Charles is 90% of what he was in KC and healthy, he turns CJ into a short yardage / goal line back.  But sadly I think he's out of gas. Would love to be wrong on this."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Poor Browns fans and their players it must be hard to watch recently knowing you're almost definitely going to be laughed at come the end of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On a long enough timeline, the success rate for every NFL team rises to 100%. So yes."
