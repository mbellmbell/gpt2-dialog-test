"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite director?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say Stanley Kubrick."
"__MOVIES__ Why would you say Kubrick?"
"__MOVIES__ Because it he was able to really master any genre that he attempted and many of his movies are my all-time favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Like which movies?"
"__MOVIES__ 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and A Clockwork Orange, to name a few."
"__MOVIES__ I like Kubrick but I feel that he often got wooden performances from his actors and actresses."
"__MOVIES__ That's a fair criticism."
"__MOVIES__ As an example, I found the acting in Eyes Wide Shut to be quite mechanical and cold."
"__MOVIES__ I would agree. You chose the movie that best supports your opinion. I think his productions often dwarfed an actor or actresses performances."
"__MOVIES__ If you are agreeing with me then I find it hard to believe that he is your favorite director."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I also think he got great performances as well. Take Ryan O'Neal's performance in Barry Lyndon - it may be the best in his career."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah, but so many of the other leads in his films were quite wooden, cold, and mechanical."
"__MOVIES__ I would prefer the term stylized and mannered, but it often fit the script or the overall mood of his films."
"__MOVIES__ You aren't going to win me over in the Kubrick department. I'm much more of a fan of director's that get more human performances."
"__MOVIES__ Again... you are not alone in your opinion, but I think you are putting Kubrick in a very narrowly defined box."
"__MOVIES__ What sort of box?"
"__MOVIES__ That a director's worth is based solely on achieving human, warm, or realistic performances from the actors he or she uses."
"__MOVIES__ That's true."
"__MOVIES__ Perhaps we should define criteria with which to evaluate great directors."
