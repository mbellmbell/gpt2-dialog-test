"__STAR_WARS__ Are you looking forward to the Hans Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I am now that Ron Howard is directing it!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Is he? No way! I hadn't hear that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah! I have more confidence in it now."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think I actually care about the early life of Hans Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, maybe we can learn about how he met Chewbaca?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I haven't enjoyed the prequels at all, and this one doesn't look like it'll be better."
"__STAR_WARS__ But you liked Rogue one!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. That one was good."
"__STAR_WARS__ But, everyone isn't going to die at the end of this one!"
