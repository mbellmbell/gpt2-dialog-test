"__MOVIES__ Are you planning to see the new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It looks like it will be really good."
"__MOVIES__ Gal Gadot seems to be a great choice for Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I really enjoyed her portrayal in Batman vs. Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really enjoyed that movie as well."
"__MOVIES__ I was a little curious about casting Ben Affleck as Batman but he seemed to play the part well."
"__MOVIES__ I knew he was going to nail it as Bruce Wayne but I wasn't sure how he'd handle the role of Batman either."
"__MOVIES__ I'm excited to see more of him in the Justice League movie. That comes out pretty soon as well."
"__MOVIES__ I look forward to them introducing some more of the DC characters to their cinematic universe."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. The Wonder Woman movie will be a great start to kicking off solo movies for more of the Justice League characters."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard they're going to work on a stand alone Flash movie as well; and possibly a Batgirl flick."
"__MOVIES__ That would be great. Clearly, they have Ezra Miller to play the Flash, but I wonder who they'll cast as Batgirl."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I haven't heard any rumors about that yet. I think it's probably still too early."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how many of these movies actually see the light of day."
"__MOVIES__ I would imagine quite a few of them. Warner Brothers and DC stand to make a ton of money in releasing them, assuming they're done well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there sure are a lot of comic book fans out there looking for these types of movies and willing to shell out their money to see them."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of which, are you going to try and see Wonder Woman opening night?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I'll probably wait a few days so I can go when the theater is less crowded."
"__MOVIES__ That's probably what I'll do too. It's a little nicer when you don't have to share the theater with a ton of people."
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree."
