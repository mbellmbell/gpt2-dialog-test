"__ROCK__ Do you want to go out Saturday night and hang out in a club or something?"
"__ROCK__ Sure, have you been to that bar on Central Ave called Mickey's? They play really great rock songs, and have several pool tables."
"__ROCK__ I've drove past it, but I haven't been in there. What kind of music do they play?"
"__ROCK__ I was there a couple weeks ago, and they were playing Metallica, Coldplay, Van Halen, 3 Doors Down, a whole mix of cool rock."
"__ROCK__ That sounds really good, I love Metallica but I don't hear it too often any more."
"__ROCK__ I miss 90s rock, it was the best. They used to play Metallica on the radio every day, now they never play it."
"__ROCK__ Most clubs these days play electronic dance or rap, and I wind up with a headache."
"__ROCK__ I know what you mean. That stuff gives me a headache too."
"__ROCK__ It's funny how you can listen to a band like Metallica really loud though and it doesn't give you a headache."
"__ROCK__ Right?! We should go hang out there this weekend then."
