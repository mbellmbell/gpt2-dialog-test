"__MUSIC__ I'm thinking that I may go to Warped Tour this summer."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I've never been to it. Isn't it mostly kids?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah..I've been to a lot of other festivals but Warped never really appealed to me. There's a couple good bands playing this year's."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Hatebreed who I never miss, Alestorm who is this awesome pirate metal band."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard you talk about Alestorm. They're pirate metal?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, their songs are about alcohol and pillaging, they're really fun to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I think I saw Hatebreed years ago, I remember liking their show."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've seen Hatebreed probably a dozen times. Super high energy and really nice guys."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't the singer have a solo band too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Jamey Jasta, he just had a new album come out and he opened for Killswitch Engage and Anthrax when they were in town."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I thought so! I was at that show. They were really good."
"__MUSIC__ You went to the Killswitch Engage and Anthrax concert? I was there too! Which band was your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to see Anthrax, it was cool to hear the old stuff. I love Caught in the Mosh. I did stay for Killswitch Engage and those guys were really good too."
"__MUSIC__ I know, that's who I went for. Jesse's songwriting on their new album Incarnate is so good."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check it out. I think I listened to them years ago when the other guy was singing for them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he has a new band now. Jesse was the original singer, I'm glad he's back. Have you been to any other concerts lately?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I'm thinking about going to see Mushroomhead when they're in town. How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ I went to Coheed & Cambria and Seether a couple weeks ago and we went to Columbus to see City and Colour last week. I'm a little bit of a concert junkie."
"__MUSIC__ You really are. I like the new Seether album, Poison the Parish. It's nice to see that they're getting heavier again."
