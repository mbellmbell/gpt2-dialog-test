"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite evil guy in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Obviously Darth Vader is the best and the original bad guy of Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but did you know that he was supposed to be killed off in the first movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't imagine the movies without him. His voice and costume is so iconic."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but he is only on screen for like 12 minutes in the first movie, even though he is pretty much a main character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just learned that they guy doing the voice isn't the same guy that is actually doing the acting."
"__STAR_WARS__ James Earl Jones does the voice, even though he isn't listed in the credits. David Prowse did the acting."
"__STAR_WARS__ His voice was perfect for that role!  He also did Mufasa in the Lion King."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even though they played the same character, David and Earl never actually met eachother."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be so weird to be playing the same person but never meet the other half."
