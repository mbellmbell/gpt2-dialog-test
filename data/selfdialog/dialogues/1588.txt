"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite rock band?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a country fan. Most of the rock bands I know are from the 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so who was your favorite 80's rock band?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough one. Foriegner, Chicago, Journey, Loverboy..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there were a lot of them. So who was your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Pushy, pushy. I guess I'd have to say my favorite is probably Fleetwood Mac."
"__MUSIC__ Excellent choice. They aren't an 80's band though. I think they were founded in sixties or seventies."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Whatever. I listened to them in eighties. I was a fan of them in 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Gotcha. So what other rock groups did you, or do you, like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I've always been a fan of the Stones, the Beatles, I like Def Leppard."
"__MUSIC__ See, you know some good bands."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks."
"__MUSIC__ What about more hard rock stuff? Kiss, AC/DC, Black Sabbath."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know a single Black Sabbath song. I've heard Kiss songs, from the movies and such, but I've never really been a fan. I know there are some AC/DC songs I like, but honestly, but I don't know which ones they are."
"__MUSIC__ What about more modern groups? REM? Counting Crows? things like that."
"__MUSIC__ I like that Stand song by REM, I think."
"__MUSIC__ I know what song you mean."
"__MUSIC__ If you play some of their songs, I might recognize another REM song or some COunting Crows songs."
"__MUSIC__ I guess next time we should have a conversation about country music."
"__MUSIC__ I'd be a lot better informed about it."
