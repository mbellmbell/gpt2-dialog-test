"__MUSIC__ Have you ever noticed how the same music is used all over the place? Especially classical music in films and TV dramas and documentaries."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I guess it's because after a while it becomes like a shorthand for an emotion or something."
"__MUSIC__ It's usually one of the great requiems. Mozart's or Faure's generally."
"__MUSIC__ Mozart's Mass in C Minor is used a lot too, that's a great choral work that's often mistaken for the requiem."
"__MUSIC__ Then you have your modern classical alternatives. Max Richter..."
"__MUSIC__ ...Sigur Ros, Olafur Arnalds..."
"__MUSIC__ It's funny how when it comes to classical music, or modern songs, there's no sense of exclusivity to them."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, take John Williams. He'll write a soundtrack for a film and it'll forever only be used for that one film."
"__MUSIC__ Right. I can't imagine the Jaws theme being used anywhere else, and it'll always be associated with that movie even if it is used elsewhere."
"__MUSIC__ But Max Richter's 'On the Nature of Daylight' must have been in a handful of films already, not to mention documentaries on TV too."
"__MUSIC__ So is there anyone writing really good, big, orchestral and choral works these days except for film?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure people are creating it, but I wouldn't know how to find out."
"__MUSIC__ It's almost like films are now the only outlet for that kind of music. It's a shame they keep using old music rather than create new pieces as there may be an undiscovered Mozart somewhere."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of that kind of music used to be sponsored by the church and the great European monarchies."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose they no longer have the need to be such patrons of the arts, what with commercial interests driving everything these days."
"__MUSIC__ It was a power thing too. They'd sign up a leading composer to only create works for them, and that'd annoy the other kingdoms."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure I remember something about that when I studied Mozart at school."
"__MUSIC__ That's right. You know it's rumored that his sister actually wrote some of his pieces, but the patriarchal society meant it had to be published in his name?"
"__MUSIC__ I do. It's one of the few Mozart rumors that has any solid evidence behind it that it might be true."
