"__MUSIC__ What do you think about dubstep?"
"__MUSIC__ Dubstep is really hit or miss for me. I get the complaints about it, but there can be some really catchy songs."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think dubstep has died out?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think it's died out entirely. I think it's moreso become more integrated into other genres of music like pop and rock."
"__MUSIC__ You mean like a lot of club music has sirens and similar noises?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but also in that a lot of pop musicians have collaborated with dubstep artists like Skrillex."
"__MUSIC__ What's your opinion of Skrillex?"
"__MUSIC__ I think his music's alright. I think he's a bit overrated in the dubstep world, but that's probably because he was the one who made the cornerstone in the genre."
"__MUSIC__ Dubstep reminds me a lot of freestyle street music that they made in the 90s a lot. Like banging on trashcans and tapping along fences."
"__MUSIC__ You're right, it is very similar. Except the sounds are being produced electronically instead of manually."
"__MUSIC__ Which would you prefer; dubstep or freestyle street music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd honestly take freestyle street music. I just think that takes more effort, creativity and ingenuity than dubstep."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think is the best part of both?"
"__MUSIC__ That really anyone can try to make their own music in that genre. Dubstep really only requires a computer an editing software, which can be free, and freestyle street music can be created anywhere."
"__MUSIC__ You said pop music and other genres have integrated dubstep into their mixes more often. Do you think that's a good thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Like any form of music, you're going to have good and bad songs. Ultimately, though, I'd prefer dubstep to be within pop and other genres than on its own."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think we'll see a dubstep revival?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think dubstep is really that dead since it's still pretty big in clubs, but it's very possible that we could see a big dubstep revival of sorts. Old classic and forgotten genres like funk are making a comeback."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite dubstep song?"
"__MUSIC__ First of the year (Equinox) by Skrillex. It has a fantastic beat and I love the flow."
