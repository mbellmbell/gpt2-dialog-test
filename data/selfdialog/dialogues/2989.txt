"__MUSIC__ Can you guess who  I've really grown to like as a singer and musician?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who?"
"__MUSIC__ Miley Cyrus"
"__MUSIC__ You mean that kid who played Hannah Montana?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yes, but that was a long time ago. She's come a long way since then."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't she a judge on The Voice last season?"
"__MUSIC__ Right, she was,and that's when I realized how great she was."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she is a true musician-not just a singer-songwriter. She knows her stuff."
"__MUSIC__ How old is she now?"
"__MUSIC__ She's about 24 I think, but wise beyond her years as far as coaching singers and music goes."
"__MUSIC__ I heard her sing Jolene once and it was excellent."
"__MUSIC__ I like her cover of that song. Did you know Dolly Parton is her godmother?"
"__MUSIC__ No, talented family."
"__MUSIC__ Do you remember all the grief she was getting for Wrecking Ball?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, like Madonna and Taylor Swift and every other young female singer didn't go through a finding themselves period too"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I thought too and I'm glad we were right. She's matured a lot vocally."
"__MUSIC__ I think she can do just about any kind of music now. She's got the chops and the feel and the understanding of music."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I was thinking too and her new song proves it. She's maturing and doesn't need to stay locked into one type of  music."
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean the song Malibu? Love that song. It's different and mature."
