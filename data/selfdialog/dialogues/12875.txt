"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You like pro football too, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I'm a big fan. Can't wait for this fall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you follow how the season schedule is structured? I never knew."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure. I know, it can be somewhat complicated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know there are thirty-two teams. Then they start competing.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So back in 2002 there was an expansion and realignment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and that's when I lost track of things. How does it work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So now there are four divisions in each conference, see?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm still with you. Then what else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The champions of each conference proceed to the NFL playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That part I have down. Just some of the regulations aren't clear."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe you're thinking about the wild card teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet that's it. Those extra teams can muddle things up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They've limited the number of wild card teams, so it should be clearer now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I enjoy the fall season, plus the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of rules and regulations, you know those of pro-football differ from college football, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wasn't sure. Also I wasn't thinking about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you could be watching a pro game as a college football fan and become thrown by the game rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mostly I like the social aspects of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No argument here. You and a lot of people."
