"__DISNEY__ I just sat through Toy Story with my nephew and boy do I miss the old Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ I agree the old Disney movies were great, they just seemed to have more heart."
"__DISNEY__ Which Disney movie do you remember the most from your childhood?"
"__DISNEY__ I would have to say Old Yeller, you know that movie about the boy and his dog."
"__DISNEY__ I agree that was the best.  I didn't have a dog when I was kid but when I saw the little boy Travis with his dog Old Yeller, that made me beg for one!"
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't that also the movie with Fess Parker as the father Jim?  He used to be in so many Disney films, he was like a father figure back then."
"__DISNEY__ Of course the thing everyone remembers is the part where Old Yeller gets rabies and they have to shoot him."
"__DISNEY__ I cried like a baby at the end of that movie.  It seemed so cruel after the dog had saved the boy from the bear earlier in the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure but I think the little boy in that movie was Kevin Corcoran, I remember I thought he was so cute."
"__DISNEY__ Really makes me sad to think how old we all are now, that movie came out in 1957!"
