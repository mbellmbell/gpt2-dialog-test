"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe there is only 2 months left before the NFL Season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I am super excited, are you going to opening day?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No I cant its on a Thursday September 7th I have school next day. Are you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes my family goes to Gillette stadium every year for opening night, its a tradition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots are loading up this year as rumor is Brady is retiring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no way I don't believe it, I know the papers mentioned it but he said he wants to play 5 more years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but did you hear his wife Giselle mention that last year he played with concussions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was crazy. What do you think about the Jets horror show this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man I cant believe what they are doing, that should be illegal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know right ! How can you cut every single high priced player just to lose every game to get the #1 pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Its crazy, I know some sports the teams try to tank during the season to get a better draft pick, but not BEFORE the season starts!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are the Patriots even playing Jets in New York this year or only in Foxoboro?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they play them in New York on Sunday October 15th."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no way! Is that a flex game or is the time set?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It looks like its set for 1pm. Do you want to drive down here to see them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man YES, you can get me 2 tickets over there? I would love to bring my girl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I can get tickets to Met Life stadium here of coarse, nobody is buying them this year since team is tanking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true but I think the Patriots game will be fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OH YES! The entire stadium will be filled with Patriots blue, pretty funny to see that in New Jersey."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Awesome man I will see you there!"
