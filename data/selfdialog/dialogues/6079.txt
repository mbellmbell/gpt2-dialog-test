"__STAR_WARS__ So what did you feel about the force awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ To be honest I freaked out because it was so good!"
"__STAR_WARS__ How did you feel about the characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really enjoyed Finn's character and Ray."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! They fit well together."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the action scenes with them kept me on the edge."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was so shocked that Ray had the force."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was as well. But even more shocked that she was stronger than Kylo."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Kylo's light saber was so awesome looking!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That light saber battle at the end was so epic as well."
