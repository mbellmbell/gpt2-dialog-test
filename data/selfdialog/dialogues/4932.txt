"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift was a horrid movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really? I thought the movie was pretty good. Why didn't you like it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The acting was pathetic and it just really didn't fit in with the other two. I mean come on Paul and Vin were nowhere in it and their interation made the ones before."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, I guess you have a point, but I thought the change of scenery was pretty cool and the cultural shift intrigued me."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The change in scenery doesn't excuse that kids horrible accent and just all around bad acting skills."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, which one did you like the most?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I really think the original Fast and Furious was the best out of all of them. You got the whole feeling of Paul Walker and his loyalty first to the police and then to Vin"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh ya! Isn't that when the term Busta came into play? During that movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes! It Did! When they were at the party Dom was like Busta id the only one that kept me outta cuffs! That was great!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I really should watch the first one again it's been so long!"
