"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Reservoir Dogs?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. I think it's Tarantino's best."
"__MOVIES__ I would agree with you there."
"__MOVIES__ What were some of the things you liked about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked that it was more on the dialogue between characters than the action scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a movie about a diamond heist and you never see the heist."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. You just see the aftermath."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Mr. Blonde and the police officer?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought that scene was really good."
"__MOVIES__ The music fit the scene very well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Really showed that Blonde was a loose cannon compared to the others."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of about Mr. Pink? Did you think he got away with the diamonds?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah probably. It showed him getting in the car with the briefcase."
"__MOVIES__ But the police were arriving at the scene shortly after he left."
"__MOVIES__ True, but you never know with Tarantino's films."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. Lot of questions can be asked at the end of watching one of his films."
"__MOVIES__ Which makes his films even better in my opinion."
