"__MUSIC__ What do you think of 80s music?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean popular music of the 1980.?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really to it. Did that decade produce anything good?"
"__MUSIC__ I think music took a turn for the worse in the 80s, but there were a couple good bands."
"__MUSIC__ Which ones were good?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, in the 80s you had The Police and U2. Those are two of the greatest rock bands of all time."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. Those two bands are really great."
"__MUSIC__ I was a fan of The Police in particular, but I couldn't get into the other music in the 80s. It was pretty much garbage."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, all that synth-rock and new wave stuff was kind of bad."
"__MUSIC__ Right, but even worse was all the super corny hair bands."
"__MUSIC__ Which ones do you mean in particular?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm talking about garbage like Van Halen, Motley Crew and Bon Jovi."
"__MUSIC__ Oh right. That stuff is pretty aweful."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes it's fun to hear some New Wave punk like Devo or Flock of Seagulls, but only in small quantities."
"__MUSIC__ I don't ever listen to 80s stations, so I don't really know."
"__MUSIC__ You also had some super corny solo artists like Madonna, Boy George and such."
"__MUSIC__ Right. I can't believe how popular that stuff became."
"__MUSIC__ It boggles my mind at times."
"__MUSIC__ No doubt."
