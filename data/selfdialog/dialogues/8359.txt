"__POP__ Are you a fan of auto-tune?"
"__POP__ Here we go.  Heck yes I am."
"__POP__ Oh my.  Why would you like such an overused thing?"
"__POP__ Think about it.  It's a tool that perfects human singing, one of the most impactful sounds a human can hear."
"__POP__ Well, I like it when it first started."
"__POP__ Don't get auto-tune and vocoders confused.  Both are used all of the time in pop music."
"__POP__ Oh I love vocoders.  The harmonies are quite sweet."
"__POP__ Yeah, pop stars Roger and Zapp crushed the vocoder scene in the eighties."
"__POP__ Now everyone from Madonna to Daft Punk have used vocoder technology."
"__POP__ And auto-tune sounds like vocoders, so that's why I love it."
