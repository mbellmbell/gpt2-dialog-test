"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uhhh, so what are you doing right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, just lookin' at MetLife Stadium!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, heard they're gonna make some renovations to it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, from whom?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From the Director of NFL himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They say, that they're improving it for some hunk-a-junk bout the Super Bowl, but I don't believe that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then why do you think they're really changing MetLife for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmmm, not sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's on your mind?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most likely, the fact that they're just renovating it for the Jets!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh, makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I overheard some complaints coming from some of the players themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ About what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll tell you more, once we get out of this joint."
