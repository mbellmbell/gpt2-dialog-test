"__SUPERHERO__ How do you think Age of Ultron will go?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I REALLY hope he obliterates the Avengers."
"__SUPERHERO__ How badly?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, they need to kill someone off."
"__SUPERHERO__ Who should go?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I want Thor to die because as humans we cannot relate to him."
"__SUPERHERO__ True, I never really cared about his character. He's also the weakest actor."
"__SUPERHERO__ I hope he kills a good amount, actually. Marvel does a bad job with villains."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, I agree."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'll be really mad if he loses as bad as Ronan the Accuser did."
