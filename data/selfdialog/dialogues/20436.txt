"__MOVIES__ Hey have you seen the new movie Bay Watch?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't, I wasn't sure if it really looked worth watching."
"__MOVIES__ Well I have to say it really is. It also doesn't help that I love Dwayne Johnson."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I have to agree with you there, I am a big fan of his."
"__MOVIES__ See than you should see the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well what was it even about, besides the normal Bay Watch stuff from the old show."
"__MOVIES__ Well it is about everyone of course on the Bay Watch team and how they are trying to solve a crime."
"__MOVIES__ So is it just funny or is there action too since they are solving crime?"
"__MOVIES__ It has both super funny parts and some pretty cool action parts."
"__MOVIES__ I think I will watch it then when I get home. Who else was in it besides The Rock?"
"__MOVIES__ Zac Efron is also in it. He is pretty funny but at first I hated his character."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he can play a good jerk if you know what I mean."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah absolutely. I think that they made a really good team in this too. One had a bad attitude while the other was happy and well liked."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah in a lot of movies I have noticed they make The Rock out to be a really goofy and funny guy but still tough."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly like in that movie Central Intelligence with Kevin Hart!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I loved that movie! That is really one of the only reason I am going to give Bay Watch a try besides your suggestion."
"__MOVIES__ Well I don't think it was as funny as Central Intelligence, but it is still a great comedy you have to see."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good I am going to watch it tonight. Maybe this weekend you can come over and well have a movie night and watch Central Intelligence again."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great. I will bring the pop corn."
"__MOVIES__ I'll bring the drinks. And I will try to find more funny Rock movies!"
