"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you remember the scene from the first Fast & Furious in the Tran's garage?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm not sure if I do."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ When Brian was looking for the stolen stuff from the truck robberies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh right, when he almost got found out by Dom."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, the scene with the mechanic is what I mean specifically."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh when he's watching the guy get tortured."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah that's it, it took me so long to figure out what he Tran was talking about when he asked 40 weight or 50 weight."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Are you for real right now?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes I know now, but I completely spaced about oil viscosities when I was watching it the first few times."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think I'm gonna find a new mechanic, no offense."
