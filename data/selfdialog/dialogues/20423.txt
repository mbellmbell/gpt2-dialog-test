"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Passengers wasn't bad."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in that? I haven't heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence."
"__MOVIES__ Oh maybe I've seen the trailer. Is that the one where they're trapped in a ship or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's like a giant moving truck spaceship."
"__MOVIES__ Moving truck spaceship?"
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah because it's essentially moving thousands of people from planet to another."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see. So what happens."
"__MOVIES__ Well without giving too much away they wake up early and fall in love."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I hate love stories."
"__MOVIES__ Normally I do too but this one is actually good."
"__MOVIES__ What's different about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Without giving too much away again, there's more going on than just a love story."
"__MOVIES__ I think I remember reading about that movie now. It didn't get great reviews."
"__MOVIES__ No but to each their own. That's what I say. The design and special effects are really cool too."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if even care about that."
"__MOVIES__ Normally I don;t either but they made it all look really nice."
"__MOVIES__ Well I have been looking for something to watch. Might give it a shot."
"__MOVIES__ You wont be disappointed."
