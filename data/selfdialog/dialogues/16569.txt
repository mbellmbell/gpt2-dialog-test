"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  The Force Awakens!  It's my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't you think it copied the original too much?"
"__MOVIES__ No, dude.  I thought it was very much original."
"__MOVIES__ What about the first scene with that droid?"
"__MOVIES__ BB8."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  Didn't that man pass off some plans inside it like Leia did in the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know.   I guess I wasn't really paying attenion to it.  I was so jazzed about the movie.  I mean afterall it's Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I know.  I was a huge fan of the original.  I went out and bought as many of the toys as I could."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  I still do!"
"__MOVIES__ Let's talk some more about the end of it.  That base.  I mean didn't you think it was kinda like the Death Star."
"__MOVIES__ It kinda did."
"__MOVIES__ They even called it Starkiller."
"__MOVIES__ Right. I know. It was after Luke's original name in one of the first Star Wars drafts."
"__MOVIES__ All I am saying here is that I, personally, felt it to had too much in common with the original."
"__MOVIES__ But it's Star Wars!  It took them years to even make these sequels."
"__MOVIES__ And I think they could have done a much better job of it."
"__MOVIES__ I do see your point."
"__MOVIES__ I was no Phantom Menace."
"__MOVIES__ I think they could have done away with all those prequels."
