"__MUSIC__ Did you see the Radiohead set at Glastonbury?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw some of it, but I admit I fell asleep in front of the TV when they were on."
"__MUSIC__ I thought they were great, a good mix of old and new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ A bit too self-indulgent for my liking: who plays Pulk/Pull if they want to have a good time?"
"__MUSIC__ But you can't fault No Surprises..."
"__MUSIC__ You're right, that at least is a singalong classic."
"__MUSIC__ And Fake Plastic Trees?"
"__MUSIC__ Again, good, but for everyone one of those there's a Weird Fishes."
"__MUSIC__ You must have been happy they played Creep though."
"__MUSIC__ I guess, though I find it a bit cringey now."
"__MUSIC__ Tell you what else made me cringe. All the old acts coming back."
"__MUSIC__ Like Craig David?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly like Craig David."
"__MUSIC__ I reckon 90% of the audience were there ironically."
"__MUSIC__ I did like Barry Gibb though. So many classics."
"__MUSIC__ It's only sad that these days so many people only know the Bee Gees because so many people cover them."
"__MUSIC__ I tell you what Glastonbury was missing this year though. A strong female stand-out figure."
"__MUSIC__ Like Rihanna, Beyonce?"
"__MUSIC__ This year the best they could come up with Katy Perry. I like her but where's the girl power?"
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean."
