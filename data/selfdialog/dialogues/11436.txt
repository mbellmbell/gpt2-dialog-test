"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What NFL team do you hate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ummm, the Seahawks probably."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I hate them too, also Dallas Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes! America's Team? They need to upgrade that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, haha."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt they will win a Super Bowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt it too but you never know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Minnesota Vikings need to win one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they do. The oldest team to not win one I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, oldest in all sports I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Poor Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, maybe they will get one someday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adrian Peterson is gone but I think they are better off for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, they have a lot more cap space for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he was getting old and not as productive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Super Bowl is in their home town this year, it would be cool for them to win it at home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that would be perfect."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has never happened yet, winning at home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe this is the year."
