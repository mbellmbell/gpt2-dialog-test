"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh thats horrible, did they do it for real?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, definetely. I'm pretty sure they got suspended for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady must have been pissed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they all deserved it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, you would just have yourself to blame for that."
