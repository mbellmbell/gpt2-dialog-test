"__MOVIES__ Have you watched The Space Between Us?"
"__MOVIES__ The Asa Butterfield and Gary Oldman movie about the kid from Mars?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Britt Robertson and Carla Cugino are also in it. It was pretty good, I really enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Did Asa play the boy from Mars and was he an alien?"
"__MOVIES__ Not exactly, I mean Asa did play the main actor, but he wasn't an alien. His mom played by Janet Montgomery was the lead astronaut on a team that flew out to Mars to do an expedition at the camp sites NASA had set up there."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that sounds interesting, so he was born in space?"
"__MOVIES__ Well he was conceived on the ship during the flight out there, and I guess I'll spoil it, his mother dies from child birth. He ends up growing up on Mars with the dreams to visit Earth."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a really good concept. I really liked him in Ender's Game and Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children. I also enjoy all of Gary Oldman's performances. Britt Robertson was a friend in this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Britt Robertson plays his only friend. She's a student on Earth and they communicate via chat daily. He eventually makes his way back to Earth and begins his fish out of water experience."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoy these types of movies because it gives you a look at how things would be if you were truly not from this world experiencing it for the first time."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree that's why this movie drew me in initially. Carla Cugino basically is his surrogate mother who raises him on the base station on Mars and she also accompanies him back to Earth."
"__MOVIES__ She's such an underrated actress. She was really terrific in Sin City as well as Sucker Punch."
"__MOVIES__ I like her a lot as an actress too and agree she is really underrated. She was also in San Andreas as the Rock's wife."
"__MOVIES__ That's right! I forgot about that. I love disaster movies. So how does The Space Between Us play out."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not going to spoil it for you because I want you to see it. I think you'd like it a lot. Asa's can't survive Earth for long because his blood's density doesn't balance within the Earth's atmosphere so Gary Oldman and Carla Cugino try to track him down as he's escaped to visit Britt."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see. That sounds pretty intense. I'm sure there were a lot of good sequences and scenes about his exploration of Earth."
"__MOVIES__ There was, but I really wanted more. They could've really taken some liberties and gone more into depth with a lot of this but they left it, I felt, a little short."
"__MOVIES__ How was the relationship between Britt and Asa. Britt was wonderful in Tomorrowland as I thought that movie was better than most critics."
"__MOVIES__ They had a really good contrasting dynamic of personalities but I think they played off each other really well. I'd definitely recommend this movie for you."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks for that, I'm going to try to see if it's up on Netflix since it's been out for awhile now."
