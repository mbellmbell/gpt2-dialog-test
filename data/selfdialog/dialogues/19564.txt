"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any new movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw the the new King Kong movie."
"__MOVIES__ Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was great. Really action-packed."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I want to watch it soon."
"__MOVIES__ You definitely should watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Was it as good as the new Pirates of the Carribean movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Just as good but different, of course."
"__MOVIES__ What movie the main male character play in from King Kong?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he played in the X-men movie, First Class as the young Magneto."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. That's why he looked so familiar in the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ First Class was a good movie too. I liked learning about how the X-men came about."
"__MOVIES__ We got to see how Mystic looked as a person instead of as the blue mutant."
"__MOVIES__ It was interesting to see Xavier walking around instead of moving about in his wheelchair."
"__MOVIES__ Too bad he could keep walking and keep his awesome powers."
"__MOVIES__ That was a shame. At least his powers are cool."
"__MOVIES__ Magneto has one of the best powers though."
"__MOVIES__ His power would be a good power to have if you need to defend yourself."
"__MOVIES__ If he ever couldn't walk, he could just sit on a piece of metal and fly himself around."
"__MOVIES__ It would be cool to have the power to fly."
