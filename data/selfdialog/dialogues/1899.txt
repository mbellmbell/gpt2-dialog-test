"__MUSIC__ Were The Beatles from Germany?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they were from England."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that makes so much more sense. They kind of have a British accent."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they do. Do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, my dad was playing them in the car the other day and now I'm really into them."
"__MUSIC__ You've got a dad with a good taste in music."
"__MUSIC__ He's a pretty good dad all around but yeah, I definitely approve of his musical taste."
"__MUSIC__ What other music does he listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Mainly just the oldies. Simon and Garfunkle, Billy Joel, Frank Sinatra, to name a few."
"__MUSIC__ Those are really good artists!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm just now I'm realizing that. I never really gave them a chance before."
"__MUSIC__ I feel that all of our musical tastes shift as we grow older."
"__MUSIC__ I would definitely have to agree. I used to love Miley Cyrus and now whenever I hear her sing, I don't understand why."
"__MUSIC__ The same thing happened to me with the Jonas Brothers."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I used to be obsessed with them too. I don't really like them anymore but I still really love 'When You Look Me in the Eyes.'"
"__MUSIC__ I actually want that to be my wedding song."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I haven't really put any thought into what I want my wedding song to be."
"__MUSIC__ I want either that song or 'A Thousand Years' by Christina Perri."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good one!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's one of my all time favorite songs and I think it would be just perfect for a wedding."
