"__MOVIES__ So did you like the first Reacher movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I absolutely hated it. I almost walked out."
"__MOVIES__ I hated it too. Why didn't you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for one thing, Jack Reacher is supposed to be--"
"__MOVIES__ Tall! Huge! Gigantic! Tom Cruise is--"
"__MOVIES__ Short. Undersized. Not--"
"__MOVIES__ Not tall. At all."
"__MOVIES__ And then, Cruise can't act, either."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes he can. Magnolia. Risky Business. Jerry Maguire. Interview with the Vampire."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, yes, he can act. But in this one, he didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're right. I wonder why not."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe he knew it was hopeless."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, maybe. A bad script, a bad physical fit, maybe he gave up before he started."
"__MOVIES__ Or maybe he just doesn't want to be an actor any more."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Maybe, in his mind, he's retired."
"__MOVIES__ Or maybe he had huge, distracting, personal troubles."
"__MOVIES__ Or maybe he was sick."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it doesn't matter. They're making another one anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, no."
"__MOVIES__ Because he's such a star he doesn't even have to act."
