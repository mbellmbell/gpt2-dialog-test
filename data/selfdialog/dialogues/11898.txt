"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think of the QB the Bears drafted?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they gave up a lot to trade up to the 2nd draft position to get him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. He better be great, or that was a mistake."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A great QB really makes all the difference in your team's chances though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So true. You've got to roll the dice and hope you get lucky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I believe QB is the hardest position to scout. More busts there than any position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, this guy has quite an arm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He'll need it at Soldier Field in the winter time. The wind there can be awful to throw against."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard a lot about his accuracy. I really hope it's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding. Cutler had a great arm, but he wasn't accurate, and it killed them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It killed me watching it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you see short throws from the best QBs  that are in the perfect position leading the receiver go for huge plays all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most of them are so fast that if you don't make them stop or lunge just to catch it, they can gobble up huge chunks of real estate in a flash."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ God, I'd give anything to see that on a regular basis here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the dream!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So we'll see how he turns out. Hope springs eternal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's got some definite pluses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But lots of college experience isn't one of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, that's the risk. The claim they don't expect him to play much this year as he learns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the plan. But they're just one big hit on the veteran starter Glennon away from having a whole new plan. It's be trial by fire."
