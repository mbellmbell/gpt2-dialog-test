"__MUSIC__ I just got some new guitar strings. Gonna put them on."
"__MUSIC__ You play guitar? and change your own strings?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I played from like 8 to 30 or so. Got pretty good, then got busy with life and such."
"__MUSIC__ So you're picking it up again, no pun intended?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha yeah, and boy am I rusty! A few years ago somebody handed me their guitar and while I used to wow people with Under the Double Eagle, I just froze."
"__MUSIC__ Under the Double Eagle?"
"__MUSIC__ Bluegrass. Hard picking. You've heard it, everyone has."
"__MUSIC__ What else do you play?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorites from childhood/youth were James Taylor, Cat Stevens, and, yes. John Denver. eek."
"__MUSIC__ Haha yeah, John Denver is pretty cringworthy, but still he was really good and fitting for his time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, when every young girl wore overall jeans, had Kristy McNichol hair and nature shows like Grizzly Adams were in."
"__MUSIC__ Yes - remember John Denver Christmas specials?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Always in some transparent dome thingie in the Colorado Rockies. Like a John Denver snow globe haha."
"__MUSIC__ Sad he died so young. He definitely had some good environmental activism left in him."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I don't play his stuff any more though, too goofy."
"__MUSIC__ Do you play classical at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, I did a little at first but didn't like the nylong strings and wider guitar neck and all that long fingernail stuff haha."
"__MUSIC__ You could use picks?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was just being funny. Now I have a few classical pieces I wish I could play."
"__MUSIC__ Once you get the rust out you can try!"
