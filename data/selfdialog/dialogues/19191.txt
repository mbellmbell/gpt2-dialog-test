"__MOVIES__ What would you say is the most overrated movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Off the top of my head, maybe Titanic."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it won the most Oscars of any movie ever, and made a boatload of money. And it just wasnt that great of a movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know that people act like it's the best movie ever, though."
"__MOVIES__ Then why did it win the greatest number of Academy Awards?"
"__MOVIES__ I think because it was a technical challenge to make the movie. Technically, it's a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ All that technology doesn't make it a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't make the plot good, or the acting performances good. Although I think Kate Winslet was good."
"__MOVIES__ She was good, and Leonardo DiCaprio was OK, but the plot was really cliched."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes, people like movie plots that are cliched. Take Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I see what you mean. Sometimes a simple story is best."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's especially true of visually stunning, extravagant movies."
"__MOVIES__ Now that I think about it, Avatar was kind of the same way."
"__MOVIES__ That seems to be James Cameron's style."
"__MOVIES__ He directed Titanic and Avatar?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I'm pretty sure he did. Avatar made even more money than Titanic."
"__MOVIES__ And had an evil worse plot! But it was one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ So back to Titanic, I think it was a movie that was really good for what it was."
"__MOVIES__ I see where you're coming from."
