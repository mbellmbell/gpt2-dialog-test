"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that I saw the first Star Wars movie in the theater?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No way, A New Hope? That's crazy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I went with my brother.  At the time the special effects were amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ The first appearance of Luke Skywalker!"
"__STAR_WARS__ i remember that Harrison Ford became a big action star."
"__STAR_WARS__ Empire Strikes back was a better movie though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, maybe.  Actually the first three were terrific."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then the next three were horrible.  Somebody should have written out Jar Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Although the new series is great.  I like the appearance of the original characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ But too bad about Carrie Fisher, and then wrote Ford out, so that's a bummer."
