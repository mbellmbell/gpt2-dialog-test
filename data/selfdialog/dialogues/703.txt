"__MUSIC__ Who is the best rock and roll band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Easy: Van Halen."
"__MUSIC__ No way. Van Hajen is good but they aren't the best of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, then who is?"
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Look, I know everybody worships the Beatles, but I don't think they're the best of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Ok then, who is?"
"__MUSIC__ Well since I can't answer Van Halen, I'll say AC/DC."
"__MUSIC__ They might be the best heavy metal band of all time, but not the best rock and roll band."
"__MUSIC__ Oh please. Then who is the best rock band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ The Rolling Stones."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, now you're talking. I could agree with that."
"__MUSIC__ But I'm not sure the best heavy metal band is AC/DC."
"__MUSIC__ If not AC/DC, then who?"
"__MUSIC__ KISS."
"__MUSIC__ Look, KISS is legendary, but I wouldn't call it heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember 'I was made for loving you'?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. I guess they would be considered rock."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly my point."
