"__MUSIC__ Hey man have you heard the latest Panic! at the Disco song?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't even know they were still making music."
"__MUSIC__ They sure are, they just released an entire album, Death of a Bachelor."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! I have heard that then. But only the title song, Death of a Bachelor."
"__MUSIC__ To be honest I haven't listened to it too in depth either. I think I'm still obsessed with their old stuff."
"__MUSIC__ For sure, every time I Write Sins Not Tragedies comes on my playlist I'm screaming the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I'D CHIME IN WITH A HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF --"
"__MUSIC__ CLOSING A GODDAMN DOOR, NO --"
"__MUSIC__ Wait, it's 'a' door? I thought it was 'the' door."
"__MUSIC__ Mandela effect dude, Brendon Urie tweeted about it himself."
"__MUSIC__ There's no way! I used to sing that song everyday in eighth grade."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe because you were singing so hard is why you never heard the actual lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ That's crazy, hey do you know who else is even in Panic! at the Disco besides Brendon Urie?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I've heard that they've all been replaced multiple times."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha really? So the band is really just Brendon Urie."
"__MUSIC__ It would appear that way, yes."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know some of those people you think are bands are just one person?"
"__MUSIC__ If you told me those girls in Haim are all the same person I'd totally believe it."
"__MUSIC__ Haha no. Francis and the Lights and Marina and the Diamonds are just one person."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, why can't they just be like everyone else and call themselves Francis and Marina?"
