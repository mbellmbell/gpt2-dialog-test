"__MUSIC__ Hey, are you a fan of Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I am, but I don't know too much about her."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what is your favorite album she made?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like the Red album, but I don't know too many more."
"__MUSIC__ You should let me make a few suggestions."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, go right ahead."
"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with Speak Now or Fearless?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I haven't heard of those."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, those are earlier records and will probably suit you if you like Red."
"__MUSIC__ So, what popular songs are on those two albums."
"__MUSIC__ Speak Now and Back to December are my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I'll be sure to listen soon. Have you heard the 1989 album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's not my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Why not? I thought you liked Taylor Swift too?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, but these are newer and more mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by more mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it seems like the record labels are dictating what kind of songs should be showcased."
"__MUSIC__ Oh ok, yes, I heard that happens a lot to established artists."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I hear that too."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I have to go to lunch now, but thanks for your suggestions."
