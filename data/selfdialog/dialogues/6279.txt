"__STAR_WARS__ How many Star Wars movies are there?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to say 8, including The Force Awakens and Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've seen two of them. Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you've never seen any of the ones from the 70's?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No but I've been making it a point to watch them. What's your favorite of the originals?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to say Return of the Jedi. That's when things got real."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah? Well is it necessary for me to watch them in chronological order?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would say that's your best bet so that it flows seamlessly for you. The storyline I mean."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh ok. Is it true that James Earl Jones does the voice of Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! He's such a great voice actor. One of the greatest of our time."
