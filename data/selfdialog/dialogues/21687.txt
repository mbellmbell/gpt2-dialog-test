"__DISNEY__ I noticed something about almost all Disney movies.  There are almost no 2-parent families."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Think about it.  Bambi, Cinderella, Lion King, Toy Story(s), Dumbo, Sleeping Beauty..."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, I never realized that."
"__DISNEY__ Sometimes there's two but something terrible happens.  Like Finding Nemo."
"__DISNEY__ Are there any with whole families?"
"__DISNEY__ The Incredibles has both parents.  Maybe Brave?"
"__DISNEY__ The one with Merida?  Yeah, I think so."
"__DISNEY__ They sould show more 2-parent families.  Even same-sex couples."
"__DISNEY__ Right, that doesn't imply some sort of tragedy or divorce."
