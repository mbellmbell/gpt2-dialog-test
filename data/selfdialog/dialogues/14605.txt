"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What's up?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not much, you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh the usual, but I have a funny story for you."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, my husband was listening to music the other day on YouTube, while I was blowing bubbles for our son."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Kay..."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, he's just started talking, and 'You're welcome' is one of the things he's saying."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Your husband?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, my son silly."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ha ha ha, I knew that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Anyway, the 'You're Welcome' song comes up as part of the mix."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The one from 'Moana.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, that The Rock sings."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He's so cool!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Anyway, my son bolts for the computer and watches the whole song even repeating, 'You're Welcome,' a few times."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's so cute."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Speaking of The Rock, do you plan to see the 'Baywatch' movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I like The Rock, but that one looks stupid."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I wasn't going to see it in theaters with the other stuff I'd rather see, but I miht rent it when it comes out."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Check it out from the library, and then it would be free."
