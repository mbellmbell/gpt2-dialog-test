"__MOVIES__ Do you know anything about mumblecore movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Surprisingly, a bit."
"__MOVIES__ I just started dating a girl who told me that her favorite genre is mumblecore. What do you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of Hannah Takes the Stairs?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. Is that a mumblecore film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's one of the most famous. It's by a director called Joe Swanberg, he's widely credited as one of the originators of mumblecore."
"__MOVIES__ Any other directors I might know?"
"__MOVIES__ You might have heard of the Duplass Brothers. Mark Duplass was on the television show The League and Jay Duplass is on Transparent."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know both of them actually, but not their movies! What did they make?"
"__MOVIES__ They've made quite a few movies. The Puffy Chair, Baghead, Cyrus, Jeff Who Lives at Home, Creep, The Do-Deca-Pentathlon."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is a lot of stuff. Which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Cyrus is probably my favorite, but The Puffy Chair, their first feature length is my second favorite and probably the most emblematic of mumblecore."
"__MOVIES__ What exactly is mumblecore then?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a lo-fi style of movie production, usually recorded very cheaply, sometimes with a shaky camera."
"__MOVIES__ Why not just call it lo-fi?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there are other elements to it. The characters have a script, but there's a bit of improv."
"__MOVIES__ I see, what else?"
"__MOVIES__ The filmmakers are trying to capture raw human emotion and what is essential in relationships rather than load a movie up with special effects."
"__MOVIES__ I like the sound of this. Maybe this girl is for me."
"__MOVIES__ She might be. You should definitely watch The Puffy Chair."
