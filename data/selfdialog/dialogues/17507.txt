"__MOVIES__ What kinds of movies have you seen lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw a really good scary movie not too long ago."
"__MOVIES__ Which one was that?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw The Babadook."
"__MOVIES__ That's a funny name. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a monster movie about a story book character that comes to life."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, okay. That's creepy."
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty creepy, but the whole movie is very artistically done."
"__MOVIES__ How is that?"
"__MOVIES__ There are scenes where the mom is dreaming and she floats down into her bed to make you feel like you're dreaming with her."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty cool. What else is interesting?"
"__MOVIES__ The choice of colors and camera angles are all interesting too."
"__MOVIES__ Care to explain some more?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they chose a bunch of dull and drab colors to make the movie feel depressing."
"__MOVIES__ Huh, that's interesting. Not a lot of movies do that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah this movie did a lot of things differently."
"__MOVIES__ What else did it do? Did it end well?"
"__MOVIES__ The ending was really cool, basically they decided to live with the monster and keep him in the basement."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wow! That's awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was a cool thing to do, there's a lot of metaphorical stuff going on with that you should look into."
