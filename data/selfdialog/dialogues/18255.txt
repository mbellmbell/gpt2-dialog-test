"__MOVIES__ Have you seen It Follows?"
"__MOVIES__ No. What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a horror movie about a monster that follows you by walking."
"__MOVIES__ So it's really easy to get away from?"
"__MOVIES__ Sorta. But it's always walking, so you can't ever rest."
"__MOVIES__ That seems really bleak."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was an unusual movie. Felt very out of time."
"__MOVIES__ Do you usually watch horror movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Not all that often. I don't get scared very easily."
"__MOVIES__ Ah. I can't. I won't be able to sleep if I do."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen anything good lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw the new Guardians of the Galaxy last week."
"__MOVIES__ Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Not as good as the first, but we had a lot of fun."
"__MOVIES__ Chris Pratt was great in the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's really having a moment."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of want them to remake Indiana Jones with him as the lead."
"__MOVIES__ I'd pay to see that!"
"__MOVIES__ Right? I think it's a great idea."
"__MOVIES__ That might be a remake that actually works!"
