"__BEATLES__ To me, it was like The Beatles changed everthing. They picked rock up and shook it, and put it down somewhere else."
"__BEATLES__ Yet they had influences, of course, like anybody. They didn't just spring out of nowhere."
"__BEATLES__ I know that when they were getting started, at the Star Club in Hamburg, Little Richard was playing there too."
"__BEATLES__ I know when Paul McCartney was in school he idolized Little Richard."
"__BEATLES__ And John praised him too. They all admired his musical daring, I imagine."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. When the Beatles were inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame Harrison said they wouldn't be there if not for Little Richard."
"__BEATLES__ I heard Little Richard was there for the ceremony, and Harrison pointed at him and said, 'It's all his fault, really.'"
"__BEATLES__ Funny. But Harrison's big influence was Ravi Shankar. That's where the boys got all the sitar music."
"__BEATLES__ I heard Harrison studied with him in India."
"__BEATLES__ And Lennon was influenced by his poor mother, who couldn't raise him but taught him banjo and gave him a guitar."
