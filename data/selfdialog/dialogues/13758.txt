"__BASKETBALL__ Who won game 6 between the Celtics and Wizards last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Wizards did, but just barely, and only because John Wall made a game-winning three."
"__BASKETBALL__ John Wall is a terrific player, one of my favorites to watch."
"__BASKETBALL__ He could have been MVP if it weren't for James Harden and Russell Westbrook getting all those triple-doubles."
"__BASKETBALL__ Which team do you think will win this series."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know, because neither team seems to want it bad enough. Regardless, the Cavaliers will beat either team to get to the Finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ So are you saying there will be a Warriors-Cavaliers rematch?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It could happen, but the Warriors have to go through the Spurs first, and the Spurs aren't easy to beat."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think LeBron James is as good as Michael Jordan?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's hard to say. I think time will tell."
"__BASKETBALL__ I ask because Jordan has six championships, but LeBron only has half that amount."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, but LeBron has some years of basketball still yet to play. He has time to win three more."
"__BASKETBALL__ Right, but he'll probably have to hurry. The Cavaliers won't stay this good forever, unless they're the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, because the Spurs are good every year, regardless of who plays for them. I don't know how they do it."
"__BASKETBALL__ So, where will game 7 be played at?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It will be played in Boston, and, come to think of it, the Celtics will win just because of that."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. The Wizards barely won at home, and they surely aren't going to survive a hostile environment like Boston."
"__BASKETBALL__ Right. Plus there is too much green painted on that parquet basketball court."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not only that, but Isaiah Thomas will step up at the right time, and so will his teammates."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. This is Boston's best team since the big 3 of Garnett, Pierce, and Allen."
