"__MOVIES__ Did you see Rogue One yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure it; it was great."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I think it was the best Star Wars movie so far."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not so sure I'ld go that far; I really like The Empire Strikes Back."
"__MOVIES__ They're kind of similar, aren't they?  Both are pretty dark."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but Empire Strikes Back did it first."
"__MOVIES__ I think Rogue One did it better.  I liked that they were willing to have such a dark ending."
"__MOVIES__ I did like the ending, although it did seem a bit harsh to kill everyone."
"__MOVIES__ How could they have possibly escaped and had it be believable?"
"__MOVIES__ Good point; I'm not sure how you could have written that without seeming forced."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the acting was really good, too."
"__MOVIES__ The writing was excellent, as well.  I liked that the characters had shades of gray."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, having everything be too clearly good versus evil is a weakness in Star Wars."
"__MOVIES__ It seems more compelling to have the good guys have some bad traits and bad people working with them."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of bad people, I do wish they had spent more time with Forrest Whittaker's character."
"__MOVIES__ I agree; I felt short-changed there."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe they'll get to him in another one-shot."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully so; better him that Jar-Jar Binks!"
"__MOVIES__ Anything is better than Jar-Jar!"
"__MOVIES__ That we can agree on!"
