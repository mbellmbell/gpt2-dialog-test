"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think has the best stadium in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without a doubt, it's the Cowboys. The billion dollar playground."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jerry Jones really loves to be a showoff. That stadium is insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The technology, design, and experience is bar none."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet. I would agree that the Cowboys have the best stadium. What other stadiums stand out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say that Seattle's stadium is pretty spectacular as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Architecturally, it is a pretty stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did a good job with that stadium, especially making it unique."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is definitely unique. What about the older stadiums like Soldier Field or Lambeau Field?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are great stadiums for other reasons. So much history in those stadiums."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe they gave Soldier Field a makeover a few years ago, didn't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe so. At it's core, it is still Soldier Field. I believe they gave it a makeover and added a few more seats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Soldier Field does have so much history. Lambeau Field even more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lambeau Field should be on the registry of historic sites."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think it is, but I could be wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think is the worst stadium in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the stadium the Dolphins play in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know what they call it now, but I agree, it's had its day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It has had its day. They should build a new stadium there instead of remodeling that stadium and giving it a new name every year."
