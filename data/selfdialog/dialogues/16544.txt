"__MOVIES__ Did you ever happen to see the movie In Good Company?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think I missed that one. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Scarlett Johansson, Topher Grace, and Dennis Quaid"
"__MOVIES__ Those are pretty big names, but it's not ringing a bell."
"__MOVIES__ It was kind of advertised as a romance, but that's not what it was really about."
"__MOVIES__ Weird. So what's it really about?"
"__MOVIES__ Topher's character basically comes into Quaid's company all new and shiny and becomes his boss. It's sort of how older workers aren't respected."
"__MOVIES__ And Scarlett works there too?"
"__MOVIES__ No, she plays Quaid's daughter. And eventually Topher's secret girlfriend."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my. I'm guessing dad is not pleased?"
"__MOVIES__ You would guess right. But there's a sweetness to the story I wasn't expecting."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Like how it kind of becomes clear that what Topher's really looking for is a father figure."
"__MOVIES__ So Quaid comes around eventually?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and no. You don't want me to spoil everything do you?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess not. We should watch it sometime."
"__MOVIES__ We should. I just feel like it was a really good movie that kind of slipped through the cracks."
"__MOVIES__ I hate it when that happens."
"__MOVIES__ But then we get to have the fun of discovering them."
"__MOVIES__ Very true. Now I want to go explore Netflix."
