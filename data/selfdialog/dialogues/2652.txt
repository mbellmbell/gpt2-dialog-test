"__MUSIC__ I love concerts. When was the last time you went to see something live?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was a few months ago."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, it has been a while. Who did you see?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw a band called Old Dominion downtown. Have you heard of them?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. They have a song on country radio, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they had one big hit last year."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool. I went to see a jazz band at a local bar a last night."
"__MUSIC__ What bar?"
"__MUSIC__ A new bar opened in downtown called Regressive, and they have live music every Thursday night."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds fun. Do you have to pay to get in."
"__MUSIC__ No cover charge. The band's pianist was the best I've ever seen."
"__MUSIC__ Did they have a saxophone too?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember seeing a saxophone, but they did have a trumpet."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that I can play the trumpet?"
"__MUSIC__ Really! Would you be able to show me a song?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. What is your favorite jazz song?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure that I know any songs by name. Play me your favorite."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite artist is Sidney Bechet, so I'll play you one of those songs."
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of them. Why is Sidney your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ The music is classic, original jazz from before it was popular."
