"__STAR_WARS__ Which Star Wars film trilogy do you like best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a hard one. The trilogy with Anakin Skywalker's backstory had such great computer animation."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed.  So you like them both equally?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No really I prefer the first trilogy that started in the 70's."
"__STAR_WARS__ Unh hunh, what do you like about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The basic story.  Lucas created a mythic tale, no fuss."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea I heard he drew from different archetypes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, so the basic stories to me, were front and center."
"__STAR_WARS__ They weren't hard to understand or follow."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was just his dialogue they say needed polishing."
