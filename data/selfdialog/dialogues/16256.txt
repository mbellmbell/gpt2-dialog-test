"__ROCK__ Do you think Journey is going to keep touring?"
"__ROCK__ Why wouldn't they?"
"__ROCK__ Well there's some drama between Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain."
"__ROCK__ But there's always drama in that band."
"__ROCK__ That's true. I want them to reunite with Steve Perry."
"__ROCK__ I doubt that will ever happen. I just want Steve's new solo record."
"__ROCK__ Wait, he's working on a solo project?"
"__ROCK__ That's what he recently."
"__ROCK__ I'd buy that in a hearbeat!"
"__ROCK__ Me, too! I hope his voice hasn't changed too much over the years."
