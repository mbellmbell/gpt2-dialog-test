"__POP__ What do you think about Sia?"
"__POP__ I don't really listen to her much, but I don't have anything bad to say about her."
"__POP__ So, you like her music?"
"__POP__ It's not bad.  At least it isn't annoying like a lot of other music."
"__POP__ No, but she's kind of weird."
"__POP__ I don't know.  The hair thing?"
"__POP__ Yeah, that and the weird videos and stuff."
"__POP__ Well, I figure the hair is for her to stay anonymous."
"__POP__ Oh, that would be smart."
"__POP__ Yeah, she could probably easily go out in public."
