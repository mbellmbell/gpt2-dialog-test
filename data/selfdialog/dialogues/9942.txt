"__COMEDY__ Okay, comedies. Will we ever get a good one again?"
"__COMEDY__ Every year someone says 'no really, ____ was good.' I go to see it and its stale garbage."
"__COMEDY__ Hah, I know the feeling. Doesn't matter who is starring."
"__COMEDY__ The problem is that the main people churning them out are just stale. Feig, Apatow, anything with Seth Rogen."
"__COMEDY__ I'm with you there. But even the indie scene has been a failure recently!"
"__COMEDY__ The last good comedy I saw was The Overnight."
"__COMEDY__ Wasn't crazy about it, though I did laugh."
"__COMEDY__ We need another Obvious Child, In Another World, and so on. Just, something"
"__COMEDY__ It's possible that the best comedies are being made elsewhere. I need to check outside the US"
"__COMEDY__ Good call. I can't stomach another raunchy crap fest"
