"__BASEBALL__ Did you see last night's baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I cannot believe that Brad Brach blew another save."
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees have owned him this season."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but did you see the homerun by Aaron Judge in the 14th inning to win it?"
"__BASEBALL__ Ha, by then I was fast asleep."
"__BASEBALL__ I was exhausted but it was totally worth staying up for, he hit it in the black seats at the stadium."
"__BASEBALL__ Seriously?  Isn't he just the second one to do that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Certainly is, Alex Rodriguez did it 5 years ago."
"__BASEBALL__ That Judge kid looks to be an amazing young talent."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I like the young core that the Yankees have with Judge, Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius."
"__BASEBALL__ I really wasn't sure why the Yankees let Brian McCann go to Houston, but now I see why watching Sanchez."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the 20 homeruns he hit last year are definitely no fluke."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree and Judge is already at 15 in his rookie season and we are only in May."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, 15 already! I did not realize it was that many."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and when he hits one it is long gone over the fence."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, his longest was around 460 feet this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Was that the longest homerun in the Major Leagues this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, it was close but someone hit a ball farther in Miami."
"__BASEBALL__ Mike Stanton?"
"__BASEBALL__ But of course :-)"
