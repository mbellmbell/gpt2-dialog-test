"__DISNEY__ I can't believe that there is going to be a toy story 4 movie."
"__DISNEY__ Oh really?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, Pixar is already working on it."
"__DISNEY__ I can't wait, i loved the last one."
"__DISNEY__ I know, it was awesome, but i don't really like how long these movies take to be released."
"__DISNEY__ I totally agree with you there."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think that we will be seeing the same characters again?"
"__DISNEY__ I hope so, it wouldn't be the same without them. I can't imagine a toy story without Woody & Buzz"
"__DISNEY__ Well, i guess we will wait a couple of years to find out."
"__DISNEY__ It's going to be all worth it, believe me."
