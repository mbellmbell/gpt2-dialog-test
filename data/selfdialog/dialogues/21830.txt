"__DISNEY__ Star Wars is now owned by Disney, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Disney bought it from George Lucas I think two or three years ago now."
"__DISNEY__ But are they really 'Disney' movies? I mean, there's no songs or anything..."
"__DISNEY__ Well, there is the cantina scene in the new one. Not like the original, but still cantina-like."
"__DISNEY__ You're being difficult. You know what I mean. Singing."
"__DISNEY__ Sorry, I know what you mean. Yeah, I guess they are different in that way. But Disney also did live action movies without songs in the past."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, like The Black Hole, I used to love that movie. Especially the robots."
"__DISNEY__ There was another one that scared the heck outta me, Watcher in the Woods I think it was called."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! I totally remember that. Well, I remember really liking it, but can't actually remember anything other than it was scary."
"__DISNEY__ They need to make a reboot of that. Maybe in the Star Wars universe. I'd watch that for sure."
