"__DISNEY__ I saw Pocahontas on a plane ride yesterday."
"__DISNEY__ What'd you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Awful movie."
"__DISNEY__ You're awful!  What did you hate it."
"__DISNEY__ Mel Gibson did a horrible job as John Smith."
"__DISNEY__ He wasn't in it that much really."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but every scene, all I can think about was how I don't like Mel Gibson"
"__DISNEY__ So really, it's not about not liking the movie, it's about you not liking Mel Gibson."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I guess you could say that."
"__DISNEY__ You should give the movie another try, just mute his parts."
