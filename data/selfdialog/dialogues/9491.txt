"__BASEBALL__ did you watch the Royals game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ yes, it was another low scoring game."
"__BASEBALL__ Did they win?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, they won 3-2."
"__BASEBALL__ What pitcher won the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ Joakim Soria. I can't believe he actually got anyone out with his stuff."
"__BASEBALL__ Who was the starting pticher?"
"__BASEBALL__ Danny Duffy. He did well, he allowed 2 runs in 7 innings."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, that's great, too bad he didn't get the win."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, he's been our only really reliable pitcher this year."
"__BASEBALL__ So how did the Royals score their runs?"
"__BASEBALL__ Brandon Moss hit a home run into the fountains in right field."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't believe that! He's had such a bad year."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe he is finally seeing the ball better."
"__BASEBALL__ Who will be pitching when we go to the game tomorrow?"
"__BASEBALL__ Unfortunately, Chris Young."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, wow, that's going to be a slugfest, and not good for us.  Well, at least our Mom's will have a chance to talk during the game since it will be over by the 2nd inning!"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, going to the game is always fun regardless of how bad they do."
"__BASEBALL__ You're right, I'm really looking forward to going, since we don't get to go very often, and I know our Mom's will enjoy going to see a baseball game in person."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too, plus, they are giving away sun hats for Mother's Day for all of the Mom's, so that will be nice for them to wear while watching the game in the sun."
