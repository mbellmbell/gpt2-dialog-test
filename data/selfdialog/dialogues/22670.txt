"__DISNEY__ I was watching Cars the other night, my favorite is still Sally."
"__DISNEY__ I'm more partial to Doc. That scene where he puts on his old race tires and is my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ That's when Lightening realizes that he was in the presence of greatness."
"__DISNEY__ It was. The colors in that part of the film were amazing, and the blue on Doc, well...it reminded me so much of Paul Newman's eyes."
"__DISNEY__ I just loved seeing Doc on the stand, at the race."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite part in that scene was when Mator finally said goodbye."
"__DISNEY__ Red, Lizzy and Sally gathered around that old black and white tv was adorable. I think they stayed behind for Lizzie."
"__DISNEY__ I do too. She is a great character, I liked when she slapped that bumper sticker on Lightening."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! And, when she said goodnight to Stanley."
"__DISNEY__ That was sad and sweet at the same time."
