"__DISNEY__ Hey have you watched Beauty and the Beast yet?"
"__DISNEY__ The original one or the one with Emma Watson?"
"__DISNEY__ Emma Watson! The newest one."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, I've seen it already. I loved it."
"__DISNEY__ Same! I love the feeling you get when you watch Disney movies!"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ They just feel so comforting and familiar I guess."
"__DISNEY__ I know exactly what you mean! The introduction is my favorite part."
"__DISNEY__ When the fireworks fly over the castle it just feels so good!"
"__DISNEY__ I wish I could always feel that way!"
