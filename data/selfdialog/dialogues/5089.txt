"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What's the most outrageous stunt featuring a car in the Fast & the Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I would have to say when Paul Walker and Vin Diseal drove the supercar between the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was almost postivie you were going to say the bank vault scene!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What Fast movie was that in? I get them all mixed up now since there are so many."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The bank vault chase was in Fast 5, released in 2011."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Didn't Brian and Dom drag that entire bank vault down the streets of Rio de Janeiro?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes that's the scene! I think the craziest car scene was in 2 Fast 2 Furious, the first race when Brain jumped over the draw bridge in his car."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That scene still gives me chills when I watch it. The cinematography makes the viewer feel the adrenaline that the racers are feeling all the way up until the end."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think you can say that about any of the Fast & the Furious movies. Each film is adrenaline packed to the core."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh but what about that tank car chase in Fast & Furious 6? That was the most adrenaline packed scene in the entire series in my opinion."
