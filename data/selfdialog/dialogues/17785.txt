"__MOVIES__ We saw this awesome movie the other day."
"__MOVIES__ What was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Interstellar."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes. It's been out for a while, no?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's a few years old but we had never seen it before."
"__MOVIES__ So you guys liked it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was amazing! Such a beautiful, touching movie,"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really liked it too when I saw it. Matthew McConaughey is so good in that."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't he? I always like him, but in Interstellar, he really got me."
"__MOVIES__ The moment where he is watching a video of his son with his newborn, and so much time has passed..."
"__MOVIES__ Oh God... That killed me!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was amazingly touching."
"__MOVIES__ I know... And I really liked the pace of the movie too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It does take time to establish things. And there are so many things to consider in that story."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's very complex, and they get it right. It could have been confusing, but they managed to nail it."
"__MOVIES__ Totally. And I really liked Anne Hathaway as well. I don't get why people don't like her."
"__MOVIES__ It's just a stupid fad. People don't think by themselves. She is great."
"__MOVIES__ I loved her in Rachel Getting Married."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! That was a good movie!"
"__MOVIES__ And she was really good in it."
