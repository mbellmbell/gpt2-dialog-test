"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's the second best coach in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's an odd question."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it's because we all know who the best is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess you're right about that.  The Hoodie all the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I'm going to go with Mike McCarthy."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tied with New England for longest streak."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's good company."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus I think New England has more talent."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do.  Who else do you think is good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Andy Ried has been good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he has.  Talk about coaching with nothing."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mike Tomlin too."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Pete Carroll."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a good defense."
