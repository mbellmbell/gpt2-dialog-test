"__DISNEY__ I bet it's fantastic."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I loved that movie as a kid!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too, I wanted to be the lost princess so bad!"
"__DISNEY__ Me too!"

"__DISNEY__ I know, me too. I couldn't understand why the Czar hated her family!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but it didn't even matter, all that mattered to me was the love story!"
