"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Have you seen all the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Nope. I've only seen like the first two and then the 6th one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, it's pretty ridiculous that they can make so many movies from that one franchise."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I don't get it. I mean I liked the first one alright, but I feel like the other movies would just kind of all be the same storyline."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How'd you like the 6th one?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well first off, I only watched it because it was playing on the airplane I was on."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Haha, so you were basically forced to watch it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I guess you could say that. I mean the movie was alright, it was pretty ridiculous at times and I didn't really know/remember half of the characters since it had been so long since I last saw a Fast and Furious movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well maybe you should watch the other ones then. Haha."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, no thanks. I mean I know of people who really enjoy them, but personally not really my cup of tea."
