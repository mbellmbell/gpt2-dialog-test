"__STAR_WARS__ Luke should have had a bigger role in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it doesn't make any sense that he'd just stay out there on an island for decades."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. It's incredibly irresponsible, if you think about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Certainly.  Luke from Return of the Jedi wouldn't have just ran away, he would have gone there and grabbed Kylo by the ear and brought him back home."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not like he could have been scared of Snoke. Snoke is nothing compared to Palpatine, and Luke confronted him without hesitating."
"__STAR_WARS__ They were probably trying to do the Yoda thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Yoda had an excuse, he was really old, and on his last legs. He also lost when he fought Palpatine. And originally, he wasn't even supposed to be a fighter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke doesn't have those excuses, does he? Maybe Snoke did beat him."
"__STAR_WARS__ If that's the case, then they have to show it.  It's also implausibly. Luke was one of the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ He wasn't that good. He was only half trained."
