"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new beauty and beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No not yet. Is it like the original?"
"__DISNEY__ In some ways. The original is better in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ I figured it would not be as good as the first, sequels never are as good as originals."
"__DISNEY__ The story line is close to the same though."
"__DISNEY__ That's good. I will have to just watch it and compare."
"__DISNEY__ It was worth the watch."
"__DISNEY__ Cool.  Are all the characters the same?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. There's bell, the beast, gustan, the candle stick, and the others."
"__DISNEY__ Good. I don't like when characters are changed.  Thanks"
