"__DISNEY__ Are you going to see the live action Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know. I love the animated one so much."
"__DISNEY__ I see, you want to keep your memories intact?"
"__DISNEY__ Exactly! How perfect is the first scene? Or the one where the Beast really lets his anger go?"
"__DISNEY__ What about Gaston's song? So clever!"
"__DISNEY__ It's just a perfect film. No wonder it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think you need to worry--my mom saw the new one and said it's fantastic."
"__DISNEY__ What did she like about it?"
"__DISNEY__ She said Emma Thompson is perfect."
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm...maybe I need to make time to see it."
