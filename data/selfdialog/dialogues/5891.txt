"__STAR_WARS__ So, the basic idea is to go back to Episode IV, A New Hope, and follow the implicit and expected plot points and developments, as if the other movies didn't exist in their current form."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, for starters, in that Universe, Luke and Leia aren't related and would probably have wound up together."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, because Darth Vader isn't their father and Obi Wan was telling the truth when he said that Vader killed Luke's Dad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which brings us to the Clone Wars, which were probably originally intended to be something entirely different."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe clones of Jedi's fighting each other, or something. Or a clone workforce uprising."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Emperor probably wasn't originally thought of as a Sith, either."
"__STAR_WARS__ No and Vader's power was a bit more limited than one might expect, seeing that in the first movie he had to obey an order from Grand Moff Tarkin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Peter Cushing was awesome as Tarkin and I've always thought it was neat that both he and Christopher Lee were involved in Star Wars, given their past history together."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, we're looking at a Star Wars Universe, where the Jedi's were probably less powerful, politically."
"__STAR_WARS__ Their influence would have been much more of an undercurrent, with their war against the Sith manifesting in ways, less than obvious to the general populace."
