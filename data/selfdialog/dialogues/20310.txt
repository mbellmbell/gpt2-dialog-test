"__MOVIES__ Guess what I went and saw last night?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ The Secret Life of Pets!  It was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I've been dying to see that!  How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it!  It totally lived up to its reviews."
"__MOVIES__ I'd love to know what my pets are doing and thinking during the day when I'm gone."
"__MOVIES__ I know right? It really cast light into the mind of pets."
"__MOVIES__ So was it as funny as it's supposed to be?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, even funnier.  The two dogs are hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ What actors did the voices in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Louis C.K. is one of them.  He's hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I love him!"
"__MOVIES__ And Kevin Hart was another one.  So they are two of my favorite comedians."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that definitely would make for a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is, you should see it.  It's got a lot of good adventure too."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  It didn't seem adventurous in the previews."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I was surprised by that, but the pets really go out on a limb."
"__MOVIES__ What about the cats?  They seemed funny too."
"__MOVIES__ There are definitely some funny cats, and a whole host of other animals."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you've got me sold!  I'm going to see it tonight."
