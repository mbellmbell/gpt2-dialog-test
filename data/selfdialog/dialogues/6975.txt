"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of Anakin's story in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh its so traguc. I felt bad for the Skywalkers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Mmm hmm. So do you think he was a bad guy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ To be sure, he did go to the dark side. He killed quite a bit."
"__STAR_WARS__ But you think he's a tragic character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  A lot of tragedies were caused by him, and in the end he was redeemed."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say it was hard to see the young, promising Anakin, knowing he'd go astray."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then events went full circle, and Darth Vader rebelled against the Emperor."
"__STAR_WARS__ So in one way love ruled the day."
