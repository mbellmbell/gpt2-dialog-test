"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the last Mets game?"
"__BASEBALL__ The one in Arizona?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the Wednesday game."
"__BASEBALL__ I did. They lost."
"__BASEBALL__ They've lost seven games in a row now."
"__BASEBALL__ That's pretty bad. Do you think the season is already over for them?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nah, I think they have time to bounce back."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe. Yoenis Cespedes comes back next week and that should help."
"__BASEBALL__ True. I think they have a few other key players out with injuries too."
"__BASEBALL__ Yup, Steven Matz and Seth Lugo should be back soon too."
"__BASEBALL__ Too many early season injuries, in my opinion. It really cost them."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah and I heard Noah Syndergaard might not be back at all this season."
"__BASEBALL__ Has the coach said anything?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, but a team official said they've deserved to lose these games. They aren't playing well."
"__BASEBALL__ It's weird that they're still managing to cling to second in scoring in the Major Leagues."
"__BASEBALL__ The games have had really high scores."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they lost to the Brewers 11-9 last week."
"__BASEBALL__ Still, I have hope the team can turn it around."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too. There's a lot of talent on the Mets."
"__BASEBALL__ Once the core team is healthy and returns, I think they'll see better results."
