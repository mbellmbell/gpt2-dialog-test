"__BASKETBALL__ Which conference is the strongest for NCAA basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Mens or womens?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Womens."
"__BASKETBALL__ I have no idea. I don't watch that because it's crap. Whichever UConn is in."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay then. How about mens?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Despite the long-standing dominance of the ACC, they haven't been as good."
"__BASKETBALL__ They just won the tournament this year. UNC was 33-7 and the national title. Are you blind?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, you can't watch sports if you're blind. Duke, FSU, Louisville, and Notre Lame all had down seasons recently."
"__BASKETBALL__ So, who is better?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Bear with me...the Big Ten was the best this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ What? HOW?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, despite MSU's down year (which was due to injuries), they only had three sub-.500 teams this eyar."
"__BASKETBALL__ So?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, Maryland, Purdue, Wisconsin and Michigan were all highly-ranked this year at various points, and pretty much just lost to each other."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're saying that they just beat each other up?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yup. Most of the Big 10 team losses were to each other."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't buy it, sorry, ACC or bust."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's so narrow-minded. I bet you support OSU in football, too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I do."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think your priorities are off."
