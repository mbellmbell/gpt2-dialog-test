"__DISNEY__ I watched Lion King with my kids the other day. I think it is one of the best Disney movies ever!"
"__DISNEY__ Well I have to agree with you there. I love that movie, plus the music is great!"
"__DISNEY__ I just find the plot so interesting. It is entertaining to kids and makes adults think a little bit."
"__DISNEY__ For sure. Like how Mufasa is not really gone from Simba, even if he has passed away."
"__DISNEY__ I think it speaks to how we carry loved ones in our heart after they've passed on."
"__DISNEY__ But really, the best part is the music!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh definitely, I sometimes catch myself singing Hakuna Matata."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good one, plus the song that everyone loves-Can You Feel The Love Tonight."
"__DISNEY__ It is a classic. Plus, my daughter loved that storyline of Simba and Nala reuniting during the song."
"__DISNEY__ The love story within the plot is definitely a plus."
