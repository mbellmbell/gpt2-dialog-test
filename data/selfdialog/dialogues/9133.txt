"__BASEBALL__ So you pitched?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, In high school. varsity. Saved a few games, actually."
"__BASEBALL__ Nice. How fast is your fastball?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'mm a side armer, so my fast ball isn't my forte, you know."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok, what is? Curve ball? Slider?"
"__BASEBALL__ Slider definitely. I got it to a point where it spirals."
"__BASEBALL__ The thing is, though, it could spiral all it wants, if it goes over the plate straight, it's useless"
"__BASEBALL__ Yep, yep. my curve does that. But my slider, it spirals right up to the plate."
"__BASEBALL__ Nice. That must be hard to hit."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep, yep. I used to love watching that slide up and way into the right corner of the box."
"__BASEBALL__ You said you saved a few games?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, i get tired easily, so I didn't start much, but I can shut out a team for a few innings."
"__BASEBALL__ Nice. That's gotta be a bummer though. Not being able to start much."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, it's a team game. I don't mind. This one time We were up by 2 and it was the 5 inning. And boom, all of sudden they were up by 3 point."
"__BASEBALL__ So they scored 5 points nonstop?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, just back to back. They were just banging it out. So I was told to go in"
"__BASEBALL__ Man, that's some nerve racking job."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but I did Ok. Shut them down pretty quick with my sliders."
"__BASEBALL__ Spirals, up and away eh?"
