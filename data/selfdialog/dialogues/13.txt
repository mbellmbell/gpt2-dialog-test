"__MUSIC__ Guess what I just found out?"
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ Nicole Scherzinger was the only one that was singing for The Pussycat Dolls."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I couldn't believe when I heard that."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like I've been lied to."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I can't believe none of the other girls were singing."
"__MUSIC__ I guess none of the other girls really ever had any solos."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. I can't even remember any of their names."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what Nicole is up to now."
"__MUSIC__ I know she won Dancing With The Stars one season."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, and I think she sang in Broadway."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty impressive."
"__MUSIC__ Idina Menzel, the woman who sang Let It Go in Frozen, also stars in Broadway shows."
"__MUSIC__ She does have a very strong voice."
"__MUSIC__ Totally. She brings Let It Go to life with her voice."
"__MUSIC__ I definitely agree."
"__MUSIC__ I was shocked to find out that Kristen Bell was a singer, too."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, and she actually sings pretty well."
