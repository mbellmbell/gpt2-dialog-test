"__DISNEY__ I watched 101 Dalmations the other day."
"__DISNEY__ The live-action version, or the original one?"
"__DISNEY__ The original one. I forgot how good it is!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's a really fun movie."
"__DISNEY__ I like the style of animation it uses. It's kind of stylized, and it fits the setting."
"__DISNEY__ And all the puppies are so cute!"
"__DISNEY__ I really like Cruella de Vil as a villain, too."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, she's one of the great Disney villains!"
"__DISNEY__ Her look is so distinctive, with her black and white hair."
"__DISNEY__ You just shudder when she comes on screen, and that's part of what makes the movie great."
