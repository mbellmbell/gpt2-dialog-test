"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Star Wars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean the old ones or the new ones in theaters?"
"__MOVIES__ The news ones."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen Force Awakens, but I haven't seen Rogue One."
"__MOVIES__ What! Rogue one is where it gets good."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I didn't like Force awakens that much despite all the hype."
"__MOVIES__ Well it was hyped up a lot, but I also didn't think it was that good."
"__MOVIES__ But Rogue one?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought rogue one hit it out of the park. I highly recommend it?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like Force Awakens because I thought it was slow and didn't get a lot of the references."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you haven't seen star wars before?"
"__MOVIES__ No I never got into it, so all the characters are new."
"__MOVIES__ That explains a lot. Most people watching these movies are die hard Star Wars fans."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's kind of a turnoff."
"__MOVIES__ Regardless, I still think you should give Rogue One a chance. It's a lot better as a stand alone movie."
"__MOVIES__ Were the reviews good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they were much better than Force Awakens."
"__MOVIES__ Okay maybe I'll check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah we can go together too. I wouldn't mind watching it again."
"__MOVIES__ Oh nice. If you're willing to watch it again I would love to watch it."
