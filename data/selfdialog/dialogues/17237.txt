"__MOVIES__ Are there any sports movies worth the time?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess my first question would be what sport interests you?"
"__MOVIES__ I like lots of sports, but let's start with football."
"__MOVIES__ OK.     How about Rudy?     That is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ Remind me what that film is about."
"__MOVIES__ It is based on a true story, a kid wants on the Notre Dame football team."
"__MOVIES__ I think I remember it.     Working class, and he takes a job as the assistant or something."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is the one.      He works for the team all season, but does not get a shot."
"__MOVIES__ That is sad.     What happened in the end?"
"__MOVIES__ The other players convince the coach that they will not play unless Rudy is given his opportunity."
"__MOVIES__ Happy Ending.    That's nice.     What about a baseball movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I like that Kevin Costner one, For the Love of the Game."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that.      They got permission to use real logos and team names."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they did a very convincing simulation of a game and a broadcast."
"__MOVIES__ What was special about that game?"
"__MOVIES__ It was the final game of his career, and flashed back to his relationship with a woman."
"__MOVIES__ That's nice, a love story too.    Who was the female lead?"
"__MOVIES__ John Travolta's wife.    Kelly Preston, I believe."
"__MOVIES__ So it is there story too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.     The only thing is we know it is Fantasy given the role of the Detroit Tigers!"
