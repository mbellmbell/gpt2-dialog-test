"__MUSIC__ Makes you wonder why marching bands were so popular."
"__MUSIC__ it began in war times. when infantry men had to actually march towards their enemies."
"__MUSIC__ yep. I know. Without the drumbeat, people tire and slow down."
"__MUSIC__ And by keeping them in time with drum beats you get to the war zone more quickly."
"__MUSIC__ That became what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it combined with the various musical elements of the day. In the ancient world, it combined with the traveling musicians who performed at various festivals. which at later time became an elements of the military."
"__MUSIC__ For the reasons we talked about."
"__MUSIC__ Right. But as far as marching bands playing in sporting events like football, we do know the first band ever to play at a half time."
"__MUSIC__ Which is..."
"__MUSIC__ The marching Illini. The band from University of Illinois at Urbana champagne. That was in 1907. The beginning of a great American tradition."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, interesting. So before that year the half time show didn't exist?"
"__MUSIC__ Not as we thought of today. Certainly not with the marching bands. in the NFL half tiem shows come much later in 1920s i believe."
"__MUSIC__ John Philip Souza thought the marching Illinis were 'the world's greatest band'"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. And coming from the March King, that was a great compliment."
"__MUSIC__ It's kinda sad that these kids get made fun of util they get to college. I mean band geeks in high school are the worst"
"__MUSIC__ it's pretty harsh on many of them, but by high school, most of them get over it. i think it's harder in jr high and earlier."
"__MUSIC__ They're so vulnerable at that age."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. And once they get to college and beyond, they're popular because they can play a musical instrument, which is something most popular kids can't do."
"__MUSIC__ They were too busy being cool to learn an instrument. That's even sadder than being a band geek"
"__MUSIC__ No argument here. My kids are learning guitar and piano. No marching band stuff though. They will  bepopular even in high school, and even more so in college and after."
