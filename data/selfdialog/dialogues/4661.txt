"__MUSIC__ Hey did you ever listen to DMX?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I loved DMX when I was in high school!"
"__MUSIC__ I thought the dog barking thing was kinda funny."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he definitely had an original style.  But his beats were great."
"__MUSIC__ I know, and he was really original."
"__MUSIC__ He was.  That was a great time for hip hop music, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, all the great classics were big back then.  Tupac, Biggie, Dr. Dre, DMX, Jay-Z..."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were definitely unique.  The stuff today can't touch the stuff from back then!"
"__MUSIC__ I know it.  When I turn it on today, I don't know what it is I'm listening to."
"__MUSIC__ It all sounds the same to me."
"__MUSIC__ But that DMX...you could play the whole album without skipping a song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you really could.  He had some kind of weird scar on his face, didn't he?"
"__MUSIC__ I think you're thinking of Scarface.  He was another great rapper."
"__MUSIC__ No, I know who he is.  I mean DMX really did have a scar though."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, dude.  Maybe he did."
"__MUSIC__ Whatever happened to him, is he still making music?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure.  I don't really keep up with hip hop anymore."
"__MUSIC__ It's gotten so bad."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it has.  That's why I quit listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ I did the same for the same reason."
