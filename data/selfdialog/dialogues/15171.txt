"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen Chamber of Secrets?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes I have, it was pretty good."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree, big improvement over the first, and a lot more mature."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I liked the fight scene at the end.  And how it seems that Vodly is destined to come back."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know what you mean.  And that book, how innocent people can just be controlled by Voldy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And the part about parcil mouths.  It was cool how only a select few can speak to snakes."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That was one of Voldemort's best showings at the end.  Seems he got much closer to victory the second time around."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, to see him young, and get a glimpse of his planning abilities."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also liked the Griffendore sword."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Gave a warm feeling to the end as well."
