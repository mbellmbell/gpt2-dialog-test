"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sometimes I don't know how to feel about Dumbledore as a character. He was awfully manipulative."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but he make sure Harry survived, didn't he?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He took a lot of unnecessary chances though. He also lied to everyone around him, especially Harry and Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, he was trying to keep Voldemort from finding out about what they were doing, wasn't he?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess, but his methods seem really harsh, especially where Snape is concerned."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Lying to him about Harry having to die and all that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, not to mention forcing Snape to kill him so that Voldemort would believe that Snape was master of the Elder Wand."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Is that why he did it? I thought it was because he wanted Snape to take over at Hogwarts and protect the children."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, that was part of it. But like everything he did, he had multiple reasons."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I guess he was pretty tricky."
