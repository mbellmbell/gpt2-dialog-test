"__DISNEY__ I watched up last night."
"__DISNEY__ Dude, what did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ It made me cry.  I was not expecting that."
"__DISNEY__ At which part?"
"__DISNEY__ All of them!  Especially the beginning when his wife died."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, gets me everytime.  I balled at the end too."
"__DISNEY__ When the house was left there?"
"__DISNEY__ No, when he reads the storybook about having an adventure."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah.  I was wiping away tears the whole time.  Such a good movie."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe they'll make a sequel."
