"__MOVIES__ What movie do you think was awful?"
"__MOVIES__ The sex and the city films were complete wastes of money."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like either of them?"
"__MOVIES__ No, i thought they were really awful. The storyline of the first movie is really so depressing mostly."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the tv series?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved the show, it was one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, weird you hated the movies so much."
"__MOVIES__ Well the show ended so well, had tied everything together so wonderfully, totally stasified with each storyline."
"__MOVIES__ I do agree the end to the show felt very satisfying for all characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and then to have carrie and big on the outs again and go through all that, just hated it."
"__MOVIES__ We did wait all those years for them to be together then the movie essentially ripped them apart."
"__MOVIES__ More than that, samantha in the movie could not be happy in a monogamous relationship with smith.Frustrating."
"__MOVIES__ It was not the best movie/movies but I liked them."
"__MOVIES__ Fine, but admit Sam had made all this emotional progress (show) then reverted backwards in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I do see your point. I think they were reaching for storylines."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, then they should have left well enough alone."
"__MOVIES__ You think they should have never even made the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I disliked those films that much."
"__MOVIES__ The second was a little better than the first at least."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but it still stank."
