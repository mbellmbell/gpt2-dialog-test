"__STAR_WARS__ So I've seen some videos on youtube that talked about return of Anakin Skywalker in the Last Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ That doesn't make sense. Darth vader died."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he turned into a Force Ghost, remeber?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait, oh yeah, you're right."
"__STAR_WARS__ So Anakin shows up as Force Ghost in training of Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that could be kind cool to see."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. They even changed the end of the the return of Jedi to include footage of the new Anakin Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah I remember that. See, modenizing the old series is possible."
"__STAR_WARS__ not really. That was jkust right at the end of the movie, remaking was pretty simple."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know what still doesn't make sense? Anakin's age doesn't match the Darth Vader's when he dies in the original series."
