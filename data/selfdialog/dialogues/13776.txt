"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Celtics and Wizards last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, what a game.  Cant believe that the Wizards one."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, That was a hell of a shot by John Wall"
"__BASKETBALL__ He has had an awesome season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think the Wizards can beat the Celtics at home in game six."
"__BASKETBALL__ They have a chance, but it's going to be hard."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, the Celtics are strong at home"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Wizards are going to have to play great defense to have a chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think however wins has a chance against Cleveland"
"__BASKETBALL__ To be honest, not really.  Cleveland is just to good"
"__BASKETBALL__ As long as they have Lebron, I don't think anyone in the east can beat them."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, Lebron is just to damn good.  He is amazing."
"__BASKETBALL__ He should be slowing down in the next 2-3 year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, then maybe the other teams will have a chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think that Cleveland can beat Golden State"
"__BASKETBALL__ I do, but it's going to be hard."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, it should be a hell of a series."
"__BASKETBALL__ With Durant, Curry, Thompson, and Green, i'm not sure anyone can beat them in a 7 game series."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, it's like they have their own all star team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, it should be fun to watch no matter who wins."
