"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is best player in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is hard, there are a lot of good players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How would you narrow it down?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say, who is the best quarterback in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. Who is the best quarterback in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because he has won five Super Bowls as quarterback of the New England Patriots and he is a fierce competitor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Five Super Bowl wins?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  And not only that, he was voted MVP in four of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. That is incredible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, especially when you consider he won his first Super Bowl in 2002 and the last one in 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? That is fifteen years apart!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right.  Tom Brady will be forty years old this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And he's still playing football in the NFL? That's truly remarkable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really is. And with few signs of slowing down. I mean many think the last quarter of football he played this year was his best ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? What happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Unbelievable fourth quarter comeback to beat Atlanta in the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like he might not only be the best player now but also the greatest of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not everyone wants to admit it, but yeah, I would have to say that its probably true."
