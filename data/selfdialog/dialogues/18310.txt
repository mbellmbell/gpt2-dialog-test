"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I want to. Did you know Robin Wright plays a general in it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I did not know that! She was in Princess Bride, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! She looks very strong in the trailers."
"__MOVIES__ All of the Amazons were athletes, I heard. It makes a difference!"
"__MOVIES__ What kind of difference?"
"__MOVIES__ When they train and fight, it feels real. Not like models posing."
"__MOVIES__ How was Gal Godot's fighting?"
"__MOVIES__ It was great! There is an amazing scene where she begins a fight alone."
"__MOVIES__ Do not spoil it! What about Chris Pine's character?"
"__MOVIES__ He is really cool."
"__MOVIES__ I was worried he might be kind of a jerk because Diana is a female soldier."
"__MOVIES__ No, he isn't. They make a good team and they challenge each other."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a relief."
"__MOVIES__ Also, I think you will like one of the villains."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ She is creepy and has a really cool character design."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like someone I would cosplay."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait for Halloween costumes based on this movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I will watch it and let you know what I think."
