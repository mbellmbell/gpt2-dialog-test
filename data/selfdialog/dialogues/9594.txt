"__COMEDY__ Have you seen 'Shaun of the Dead'?"
"__COMEDY__ The English comedy horror movie? Yeah, that film is so great."
"__COMEDY__ Such a weird genre but that movie really pulled it off."
"__COMEDY__ So funny and the special effects on the zombies are actually really good!"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah. I love Edgar Wright's movies."
"__COMEDY__ What else has he done?"
"__COMEDY__ 'Hot Fuzz' which has the same actors and is possible even funnier than 'Shaun of the Dead'."
"__COMEDY__ I've never heard of that one, sounds good though."
"__COMEDY__ He directed 'Scott Pilgrim', too. That's a hilarious movie."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, I love that movie. I watch it every couple of months."
