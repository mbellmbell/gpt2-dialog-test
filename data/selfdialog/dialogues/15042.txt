"__ACTION__ What did you think of the remake of the movie 'Point Break'?"
"__ACTION__ I wasn't happy at first, just because I think Hollywood needs to chill out with remaking great old movies, but after watching the remake I thought it was pretty good."
"__ACTION__ I couldn't agree more. I can't picture Point Break without Keanu Reeves acting at Johnny Utah but the remake followed the orginal storyline pretty well."
"__ACTION__ The remake had just as much or even more action scenes then the orginial one that was released in 1991."
"__ACTION__ Can't believe the first one was released in 1991! It's still a classic movie and one of my favorites."
"__ACTION__ Kathryn Bigelow did a fanstatic job directing the orginial Point Break, as an audience member, the film really throws you into Johnny Utah's extreme life."
"__ACTION__ Speaking of extreme, how bout that skydiving scene in the first movie? I love that scene."
"__ACTION__ When Johnny Utah jumps out the airplane with no parachute to catch Bodhi? Yeah man, I doubt that would be possible in real life but it sure looked good on the big screen."
"__ACTION__ Sometimes I wish I lived a life like Johnny Utah."
"__ACTION__ I dressed up as one of the dead presidents for halloween a few years ago."
