"__MOVIES__ I hated Pulp Fiction."
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ Because it kept jumping around from the future to the past, it was confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I admit it's edited unusually. But that's part of what makes it great: you see bits that haven't happened yet, and you can't put their significance together until later."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like how these two weirdly dressed guys are eating at a Denny's, and a couple tries to rob the place?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, exactly. Only later do you know they're hit-men who got bloody and had to changed their clothes."
"__MOVIES__ And what's the deal with the boxer?"
"__MOVIES__ He has an agreement to throw a fight so this gangster guy can profit on the bets. But then he changes his mind and has to go on the run."
"__MOVIES__ And then comes the guy with the ball in his mouth."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. This guy is trying to kill him, and they get into the weirdest, freakiest situation and have to help each other."
"__MOVIES__ And then the guy says he won't kill him if they just never tell what happened."
"__MOVIES__ But you already know the hit man went to the boxer's house, and because he was stupid the boxer ends up killing him."
"__MOVIES__ Right. And then you see the hot girl overdose because she snorted something without knowing what it was, and it's this gross overdose scene."
"__MOVIES__ And the hit man is the one who saves her."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Even though we know he dies, trying to carry out a hit that got cancelled anyway."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I never put the individual stories together really."
"__MOVIES__ You should watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ I just might do that."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me, you'll like it so much better."
"__MOVIES__ Want to watch it with me?"
