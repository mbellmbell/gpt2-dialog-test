"__MOVIES__ I'm excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I like that Marvel supposedly kept this movie light and fun like the first."
"__MOVIES__ Marvel has a bad habit of making movies darker as a serial progresses."
"__MOVIES__ I know. The Captain America movies have gotten a little too serious."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and the last Ironman movie was no fun at all."
"__MOVIES__ It isn't just Marvel that has a tendency to make movies more grim as the series progresses."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was amazing how different the movie Kill Bill 1 was from Kill Bill 2."
"__MOVIES__ Frankly, I think they've ruined the Batman franchise by making the movies so dark and brooding."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, during the last few Batman movies, all I could think about is how Batman growls his words constantly."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that the Lego Movie made fun of that."
"__MOVIES__ The Superman movies have pretty much ruined that franchise also."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, once you've had Superman save the world, then how can you up the stakes in the next movie. It gets ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ I really haven't liked any of the Superman movies, because Superman is always so perfect that he's boring. He's so powerful that the villain is never any real threat."
"__MOVIES__ I have to admit that I liked the Batman movie that starred George Clooney, because it was just so silly."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that it featured so many big stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura."
"__MOVIES__ Jesse Ventura is so entertaining. I loved him in Predator."
"__MOVIES__ The two Predator verses the Alien movies were absolutely awful."
"__MOVIES__ I hated that they weren't very good because it sounded like a good idea to have those two beings face off in a movie."
"__MOVIES__ It would've been a lot better if Jesse Ventura was in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Rocket Racoon and Groot, too."
