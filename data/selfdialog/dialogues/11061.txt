"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, are you still a really big NFL fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it is pretty much the only sport that I follow very closely these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought so. Me and a friend was having a debate at work the other day and I thought about you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was the debate about exactly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We were debating who the best NFL team of all time was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is debate that I am sure has taken place millions of times in offices all over the country."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love talking about the NFL whenever there is down time at work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who did you say the best team ever was?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I strongly believe that the 2007 New England Patriot were the best team ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious about that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I am serious! They got all the way to 18-0 and had Tom Brady and Randy Moss together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, however, they did not win the Superbowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand that; but you can not let that undermine what a wonderful season that they had."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did have a great year, but you can not put them in front of any other team that won the Superbowl in my opinion!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will have to agree to disagree on this one!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who did your friend have as the best team ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He said it was the 1972 Miami Dolphins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure if I agree with that one either, but he is way closer than you are!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! Who would you say is the best team ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I would have to go with the 1985 Chicago Bears."
