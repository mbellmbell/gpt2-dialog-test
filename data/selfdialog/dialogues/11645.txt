"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's the other player that won 5 superbowls?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Charles Haley"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't even klnow who that is"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a linebacker and defensive end. Played for the 49ers and the cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh. And he won superbowl with 2 different teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yep, twice with the 49ers, and 3 times with the cowboys"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i wonder how common that is? Winning the superbowl playing for multipl,e teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not common. Peyton Manning is the very first QB to win the superbowl playing for two different teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That kinda makes sense, the reason for trade is because your performance goes down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. There have been other QBs who went to the superbowl playing for more than one team, however."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kurt Warner and Craig Morton. Morton didn't win any, while Warner won 1."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should keep track of all the players who do that, not just QBs. Like in a database."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That database would be cool to have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My point exactly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ WEll at least we have the info for the QBs, and that's better than nothing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady went to the superbowl 7 times!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And won 5."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he went to the superbowl more than anyone. and won the superbowl more than anyone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, but he also lost 2, so his percentage of winning the superbowl isn't as high as Bradshaw or Montana who both went to the superbowl 4 times and won all 4."
