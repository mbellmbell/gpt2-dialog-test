"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know Star Wars has a lot of Japanese influences in it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean the name Obi Wan Kenobi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I mean how George Lucas was in love with films by director Akira Kurosawa, and seemed to outright copy parts of his films for Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I didn't know that. I thought he had just made it all up himself."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not only scenes and ideas, but also costumes that mimicked Japanese clothing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, so the credit for the ideas goes to a lot of other people."
"__STAR_WARS__ There was one film people thought Star Wars copied, but it was the opposite- they had seen Star Wars and been influence by it, but their film came out first, making everyone think the opposite."
"__STAR_WARS__ A lot of art- movies, music, painting, seems to have been influenced by things before it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars was also influenced by Japanese anime and manga, but in turn also later influenced them."
"__STAR_WARS__ So we have the Japanese to thank for Star Wars, huh? I bet a lot of people don't know that."
