"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the rookies in the NFL last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that they didn't perform very well"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, off the top of my head I can only remember Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I really don't remember anyone else"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did Carson Wentz start playing last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually I think you are right"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he did alright with the Eagles"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's surprising too because he came from a small university"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess there's talent everywhere you look if you look hard enough"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet a team wishes they get good rookies for the new year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's really important to have refreshing talent on your team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They can go very far with good rookies"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They can also bargain their rookies with other veteren players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rookies often don't last too long in the year though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think your right, a startling number of them are injured and out of the league early"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but the minimum salary I believe is around 400k/year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is still a lot of money but the best players get paid so much more"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they probably should"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the disparity is so large, it should be a little closer together"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That may happen in the nearby future"
