"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you want to go with me to the Outlaw Festival July 16th?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. Who is playing there?"
"__MUSIC__ It's Willie Nelson's festival but there are a few others playing as well."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know who else is going to be there?"
"__MUSIC__ I think its Sheryl Crow, My Morning Jacket and one other band."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if I really like Sheryl Crow and I don't know much about My Morning Jacket."
"__MUSIC__ Some of her songs were overplayed like 'Soak Up the Sun' and 'All I Wanna Do' but I like the song 'My Favorite Mistake'."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, none of those songs are really my style, but I can say she looks great for 55."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, My Morning Jacket isn't really country as far as I know. I would recommend the song, 'Off the Record'."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I will look into it. Did you remember the fourth band yet?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was Margo Price. The line up changes every date."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that the Avett Brothers and Jason Isbell were going to be on this tour."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they are on different dates but for some reason our date only has like 4 bands total."
"__MUSIC__ So is it really worth paying full price when half the line up is missing?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there is a Groupon so we can get tickets to the show for $20."
"__MUSIC__ Why didn't you start out by saying that? I'll go if its only $20."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, so you want me to buy your ticket for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Just send me the link for tickets and I'll buy my own."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. Can you think of anyone else that would be interested in seeing Willie Nelson."
"__MUSIC__ My brother is a big Willie Nelson fan but I think he might have already bought tickets at full price."
