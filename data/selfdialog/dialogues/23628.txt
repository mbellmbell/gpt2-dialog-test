"__DISNEY__ Zootopia is still my favorite Disney film."
"__DISNEY__ I thought that was a great movie too!"
"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the Behind the Scenes of it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't."
"__DISNEY__ Well, the original story of the movie was supposed to be much darker. There were government regulated collars for predators so they are oppressed from their natural instincts."
"__DISNEY__ Oh wow... That sounds really interesting. I wonder why they changed it."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not too sure but it was definately a late change. They scrapped it after finishing 2/3 of production!"
"__DISNEY__ Woah! That is crazy!"
"__DISNEY__ Honestly, I'd like them to bring the idea back."
"__DISNEY__ Same! Maybe they were struggling with how to make the setting work with the characters, but I know Disney can do it."
