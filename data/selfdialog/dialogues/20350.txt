"__MOVIES__ I wish I could watch 'I Am Legend' in the theater again."
"__MOVIES__ Why, it wasn't that great."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see it in the movie theater?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I rented it online."
"__MOVIES__ It's different when you see it on the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Because you get more in to it, it's more 'believable' and you forget where you are...so it's way more intense than on tv."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't that great to be able to do that."
"__MOVIES__ You would actually be surprised because Will Smith actually did a pretty good job in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ You think so?"
"__MOVIES__ When you were actually watching the movie, did you think 'This is Will Smith acting like he's walking down this road looking for mutants'?"
"__MOVIES__ No."
"__MOVIES__ See, that shows that he did a good job because you forgot it was Will Smith."
"__MOVIES__ Not entirely I didn't."
"__MOVIES__ But you didn't think 'Will Smith' the entire time, you thought about what was happening and how he could die, right?"
"__MOVIES__ That's true."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, what you saw on tv, imagine that on a huge screen right in front of you, and you're in a dark room, the sound is loud and drowning out everything else."
"__MOVIES__ So that you're fully emerged, I see what you're saying."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and the intensity at the end had my friend and I sit there in shock for about 10 minutes after the movie was over."
"__MOVIES__ So let's find out how we can see it on the big screen, I'm down for that."
