"__COMEDY__ Hey, so what's your favorite Jim Carey movie?"
"__COMEDY__ Hmm, I don't know. Probably The Mask?"
"__COMEDY__ The Mask? Not Ace Ventura Pet Detective?"
"__COMEDY__ I mean, is Jim Carey even making movies anymore? Why not ask about Steve Carrell?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, at least I didn't say Adam Sandler."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, I would have nothing to say to that!"
"__COMEDY__ So what's your favorite Steven Carell movie?"
"__COMEDY__ Oddly enough, probably Bruce Almighty, which was Carell's breakout hit - AND, it was a Jim Carey movie."
"__COMEDY__ Me too, but really I liked him best in The Office."
"__COMEDY__ Oh dude, for sure. Show wasn't the same when he left..."
