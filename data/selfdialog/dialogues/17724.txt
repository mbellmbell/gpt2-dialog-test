"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the remake of dirty dancing?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was okay"
"__MOVIES__ I agree, the original was way better"
"__MOVIES__ Why do they feel the need to mess with a classic?"
"__MOVIES__ I dont know why they do that."
"__MOVIES__ I fell like who they chose to play baby was all wrong"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, dirty dancing is a sexual movie, and the baby they chose looks fifteen."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I thought the whole movie, I hate when they pick the wrong actress"
"__MOVIES__ Me too, it pretty much messes up the whole movie"
"__MOVIES__ Just like twilight"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, those movies were horrible because of the actress that played bella"
"__MOVIES__ Shes not an actress, actresses express emotion"
"__MOVIES__ I dont know how she got the job"
"__MOVIES__ Me either"
"__MOVIES__ I was so excited to see twilight, and it was like watching a low budget film"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't watch any of the others after that"
"__MOVIES__ I did, They didn't get any better"
"__MOVIES__ I can imagine"
"__MOVIES__ The casting directors need to get better at this"
"__MOVIES__ I know"
