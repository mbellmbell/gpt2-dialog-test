"__MUSIC__ I've got to be careful when I get my hands on an equalizer."
"__MUSIC__ An 'equalizer'? What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's like a long treble and bass control, usually with about ten to twenty dials or levers for adjusting the sound."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I've got that on my Mixcraft software. It'll drive you nuts playing with the sound like that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm just AWFUL at it. Every time I try to improve the music I'm listening to, I mess it up."
"__MUSIC__ What exactly are you doing wrong?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, when I was trying to make a mixtape for the car years ago, for some reason I turned down most of the mid-range."
"__MUSIC__ Sounded really flat, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Worse than that. Most of the vocals are in the mid-range."
"__MUSIC__ Sounded like they were singing in a big hollow box I bet."
"__MUSIC__ Right. And when I tried to adjust 'Norwegian Wood' by the Beatles ... oh, my gosh it was bad."
"__MUSIC__ What were you trying to adjust in the song? I know I'd like to remove some of the lyrics, but that's just me."
"__MUSIC__ I was trying to bring out the Sitar, one of my favorite instruments. I'm not sure exactly what I did."
"__MUSIC__ How'd it sound after you got through with it?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Norwegian Wood' ended up sounding like 'Bavarian Cukoo Clocks', just awful. Just a droning wall of acoustic guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Now I'd really like to hear these versions that you did. Might be a fun hobby."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, I think I did an excellent job on 'Land Of 1000 Dances'."
"__MUSIC__ Which version? There's probably a dozen of them."
"__MUSIC__ The 1965 Cannibal and the Headhunters version. The one with the 'na, na-na-na-naa, na na na naaa' hook."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I had that on cassette in the car! It got eaten up. That's why I'm 100 percent digital nowadays."
