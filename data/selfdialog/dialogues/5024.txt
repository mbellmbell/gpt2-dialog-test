"__FAST_FURIOUS__ So, what do you think of the new furious movie, the Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I watched it in the theaters the other day and it is by far one of my favorites!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Mine as well. My friends and I watched it just the other day. I can never get enough of Dom and Hobbs."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh! And I can't believe they brought Deckard back."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Lord, I could never imagine that he could be portrayed as a good guy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He actually saved Dom's son. The interaction with him and the baby was hilarious."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The Fate of the Furious was not only great action, but great comedy as well."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ All around balanced. I do hope they make more movies in the Furious Franchise, I love to see more of Dom, Letty and Hobbs and maybe more of Deckard as well."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ i'm sure there will be more to come. They do have a new story to tell after all. Dom's son."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ cheers!"
