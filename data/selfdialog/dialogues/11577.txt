"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, now I'm all hyped up for the season. i can't wait until September, It's still 2 months away..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ August 10 is the preseason. So we only have one more month left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Preseason games kinda suck"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well,l they're not really games as much as a show case"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Show case for what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For the new recruits. They show off what they can do how they fit with the teamm etc."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Honestly, we don't need that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um. Yes we do. It helps us to prepare for the games. See how much improvements new people bring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't really play seriously."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because they're interested in showcasing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems silly to me. Anyway, I wonder who will be the most improved team this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People say Titans, but will see. I love Mariota so seeing him get one of the best WR is a good thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hink Patriots will improve and be even more dominant"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They got revamped on WR, RB, TE and DE positions. Their depth is amazing"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh. maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Ravens will improve a lot this year too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How's that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ravens D is gonna be even more dominant now this year with all the new players they picked up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh, guess we'll see. I kinda also liked Texans. Deshaun Watson. Enough said."
