"__MUSIC__ 'My name is Alexander Hamilton ..... there's a million things I haven't done.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yo! Are you a Hamilton fan!?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm a fan of the soundtrack. Unfortunately I don't have the money to see it on Broadway."
"__MUSIC__ Oh me neither. But I've listened to the soundtrack so many times!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you have a favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! The Story of Tonight, the reprise specifically is such a good song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I like that one, but it's kind of short? Why is it your favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I guess there's just this part that sounds really good. 'Well I've heard, you got a special someone on the side Burr.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I like that too, Anthony Ramos has some unbelievable vocals."
"__MUSIC__ Well what's your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I think my favorite songs is one off of the mixtape."
"__MUSIC__ I love the Hamilton Mixtape! Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Cabinet Battle 3. Maybe because I liked Hail Mary by Tupac so much."
"__MUSIC__ What's that got to do with anything?"
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding me? 'Plantation states are packed with promise makers,' those are nearly the exact words from Hail Mary."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, sorry. I've honestly never listened to Tupac. Do any of the other songs borrow from traditional Hip Hop?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I've heard that growl in helpless was based off Ja Rule's singing voice."
"__MUSIC__ I know the one, 'as long as I'm alive Eliza swear to God you'll never feel --'"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly the one, and I'm sure there's a thousand more we could go through."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we could talk about it over coffee."
