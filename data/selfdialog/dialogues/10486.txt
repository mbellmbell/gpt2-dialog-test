"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I like songs with dances. I wish more songs in rap and hip-hop had dances to go with them."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You mean like the macarena??"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes! Just like that, but in rap"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Remember that song by Fat Joe and Remy Ma called 'Lean Back'? That had a fun little dance."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah even my mom was doing that dance that year!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ My mom is cooler than your mom. My mom was doing the Superman from Soulja Boy's song 'Crank That'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That song was a lot of fun! What ever happened to Soulja Boy?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess he was a one hit wonder, because that was the first and last I'd ever heard of him"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Actually had another song I liked although I don't remember the name. They lyrics went 'Jumped out of bed, turned my swag on'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh yea! The name of the song was actually simply 'Turn my Swag on'"
