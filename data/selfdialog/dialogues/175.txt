"__MUSIC__ I need some new music to listen to while I run."
"__MUSIC__ What sorts of things do you usually listen to while running?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like to feel excited, but predictable melodies are always good. Like the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, okay. That's different from what I expected."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think I'd listen to."
"__MUSIC__ When you said you wanted to feel excited, I thought it'd be, like, high-tempo EDM."
"__MUSIC__ No, sometimes I might listen to Ke$ha, or that sort of thing too."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like you listen to a lot of things while you run."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I do! But I'm bored of everything now."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what if you tried Lord Huron? It's a little downtempo though."
"__MUSIC__ Lord Huron?"
"__MUSIC__ They're an alt-rock band. But I like to run to their music sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ The sound feels very natural, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Maybe I should try it. Any song recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite is The Frozen Pines, but maybe for you, the first album would be better."
"__MUSIC__ It would?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there's a song called Ends of the Earth that pretty much everyone likes."
"__MUSIC__ I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the recommendation!"
"__MUSIC__ Any time!"
