"__POP__ Where do you fall on the Britney vs Christina debate?"
"__POP__ I think Christina has the better voice, so her."
"__POP__ I agree, but Britney has the better songs."
"__POP__ Well I just think that Britney has a better production team."
"__POP__ All is fair in love and pop!"
"__POP__ But Christina has the chops to do more outside of pop music."
"__POP__ Do you think she will?"
"__POP__ I don't know, but I hope she does a jazz record. Or classical pop."
"__POP__ That would be a total surprise, I think."
"__POP__ Lady GaGa did it. Maybe Christina will too!"
