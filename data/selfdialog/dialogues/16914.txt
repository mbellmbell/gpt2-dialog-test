"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I am a huge fan of Rocket."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, he is probably my favorite character."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It was amazing, the effects were quite a visual treat."
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't imagine how much work it would be to create those stunning visual effects."
"__MOVIES__ On top of creating them they have to render, the amount of computer power required to render that much cgi is mind boggling."
"__MOVIES__ Right? I wonder how many server farms it took to render all of that movie."
"__MOVIES__ The art style from the Marvel movies is really nice, I am a fan of how consistent it is through out all of the different movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, despite some Marvel movies being substantially different characters and planets it still feels like its all part of one universe."
"__MOVIES__ What about Star Wars?"
"__MOVIES__ What about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think they went overboard with the cgi in Force Awakens?"
"__MOVIES__ I kind of do, I think it was more of an issue with what they did with the cgi rather than the amount of it."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I think they have unlimited potential when working in computer created worlds yet the scenes felt very small and limited."
"__MOVIES__ Can you give me an example?"
"__MOVIES__ For starters, the space scenes only featured a hand full of craft in each battle."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I kind of noticed that too."
"__MOVIES__ The scale of the various computerized scenes just did not feel as grand as the prequels for example despite them being almost 20 years older."
