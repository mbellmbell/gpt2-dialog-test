"__MUSIC__ I really love Beyoncé. She's one of my favorite artists."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! Her last album was really good."
"__MUSIC__ Lemonade?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the one that came out in 2016."
"__MUSIC__ I love Lemonade. I listen to it all the time."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite song from the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a hard question. Depends on my mood, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ 'Formation' is an awesome song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love that one!"
"__MUSIC__ Another great song is 'Sorry'."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. 'Sorry' and 'Formation' are both great empowerment songs."
"__MUSIC__ 'Freedom' is really empowering, too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, for sure. I love Kendrick Lamar's part on that one!"
"__MUSIC__ I also like some of the slower songs."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Honestly, if I had to name one favorite song off Lemonade, it would probably be 'All Night'."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a beautiful song. Another one that's really pretty is 'Sandcastles'."
"__MUSIC__ I love that one. It's kind of melancholy, but in a good way."
"__MUSIC__ That's why I like it so much. It's really vulnerable, which is a side of Beyoncé you don't get to see that often."
"__MUSIC__ True. I hope she does more songs like that on future albums."
"__MUSIC__ Me too."
