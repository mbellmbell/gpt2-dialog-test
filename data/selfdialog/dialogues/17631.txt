"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Johnny Depp movie?"
"__MOVIES__ He's been in a lot of great movies, but I'd probably have to go with Edward Scissorhands."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Edward Scissorhands is definitely one of his most iconic roles. It's so hard to choose a favorite though!"
"__MOVIES__ He has quite a body of work behind him. I like a lot of the movies he's done with Tim Burton."
"__MOVIES__ Those two make a pretty great team. Sweeney Todd is another favorite of mine."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not usually much for musicals, but I've got to say that was one of the better ones that I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ I never knew that Johnny Depp can sing like that!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, is there anything that guy can't do? I didn't care much for his interpretation of Willy Wonka though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me either, I don't think that they should have touched that movie, Gene Wilder is the definitive Willy Wonka in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. I could have done without those Alice in Wonderland movies that Burton made too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, again, there are some movies that are just untouchable in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I wonder how the new Pirates of the Caribbean will be."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of stopped watching after the first two, but maybe I'll check it out, though I'm figuring it's kind of going to be more of the same."
"__MOVIES__ Probably so. Have you seen him in Crybaby?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I love that movie, it's so offbeat!"
"__MOVIES__ It's definitely a cult classic."
"__MOVIES__ Johnny's definitely got a lot more eccentric in his later years, but I'm always interested to see what his upcoming projects are, though he's definitely had his fair share of misses as of late."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like that Lone Ranger movie, that was just a bad idea all around."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree, I'm not sure what the filmmakers were thinking on that one."
"__MOVIES__ I guess they can't all be winners!"
