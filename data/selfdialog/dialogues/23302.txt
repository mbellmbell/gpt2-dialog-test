"__DISNEY__ Have you ever noticed in Disney films at least one parent is dead."
"__DISNEY__ Not in all of them."
"__DISNEY__ Which ones have both parents."
"__DISNEY__ Mulan, Sleeping Beauty and Tangled, to start."
"__DISNEY__ But in Tangled she was not raised by her parents, just the evil witch lady."
"__DISNEY__ But, they were still alive and she met them later."
"__DISNEY__ That is the same plot, sort of, with Sleeping Beauty?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, her parents did not get to raise her."
"__DISNEY__ Who did?"
"__DISNEY__ The fairies, to keep her safe from touching the spindle."
