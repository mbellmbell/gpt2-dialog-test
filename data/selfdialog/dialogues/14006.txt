"__BASKETBALL__ Hey there, are you watching the NBA playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes I am! I have to watch every game"
"__BASKETBALL__ What do you think of how it went so far?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's been so one sided and unfair"
"__BASKETBALL__ Ya, both teams are going to sweep their way into the finals"
"__BASKETBALL__ Everyone knew Cleveland would win though"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, Boston has no chance. And now Isaiah Thomas is injured, Cleveland has it in the bag"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea. But the Warriors look like they will sweep too"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, after Zaza's dirty play, I think the Spurs have no chance"
"__BASKETBALL__ They don't have Kawhi or Parker. They won't be doing anything this year unfortunately"
"__BASKETBALL__ So it looks like we will have 2 teams sweep their way into the finals"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, it'll be a Golden State versus Cleveland finals, yet again"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, we knew that all season long"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, in the playoffs, some of the first 2 round games were exciteding"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe just the Wizards and Celtics and the Rockets and Thunder were the ones that were entertaining"
"__BASKETBALL__ I really wish the Rockets or Thunder made it further though. The Western Conference is stacked"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea that would have been nice"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, who do you have winning it all now?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Cleveland of course, yet again"
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. Lebron is at his prime"
