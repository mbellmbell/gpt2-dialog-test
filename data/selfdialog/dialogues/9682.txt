"__COMEDY__ Did you see The Hangover? It was one of my all-time favorite movies!"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, I loved that movie so much! My favorite character was Zach Galifianakis."
"__COMEDY__ Me too. He made the movie so much better how he always acts so innocent and unaware."
"__COMEDY__ Remember that part when he put drugs in their drinks and didn't tell them?"
"__COMEDY__ How could I forget! That's how all the action started! What about the part when they go to Mike Tyson's house?"
"__COMEDY__ And they stole his tiger! That was classic comedy."
"__COMEDY__ Bradley Cooper played a great lead character in this movie."
"__COMEDY__ Did you see him in The Hangover Part 2?"
"__COMEDY__ Of course. It was just as funny as the first one."
"__COMEDY__ I liked when Ed Helms got the tattoos on his face that Mike Tyson has!"
