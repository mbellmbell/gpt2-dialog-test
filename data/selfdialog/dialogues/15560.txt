"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just finished watching Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh wow! Isn't it great? What did you think?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it's interesting how much darker all of the movies keep getting as they progress through the series."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Same. I get so sad whenever I watch that movie and Sirius dies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know. It's so sad to see Harry losing the only real family member he's ever known."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's true. The only good thing is that he has so many people who care about him that he'll always have a surrogate family in a sense."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just have a feeling that the rest of the movie are going to get so dark that he'll probably keep losing people he loves."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I'm not sure. What was your favorite part of the whole movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I liked the scene when they're in the Ministry of Magic and they're trying to save the Prophecy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also like when Professor Trelawney gives them divination readings. Everyone thinks she's crazy, but she actually knows what she's talking about."
