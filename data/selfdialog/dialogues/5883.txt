"__STAR_WARS__ What in the world was that thing that Obi-Wan sliced his arm off in the bar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You need to study up on your details dude. You really don't know?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No man I don't. It looked like some big walrus or something, really ugly."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was Ponda Baba. He's an Aqualish and a smuggler."
"__STAR_WARS__ Just like Han huh? What does he smuggle?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know.....spices or something I think. He and the other dude worked for Jabba."
"__STAR_WARS__ Man, Jabba had a real criminal empire going didn't he?"
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure, he was the Al Capone of Tatooine"
"__STAR_WARS__ Tatooine is one rough place. Either the sand people or one of the Hutts is going to get at you."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah man, it's kind of like the country of Australia. Every living thing that's not human is deadly."
