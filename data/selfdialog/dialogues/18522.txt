"__MOVIES__ Did you see The Revenant?"
"__MOVIES__ Well not yet, I just know that it is a great movie. Who was the director?"
"__MOVIES__ The Mexican Alejandro G. Iñarritu, he did a great job, and finally Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Oscar. I think he is an awesome actor. What do you think about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he is, he has had great performances, I think he deserves it and even he should have won it before. Most people agree it is a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is, I agree with them, I have read many reviews and what people say is that this movie is impressive, full of visual effects, beautiful photography and a good story."
"__MOVIES__ Where was this movie filmed? There was any USA location?"
"__MOVIES__ It was filmed in Canada, USA and Argentina. I remember Calgary, Montana and Tierra de Fuego in Argentina."
"__MOVIES__ Argentina, really? why to go there if they were here in North America?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, what I know is that there was not enough amount of snow as they needed at some locations and they had to go there or something like that."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, impressive. can you imagine what implies to have to move a production team from North america to the southernmost country in south America?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is crazy, Iñarritu said he will never again make another movie like this, he said: “I am a crazy man, but not stupid”."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I agree. How many Oscars did this movie win?"
"__MOVIES__ It got three: best director, best actor and best cinematography. It didn't win the Oscar for best picture, amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I thought the winner would be La La Land but it was Moonlight, Have you seen it? I have not seen it yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I have not seen it either, but I want to. I like coming-of-age drama films, do you like them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I like them too. Do you think Forrest Gump is one of those movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I am not sure, He jumps from Kid to Adult and those movies are characterized for the growth of a protagonist from youth to adulthood. I am not sure."
"__MOVIES__ That is a good point, but no matter what, Forrest Gum is one of my favorite movies ever."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, you are right, that is one of my favorites too. Would you like to go to the movies next week"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, just let me know when. It will be nice."
