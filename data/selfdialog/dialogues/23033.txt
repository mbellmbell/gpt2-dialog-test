"__DISNEY__ Which villain do you like more-Maleficent or Ja'Far?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm that is a hard one."
"__DISNEY__ I know because they both are so devious and ruthless."
"__DISNEY__ Maleficent is evil incarnate but as a fairie as were Ja'Far is evil as a Genie or Jin."
"__DISNEY__ I think that Maleficent is more protective of what she believes to be hers..."
"__DISNEY__ But Ja'Far just wants pure raw power."
"__DISNEY__ I think Maleficent's powers are drawn from emotions of fear and jealousy."
"__DISNEY__ And Ja'Far draws his dark magic from anger and vengence."
"__DISNEY__ I like Maleficent more."
"__DISNEY__ I think I like Ja'Far more. What does that say about us?"
