"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really like The Deathly Hallows 1."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was pretty good with all of the different scenes when they were on the run. My favorite is The Goblet of Fire."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, that one is pretty good, too. Why is it your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like it because we get to see them as teenagers for the first time exploring their first love sort of thing. And I like the ballroom scene."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hermiony did look really pretty in her dress. It seems like she went for kind of a bad boy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She didn't seem to have much in common with him. He was all brawn and no brain. But looks count for something when you are exploring. Plus I think she was trying to get Ron to make a move by making him jealous."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ron did seem a little jealous about the two of them. He didn't really have a good time at the dance."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, he didn't. But that was his own fault. He wouldn't dance so his date found someone else."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ha, Ha. Yes she did. I had forgotten about that."
