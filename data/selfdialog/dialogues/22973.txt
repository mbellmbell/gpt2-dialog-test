"__DISNEY__ Do you remember The Sword and the Stone?"
"__DISNEY__ I remember seeing it when I was young."
"__DISNEY__ Did you realize how old it was?"
"__DISNEY__ I was figuring it was from the 70s.  Is that right?"
"__DISNEY__ It was released in the early 60s!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that must have been why my mom liked watching it with me."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, she probably watched it when she was a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Probably so, and they didn't have VCRs so I bet she hadn't seen it in years."
"__DISNEY__ Probably not.  And then with VCRs we were watching things from the 60s."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and even earlier."
