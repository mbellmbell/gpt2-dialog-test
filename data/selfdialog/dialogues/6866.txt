"__STAR_WARS__ Have you heard of Ewoks?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not that I can recall, what are they?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're these short, hairy woodland creatures from the movie Star Wars Episode VI."
"__STAR_WARS__ I haven't seen that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ You should, I think you'd really like the forest moon of Endor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is that where the Ewoks live?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it is.  But it's also a place where the Empire has built a base."
"__STAR_WARS__ That sounds dangerous."
"__STAR_WARS__ It turns out to be quite an adventure and the Ewoks help to win the battle."
"__STAR_WARS__ That sounds fun, I think I'll go watch that movie now."
