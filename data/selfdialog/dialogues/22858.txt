"__DISNEY__ Our topic today is: If you could remake any animated Disney movie what would you suggest they take on next?"
"__DISNEY__ How many choices do we get?"
"__DISNEY__ We each get three. I'll go first: The Rescuers as I see it as being a surprising hit, The Black Cauldron will totally cash in on the whole fantasy genre Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit left open, and A Goofy Movie because Goofy really needs to make a comeback after all these years."
"__DISNEY__ Not sure how I feel about a live action Goofy movie but here's my choices: Toy Story because it seems to be one of the core 90s kids movies and has a lot of potential, Hunchback of Notre Dame would actually be the next surprise hit, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire for similar reasons as you choosing The Black Cauldron plus Atlantis hasn't gotten much love in modern society so it's something different."
"__DISNEY__ Oh Atlantis is a good choice! I forgot about that."
"__DISNEY__ My best friend exposed me to it and it's quickly become one of my favorites. I found the sequel to be extremely disappointing however."
"__DISNEY__ That's true about most sequels whether they're animated or not. I just hate it when any company feels the need to unnecessarily make a sequel or prequel just to cash in on a classic - it almost ruins the original every time."
"__DISNEY__ Think Empire Strikes Back is the exception to the rule."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't mind a sequel to A Nightmare Before Christmas if Tim Burton was in control though. Team him up with Neil Gaiman and I promise you it'll be the movie of the year."
"__DISNEY__ That would be a dream come true, but can you imagine a live action remake with Burton and Depp. Those two are a power couple when it comes to movies just look at the live action Alice In Wonderland Sweeney Todd."
