"__MUSIC__ What kind of music are you in to?"
"__MUSIC__ A little bit of this, a little bit of that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too I suppose!"
"__MUSIC__ Why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ There's a Glass Animals show in October of this year."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I've actually heard of them!"
"__MUSIC__ Are they something you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah definitely."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Would you want to go with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'd feel kind of weird cause I don't know many songs!"
"__MUSIC__ Don't worry about it! I think they're a fairly new band, so probably most people probably don't know many songs."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, then!"
"__MUSIC__ I think I'm gonna buy tickets tonight."
"__MUSIC__ Could you get one for me too? I'll listen to all their albums on replay tonight!"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good! Have you ever heard of Sylvan Esso?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, but I'm not positive. Why?"
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty similar in sound."
"__MUSIC__ Oh nice!"
"__MUSIC__ Sylvan Esso just recently came out with a new album too."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome. I have a lot of homework for tonight!"
