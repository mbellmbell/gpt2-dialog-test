"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga's music video for Telephone is a work of art."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. The costume design alone makes it fantastic."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Totally, and the nod toward Thelma and Louise towards the end of the video is great."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Beyonce and Lady Gaga make such a great duo."
"__LADY_GAGA__ They are both so talented."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, there's no doubt. Lady Gaga actually co-wrote the script for the Telephone music video."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wow, I had no idea. She's so creative."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She helps write a lot of her songs, too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think that that's so nice. It seems a lot of singers don't write their own songs these days."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I totally agree. I actually read somewhere that Lady Gaga wrote Telephone for Britney Spears."
