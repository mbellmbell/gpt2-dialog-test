"__ROCK__ So, let's talk some more rock music trivia."
"__ROCK__ Oh, you never get tired of this, do you?"
"__ROCK__ No, I just find there's so many neat little factoids out there, it's fun to talk about."
"__ROCK__ Okay, what do you got?"
"__ROCK__ Well, you know the song 'Sweet Home Alabama' by Lynard Skynard?"
"__ROCK__ Of course, everyone knows that one!"
"__ROCK__ Well, there's a part in the beginning where the guy says, 'Turn it up!'"
"__ROCK__ Okay, yeah, I remember that."
"__ROCK__ Well, that's actually the singer talking to the sound engineer to turn up the music, but they thought it sounded so cool they actually left it in the song."
"__ROCK__ Really?  That's pretty neat."
