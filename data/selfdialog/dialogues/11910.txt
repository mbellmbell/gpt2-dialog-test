"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do they call the American football a pigskin?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good question. It's not actually made of pig skin."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right? They're made of cow leather, aren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the professional NFL ones are, whereas amateurs use footballs made of synthetic materials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What synthetic materials are used?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most people use footballs made of vulcanized rubber."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that the same material used to make car tires?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, exactly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why is the term 'pigskin' so popular for the football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, back in the old days before the invention of vulcanized rubber, they used animal bladders to inflate the football. Pig bladders were common for this purpose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's kind of gross."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Things have changed a lot thanks to the wonders of modern technology."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Another odd thing about the American football is it's unusual shape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. No other sport has a ball shaped similar to it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think it is shaped that way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is believed that this shape was never really designed by anyone specifically, but gradually came to this shape over time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How is that possible?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The game originally had a round ball, like a soccer ball, but the shape usually ended up lopsided because it was difficult to inflate in those days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like it is meant to be long and pointy at the end so it will spiral through the air."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's basically true. In the 1930s, when the forward pass became prevalent, the ball became longer and smaller in diameter."
