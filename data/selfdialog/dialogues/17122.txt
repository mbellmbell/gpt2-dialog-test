"__MOVIES__ Did you get the DVD of Suicide Squad yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I bought it last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ And? What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a okay. I really didn't see what the hype was all about."
"__MOVIES__ What? You didn't like it?"
"__MOVIES__ What was there to like?"
"__MOVIES__ Villains becoming heroes who have to save the day."
"__MOVIES__ I guess sometimes it's good to be bad but.."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I meant. The bad guys had to save the day."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't let me finish.  I guess sometimes it's good to be bad but in Suicide Squad's case, bad is just plain bad."
"__MOVIES__ You just didn't like it, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ No. It gives villainy a bad name."
"__MOVIES__ How about how the villains had to bail  the government out of a mess they created?"
"__MOVIES__ I did find that a little ironic."
"__MOVIES__ Granted it was better than Bat Man vs Super Man."
"__MOVIES__ Not by much."
"__MOVIES__ The movie Suicide Squad  is something of a mess."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I liked it. It wasn't the best and it could have been better but it was alright to me."
"__MOVIES__ If it had a real plot that I could have followed, it might have been better to me."
"__MOVIES__ I guess."
