"__LADY_GAGA__ Alright, So here is a serious question. What do you think of Laday Gaga's music?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Her early work was weird as hell."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really? You think so?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Absolutely! Don't get me wrong some of her music was entertaining but a large portion was just odd."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah? What song stood out to you as weird?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think bad romance was pretty stange. The thing that bugged me about it was that everyone would constantly sing it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ So you didn't like the song at all?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, it's one of those annoying songs that are designed to get stuck in your head until you like it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's silly,"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah? Then why do so many people say they didn't like the song but it just grew on them?"
