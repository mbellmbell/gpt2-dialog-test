"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you prefer Biggie or Tupac?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I always think it's funny we feel like we have to pick. But that said - Tupac."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Me too. I just like his flow better."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He was more political in his lyrics than Biggie, too, which I always liked."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Me too, political rap is the best type."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They were both so talented though, and it feels stupid to 'pick' one."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's because of the East Coast/West Coast thing, I guess. We all get caught up iun the rivalry."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which is such a shame, since that's what killed him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And he was so young. Who knows what he could've done with more time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ In my opinion he's already the greatest rapper ever, and that's with such a small discography. It really is sad."
