"__MUSIC__ Here we go again. Rate your Top 5 favorite movie soundtracks. Ready?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm always ready. Crazy question. I have to think this through."
"__MUSIC__ You sure do. Only Top 5. I couldn't take giving you ten choices. You're terrible."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, you're right. Well I know 'Purple Rain' is number one. Prince made me fall in love with it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes he did. Rest in Peace Prince. That album was massive."
"__MUSIC__ From watching the movie, I was completely entranced. He was magic."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe he's gone. He was another genius."
"__MUSIC__ He played all the instruments that ever was. Incredible artist don't last long it seems."
"__MUSIC__ Well Prince lasted longer that lots of legends. He probably has so much unreleased music."
"__MUSIC__ I can imagine that. He was so particular. He was a perfectionist."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes he was. He poured over every aspect of his music."
"__MUSIC__ That could be hard to deal with, but you can't question his art. He was a master."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see him in concert? That's one of my biggest regrets."
"__MUSIC__ I am one of the fortunate ones to see him live. He of course was incredible."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome. When was that? Purple Rain days?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I was too young to see him then. I saw him in 1998 at Madison Square Garden."
"__MUSIC__ That must have been wicked. Did you go with anyone? Who was on the bill?"
"__MUSIC__ It was completely incredible. My best friend bought us tickets for my birthday. Chaka Khan and Larry Graham."
"__MUSIC__ That's crazy. Prince wrote 'I Feel For You'. She had a hit from that."
"__MUSIC__ Prince's influence is so huge. He's going to live on for centuries through his music."
