"__MOVIES__ Okay, so what's another example of one of your famous 'Good BAD films' that you like so much?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, definitely Samurai Cop."
"__MOVIES__ Samurai Cop?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was an action film made in the late 90s that was went straight to VHS but later gained a cult following on the Internet."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so, I assume Samurai Cop is about.. what, a samurai cop?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, except he's white, but he speaks 'fluent japanese' even though he can't seem to pronounce basic Japanese names later in the film?"
"__MOVIES__ Wait, what?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.. one of the characters is talking about him, 'Yeah, he's speaks fluent Japanese. He was taught by masters in Japan.'"
"__MOVIES__ The 'masters' in Japan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everybody knows who the masters are.  Try to keep up, okay?  :)"
"__MOVIES__ Hahaha."
"__MOVIES__ So, it's basically a really bad ripoff of a Lethal Weapon where Samurai Cop and this black dude and trying to take down this 'gang' of drug dealers and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Why did you put gang in quotes?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they're the most inept and poorly funded looking gang I've ever seen.  At one point the boss and his men are having dinner at this 'restaurant' and you can see a bunch of dirty windows in the background."
"__MOVIES__ Wow."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and that's just for starters.  In another scene, they're going after the gang's leader and he's got a big old Defender arcade game in his living room.  Clearly something a drug dealing gang overlord would have."
"__MOVIES__ Defender?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, keep forgetting how young you are... it's an old arcade game.  Used to play it a lot on the Atari when I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Gotcha."
"__MOVIES__ And that doesn't even scratch the surface of all the crazy stuff I could tell you about this movie..."
