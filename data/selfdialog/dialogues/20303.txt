"__MOVIES__ Do you remember 80's movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure do, back when movies were great."
"__MOVIES__ I was thinking about short circuit the other day."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man I loved short circuit, that robot was adorable!"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, did you know that the indian guy in short circuit was actually white?"
"__MOVIES__ No way! I had no idea. I was paying too much attention to how funny Steve Guttenburg was."
"__MOVIES__ Yea that guy was hilarious, I wonder what happened to him?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he made a lot of money back then, he's probably just retired."
"__MOVIES__ Yea that's true, he did all the Police Academy movies, after all."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, and Three Men and a Baby."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like he was in a lot of other ones, but I can't quite remember."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither. I do remember that movie Flight of the Navigator though."
"__MOVIES__ Yea that was another classic. I miss adventure movies like that."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I used to wish I was the kid in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I used to wish I was the kid from Never Ending Story."
"__MOVIES__ I did the same, I would wait for it to rain outside so that I could get an apple and read a book in our attic."
"__MOVIES__ They'll never make a movie like that again."
"__MOVIES__ No, today they'd be in side a virtual world killing zombies."
"__MOVIES__ I guess with technology comes different kinds of story telling."
"__MOVIES__ Yea movies have changed forever."
