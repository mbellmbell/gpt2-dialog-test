"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the Japanese band, Toe?"
"__MUSIC__ Toe?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a post-rock band. Or maybe a math rock band. I don't really understand the difference."
"__MUSIC__ Me either."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, they're really interesting. I've been listening to their music all day."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's really calm. So it's easy to work to."
"__MUSIC__ That's a plus."
"__MUSIC__ But also, if you want to listen, it's complicated enough that it's interesting on its own."
"__MUSIC__ There aren't many bands that can do that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's a quality I'm more used to seeing in classical music."
"__MUSIC__ I've actually been listening to a lot of renditions of Chopin's nocturnes lately."
"__MUSIC__ Should I check those out?"
"__MUSIC__ They have a lot of the qualities you were just talking about."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Maybe I'll give them a shot."
"__MUSIC__ Are you very into classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ I've always wanted to be, but I've never known where to look."
"__MUSIC__ You should also try some Liszt."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I will."
"__MUSIC__ I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it!"
