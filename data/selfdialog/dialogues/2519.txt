"__MUSIC__ La la lalalalal boom! I love this song."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I'd rather have mustard poured in my ears. Who is this?"
"__MUSIC__ Weird Al Yanovic covering Sean Cassidy's 'Da Do Ron Ron'."
"__MUSIC__ Man, he's really stuck for material. But that wasn't what you were singing."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ You don't know the music neither."
"__MUSIC__ Don't be hatin'."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard Weird Al cover Ray Stevens and 'The Streak'?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know that one. Any good?"
"__MUSIC__ About what you'd expect. But it does have a blistering accordion solo."
"__MUSIC__ The accordion has been an overlooked rock instrument."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that Ian Anderson started on the accordion? This was before Jethro Tull when he performed under I. Andy and the Polka Boys."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that Weird Al is a vegan? I can really hear that influence in his music."
"__MUSIC__ i don't know how to respond."
"__MUSIC__ That means he doesn't perform meat related songs. Unlike that poser the Reverend Horton Heat who is a shill for the beef industry."
"__MUSIC__ That song kicks butt. Look at the cows in the slaughter house yard, gotta hit in the head, gotta hit 'em real hard...."
"__MUSIC__ You should be ashamed. Cows are awesome. Pink Floyd loved cows."
"__MUSIC__ What the heck does that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Moooooooooo!"
"__MUSIC__ Please go back to the Do Ron Ron."
