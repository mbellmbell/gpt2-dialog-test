"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you ever heard of Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, I'm not familiar with a lot of music out today."

"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I like stuff from the 80s."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, it's funny you say that, I feel like Lady Gaga is kind of an 80s throwback.  You should check her out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh really?  Who is she most like?"
