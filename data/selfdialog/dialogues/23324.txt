"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see Meet the Robinsons?"
"__DISNEY__ That was such a cute movie. It reminds me of The Incredibles."
"__DISNEY__ I'd have to say that's my favorite Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Mine is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ You know I've never actually seen the original Snow White."
"__DISNEY__ Oh you have to see it, it's a classic."
"__DISNEY__ I've never seen Bambi either."
"__DISNEY__ Well that's not so bad. You didn't have to be traumatized as a kid like everybody else."
"__DISNEY__ Someone shot Bambi's mom right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes and left a scar on children forever and ever. Cinderella is another good Disney classic"
