"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ It's either Beauty and the Beast or Mulan."
"__DISNEY__ Well, you have to pick one!"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm, it's so hard to decide!"
"__DISNEY__ Wait, are you talking about the original Beauty and the Beast or the new live-action version?"
"__DISNEY__ The original, of course!"
"__DISNEY__ Hey, the new movie was good!"
"__DISNEY__ It was okay. Emma Watson is pretty great."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, what a good actress! Maybe you should wait to decide until you see the new live-action Mulan!"
"__DISNEY__ That makes sense. Better ask me again in a couple of years!"
