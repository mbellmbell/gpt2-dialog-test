"__STAR_WARS__ You know who's under rated in Star Wars?  The Emperor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh I agree, he fooled the Jedi for decades undetected and destroyed them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that takes impressive skill."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus his fight against Yoda was totally epic."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it was.  They were toe to toe but he had the high ground on Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've never been able to figure out if he lost on purpose to Mace or not."
"__STAR_WARS__ I kind of think he did.  All that happening at the exact right time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, way too much of a coincidence."
"__STAR_WARS__ But at the same time, Mace Windu is no slouch.  Toying with him could be dangerous."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it could be, but they took care of him in the end."
