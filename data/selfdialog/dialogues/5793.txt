"__STAR_WARS__ So be honest, before you knew they were brother and sister, did you think Luke and Leia would get together?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I really didn't. They always had that good friend chemistry, plus I kind of suspected something was up."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. I think they seemed as though they could be close friends."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think she ended up with the right guy in the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep. I guess she was drawn to Han's bad boy appeal."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess he had that, though he did plenty of good too."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just mean that his whole attitude was kind of like that, even while doing the right thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he was a great person at heart, just a little rough around the edge."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, but I can see where a couple of things go differently and he has a completely different story."
"__STAR_WARS__ I could see him working for the Empire if a few things went differently I suppose."
