"__SUPERHERO__ What is your least favorite super hero movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Hancock.  That was a huge disappointment"
"__SUPERHERO__ Agreed.  They might have been trying to do a comedy but it sure didn't come off that way."
"__SUPERHERO__ No, it was a box office bomb too I think."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes the critics certainly didn't care for it."
"__SUPERHERO__ Nope, and I can say for once I agree with them."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe if they had cast someone else."
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't think it was Will Smith who ruined the film"
"__SUPERHERO__ No but he certainly didn't help it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I guess we will have to agree to disagree on that one."
