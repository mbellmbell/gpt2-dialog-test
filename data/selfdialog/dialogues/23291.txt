"__DISNEY__ Alice in Wonderland was such a strange movie."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, especially since it came out so long ago."
"__DISNEY__ That caterpillar was just insane."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he really got mad at Alice at one point."
"__DISNEY__ There were so many parts in that movie that scared me."
"__DISNEY__ That queen and the Mad Hatter were pretty terrifying."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't the whole movie end up being a dream in the end though?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so, but I haven't seen it in so long I can't remember."
"__DISNEY__ We should watch it again soon to see if it's still scary."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, but don't blame me if you can't sleep that night!"
