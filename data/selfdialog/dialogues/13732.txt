"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think will win MVP this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's got to be Westbrook."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. I never thought I'd see a player average a triple double."
"__BASKETBALL__ Let alone a point guard."
"__BASKETBALL__ It'll be a crime if he doesn't win."
"__BASKETBALL__ But his team wasn't as good as other teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's the only argument Harden has. His team was better. And he didn't have much help."
"__BASKETBALL__ But his season wasn't historic. And he wasn't the best player in the league this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ His team's record would argue otherwise."
"__BASKETBALL__ It was a great year for many athletes. You could make a case for Lebron or Kawhi. But all are second to Westbrook."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Kawhi should get votes because of his defense. None of the other guys care about defense."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, from a true fan's perspective, we should award guys that at least try on defense."
"__BASKETBALL__ Westbrook doesn't try."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know. He spends all his energy on offense."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's a shame because Westbrook should be really good at defense."
"__BASKETBALL__ Anyone with athleticism should be good. It's all about effort."
"__BASKETBALL__ I hate knowing that some players don't put out 100% effort on the court."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's why I'd never vote for Lebron."
"__BASKETBALL__ He doesn't start trying until the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ But once the playoffs start, there's nobody better."
