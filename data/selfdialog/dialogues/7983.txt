"__POP__ I heard Miley Cyrus is going to be on The Voice this fall- I think she's a great coach."
"__POP__ I know, if you're going to have someone advising you, you would want someone sweet and supportive like her."
"__POP__ The judges are Blake and Adam again, Miley, and Jennifer Hudson. Blake always wants all the country acts, so I hope Miley takes on pop singers and helps them stand out."
"__POP__ Well, if there's one thing Miley knows how to do, it's stand out."
"__POP__ I doubt she'd do anything like have them appear naked on a wrecking ball, but I hope she would have them be more adventurous with their costumes."
"__POP__ I know what you mean, sometimes singers all seem so alike, it's hard to remember them."
"__POP__ Miley is really versatile, she's a great country singer, but also a pop music superstar. Maybe she could help her people learn to be more versatile in their music choices."
"__POP__ I'm sure she would have some great suggestions on songs. She knows what appeals to people."
"__POP__ I'm going to miss Gwen Stefani though, her and Blake were cute together."
"__POP__ Some people thought TOO cute."
