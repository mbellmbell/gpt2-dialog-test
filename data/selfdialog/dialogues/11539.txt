"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you want to join my fantasy football league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. I'm excited about the new season. Can't wait"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, I'll send you the details via email. I can't wait for the season to start either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll be going to training camp to watch Tom Brady practice with Brandin Cooks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That team is off the charts this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I'm really excited. I might draft Brady in Round 1"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha. You are such a homer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You'll regret saying that when he puts up 50 points every week."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, we'll see about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady is going to be legit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really think so at his age?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, he didn't show any signs of slippage last year. He's playing like he's 30"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Rodgers is the better bet at QB. He always is for fantasy purposes"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. He does have Martellus Bennett this year. Would be a great superbowl matchup with the Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that your prediction for this year's superbowl? Pack vs. Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ummm, yea I think so. Falcons will have Superbowl loss hangover."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you. AFC has no contenders to match the Patriots. They just got better and unless injuries hit, they should be good to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. If Gronk is healthy in the playoffs, game over for everyone else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be a good game. Rodgers vs. Brady"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't even imagine what people would say if Brady beat Rodgers. There would have to be no more doubt from anyone whatsoever."
