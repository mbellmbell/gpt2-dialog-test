"__DISNEY__ What's the deal with the Frozen movie stuff?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ My two little girls are going crazy for everything Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ That's pretty normal, what's the problem?"
"__DISNEY__ I've never seen the movie. I don't understand why they have to have everything Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ You should really see the movie. It's great."
"__DISNEY__ Why?"
"__DISNEY__ It's hard to explain. They just did everything right, and the movie became extremely popular. I mean, it's popular for a reason."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe, I will. Then I'll understand why my girls need their entire room to have Elsa and Anna everywhere."
"__DISNEY__ That's funny. Good luck with all of that."
