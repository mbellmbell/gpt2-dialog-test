"__MOVIES__ Hey you! Seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Haven't really had time for movies lately, but I did rent Hounds of Love the other night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? Never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither, but my friend in Australia totally recommended it. It sounds like a very promising Crime, Drama, Horror film from 2016."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't know you were into crime."
"__MOVIES__ Well... it's not the biggest part of this particular film par say, but I did enjoy the classic Godfather trilogy, Shawshank Redemption, and Zodiac."
"__MOVIES__ Shawshank Redemption... wasn't that with Morgan Freeman?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup! One of my absolute favorite actors."
"__MOVIES__ Mine too. His voice is just so chill... I could listen to him read a phonebook."
"__MOVIES__ Same. What's your favorite Freeman film?"
"__MOVIES__ Well... thought he made the perfect Lucius Fox in the Nolan Batman trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. Anything else?"
"__MOVIES__ He was hilarious in The Lego Movie and Bruce Almighty. Gosh, there's so many films I can't just name a few."
"__MOVIES__ I know! Practically all of them are great if not ALL of them."
"__MOVIES__ What about yours?"
"__MOVIES__ The Sum of All Fears is probably my absolute favorite though just as much for Ben Affleck as Morgan."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you've always been a huge Ben Affleck fan."
"__MOVIES__ How can I not be? I absolutely fell in love with him across all of Kevin Smith's movies."
"__MOVIES__ Now that's an actor and director I follow almost as religiously as Morgan Freeman."
"__MOVIES__ Only almost? He's my film and comic book god practically."
