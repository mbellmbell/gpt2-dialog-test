"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever seen star wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The new ones, you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I mean the real star wars, the ones from back in the day."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, so like Return of the Jedi and stuff?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, those ones, have you seen them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, they look really cheesy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course, they are cheesy, they are 30 years old."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that's why I haven't seen them."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're missing out, the characters were much cooler back then."
"__STAR_WARS__ If you say so."
