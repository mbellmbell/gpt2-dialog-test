"__MOVIES__ Who is your least favorite actor?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'd probably say Nicholas Cage?"
"__MOVIES__ Nick Cage? That guy is a riot! He's so goofy and fun!"
"__MOVIES__ So goofy and awful, you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man, his performance in Con Air is one of my favorite 'good bad' performances of all time."
"__MOVIES__ I barely remember watching that movie on cable one night, years ago."
"__MOVIES__ With that corny Southern accent. 'Why couldn't you put down the bunny?' Hahaha."
"__MOVIES__ He just seems super over-the-top and annoying most of the time."
"__MOVIES__ I respect the effort that he puts into each role. Regardless of the script, he gives his all."
"__MOVIES__ Well, but usually the script is terrible, especially recently."
"__MOVIES__ It's true, he hasn't been very choosy recently."
"__MOVIES__ He's been choosing, just bad movies! Did you see The Sorcerer's Apprentice?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw a trailer for it, and it didn't look good."
"__MOVIES__ Spoilers: It was in fact not good."
"__MOVIES__ I prefer to think about peak Nicholas Cage. How about Leaving Las Vegas?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was alright in that. Like 30 years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Either way, I think he won the Oscar for that performance."
"__MOVIES__ He might have, you might be right."
"__MOVIES__ So, just saying - your least favorite actor was once the best actor in the world."
"__MOVIES__ I still don't like him, what can I say? He just grates on me."
