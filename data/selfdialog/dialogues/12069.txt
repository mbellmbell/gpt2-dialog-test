"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for football to start. It's the Bills year this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate to burst your bubble but I don't think so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a new head coach and a solid draft class."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know but it takes more than that to win the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know but they are moving in the right direction."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, I still think it will take a few years though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I just try to stay optimistic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nothing wrong with that! I thought they would draft Chad Kelly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought that too! Glad they didn't though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How come? He's a great raw talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Raw talent, yes, but he's got a lot to work on off the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I hear you there. I think he'll do well fighting for a starting position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will probably take a few years before he makes his first start but he will be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I don't hate the guy, I want him to do great!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think everyone from Buffalo is pulling for him because of his uncle Jim."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jim Kelly is the best thing to ever happen to that city!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Four straight Super Bowls, I'd say so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only team to ever do that in history. I can't believe they couldn't win just one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a touchy subject to talk about in Buffalo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, it's just such a crazy stat!"
