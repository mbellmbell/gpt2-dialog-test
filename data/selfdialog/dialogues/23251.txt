"__DISNEY__ Did you know they're making the Incredibles 2?! It comes out in 2018."
"__DISNEY__ Really? No way! They waited 14 years, and just now they're making a sequel?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep. How do you think it'll turn out?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm, I'm not sure. Hopefully better than the first."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean? The first one was pretty good!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but there were a lot of hidden mature jokes."
"__DISNEY__ Humph. Typical Disney."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. Well, I hope it'll have good ratings."
"__DISNEY__ I can't wait to watch it!"
"__DISNEY__ Me either!"
