"__MOVIES__ Please tell me you have seen the movie called Homeward Bound:The Incredible Journey."
"__MOVIES__ I might have, is it old?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is from the 90s."
"__MOVIES__ What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is the movie with the two dogs and the cat that are looking for their way home!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wait, I have seen that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ It really is a great story, the owners leave the animals with someone for a while and the animals escape and try to find their way home."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I remember well, the dogs and the cat go through so much to find their owners!"
"__MOVIES__ I cry every time I see the end of that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, especially when Shadow, the last dog, comes walking out."
"__MOVIES__ That is the part that gets me too, the poor dogs owner thought he was dead."
"__MOVIES__ They went through some much, especially when the kitty gets sucked into the river, that was awful!"
"__MOVIES__ And the sweet man that saves her and cleans her up!"
"__MOVIES__ I really like when they are fishing, and they get the cat to get the fish for them. I laugh every time I see that part."
"__MOVIES__ Or how about when the cougar is hunting them, and the dogs use a catapult to get rid of the cat."
"__MOVIES__ That part was really funny. It is such a feel good story."
"__MOVIES__ It will always be a classic, I could watch it over and over."
"__MOVIES__ I like how it focuses mainly on the animals, and rarely the humans."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, that is what makes the story so great."
"__MOVIES__ I would have to agree!"
