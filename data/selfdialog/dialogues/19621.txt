"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see World War Z?"
"__MOVIES__ Still haven't gotten a chance yet, but remember it coming out."
"__MOVIES__ It's actually a pretty decent flick, you should check it out."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that it was a production nightmare."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they totally rewrote the last part of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I heard.  The third act is completely different."
"__MOVIES__ Apparently Brad Pitt didn't like the direction the movie went."
"__MOVIES__ Which is strange really.  He read the script, right?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure, but apparently it didn't translate to the screen like they wanted."
"__MOVIES__ So what changed?  Don't spoil it for me, but give me a hint."
"__MOVIES__ Sure.  I guess the original script had him being way too action-heroey, if that's even a word."
"__MOVIES__ It's not, but I get what you mean.  He was too much of a fighter vs. what his character should have been?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  So they reshot the end to make him more measured."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like it was a smart move."
"__MOVIES__ It was in the end.  A lot of people credit it with saving the production."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that they feared it could bomb at the box office."
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  But instead of being an expensive failure, it made money."
"__MOVIES__ You know what's crazy?"
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ We haven't even talked about the zombies in a zombie movie yet!"
