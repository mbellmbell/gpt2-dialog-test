"__FASHION__ Did you see Levi's re-cut the 501 again?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, hopefully it fixes the stitching issues on the inseam."
"__FASHION__ Here's to hoping! Have you seen their other offerings?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, I absolutely love their jackets. For both genders!"
"__FASHION__ I just recently got a denim jacket from them on sale."
"__FASHION__ Is their construction similar to their other denim?"
"__FASHION__ Yes! Speaking of jackets, what are your thoughts on old military jackets?"
"__FASHION__ They can look nice, but only when it's over-sized and bulky."
"__FASHION__ Kind of like a grunge look?"
"__FASHION__ Yes, but be careful that's going out for the new Bohemian look."
"__FASHION__ If I get a military jacket, what boots could go well with it?"
"__FASHION__ I believe I've seen Liam Hemsworth wearing Red Wings and it looked really good."
"__FASHION__ I love those! It seems old mining boots go well for men and combat boots for women."
"__FASHION__ Absolutely, Krysten Ritter looks great in combat boots!"
"__FASHION__ Yes! Especially paired with a nice leather jacket."
"__FASHION__ Too bad leather is prohibitively expense and unethical by some perspectives."
"__FASHION__ Yeah that's why I elected to choose a faux leather jacket and it's worked surprisingly well."
"__FASHION__ I have one of those too, it's held out quite well provided the stereotype that it won't hold out as long as real leather."
"__FASHION__ I want to get one similar to the one Bradley Cooper's been spotted wearing!"
"__FASHION__ With the brown leather? I love it!"
