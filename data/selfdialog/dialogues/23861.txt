"__SUPERHERO__ What superhero movies feel short for you , (if any)?"
"__SUPERHERO__ The avengers. I thought it was a disaster."
"__SUPERHERO__ Really , why? Was it the acting?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Not so much the acting, just the movie as a whole. The script mostly just did not do it for me."
"__SUPERHERO__ I thought the cast was great and  so many even carry there own films, downey, chris evans I am surprised you did not enjoy seeing them reprise these roles."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think they each are very talented. Maybe I just have trouble buying into the grouping together. Like too many to get quality focus on each."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think many people love it for the group aspect, getting to see so many favorites altogether."
"__SUPERHERO__ I personally would rather watch iron man, captain america etc individual films."
"__SUPERHERO__ Interesting I wonder how many others feel this way.. if any, because avengers was so popular has a sequel and did very well at he box office."
"__SUPERHERO__ I am a weirdo maybe, but just my least favorite superhero film/films. I don't think I could even make it awake in another viewing."
