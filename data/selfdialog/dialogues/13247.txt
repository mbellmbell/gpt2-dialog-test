"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're a 49ers fan, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sometimes, yeah. Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what's the deal about Colin Kaepernick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Joe Montana isn't optimistic about him finding a new home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean he's still a free agent? I'm a little surprised."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some are blaming protests in 2016 for him remaining a free agent for four months now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well... that could be part of it. Personally I don't think he's getting a fair chance though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he's either being blackballed by everyone in the NFL or they just don't want to see his play style."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's got a 59.8% career completion record. That's nearly 10% more than even Tim Tebow's career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is actually pretty dang impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, so the guy is getting a raw deal. Hopefully someone will give him a chance he deserves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think about that DeForest Buckner? Seems like there's a lot of hype around him lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And with good reason! Dude is going to be a defensive MVP this year for certain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really think so? Isn't he still kinda green."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may be in his sophomore of his career but dude has the build, speed, and athleticism."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But wont their new 4-3 defense give him some issues?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, dude knows his stuff and has the skill for both inside and outside on the line. Trust me, you're going to want to keep an eye on him this year."
