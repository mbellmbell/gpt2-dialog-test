"__STAR_WARS__ I hate how there is so much CGI in the new Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was the worst was in the prequel movies.  And then they had to go add some to the original."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hated all of the added scenes that they put into the original.  The original felt more real."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's because they used puppets instead of CGI. Much better in my opinion."
"__STAR_WARS__ There was one scene that was better with CGI though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one was that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Yoda fight scene where he bounces all around the room."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do love that scene.  But I do prefer my Yoda as a puppet."
"__STAR_WARS__ His original form was definitely the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ And his voice is so iconic.  He is one of the reasons it is such a popular movie!"
