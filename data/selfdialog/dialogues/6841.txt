"__STAR_WARS__ What part of Star Wars stick with you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first shot of X-wings diving toward the Death Star as that fanfare plays."
"__STAR_WARS__ A good thought, the finale of Episode four."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, another for me was the Victory Celbration at the end of four."
"__STAR_WARS__ A down point for me was six. The Ewoks was to get an even younger audience involved."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, that was dissapointing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whtn Episode One came out i was elated! Two was even better."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you like about two?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, just the city life...... it kinda reminded me of Washington DC in the 60's. Super large living spaces, large living room windows."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought that as well."
