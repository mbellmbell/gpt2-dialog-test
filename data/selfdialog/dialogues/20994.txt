"__THRILLER__ When was the last time you saw that movie Signs?"
"__THRILLER__ Man, a long time ago.  Why do you ask?"
"__THRILLER__ I was just thinking about it the other day.  I really hated the ending."
"__THRILLER__ Which is sad because the rest of the movie is constructed pretty well."
"__THRILLER__ Why on earth would the aliens come to a planet that's 75% water?"
"__THRILLER__ Because they are stupid.  That's the only logical reason."
"__THRILLER__ My wife keeps cups of water lying around the house too like the little girl."
"__THRILLER__ Is that due to laziness or aliens?"
"__THRILLER__ Both I think.  All I know is that I just keep dumping them out."
"__THRILLER__ The aliens are gonna get you then!"
