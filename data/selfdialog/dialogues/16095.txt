"__ROCK__ Bob Dylan is probably the greatest songwriter ever."
"__ROCK__ I don't think there's any debate."
"__ROCK__ He's pretty much written a good percentage of every classic song."
"__ROCK__ He's still making some pretty good music."
"__ROCK__ I haven't heard any of his latest stuff.. So it's pretty good?"
"__ROCK__ Yep, you'll never have another classic, but it's quality stuff."
"__ROCK__ How's his voice sound?"
"__ROCK__ You can tell he's getting old.  His voice flutters a bit."
"__ROCK__ Guess that's bound to happen when you're pushing 80 years old."
"__ROCK__ But at least he's still out there doing it."
