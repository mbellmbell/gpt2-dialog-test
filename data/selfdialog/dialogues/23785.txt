"__SUPERHERO__ Guess what I saw last night at the theater!"
"__SUPERHERO__ What was it? Did you go see Wonder Woman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Not just Wonder Woman, but Wonder Woman in IMAX."
"__SUPERHERO__ Dear mother of god, that's amazing."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, it was two hours of...amazing."
"__SUPERHERO__ Was the movie good too?"
"__SUPERHERO__ The movie was amazing - it was a really cool origin story."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh yeah? Do you think they will make more movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah I bet they will, the first movie ends sort of at the end of World War I, so there's plenty of space for Wonder Woman."
"__SUPERHERO__ This is good news, my friend."
