"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Dr. Strange yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it when it was in the theater."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch."
"__MOVIES__ Neither am I, but I thought he did a good job in this movie."
"__MOVIES__ The special effects were really great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I loved the part where all the buildings are moving."
"__MOVIES__ And what did you think of the big action sequence at the end?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, I'm kind of over destroying cities as the big finale to movies."
"__MOVIES__ It has been done. Although turning back time to fix it was a little different."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the best part was Strange's characterization."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, just blowing things up isn't enough to make a movie good."
"__MOVIES__ I thought this movie did a good job of establishing who he was as a person."
"__MOVIES__ He started off as kind of a jerk."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he got better."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think of it compared to other Marvel movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it better than Age of Ultron but not as well as the first Avengers movie."
"__MOVIES__ But it's still better than the DC movies."
"__MOVIES__ Much better. It was a fun movie to watch!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm glad I got a chance to see it."
