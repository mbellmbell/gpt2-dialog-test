"__MOVIES__ What's a good movie that you just dont get?"
"__MOVIES__ Man, I just don't get Titanic?"
"__MOVIES__ Why not? It's classic!"
"__MOVIES__ Why is it classic?"
"__MOVIES__ It's got famous people and they acted very well!"
"__MOVIES__ It was too boring for me. Almost 3 hours if I remember correctly"
"__MOVIES__ That plenty of time to lay down a great plot"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it helps us meet the characters well too"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! they are well cast and have a lot of depth"
"__MOVIES__ I still don't like it though"
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Too much nudity and sex for me"
"__MOVIES__ It was just Rose's chest, right?"
"__MOVIES__ I didnt care for it and also they slept together in the car"
"__MOVIES__ True, I guess that's not for everybody"
"__MOVIES__ I watched it with my kids and felt bad afterwards, they were too young"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah for a PG13 movie it was a little much"
"__MOVIES__ I also didnt like the ending, Rose should let the guy onto the door!"
"__MOVIES__ But it had to end that way, make us cry!"
"__MOVIES__ Not every good movie needs to make you cry!"
