"__MOVIES__ So you work as a children's librarian, right?"
"__MOVIES__ That's right."
"__MOVIES__ What movies are popular at the library right now?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, recent releases are always popular. Beauty & the Best is very popular right now."
"__MOVIES__ I can imagine!"
"__MOVIES__ And people keep asking about the Captain Underpants movie, which isn't even in theaters yet."
"__MOVIES__ Ha, that's funny."
"__MOVIES__ I know! Trolls is also really popular."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I've never seen that."
"__MOVIES__ Me either."
"__MOVIES__ Any trends that surprised you?"
"__MOVIES__ I was really surprised by how into terrifying movies some of the kids are."
"__MOVIES__ By terrifying do you mean Goosebumps?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they might settle for Goosebumps if they can't check out adult movies, but I've had 9-year-olds who want to check out The Exorcist and Rings."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Those movies are too scary for me, and I'm an adult!"
"__MOVIES__ Same here!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, some of those kids are super good with horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ Huh, I expected more popularity for Dora or My Little Pony."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, don't worry, those are popular too - just not with the same people!"
