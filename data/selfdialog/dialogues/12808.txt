"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All right fans we're back live with Dave Johnson the voice of the Texans.  How's training camp going Dave?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Jim the guys are having a great time getting ready for their first pre-season game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So give us an insiders look at the team for this year.  What do Texan fans have to look forward too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Houston Texans are going to have a great turnout this year.  Our offense is going to go through some changes for the better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you going to do to get the offense better then last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We are working on shoring up the tight end position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You do have a couple of new tight ends now.  How are they going to fit into the lineup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we've got one that will take on the starting position and the other will fill in on third down situations."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, what else is the offense doing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we are taking on a more pass/run philosophy instead of run first.  This will be different and fans will see us going up and down the field more I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But will that translate into more tuchdowns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I think it will.  We've got some great receivers on the team and adding some strong blocking from the Tight End position will help give them time to get freed up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the offensive line?  They were pretty good last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure were and we aren't doing a darn thing there except resigning Masey to make sure that line stays together for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any news on the defensive end of things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well yeah,  we've added a few parts in the back field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know you've picked up a new Saftey.  How's he working out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jones, yeah.  He's starting to get into the motion of the game now.  It will take a little while for him to get into NFL shape but I think he'll be in the rotation from the first game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All right folks we're going to take a break for a moment and we'll be right back with Dave Johnson and see how he thinks the division will go this year.  All right Dave, nice job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thanks Jim.  This is kinda fun."
