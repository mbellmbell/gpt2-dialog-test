"__MUSIC__ I'm going to make you a mixtape for your birthday."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks! That's really thoughtful of you."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to put all the greatest birthday themed music on it."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, what is the greatest birthday music? I can't think of any, off the top of my head."
"__MUSIC__ OK, you got me! There really isn't any, so you'll get other kinds of songs."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, yeah, there really isn't that much great music made on the theme of 'birthdays'."
"__MUSIC__ Which makes sense. Having a happy birthday isn't exactly great artistic grounds like Love or Loss or things like that."
"__MUSIC__ No, it's definitely a little more trivial."
"__MUSIC__ What is the greatest song or album made about the most trivial topic, in your opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Ohhh, good question. Let me think a sec."
"__MUSIC__ How about 'Yellow Submarine' by the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ Is that even a great song, though?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people like it, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, if we're going by that standard, then that Beatles song where he sings 'I am the Egg Man' is pretty goofy too."
"__MUSIC__ I guess in some ways, maybe that's the hardest thing to do in music."
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ Make a brilliant song out of the most trivial or absurd topic or subject matter."
"__MUSIC__ It seems like it would be easier to just make a song that deals with something important or meaningful."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, which is why doing the opposite is so hard."
"__MUSIC__ It also seems like kind of a waste of time. But whatever floats your boat!"
