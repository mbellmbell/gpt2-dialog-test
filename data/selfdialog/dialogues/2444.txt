"__MUSIC__ Hey, you want to come to a concert with me next week?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure. Who's playing? and where?"
"__MUSIC__ One of my top favorites... Bob Seger. He'll be at the Palace."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, good ole' Detroit boy. Sounds like fun. I haven't been to a live concert for quite awhile."
"__MUSIC__ I saw the Beach Boys in Chicago last summer."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That sounds like fun. How was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it was at the beach... in August. But it rained and it was really cold."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that must have put a damper on the evening. Ha ha"
"__MUSIC__ Oh very funny. Actually once everyone got really soaked we all just gave up trying to stay dry and just went with it."
"__MUSIC__ Still though, singing about summer fun at the beach?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the music was really good but it didn't look like they were having much fun.They made the best of it though."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, well we can get into that old time rock 'n roll at the palace. That should be fun."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, although I really like smaller venues. I've caught a couple concerts lately in Traverse City venues that are pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Classic rock covers mostly. But some jazz and blues too. Lot of local people, but some pretty famous names at Interlochen too."
"__MUSIC__ So maybe I'll come up and join you for some of those concerts."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, that works. I'll send you the schedule and you can pick out what you want to see."
"__MUSIC__ Alrighty then, thanks.Let me know how much the Seger tickets are."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I'll purchase them and you can pay me back."
"__MUSIC__ Or, we can go out to dinner beforehand and I can just pay for that. Either way..."
