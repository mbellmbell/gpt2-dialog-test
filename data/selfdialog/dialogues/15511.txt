"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is you favorite  McGonagall moment in the last two movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ When her and Snape duke it out in Deatlhy Hollows part two."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Just about everything she does in that one is awesome."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ When she and Snape have the battle in the main hall, it is equal parts funny and sad."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ When she sayd ' I always wanted to use that spell' after she hits him with a good one, I love that scene."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It showed that she was a powerful witch, but still cool and sweet about it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They hinted the whole series she was. But she cared more about kids than being known for her power."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That scene just cemented it. That she did not really like Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I do not think anyone but Lily and Dumbledore ever actually liked Snape before he died."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And Lily stopped liking him pretty soon after she found out he was not so nice."
