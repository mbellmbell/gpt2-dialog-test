"__STAR_WARS__ Which was the the superior set of Star Wars movies, the original or the requel trilogies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a hard question to answer."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ On one hand, the original movies are groundbreaking and innovative, while the prequels were fairly strong, but not too suprising."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't follow you."
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean, when the original trilogy movies came out, each was fresh and you didn't know what was going next."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, but not the same with the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, because we knew where everything was going, how we got was put for grabs, but the destination 'Darth Vader, the Empire, Death Star' was known."
"__STAR_WARS__ okay, I see where you're coming from."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus, the Phantom, Mence was a little underwhelming."
