"__MUSIC__ What are you listening to these days?"
"__MUSIC__ I have bee just using google play for music lately."
"__MUSIC__ Well what on google play are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I pick a mix that suits my mood for the moment."
"__MUSIC__ So you aren't listening to a particular artist?"
"__MUSIC__ No really. I enjoy the variety more."
"__MUSIC__ Sort of like radio I guess."
"__MUSIC__ It's better because there are so few commercials."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I really can't stand radio commercials these days."
"__MUSIC__ It really takes away from my enjoyment of listening to music to hear a loud ad for mattresses or something."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you should buy into one of those paid services for no ads then."
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking of it but they are so expensive."
"__MUSIC__ What do they cost, about $10 a month right?"
"__MUSIC__ More like $15. Consider how Netflix is $20 a month, then you realize what a bad deal that is."
"__MUSIC__ If you want no commercials, your alternative is to download music."
"__MUSIC__ I have been doing that more actually. It is a bit tedious though."
"__MUSIC__ Legally or the immoral way?"
"__MUSIC__ A mix of both. I find in my older age I have been buying music more."
"__MUSIC__ About a decade and a half too late to save the music industry though."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure the music and musicians will be just fine."
