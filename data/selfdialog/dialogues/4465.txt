"__MUSIC__ So did you ever listen to Bon Jovi?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I loved Bon Jovi!  He was one of the greatest artists of the nineties."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say it was more like the eighties.  Slippery When Wet came out in 1986."
"__MUSIC__ Well you may be right, but he was still very popular in the nineties."
"__MUSIC__ True.  Keep The Faith came out in 1992."
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, and they were still releasing music in 2000 believe it or not!"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that.  What did they release in 2000?"
"__MUSIC__ It's My Life.  And they had another album in 2007 which actually included country music."
"__MUSIC__ Whoah, I wouldn't have seen that coming.  So their music has spanned several decades."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, hard to believe isn't it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is.  Most artists aren't around so long."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I think they've released something like 13 albums total."
"__MUSIC__ That's crazy!  So what are their favorite songs of yours?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I always loved Blaze of Glory.  That was one of their original hits."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I love that song too.  I still listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Livin' On A Prayer."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's a great song!  I learned to play it on the guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's one you can definitely sing along to."
"__MUSIC__ That was the case with most of their music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's probably one of the things that made them so popular."
