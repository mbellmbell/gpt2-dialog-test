"__ROCK__ It's just indie rock. They have a female singer and they just have simple, nice and catchy songs."
"__ROCK__ Very cool, what are some bands that they sound like?"
"__ROCK__ Maybe a cross between Cat Power and The Lemonheads."
"__ROCK__ Sounds interesting. What's the name of a recent album of theirs and what's a good song on that album?"
"__ROCK__ The most recent album is called A Vision. There's a lot of good songs on that album but if I had to pick one I'd say that the song Let Go in really good."

"__ROCK__ If you want I can send you a YouTube link to some songs so that you can preview them and see if it's something you'd like."
