"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is this the last year for the Seahawks to make another run?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most definitely, Russell and Sherman seem to hate each other."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sherman seems to hate everyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Talented player, but a bit of a headcase."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and now he's getting older. Seems like he has seen his best days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I won't count him out, but you may have a point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I do, I think he's a locker room cancer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they say the defensive players love him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the offensive players hate him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, it's kind of a rough situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I will say that the Seahawks are talented this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep and I think they upgraded their running attack."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That'll be big. They haven't looked the same since Marshawn left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Beast Mode was a huge loss when he 'retired'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I love the way he played, just did not care."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and he was a funny dude."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love those types of characters in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not many of them left with how corporate it has become."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but I hope with them legalizing touchdown celebrations again, it'll change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree. Hopefully it'll loosen things up."
