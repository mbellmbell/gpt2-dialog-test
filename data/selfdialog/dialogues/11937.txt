"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, how do you think your Patriots are going to do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Looking good. Brady is coming off one of the best years of his career and now we have Cooks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cooks does look like a great addition and adds something to the team. Who do you think will win it all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Pats are favourites but I have a feeling that the Raiders are going to challenge them in the AFC this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Lynch, Carr and Cooper they arguably might have the best triple player offence in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brown, Bell and Roethlisburger from the Steelers might argue that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah thats a good tandom too! Some teams are loaded on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Other aren't, like the Browns!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A Texans reject likely at QB in Osweiler, they look like they're going to have another rough year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pryor looked good last season, especially as he used to be a QB and not a WR."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not good enough that he can win with Brock Osweiler throwing too him though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Osweiler gone from the Texans, how do you think Deshawn Watson will fair?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will be difficult to face. Operating that duel threat of the pass and him running. He could be the next Wilson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he will be anywhere near the level of Wilson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe not but he adds an extra dimension to the Texans and gives JJ Watt a better chance of a ring!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, JJ Watt is a monster. Think he gets the most sacks this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he can stay healthy without a doubt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does struggle to stay fit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You could say the same about Gronkowski!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just wait till he lifts the Lombardi Trophy again this year! Just you wait!"
