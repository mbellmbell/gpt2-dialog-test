"__DISNEY__ So have you seen 'Finding Nemo'?"
"__DISNEY__ No I haven't. Is it any good?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you kidding me?! It was AMAZING! One of the cutest movies I have ever seen."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah?"
"__DISNEY__ Seriously. I know it isn't you thing per say, but the turtles in that movie you would love! There is a scene where they meet the turtles, hey are surfers and he calls him 'Mr.Turtle' and the turtle responds 'My dad was Mr.Turtle, you can call me Crunch' it was hilarious!"
"__DISNEY__ So they have surfing turtles?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes and the little one is great! Oh and Dori, the fish with no memory."
"__DISNEY__ Don't all fishes have no memory?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess? But seriously you have to see it, I really can't do it justice."
"__DISNEY__ I'll check it out some time."
