"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win in the NFC this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm particularly fond of the Falcons to repeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you even think the Falcons will win their own division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that might be tough for them, but they should make the playoffs and they are as dynamic as anyone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about on the defensive end?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might not be able to hold their own, but who else is going to score as many points as them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but if the Seahawks or someone similar can compete on the defensive end, they might give them trouble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm still putting my money on the Falcons!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, what about the AFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots clearly have the edge, especially after getting Cooks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might be as dynamic as any receiver they've had since Moss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, and a healthy Gronk can only help them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm personally very fond of the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should be pretty dangerous too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Carr hadn't gone down, they might have been playing a lot further."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, does the team live and die with Carr?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might, but as long as he is healthy, they will be dangerous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, all I can say is I'm excited for the season to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, should be a very interesting one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, about as interesting as any year we've had in a while."
