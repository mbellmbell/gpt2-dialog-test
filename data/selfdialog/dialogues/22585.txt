"__DISNEY__ True, Disney making new Star Wars movies is a disgrace."
"__DISNEY__ Well, you know how businesses operate these days. Disney of course sees alot of profit in making new Star Wars movies."
"__DISNEY__ I understand, it's just dissapointing in the sense that you know they aren't going any good Star Wars movies that can compete with the original Star Wars movies."
"__DISNEY__ On the bright side, we get to see new lightsaber battles on screen"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but that is for the casual audience."
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely, I know that Star Wars is about having a good story."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was cool how Samuel L Jackson played Mace Windu in the Star Wars prequels."
