"__ROCK__ Who do you believe is the most influential rock band or musician?"
"__ROCK__ Probably someone from the sixties, like Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath."
"__ROCK__ No way, it has to be Chuck Berry."
"__ROCK__ What?  Blues isn't even rock."
"__ROCK__ Just listen to Johnny B. Goode, it's the quintessential rock and roll song."
"__ROCK__ There's not even heavy guitar or distortion, no way.  Led Zeppelin was doing that way better."
"__ROCK__ Maybe, but they did it way later.  You can't listen to something like Rock And Roll by Led Zeppelin and not hear Chuck Berry's influence."
"__ROCK__ So does the person who created the technique get the credit, or the person who refined it?"
"__ROCK__ Well, that's a good question.  I'd argue the former."
"__ROCK__ I'd argue the latter.  Thankfully, we can rock out to both."
