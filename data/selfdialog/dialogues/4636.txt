"__MUSIC__ Schonberg's music most certainly has symmetry. He even talks about it."
"__MUSIC__ Explain"
"__MUSIC__ So you understand the twelve tone technique. Yes?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think so. Use all the note equally which prevents you from being in a key"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Ok. On top of that there 4 postulates you should follow."
"__MUSIC__ Postulates. This isn't math you know."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's what Schonberg called them."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Schonberg was a secretly a mathematician wanna be."
"__MUSIC__ i don't know. Anyway, so the postulates are basically rules that apply to the twelve tone technie that makes up the rows, or series,. or those 'notes' get it?"
"__MUSIC__ i think so. You're talking about those dots and notes that appear on those lines."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. preceisly,. You can see they form a pattern when in series. And not the postulates are them. First the row is a ordering of the notes."
"__MUSIC__ Um... what?"
"__MUSIC__ A row is the ordering of the 12 tones. or how they're basically arranged."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I see. Ok go on."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, now the second postulate for the 12 tones is that in a row, there is no repeated note."
"__MUSIC__ Easy enough"
"__MUSIC__ And this is a tough one. Third, a row maybe be subjected to interval perseving transformations."
"__MUSIC__ what?"
"__MUSIC__ A transformation in music involves things like inversion, retrograde, retrograde inversion, and being the same as the poriginal or prime."
"__MUSIC__ Whoosh.. Mind blown. I have no idea"
