"__MOVIES__ Hey, do you have my copy of Django Unchained?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I forgot it, its at my house."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it! You know how much I love Tarantino movies though."
"__MOVIES__ I thought for sure that Leo was going to get the Oscar for this role."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. He totally got robbed."
"__MOVIES__ As usual."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think about the plot line?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it a lot, I like the idea of a freed slave getting his wife back."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, with help of a bounty hunter no less."
"__MOVIES__ Its not a bad deal when you think about it. Get free, get a job, and get your wife back."
"__MOVIES__ True. Though it was a bit more complicated than that."
"__MOVIES__ Well obviously."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe that Leonardo DiCaprio actually played a bad guy. He's always so nice!"
"__MOVIES__ I read that Leonardo DiCaprio,was uncomfortable with how horrible and explicitly racist his character was."
"__MOVIES__ Well wouldn't you be?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I couldn't imagine having to say all those words, in front of other people."
"__MOVIES__ Samuel L Jackson actually helped him through that."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he told Leo it was just another Tuesday to everyone there and not to feel bad."
