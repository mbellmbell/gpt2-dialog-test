"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the latest version of Tron?"
"__DISNEY__ That would be, “Tron: Legacy” in 2010."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it was quite different to the original Tron released in the 80s."
"__DISNEY__ I think the story was very different, but the visuals were quite similar."
"__DISNEY__ I would have to disagree."
"__DISNEY__ In what way do you think the visuals were different?"
"__DISNEY__ The visuals in the new version of Tron were more vibrant, the suits that the characters wear glow more realistically."
"__DISNEY__ In the original Tron the suits that the characters wear glow too."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, but in the new version the glow is more realistic, in the original version it looked like a cartoon."
"__DISNEY__ I think both movies were ahead of their time, and had amazing visuals."
