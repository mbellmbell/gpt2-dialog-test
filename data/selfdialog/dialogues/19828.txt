"__MOVIES__ What is your most favorite Disney movie that you have seen recently?"
"__MOVIES__ It has got to be Moana! The movie is so good! Plus hearing The Rock sing is really silly!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm surprised that they had The Rock actually sing in the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you can tell that's not his main talent, but it fits really well. And the songs are awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Did they use Tim Rice like usual for their musical numbers?"
"__MOVIES__ No! They actually had Hawaiian songwriters for the movie to help with the songs!"
"__MOVIES__ That's really cool and fitting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they did a really good job in terms of hiring people of either Hawaiian or Polynesian decent."
"__MOVIES__ Is there any other actors or people I know of in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Nicole Schreizenger has a role in the movie as well!"
"__MOVIES__ The girl from The Pussycat Dolls? I didn't know she could voice act."
"__MOVIES__ Well, she sings in a song or two as well. So it works."
"__MOVIES__ Makes sense. I think I would pick ZooTopia for my favorite Disney movie recently. Or maybe Star Wars Rogue One."
"__MOVIES__ It's so weird to say that Star Wars is actually a Disney movie..... That being said, The Last Jedi looks AMAZING!"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! I am definitely seeing the midnight showing of it! I can never have enough Star Wars. And Rian Johnson does amazing work!"
"__MOVIES__ Isn't he the guy who did Looper?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he is! He does some really weird but cool work. I think he is a perfect fit for the Star Wars universe."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think they will say who Rey's Parent's are in this film?"
"__MOVIES__ Johnson said it isn't really addressed too much, but it may be a red herring!"
"__MOVIES__ Just say she's Luke's daughter already!"
