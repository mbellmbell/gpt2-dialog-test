"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Rogue One? Yes, it was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ You liked it? I thought it was confusing."
"__MOVIES__ I loved it. It was probably my favorite in the series."
"__MOVIES__ It was not really part of the series though..."
"__MOVIES__ I understand that, but it did explain so much that was left out of the first  'Star Wars'."
"__MOVIES__ Like What? Why is it your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I always felt like the original movie from 1977, started out in the middle of a already playing story. I love how it tells the story of the orign of the death star plans."
"__MOVIES__ I always felt like 'Episode One' revealed enough of the story."
"__MOVIES__ It did explain a lot, but I feel like 'Rogue One' really went deeper. I felt a real connection with Jyn and Galen Erso."
"__MOVIES__ I did not feel like their story needed to be told."
"__MOVIES__ To each their own opinion, I guess. Which one is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ My favorite is the 'Return of the Jedi'."
"__MOVIES__ Why? That one is so old!"
"__MOVIES__ It has been my favorite since I saw it in the theater back in 1983. I love the ewoks!"
"__MOVIES__ Ewoks are adorable."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think the next one will be good?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean 'The last Jedi'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I think the plot sounds very interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I am excited to see if Rey is a Kenobi! We will have to wait until Christmas to find out."
