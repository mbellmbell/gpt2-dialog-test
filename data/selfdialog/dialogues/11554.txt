"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey are you excited that its almost time for the NFL season to start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, July is the last month there isnt any football on for the rest of the year, I think!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, what is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine is the Green Bay Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are pretty good, I am partial to the Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must be difficult."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, believe me, it seems like they destroy everything good they touch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, whatever happened to RG3?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was injured like every 5 minutes and then left for the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns? Thats like the Titanic of the NFL, there's no escape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it. If I were Kirk Cousins I would be planning my escape 24/7."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does that one guy who everyone hates still own the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Daniel Snyder? You bet, he's micromanaging the team into oblivion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How's the new coach working out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's pretty good, he's the brother of the guy on Monday Night Football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I like him, Jon Gruden?"

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm hopeful we can win the Super Bowl."
