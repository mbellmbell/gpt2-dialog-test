"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite activity to do to music."
"__MUSIC__ You might not have heard of it, but I love Dance Dance Revolution."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's an arcade rhythm and beat game where you use your feet to hit arrows that are synchronized to the beat of a song. It's like a dancing game."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I've seen that. A huge metal machine with arrows flying on the screen."
"__MUSIC__ Yep that's it. It's really fun and great exercise."
"__MUSIC__ I bet. Are you good at it?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually compete in DDR competitions."
"__MUSIC__ Wow that's crazy. What's your favorite part about DDR?"
"__MUSIC__ The music. I love all of the pop, dancy, techno music on DDR."
"__MUSIC__ There must be some crazy stuff on that."
"__MUSIC__ Especially since it's a Japanese company Konami, that makes the game."
"__MUSIC__ Are all the songs in Japanese?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they're in English actually, but they have an Asian feel to them."
"__MUSIC__ I never would have guessed you liked music with an Asian feel."
"__MUSIC__ Hey! I like to dance to music with an Asian feel."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny to hear."
"__MUSIC__ You should try to play DDR with me sometime"
"__MUSIC__ Oh no! I'll be horrrible."
"__MUSIC__ Trust me. It's good exercise and it's fun."
