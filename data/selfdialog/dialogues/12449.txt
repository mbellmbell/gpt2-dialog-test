"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are they going to do about the Pro Bowl, man?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it used to be a good game, you know?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember watching a few years ago and they were taking it so easy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was kind of a laugh until that one play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I remember that, when the defensive line really went at it..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the offensive line was just standing there getting smack."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then they finally started to play some football. Remember?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was kind of funny, I thought."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand them not wanting to get hurt but it used to be a real game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you wouldn't want to blow out a knee in the Pro Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I wouldn't want to end my $100 million dollar career on a name that doesn't really mean anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not like the All Star game in baseball though. Nothing's riding on it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wonder if they could do anything about that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First possession in the Super Bowl for the conference that wins the Pro Bowl maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that's something but not really much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet if they paid them better even that wouldn't make a difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to agree with you there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Pro Bowl's kind of like preseason but your job's not on the line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good way of thinking of it. Never occurred to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I only just now thought of it."
