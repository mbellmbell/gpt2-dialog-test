"__MOVIES__ Which is the best Back to the Future?"
"__MOVIES__ Tough question.  My favorite is 2, but would I like it so much without the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ So, part of why you like it so much is because it calls back to the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  What is the best Karate Kid movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I could pick between the first and second one.  Both are really good.  Do you know what I don't get?  Why Ghostbusters 2 gets so much hate."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought it was just as good as the first one, and in some cases better.  I love Jackie Wilson."
"__MOVIES__ What are some other movies with good soundtracks?"
"__MOVIES__ I love the soundtrack from both Guardians of the Galaxy movies."
"__MOVIES__ Both excellent soundtracks.  I really like the soundtrack from Blow."
"__MOVIES__ That one has some good tunes.  I like soundtrack from Reservoir Dogs."
"__MOVIES__ Another good one-- who will ever forget Stuck in the Middle with You during that scene with Michael Madsen?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like the Grease soundtrack, which is a musical, so the music had better be good."
"__MOVIES__ The soundtrack from Almost Famous is absolutely amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, and on that note, Across the Universe's soundtrack is great."
"__MOVIES__ I really like the music in Boogie Nights, too."
"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite song in a film scene moment?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like in Revenge of the Nerds when We are the Champions starts playing at the end.  You?"
"__MOVIES__ In Rocky 2, when Adrian tells Rocky to win for her, and the bell rings to start the training montage."
"__MOVIES__ The right music choices can make a good movie great."
"__MOVIES__ Totally agree with you on that."
