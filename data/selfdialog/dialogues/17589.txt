"__MOVIES__ Hi there how are you today?"
"__MOVIES__ I am well thanks.  What's up?"
"__MOVIES__ I was wondering if you would like to go to the movies tonight with me?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I have nothing else going on.  What do you have in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I wanted to go see the movie The Great Wall, with Matt Damon in it.  Have you seen the previews for it?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that yet, but it looks good.  It has creatures in it , right, and the China wall?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think it looks entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ I think Matt Damon plays the one that turns his life around and helps defend the Great Wall and people against those creatures."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, how about 7pm showing at the Mall?"
"__MOVIES__ I think 9:30pm would be better, I have to run some errands first."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I will pick you up at 9 then!"
"__MOVIES__ Thanks so much! Was there any other movie we could watch just in case that one is full?"
"__MOVIES__ Alien Covenant will be on around that time too.  Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that one either.  Sci Fi too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I would see that as well."
"__MOVIES__ Alien Covenant has better ratings than the other movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you want to go to Alien covenant instead?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, let's go to Alien Covenant instead, and see the show at 9:30pm."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, sounds good.  See you at 9pm then."
"__MOVIES__ See you!"
