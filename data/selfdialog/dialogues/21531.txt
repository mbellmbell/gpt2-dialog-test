"__DISNEY__ Did you go and see the new live action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I did, it was amazing."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. What was your favorite part?"
"__DISNEY__ It has to be the music."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. All the dancing and singing parts were done so well."
"__DISNEY__ The costumes in all of those scenes were insane! I loved them so much."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I did too. Dan Stevens as the Beast was incredible. His costume was by far the best."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, but we can't forget about Gaston."
"__DISNEY__ You're right. Luke Evans as Gaston was really cool."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, and so was Emma Watson as Belle. I love her as an actress."
