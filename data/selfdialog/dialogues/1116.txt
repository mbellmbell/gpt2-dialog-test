"__MUSIC__ Do you remember that country music duo, Joey + Rory, and the wife Joey died of cancer?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, there were articles all the time online keeping up with her struggle."
"__MUSIC__ It was really sad. I remember feeling so bad for their little daughter who was so small."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you ask?"
"__MUSIC__ I read something today about how the husband, Rory, is going back onstage for the first time since she died."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that must be really hard for him."
"__MUSIC__ He's doing it to help raise money for a charity that helped them when his wife was sick."
"__MUSIC__ That's really nice! What's the charity?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Music Health Alliance. He said they had a lot of bills when her cancer came back, and the charity helped them with it."
"__MUSIC__ Even when people have insurance, some stuff doesn't get covered."
"__MUSIC__ Plus they were a duo, and he couldn't work by himself because he had to take care of her and their little daughter."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad there was a charity to help them."
"__MUSIC__ He said he really wanted to help the charity because they had helped him so much."
"__MUSIC__ I bet it's going to be hard though singing by himself."
"__MUSIC__ He said he should do it so he can find out what he would do alone on stage, and what the future will be for him."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine he needs to get back to work and make money, and he's going to have to decide if he wants to sing solo or find a new career."
"__MUSIC__ He has a three year old daughter who has Down's syndrome, so he's going to have to figure out how to support him and her."
"__MUSIC__ It must be tough for the little girl, losing her mom at such a young age."
"__MUSIC__ After Joey died, their hymns album won a Grammy. Maybe he could do a tribute album for her."
"__MUSIC__ That would be a really nice thing to do, and it might be therapeutic for him."
