"__STAR_WARS__ Why was Poe Dameron so absent in The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He shows up early on, and then when Finn escapes, and then disappears until near the end of the movie!"
"__STAR_WARS__ He comes back in the battle at Maz Kanata's place, and then at Starkiller Base."
"__STAR_WARS__ He shows up for a few minutes each time, though. He didn't get enough screentime."
"__STAR_WARS__ J J Abrams spared the character, actually. He was originally supposed to be killed."
"__STAR_WARS__ So he wasn't intended to be a main character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently not. I'm glad he is, though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because a third protagonist mirrors the Han, Luke, and Leia trifecta of the original series. It fits thematically."
