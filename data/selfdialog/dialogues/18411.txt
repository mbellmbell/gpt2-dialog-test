"__MOVIES__ So, what's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a tough question. Well, a movie I've always really enjoyed and encourage everyone to watch in Cabin in the Woods."
"__MOVIES__ Cabin in the Woods...... I think I've heard of that. Remind me what it's about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about the kids who, well, visit a Cabin in the Woods. And I don't want to spoil it but it's not your average horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Jesse Williams from Grey's Anatomy. Chris Hemsworth."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! I do know that movie, directed by Joss Whedon?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Fun fact, the movie had been finished in like 2009, but it just didn't have the audience really to be released until 2012."
"__MOVIES__ It makes sense, I mean you had to push hard for me to remember it."
"__MOVIES__ It was just so good! You have to watch it. It will literally thwart any and all expectations you have."
"__MOVIES__ Okay I'll watch it since I really do like Joss Whedon. Especially Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog."
"__MOVIES__ Dude! I absolutely love that movie, I know like all the words to the songs!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too, and I think that's where I fell in love with Neil Patrick Harris, i.e. Dr. Horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he plays a really good bad guy. You know that movie was written in reaction to the writer's strike?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? That makes sense seeing as how it followed no rules."
"__MOVIES__ True. Did you like Avengers once Joss Whedon signed on?"
"__MOVIES__ Joss Whedon did Avengers!? No wonder I liked it so much."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was really good! And I don't even usually like superhero movies but this whole Marvel universe has sucked me in."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, and the new Black Panther movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh don't even get me started."
