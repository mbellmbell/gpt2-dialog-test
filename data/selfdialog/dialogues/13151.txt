"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, how do you feel about the upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kind of depressed, actually!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Jets fan and I feel like we don't have any of our long-time guys anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's true. Who did you lose?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We got rid of Mangold, Harris, Decker, and Marshall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's rough.  Didn't Marshall go to the Giants, too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, which makes it even worse.  I'm happy for him though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He seems like a good guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I like that he took a stand a few years ago and wore the green cleats for mental health awareness."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is there any chance that any of the other AFC East teams knock off the Pats?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not, but we'll see how Tannehill comes back from injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dolphins are always a little bit better than they should be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the Bills are always a little bit worse than they should be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It honestly has not been fair for over a decade with Bellichick and Brady running the show."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I think it might be more Bellichick than Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well when Brady is hurt or suspended they continue to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Pats won't lose the East until they're both gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably true."
