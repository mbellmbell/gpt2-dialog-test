"__BEATLES__ Have you heard Let it be… Naked?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I'm so glad they put out that album."
"__BEATLES__ I think it's way better than the original Let it Be."
"__BEATLES__ I was thrilled that they included Don't Let Me Down."
"__BEATLES__ Yes! That's one of my favorite Beatles songs ever."
"__BEATLES__ The single version never had the same feel as the version they recorded on the Apple Corps rooftop."
"__BEATLES__ The new version sounds so much better. The album is worth purchasing for that song alone."
"__BEATLES__ I agree. I also really like the new version of Across the Universe."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, but there are so many different versions of that song."
"__BEATLES__ I think the Let it Be… Naked version is my favorite of them all."
