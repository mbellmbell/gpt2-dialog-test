"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Moana?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh I did, it was great! The way the ocean was its own character was fascinating."
"__DISNEY__ I know and the songs are so addictive. I've been singing 'You're Welcome' since I saw it."
"__DISNEY__ I know me too! It's almost as bad as Let it Go."
"__DISNEY__ Almost. I had that song stuck in my head for weeks."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know it was The Rock Dwayne Johnson doing the voice of Maui?"
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know that until after I saw it. He has a pretty decent singing voice."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah who would have thought it? I loved him in CIA Central Intelligence."
"__DISNEY__ He was actually pretty funny in that, him and Kevin Hart."
"__DISNEY__ The Rock plays equally well doing cute and playful characters as he does playing tough guys."
