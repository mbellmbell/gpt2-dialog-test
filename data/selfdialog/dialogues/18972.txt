"__MOVIES__ What do you think will be the general plot of Star Wars Episode 8?"
"__MOVIES__ Ooh, good question. There's so many places this can go."
"__MOVIES__ Luke Skywalker better start manning up. He's been a child who runs when he gets emotional."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he pretty much caused the death of billions through his lack of intervention, but throwing it off as everything being part of the force overall."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously, and now he wants to end the Jedi?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure that's what it means. Jedi is singular and plural."
"__MOVIES__ Right, perhaps HE wants to die."
"__MOVIES__ Ooooooh, I like that. Maybe he feels he has turned bad and the way to balance the force is for him to die."
"__MOVIES__ Who do you think Snoke is?"
"__MOVIES__ I've read lots of theories: he's Plagiues, he's Windu."
"__MOVIES__ I have a great theory about who he is."
"__MOVIES__ Really, what's that?"
"__MOVIES__ Supreme Chancellor Snoke is ..."
"__MOVIES__ Yes?"
"__MOVIES__ A guy named Snoke. He's not anyone from the past Star Wars universe. He's just a guy."
"__MOVIES__ While that would be refreshing, the whole saga is about Palpatine manipulating the Skywalker family."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it had something to do with it."
"__MOVIES__ Who do you think Rey's parents are?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Luke and Leia's baby they had together. They kissed... so why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Don't be gross."
