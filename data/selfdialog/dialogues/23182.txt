"__DISNEY__ You saw the live action Beauty and the Beast, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I saw it a couple of weeks ago. It was really good. Why?"
"__DISNEY__ I was wondering how you felt it held up to the original cartoon version?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was a perfect copy of the original! The songs were so beautiful and the characters were all cast perfectly."
"__DISNEY__ Really? It was that good?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, absolutely. Beauty and the Beast was my favorite Disney movie as a kid, and I thought the live action version was amazing."
"__DISNEY__ Wow! And Emma Watson portrayed a good Belle?"
"__DISNEY__ She made the perfect Belle!"
"__DISNEY__ She's one of my favorite actresses, so I didn't want to disappoint myself if I didn't like the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I promise you won't be disappointed."
