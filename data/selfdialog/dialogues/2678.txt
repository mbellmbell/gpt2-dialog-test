"__MUSIC__ So, I checked out the postmodern Jukebox like you told me to."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah? What do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ They're from New York, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. The head arranger guy, Scott Bradlee was a jazz musician there."
"__MUSIC__ Their whole Broadway vibe is unmistakable."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, and to have that many singers and musicians with exactly same skill sets, it can only be done in New York"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. They're all probably Broadway or off-Broadway performers."
"__MUSIC__ Super talented, well educated. That blonde singer went to Julliard and studied Opera"
"__MUSIC__ Morgan James. I love her."
"__MUSIC__ Yep."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe she couldn't hack it as an Opera singer. That's some hard work..."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but she's great at Jazz, so why not do it?"
"__MUSIC__ Her body language is so poised and so well rehearsed. I always wondered if she had a formal education..."
"__MUSIC__ My honest guess is that most of them have bachelor's in music from some college somewhere."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Just the sheer command of the instruments. Not just being able to play some tunes, but many with varying styles is not something you can just pick up and learn."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough."
"__MUSIC__ They're touring. I'm definitely going to see them live."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. We should make it a date"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so we're dating now?"
