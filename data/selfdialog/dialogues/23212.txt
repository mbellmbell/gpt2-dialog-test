"__DISNEY__ Do you want to watch Meet the Robinsons with me?"
"__DISNEY__ I heard that movie wasn't very good."
"__DISNEY__ I enjoyed it. I'm about to watch it for the tenth time."
"__DISNEY__ Doesn't  Adam West voice a character in that one?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, he's Uncle Art's voice actor. Tom Selleck is in it as well."
"__DISNEY__ Tom Selleck? Now I've got to watch it."
"__DISNEY__ It's a very underrated Disney film, if you ask me."
"__DISNEY__ So, what's the plot? Time travel?"
"__DISNEY__ That's part of it. I don't want to spoil everything, though."
"__DISNEY__ Alright, I'll check it out. I love computer animated movies, so this should be decent."
