"__MOVIES__ I'm going to the movies this weekend with my son"
"__MOVIES__ Oh? what are you seeing?"
"__MOVIES__ We were thinking of seeing the new Cars 3D movie or maybe Dispicable me"
"__MOVIES__ Is everything playing right now a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Seems like it - there's also another Pirates of the Carribean and Transformers!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't go much. Last I saw was at home and it was about Benghazi. That was well done, but pretty horrible"
"__MOVIES__ Didn't that have the guy from the office? How did he do?"
"__MOVIES__ Surprisingly well, actually. His name is John Krasinski."
"__MOVIES__ I think he mostly does comedies, though."
"__MOVIES__ What I really want to see is the new Wonder Woman. It's supposed to be amazing."
"__MOVIES__ It was. I loved it even though Lynda Carter will always be my Wonder Woman!"
"__MOVIES__ How did you like Captain Kirk in as the guy?"
"__MOVIES__ He was fine - it's like his thing. I think your kids are too young to see it, unfortunately."
"__MOVIES__ Anything you can recommend for them since you see a bunch of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it, but there's a Captain Underpants movie"
"__MOVIES__ Those books are hilarous. We're reading them and we're up to the 7th"
"__MOVIES__ the movie has Professor Poopypants and everything"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds fun"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you should also see the new cars?"
"__MOVIES__ They've seen the other two on DVD from the library so that would be great"
