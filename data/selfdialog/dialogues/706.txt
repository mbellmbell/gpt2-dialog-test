"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite classic rock band?"
"__MUSIC__ I think thats a hard question to ask"
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ No one goes out with the intention of being classic rock."
"__MUSIC__ So you think they just end up in the genre?"
"__MUSIC__ No I am saying they get shifted to that once they get older and stop making music."
"__MUSIC__ OK so who in the classic rock rotation right now was the best of all times."
"__MUSIC__ Can I say The Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ You can! But it would lead to an argument from me."
"__MUSIC__ You didnt think they were that good?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they had some great singles but most of their albums were filler."
"__MUSIC__ I have never heard that hot take before."
"__MUSIC__ I would also say Led Zepplin if we are being honest."
"__MUSIC__ I can see where you would come with that."
"__MUSIC__ What about Pink Floyd?"
"__MUSIC__ I never understood their love they get from fans."
"__MUSIC__ I think they just know what they were doing"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like you needed to be on drugs to listen to them"
"__MUSIC__ I am sure when people listen to dark side of the moon they were on them"
"__MUSIC__ But they did write some incredible long tracks"
