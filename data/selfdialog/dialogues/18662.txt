"__MOVIES__ Do you watch sports movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Occasionally. It's not my favorite but they can be enjoyable. Why do you ask?"
"__MOVIES__ What're your top movies?"
"__MOVIES__ It's complicated. I loved Moneyball as a baseball fan, but there's one surprising movie that WOULD be my favorite if they had the right ending."
"__MOVIES__ Which is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story."
"__MOVIES__ YOU liked THAT? You hate Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughan!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I know, but it's set up perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ What did you mean 'If the end was right?'"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know how the good guys win in the end?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a feel-good ending."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's not what was supposed to happen."
"__MOVIES__ What was?"
"__MOVIES__ Ben Stiller said the original ending, and what's in the end credits, is that the bad guys end up winning as it's more realistic."
"__MOVIES__ That'd be a slap in the face and audiences wouldn't like it."
"__MOVIES__ That's what the studio figures, but I don't buy it. We can handle the bad guys winning."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like in the original Rocky."
"__MOVIES__ See? And it won Best Picture!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree with Moneyball, especially with Jonah Hill."
"__MOVIES__ Too bad that's the only movie he can act in properly."
