"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really need studying advice."
"__MUSIC__ What's the test on, specifically?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's a listening test."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, those are rough."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, know how everyone thinks they all sound the same?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, haha."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's true. My school got rid of comprehensive music history tests because no one could pass the listening exam."
"__MUSIC__ So how do I do it?"
"__MUSIC__ First off, it's only on a few composers, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ Listen for the language."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ If it's in Latin it's a mass. If it's Italian it's Monteverdi.If it's French..."
