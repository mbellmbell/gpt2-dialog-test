"__BASKETBALL__ Did you watch the Lakers and Celtics game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah! The Celts really stuck it to them!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I wonder what Kobe was thinking at the end of the game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably something like 'get me outta here, this is awful!'"
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably so! What do you think the chance is for the Celtics to go all the way this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think if Pierce and Rondo stay healthy, there's a good chance."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'll be keeping my fingers crossed. I'd love to see it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too! We should totally have a watch party when the playoffs start."
"__BASKETBALL__ Absolutely! We would have fun doing our own game analysis."
"__BASKETBALL__ Definitely! I love looking at how teams call plays."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think is the best rebounder the Celtics have?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably Pierce, even though he's not a big guy."
"__BASKETBALL__ What's the big goofy guy's name, who's always awkward handling the ball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ You know, I can't remember."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hmm. Okay. What do you think about Lebron this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he's doing well, but he's a little overrated this time around."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do you say Lebron is overrated this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He just hasn't put up the scoring numbers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Fair enough. Do you think he'll ever be considered as good as Michael Jordan?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No way! Michael Jordan will always be the greatest!"
