"__MOVIES__ I think I am going to watch the Ghostbusters movies tonight. Have you ever seen them?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love them. Bill Murray cracks me up."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he is good. I think he is way underrated."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new remake with Melissa McCarthy?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't seen it yet, was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I was a little weary of it at first but after I watched it I feel in love with it."
"__MOVIES__ How close does it compare to the original?"
"__MOVIES__ Some things are the same and some are different. Melissa McCarthy is awesome in it though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I like her pretty good. Have you ever seen The Heat with her and Sandra Bullock?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Me to. I so wish they would make a part two to that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I definitely agree. I think those two have a great dynamic with one another."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I found myself laughing throughout the entire movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was extremely funny but a little over the top with all the curse words."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I was pretty shocked with all of those at first."
"__MOVIES__ Overall it was a good movie though. It is one that I could watch over and over again."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah me to. She tends to have that affect on me to where I could watch any of her movies over and over."
"__MOVIES__ What other movies of hers do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like Tammy, Identity Thief, Spy, and The Boss."
"__MOVIES__ The Boss was awesome. She played her character very well"
