"__DISNEY__ I think that the romance in Lady and the Tramp is the best Disney love story of all time."
"__DISNEY__ You mean the best Disney relationship is between two dogs?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! The way they give each other puppy dog eyes. It kills me."
"__DISNEY__ They are awfully charming."
"__DISNEY__ And the way they share that meal. It just touches my heart."
"__DISNEY__ A romantic dinner will do that to a person."
"__DISNEY__ Lady is so demure. And then she embraces the Tramp with all of his unruliness."
"__DISNEY__ It's a special kind of unconditional love."
"__DISNEY__ We should all aspire to find the Lady to our Tramp."
"__DISNEY__ Or the Tramp to our Lady."
