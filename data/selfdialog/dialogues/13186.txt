"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for some football!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all with the way my Jets are poised."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think they are going to do? I can't see them winning more than 3-4 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know and that doesn't put us in the best place for next years draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You guys desperately need a quarter back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think? Hackenberg is a bum."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but you don't have any other options. It would be best if they just lost every game this year to get a good pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are some great quarterbacks poised to come out of the draft next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sam Darnold may be NFL ready and if you guys land him you might be poised for a winning season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Your right! Same thing with Rosen. He might be NFL ready also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There's no guarantee though. How do you ask professional athletes to purposely tank a season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't it's not going to happen. They're going to try to win as they should, but it's not going to put us in a good position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they're not Cleaveland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might as well be the Browns, I wouldn't be surprised if we lost to them this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well anything can happen. Maybe Hackenberg can turn things around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. We got rid of almost every player that helped us get close to the post season in 2015."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hope Hackenberg has a better year, and that talented defensive back field is conditioned."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I have a feeling they are going to spend a lot of time on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They better start running sprints now or you guys are going to get scored on in the second half all year long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it."
