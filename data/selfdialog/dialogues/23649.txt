"__DISNEY__ Are we still watching Disney movies tonight when everyone comes over?"
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely! I've got several of them picked out, so we've got plenty to choose from."
"__DISNEY__ Cool, what have you gotten for tonight?"
"__DISNEY__ I've got The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Mulan, Frozen, The Princess and the Frog, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, that's quite the list."
"__DISNEY__ Yep! I know everyone won't be here long enough to watch more than two or three, so I wanted a big enough list to choose from."
"__DISNEY__ Well, you've definitely succeeded on that."
"__DISNEY__ I hope so. I've also got some Disney themed snacks. Gummy frogs, apple bites, 'glass' candy, gummy fish, little swords for the sandwiches, and some ice cream, too."
"__DISNEY__ Well it all sounds amazing to me!"
"__DISNEY__ Thanks! I really hope the Disney night is a success."
