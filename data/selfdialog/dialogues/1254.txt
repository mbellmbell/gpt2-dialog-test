"__MUSIC__ Well it has happened before."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Justin Bieber is a really good example of that."
"__MUSIC__ He was only twelve years old when he first started posting them."

"__MUSIC__ How about Cody Simpson?"
"__MUSIC__ He got his start on YouTube?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ And don't forget about Susan Boyle."
