"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you hoping to see some quality football this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I most certainly am.  Football season is about the only time I watch television anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you rooting for any specific teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, but mostly I just want to enjoy some great competition."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't leave me hanging, which team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Seahawks, but I won't be disappointed if a number of teams are successful this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're more of a fan of the sport than a specific team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure.  I really like physical competition and the nature of football creates a lot of physical engagement, suspense, drama, and glory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you like about the Seahawks then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like their style of play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean running the football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think running the football is one of the most effective strategies when combined with a strong defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And having that amazing stadium certainly helps that defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does and it's also an amazing experience to be in that stadium when it's loud."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  I've been to one of their games and even though it was preseason I was thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle really is a football city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably why their attempts to bring back a basketball team have failed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't help when those teams have historically under performed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully Seattle will have a good, injury free season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And some better offensive linemen."
