"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does your wife thinking you watching football all day Sunday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh she doesn't seem to mind she is a casual fan herself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean by a casual fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well she might warch a few mintues of the game and the go to something else."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well of course she does since you live in Seattle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For some reason we have a lot of Oaklands fans her too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't understand that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either I mean Oakland hasn't even been that good before last  year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what chance do you think the Seahawks have this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have a good chance as long as Russell Wilson stays healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, but will stay healthy if the Offensive line doesn't protect him better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That my friend is the million dollar question."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I hope so I would hate to see him get taken out because they Seahawks woudn't put together a good offensice line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding; it has been a weakness for years you think they would fix it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Seahawks wouldn't make do you have another team you watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really though since i was born in Indianapolis I do kinda cheer for them."
