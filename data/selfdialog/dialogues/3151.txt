"__MUSIC__ Hi there, do you know anything about dance music?"
"__MUSIC__ A little, why?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm helping to pick songs for a wedding reception and need ideas."
"__MUSIC__ What do you have so far?"
"__MUSIC__ We hired a DJ and need to pick the songs now. I suggested we start with Holiday by Madonna."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that should get them dancing. What else are you thinking?"
"__MUSIC__ We want a mix of styles and periods, and for people to dance."
"__MUSIC__ With a wedding its a mixed group of people."
"__MUSIC__ So for the oldtimers, maybe Its a Wonderful World."
"__MUSIC__ Right! I like that."
"__MUSIC__ And a little Nat King Cole."
"__MUSIC__ Good, good."
"__MUSIC__ Also, Aerosmith, Don't Want to Miss a Thing -another slow, romantic one."
"__MUSIC__ I like that.  And more modern?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought maybe one Bruno Mars."
"__MUSIC__ He's romantic."
"__MUSIC__ And then maybe a funny one."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ When I'm 64, by the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ That's a sweet touch."
