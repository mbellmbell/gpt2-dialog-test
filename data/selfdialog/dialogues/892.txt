"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ Not too much but I've definitely heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they are one of my favorite metal bands.  Their music is great!"
"__MUSIC__ Are they still around?  I thought they were kinda old."
"__MUSIC__ Well they came out in 1981 so they have been around awhile.  But believe it or not they just released a new album in 2016."
"__MUSIC__ Really, what was it called?"
"__MUSIC__ Hardwired...To Self Destruct.  It's crazy to think they've been making music for thirty six years."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that is a long time.  So what songs do you like best?"
"__MUSIC__ I listen to their original stuff from their Metallica album or And Justice for All the most probably."
"__MUSIC__ That's the older stuff, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  You've probably heard the song One or Sad But True."
"__MUSIC__ I know I've heard Sad But True.  Everyone's heard that song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was one of their most famous.  But even in 2003 their album hit the Billboard number one spot."
"__MUSIC__ That's crazy a band can continue being so popular for so long."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's because they have a devoted fan base.  They've been really controversial over time though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I've heard about a lot of that.  I think it's the thrash metal image."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it can be offensive to some people.  I think their music is spectacular though regardless of their image."
"__MUSIC__ Who's the lead singer?"
"__MUSIC__ Hetfield and Ulrich are the founding members."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I've definitely heard of Ulrich."
