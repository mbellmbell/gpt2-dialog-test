"__POP__ what pop music do you think is the best for a work out?"
"__POP__ bruno mars!"
"__POP__ okay, aside from bruno mars. he's overplayed"
"__POP__ a little. okay, i guess the chainsmokers are pretty good. very upbeat"
"__POP__ upbeat is good for a work out, but they're not quite my thing"
"__POP__ not even roses?"
"__POP__ nah. that song is pretty good, but not for a work out!"
"__POP__ honestly, i listen to the killers when i work out."
"__POP__ what? how?!"
"__POP__ i don't know! pop rock pumps me up more than just pop"
