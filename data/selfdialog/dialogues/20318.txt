"__MOVIES__ Have you see Get Out?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet -- that's the one by Jordan Peele, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's really good. Creepy."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Keanu. Did you see that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was hilarious. I cant believe they made a movie about that."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, it was a pretty ridiculous premise for a movie."
"__MOVIES__ I finally watched Sleepwalk with Me, the one that won the Sundance Audience award."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I heard about that. It's with the stand-up comedian, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Mike Birbiglia. It was good, but I like comedies with stand-up comedians in them in general."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, like Half Baked?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That's a classic. Dave Chappelle was perfect in that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, has he been in any other movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he was in Undercover Brother."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I saw that. It was ok. Denise Richards was good in it."
"__MOVIES__ Not as good as she was in Wild Things!"
"__MOVIES__ I never saw that, but I heard about it. You seen the new Transformers yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I heard it was awful though. And Megan Fox isn't in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was kind of a bummer of a movie. I'm going to see Wonder Woman next week."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I think I'm going to see Megan Leavey, because I love dogs and used to train them to do scent work."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I heard that Megan Leavey was really good. My friend said she cried when she watched it."
