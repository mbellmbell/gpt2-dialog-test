"__MOVIES__ Hey I hear the new Aliens movie is out."
"__MOVIES__ I think it came out last weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Its supposed to be pretty good.  Some flaws."
"__MOVIES__ That director is like that.  Slow with pacing a story."
"__MOVIES__ He's still a good director."
"__MOVIES__ Will you go see it?"
"__MOVIES__ If I can get a group together."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's a film that would be best on a big screen."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the last one, Prometheus?"
"__MOVIES__ I did.  That was different."
"__MOVIES__ Different how?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, new worlds, engineers, DNA, and the making of aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Gotcha.  Pure sci fi stuff though."
"__MOVIES__ That's true.  Just so different from the other Alien movies."
"__MOVIES__ Those other ones are old school now, but classics."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked those old ones...so scary."
"__MOVIES__ Prometheus was scary too."
"__MOVIES__ And really cutting edge."
"__MOVIES__ I want to go see this new film really badly."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me how it goes.  I'll try to get out there."
