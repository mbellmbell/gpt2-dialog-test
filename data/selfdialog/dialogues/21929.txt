"__DISNEY__ Every time I eat stick pretzels, it makes me think about The Great Mouse Detective."
"__DISNEY__ The disney film? How come?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it came out when I was little and I remember a friend and I watched it and pretended that the pretzels were pipes like Basil had."
"__DISNEY__ Oh dear, that wouldn't fly these days!"
"__DISNEY__ I suppose not, but I always loved that movie. The end was so intense!"
"__DISNEY__ The part where Ratigan went all rabid, you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and Basil and him fell off the clock tower."
"__DISNEY__ I was so scared he'd actually died as a kid!"
"__DISNEY__ Basil was my absolute favourite character growing up; I loved how smart he was."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, though watching it now I have to laugh at how silly some of the lines are!"
