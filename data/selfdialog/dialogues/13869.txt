"__BASKETBALL__ Free throw shooting is terrible in the league anymore"
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do you think that happened"
"__BASKETBALL__ Guys dont care about shooting"
"__BASKETBALL__ That cant be true"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sure it is, look how many guys just drive the lane"
"__BASKETBALL__ Then you have guys like Steph Curry"
"__BASKETBALL__ OK and thats one guy"
"__BASKETBALL__ I see where you are trying to corner me"
"__BASKETBALL__ Not that, its just hes one example out of 150 you can come up with."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well its important to know theres no way guys cant shoot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Teams are always searching for shooters."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Sixers are example one of that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they need a scorer but more importantly a scoring guard"
"__BASKETBALL__ I have seen Embiid throw up 3s"
"__BASKETBALL__ I am sure the team hates that"
"__BASKETBALL__ He can get back on defense quicker"
"__BASKETBALL__ But then you have your guards trying to rebound."
"__BASKETBALL__ If theres a better method tell me"
"__BASKETBALL__ Thats not what I am here to do."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well the NBA needs better shooters I can say that"
