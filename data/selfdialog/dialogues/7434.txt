"__LADY_GAGA__ Because her songs are so boring, like Bad Romance is just another pop song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What about Born this way?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ What about it"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Doesn't it make you feel like strutting down a walkway like a dork?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ ...Kinda"
"__LADY_GAGA__ So you do like Lady Gaga then"
"__LADY_GAGA__ YES I DO but don't tell my wife."
