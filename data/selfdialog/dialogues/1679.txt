"__MUSIC__ Hey. How was your date last night?"
"__MUSIC__ It was horrible. My date seemed to forget that I exist."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean? Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, my date was obsessed with Selena Gomez. Apparently he is in love with her music."
"__MUSIC__ Selena Gomez?! You're thirty-nine years old!"
"__MUSIC__ I know that! What is your point?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Selena Gomez's music is followed by tween's. How old was your date? Twelve?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh stop it. He was thirty-six."
"__MUSIC__ He was thirty-six and obsessed with Selena Gomez?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! When he picked me up, he was wearing a Selena Gomez t-shirt."
"__MUSIC__ Are you pulling my leg?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. Once we got in the car he started listening to songs that Selena Gomez sings and telling me how much he loved her."
"__MUSIC__ Why would you even consider going on the date with him if he showed up wearing a Selena Gomez t-shirt?"
"__MUSIC__ Because he was cute!"
"__MUSIC__ Listening to Selena Gomez at thirty-six is not cute, especially if you're a male!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Which is why we are not going on a second date."
"__MUSIC__ Well, did he ask you for a second date?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup. He wanted to take me to a Selena Gomez concert."
"__MUSIC__ You both would have stood out like a sore thumb in that crowd."
"__MUSIC__ I know! We would have been old enough to be the parents of all the tween's!"
