"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Django Unchained?"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Leonardo DiCaprio in that? Wasn't he some plantation land-owner in the South?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Well, Hateful Eight is supposed to be the sequel to Django Unchained."
"__MOVIES__ Really? The preview seemed different from Django Unchained."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I mean. I watched a commentary that Tarantino did, and he said that somehow the original script for Hateful Eight was leaked and he changed his mind on the entire script."
"__MOVIES__ So its not a sequel to Django Unchained?"
"__MOVIES__ No its not."
"__MOVIES__ So why did you say it was a sequel if its not a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Because it was supposed to be a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ But its not a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Why do you keep asking me that? I just told you its not a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Because you said it was a sequel to Django Unchained!"
"__MOVIES__ Ugh.... No I didn't! I said it was supposed to be a sequel!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think Samuel Jackson is that good of an actor anyway. I think Morgan Freeman is a much better actor."
"__MOVIES__ Morgan Freeman is so over-rated. He acts the same way in all of his movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that Stephen King wrote Shawshank Redemption?"
"__MOVIES__ Shawshank Redemption? Where did that come from? And we're not talking about Stephen King movies, and I thought Stephen King only did sci-fi or horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ I would think if I was in Andy Dufresne's shoes that would be horror."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah? Well, what Stephen King novel is it based off of, then?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, its based off of his short story called Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Google it if you don't believe me."
