"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is rap and hip-hop the same thing?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not at all. They are related but not the same."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How so?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Rap is a genre of music characterized by spoken word sprinkled rhythmically over a beat. Hip-hop is a culture that involves rap."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ A music culture right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes, but not only is hip hop considered music, it's a state of mind, okay. The way you dress, talk, party, emote, all of it is hip-hop."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So I can be hip-hop without a single song playing. Like, in total silence."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly. Rap, however can't exist without a beat and lyrics."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So if I'm wearing Phat Farm clothing in total silence, I can be hip-hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right, but you can't rap until you open your mouth and spit some bars over a beat."
