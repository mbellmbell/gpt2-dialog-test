"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened to the Bengals last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Half of their receivers left. AJ Green was hurt most of the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really shows you what kind of impact big playmakers have on success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most definitely, big play ability is what makes most good teams good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is Dalton the future?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. I am starting to have doubts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about McCarron?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a good game manager but without multiple big time weapons around him I don't see him producing big numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The defense is almost good enough to make up for that though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Almost is not good enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah,  you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Burfict and Jones miss a few games a year because of this malfeasance or that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why can't the Bengals get that squashed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no idea bro.. But it's every single year and it's frustrating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With a basically healthy and full defensive roster for an entire season could they get it done?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With some of the new draft additions and a healthy tight end position I say yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tough to be a Bengals fan when they are in the playoffs most years but can't win a playoff game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, the wildcard game against Pittsburgh two years ago about ended my fandom."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel ya', and it was Burfict and Jones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the Who Deys could clean it up just a little more they would achieve playoff success."
