"__BASEBALL__ Did you see what the Phillies did yesterday?"
"__BASEBALL__ What was it?"
"__BASEBALL__ They extended their manager."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh wow thats a surprise."
"__BASEBALL__ Who does it on May 11th?"
"__BASEBALL__ I guess a team who is struggling with their identity."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I presume he wants to show that the manager will be here for awhile."
"__BASEBALL__ Or wants to show stability in the franchise for upcoming free agents."
"__BASEBALL__ No one cares about that anymore."
"__BASEBALL__ It is all about the money but some guys want to win."
"__BASEBALL__ I dont think Philly is luring those free agents for awhile yet."
"__BASEBALL__ True, they look like they will be contenders soon."
"__BASEBALL__ I dont think so, but back to the extension."
"__BASEBALL__ You cant fire a guy who has been given nothing"
"__BASEBALL__ I agree but they could have waited a few months."
"__BASEBALL__ No I think they want to establish trust."
"__BASEBALL__ Could be but this guy looks over his head."
"__BASEBALL__ He has been given no talent"
"__BASEBALL__ Thats not true, they have Herrera."
"__BASEBALL__ I dont know about that he looks terrible."
