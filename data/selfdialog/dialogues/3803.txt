"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to any Belle and Sebastian?"
"__MUSIC__ Can't say I have, are they a duo?"
"__MUSIC__ No they're a Scottish indie band, they're pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Why are they called that if there's more than two people? That's silly."
"__MUSIC__ I think they're named after a French something, a kids' book maybe?"
"__MUSIC__ Bit of a weird name if you ask me."
"__MUSIC__ Forget the name, listen to the music!"
"__MUSIC__ Woah, it looks like they've recorded a bunch of stuff. Where do I even start?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, 'If You're Feeling Sinister' is their most famous album, and the track of the same name is probably a good intro."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I'll give that a listen."
"__MUSIC__ But it depends what you're into"
"__MUSIC__ Just anything interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you should try 'Electronic Renaissance' then."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ A track from their first album, 'Tigermilk'. It's a bit quirky."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'll try that."
"__MUSIC__ How do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ I recognise the intro. Is it a remix of something?"
"__MUSIC__ Pachelbel's Canon"
"__MUSIC__ Of course."
