"__STAR_WARS__ The serial escalation in Star Wars is kind of dumb, honestly."
"__STAR_WARS__ What are you referring to?"
"__STAR_WARS__ So, for example, you've got the Death Star, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, what about it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's huge and it blows up planets. Then comes the Death Star II."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that one was even bigger."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, and they followed it up with Starkiller Base. A planet that eats stars and blows up many planets."
"__STAR_WARS__ It does sound a little silly when you put it like that. Maybe in the next one have a solar system sized weapon powered by a black hole."
"__STAR_WARS__ You joke, but the odds that of that happening are higher than you think."
"__STAR_WARS__ Never tell me the odds."
