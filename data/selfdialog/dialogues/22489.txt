"__DISNEY__ Do you ever just think about Disney's classic Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I do actually."
"__DISNEY__ Imagine talking to animals, or thinking that you're talking to animals."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't mind having birds and mice that are tame enough to let me dress them up."
"__DISNEY__ That would be adorable, wouldn't it."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't want to talk to animals if it meant I had to live with that family through most of my adolescence."
"__DISNEY__ That's true but I supposed at the end of it you end up rich and with someone who wants to take you away from it all."
"__DISNEY__ Even then I don't find it worth it."
"__DISNEY__ You know what's really not worth it, those glass shoes. That would hurt!"
"__DISNEY__ No kidding!"
