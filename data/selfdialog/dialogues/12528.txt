"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Tom Brady is a better quarterback now then Joe Montana was?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a huge 49ers fan and a huge Montana fan so it's hard for me to honestly say yes, but I have to say yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking about this the other day and it's hard to argue against Tom Brady being the best quarterback ever now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you really argue against it? He's won 5 Superbowls. He's been Superbowl MVP 4 times. He's been league MVP 2 times. Those are stellar merits."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess the only argument you could make is that he lost Superbowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh don't remind me about the Eli curse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's 7-2 in the Superbowl. So, you have to take into the account of times he's appeared as well as the number of victories."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Joe Montana has won 4 Superbowls and was named Superbowl MVP 3 times. Joe's also 4-0 in the Superbowl. Undefeated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I think that's the argument you could make that Joe Montana is better than Tom Brady but it's hard to overlook Tom's achievements."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard people say that Joe had Jerry Rice so it made life easier for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ While that's true that Joe Montana did have Jerry Rice he also played in an era where quarterbacks weren't protected like they are now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right. You could argue that his career could have been longer if he had the same rules that protect quarterbacks today like Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, I think that's an argument you could have with someone about who's the greatest quarterback of all time when it comes to comparing Brady with Montana."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes for an interesting discussion but I still find it tough to not say Tom Brady is the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There really isn't much of a strong case to be made but it's not beyond debating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you factor in their games and moments, it just seems like Joe has had a lot of classic moments."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is surprising because in today's time with the TV, internet, and social media exposure, I feel we have seen everything Tom Brady has done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ While that's correct, I think all of Tom Brady's highlights on the field don't measure and compare to Joe Montana's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, if we just compare highlights I would say Aaron Rodgers has more impressive highlights than Tom Brady but Tom Brady is overall the better if not the best quarterback of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait to have this debate 10 years from now about who the next great quarterback is to compare with Tom Brady after he retires."
