"__MOVIES__ I just saw the movie the Awakening."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen that. Would did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it, I thought it had a lot of good plot twists."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I was totally confused."
"__MOVIES__ What confused you?"
"__MOVIES__ The guy said the headmistress sent him to hire her, but then it turns out she was dead..."
"__MOVIES__ No, he said the headmaster sent him. And the headmistress wasn't dead, why did you think that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well when she says she thinks she killed the guy and mentions the boy, he says there is no boy and only 3 of them there."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, so how was that confusing?"
"__MOVIES__ Well he said there were only 3. That would be him, her and the guy who attacked her."
"__MOVIES__ No, no, no. He didn't count the guy who attacked her."
"__MOVIES__ Why wouldn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ He was either referring to 3 of them being in the house, or he didn't count the guy because he assumed she had killed him."
"__MOVIES__ I'm still confused."
"__MOVIES__ He introduces her to the headmistress as soon as they arrive: she's totally alive."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Well I was confused in the end, I didn't know who was alive and who was dead."
"__MOVIES__ They made that a little mysterious, but if you're paying attention you realize she is alive because she's leaving and says she'll see him in a week, and can no longer see the ghosts."
"__MOVIES__ But the headmaster didn't see her."
"__MOVIES__ She even makes a joke about him not noticing her, either because he was sort of permanently distracted, or because she was a woman. But it wasn't because she was dead."
"__MOVIES__ I really should re-watch this."
