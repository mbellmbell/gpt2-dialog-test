"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles are going to be so good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh, not sure I'm buying that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about I school you as to why I feel that way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Please, by all means."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well first of, Wentz is going to dominate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything will be better than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was good last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good?  Don't make me laugh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did great for a rookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He dinked and dunked the whole year.  Didn't throw a pass more than ten yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They kept the offense vanilla for him to make it easier."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  I thought he was supposed to be cerebral and smart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is, but it's not easy to learn a NFL playbook."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get that, but you're overestimating him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In any event, I think they can compete for the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe.  Just depends on their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See, I think it depends on the arm of Wentz."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To score points, yes, but they can't give up so many easy TD's again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, their secondary was pretty poor last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will have to see how they fare this year."
