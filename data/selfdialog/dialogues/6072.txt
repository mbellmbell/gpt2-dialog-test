"__STAR_WARS__ So what do you think is the bigger franchise, Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's not even a question is it? It's obviously Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, maybe so, but I'd argue that the public knows just as many Lord of the Ring characters as they do Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha, no way. Name some then."
"__STAR_WARS__ Gandolf, Frodo, Samwise, Gollum, Legolas, Aragorn, Bilbo, and plenty more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, but in Yoda, Vader, the Emperor, Han, Luke, Chewie, Leia, R2D2, C-3P0, and even characters like Tarkin. That's just the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Seems close. If I add in The Hobbit there's a lot more."
"__STAR_WARS__ And then I'd add in the prequels, the sequels, and the spin-off movies. Even characters everyone hates like Jar-Jar people still know."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, yeah, I guess it was kind of dumb to compare them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Look, Lord of the Rings is huge, really it is. But it's no Star Wars."
