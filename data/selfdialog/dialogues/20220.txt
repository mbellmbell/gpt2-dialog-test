"__MOVIES__ Hey what's your favorite comedy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow that's a tough one. I guess I'd have to say The Hangover series."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good choice, I like those too. Zach Galifianakis is a very funny man."
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite part is in The Hangover 3 when he has the romance with Melissa Mcarthy. That was just too hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Why haven't they made a movie together yet? They really need to!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see that one called Identity Thief? Where she was with Jason Bateman?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah it was kind of like a road trip movie. It wasn't too bad!"
"__MOVIES__ And then Zach had the one where he was with Robert Downey Junior. What was that called again?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe it was called Due Date. It had some funny scenes, but also some really gross ones."
"__MOVIES__ That's right I totally forgot about that. Gross humor in movies is good sometimes, but then other times they take it a bit too far."
"__MOVIES__ Who was your favorite character in The Hangover movies? Was it Zach?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually as funny as he was I kind of the guy Chow. I think he really stole the show in his scenes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah he is really funny! When he jumps out of the trunk naked was my favorite part."
"__MOVIES__ I honestly think those movies don't go downhill like a lot of sequels do. They stay funny to me."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the movie The 40 Year old Virgin?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think I did a long time ago. I remember thinking it was really funny."
"__MOVIES__ I watched it recently and remembered how awesome it was. Man Seth Rogan was really hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ I really like him in a lot of movies. I thought he was especially funny in Pineapple Express."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah stoner comedy seems to be his niche, although I like seeing him do some directing and writing as well. He's a really smart guy."
"__MOVIES__ Him and James Franco really are the Cheech and Chong of our generation. I think their stuff will remain timeless."
