"__MOVIES__ hi mate...how's the evening going?"
"__MOVIES__ not bad, though quite boring, Ann has gone to visit her parent's for the weekend."
"__MOVIES__ oh i see, you should knock yourself out with some great movies then ,lolz"
"__MOVIES__ hmm didn't really thought of that, any blockbuster movies you'd suggest i start with this evening? haven't been keeping up of late with new releases."
"__MOVIES__ couple of movies out now that are great, you should check netflix, they've got 'space between us' and 'sleepless'  starring jamie foxx"
"__MOVIES__ oh sleepless i have seen the trailer plus the reviews was bad, some one even said its like the biggest flop of 2017."
"__MOVIES__ on the contrary i 've seen the full movies and it's quite intriguing, i wonder why the bad reviews, I've seen them also."
"__MOVIES__ the trailer never even got me interested to watch, kinda boring."
"__MOVIES__ if 'sleepless' is boring i wonder what you'd say about 'collide'"
"__MOVIES__ hahaha that's is the worse of all, Ann made me waste my money on that movie just because she loves Stacy graff, but after the movie she also complain it was waste of money."
"__MOVIES__ would also add  ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' and ''Baywatch'' on the list of flop movies.... They both bombed pretty bad."
"__MOVIES__ hahaha i saw the trailer for 'Baywatch' and like 'sleepless' i just skipped."
"__MOVIES__ what makes a great movie for you then?"
"__MOVIES__ well it has to be action packed and well thought through story line, sometimes stars starring can lure me to watch.... like i can't see Will Smith on a movie and i don't watch."
"__MOVIES__ talking about Will smith, he's having a new movie out this year were he would be playing Mohammed Ali."
"__MOVIES__ are you serious?"
"__MOVIES__ yeah saw it on the box office weekly magazine."
"__MOVIES__ hmm i would watch out for it then"
"__MOVIES__ so for now what would you rather watch on netfix?"
"__MOVIES__ well let me browse through their recently added and see if any tickle my fancy to while away the night with.lol"
