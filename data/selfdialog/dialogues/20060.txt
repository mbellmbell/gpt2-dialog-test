"__MOVIES__ What were some of the other movies nominated back then?"
"__MOVIES__ I remember Walk the Line was one"
"__MOVIES__ Oh the Johnny Cash one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's it."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked that one. Did Joaquin Phoenix win for that one?"

"__MOVIES__ I thought someone won for Walk The Line."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was Reese Witherspoon"
"__MOVIES__ Oh right. She played Johnny Cash's wife."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, June Carter Cash."
