"__MUSIC__ Do you like psychedelic music?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I am very much into the Grateful Dead and Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ You know what the best Pink Floyd record is? Piper at the Gates of Dawn."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? I haven't actually heard that one."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, you're missing out! It's their most spacey record, if you ask me!"
"__MUSIC__ Is it better than Dark Side of the Moon? Wish You Were Here?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, they were a totally different band back in the late 60s. They actually had a different singer, Syd Barrett."
"__MUSIC__ I had no idea! I've never even heard of Syd Barrett."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he was the leader when they started out. Piper at the Gates of Dawn sounds like a completely different band compared to Dark Side of the Moon."
"__MUSIC__ What happened to Syd, then? Did he just up and quit the band?"
"__MUSIC__ He actually lost his mind and they had to replace him. He became unable to function and had to move in with his mother."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious? So they ended up replacing him because he was insane?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, apparently he had taken too much acid and totally lost touch with reality. That's actually what the band wrote Wish You Were Here about."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa, so it's a song to their own singer saying, 'we miss you'? That's pretty cool, although super sad."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Syd really only got to express himself on that first album, Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Try and find it in mono if you can, because it sounds way better than the stereo mix."
"__MUSIC__ Is it like those Beatles albums, where the band was there to mix them in mono and then the label remixed them in stereo as an afterthought?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. But it's an interesting fact that they recorded Piper at EMI studios, the same place as the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Really, so Abbey Road? Were the two bands recording at the same time?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Piper at the Gates of Dawn came out in '67, and I believe the Beatles were working on Sgt. Pepper next door to them. I think I remember hearing that they visited the Beatles in the studio."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I feel like my entire world has been rocked. I can't believe I've never heard of Syd Barrett or Piper at the Gates of Dawn before!"
