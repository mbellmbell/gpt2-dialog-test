"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey there!  How 'bout them Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about them?  Their 4 defensive players arrested so far this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ LOL.  It is the offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True.  However, they will miss games due to team or league rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  They will be early season games though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably, but remember Dallas has collapsed the past few years late in the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, other than last year, they usually end up playing for the division in the last game of the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On NBC's Sunday Night Football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They lost those games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They didn't make the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Win the division and you're in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lose and you go home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This didn't happen last year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, but Aaron Rodgers picked apart their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he had one of the greatest seasons of all time though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did, but keep in mind that Green Bay lost their receiver and running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a guy with a number in the 80s playing running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that is crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully Dak Prescott will be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might be, but then again, defense may learn how to play him better too."
