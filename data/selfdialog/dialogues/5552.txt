"__STAR_WARS__ I was reading a page of Yoda quotes from Star Wars, and I thought about how true they are today."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda was so cute. What were some of the quotes?"
"__STAR_WARS__ “You must unlearn what you have learned.”"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. Sometimes we learn things that aren't good for us, and we have to learn to forget them."
"__STAR_WARS__ “Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.”"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's especially true of politics and religion."
"__STAR_WARS__ “Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future…the past. Old friends long gone.”"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's what people who believe in Heaven believe will happen to them someday."
"__STAR_WARS__ 'In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is true about how we often in life have a hard time, but using knowledge helps us figure out what to do. Yoda was pretty smart."
