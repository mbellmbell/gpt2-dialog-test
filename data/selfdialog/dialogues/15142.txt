"__ACTION__ Have you seen Terminator 2?"
"__ACTION__ Yes I actually saw it with my dad when it came out in theaters."
"__ACTION__ Wow that was a long time ago. What did you think of it?"
"__ACTION__ I thought it was far better than the first."
"__ACTION__ Right that's because special effects had evolved a lot since the 80's."
"__ACTION__ That's true. What's your favorite scene of the movie?"
"__ACTION__ Definitely the motorcycle and truck chase between Arnold Schwarzenegger and the T-1000."
"__ACTION__ That's my favorite too. Probably one of the greatest chases in history period."
"__ACTION__ I agree. Edward Furlong did a great job for that being his breakout role."
"__ACTION__ He really did. It's too bad we haven't seen him in much since then."
