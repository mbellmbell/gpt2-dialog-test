"__MOVIES__ What do you think about the movie Mean Girls, have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I have, I think is hilarious and one of the best teen movies out there."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I just loved the whole scenario, you can feel like it is all real."
"__MOVIES__ You are so right! Who are the main actresses on the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Lindday Lohan is the main actress and the other mean girls are: Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert. Also featuring Tina Fey."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow! It did have an all star cast. Who was the meanest of the mean girls?"
"__MOVIES__ Without doubt it was Rachel McAdams, she nailed her part."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! You are right, I remember now."
"__MOVIES__ I believe Rachel McAdams has been in several movies after that, do you remember some?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! She became very popular, she was in the Notebook, the Vow, About Time, The Time Traveler´s Wife, Midnight in Paris, Morning Glory. etc."
"__MOVIES__ She has so many. Don´t you think is funny how she did two different movies where her co-star was a time traveling guy."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! You are right, I found this to be very odd. I think I liked About Time more, less sad."
"__MOVIES__ Yes me too!. There is another movie that you did not mention that I really like, is called The Family Stone."
"__MOVIES__ I have not seen it. What is it about? Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh you have to see it, it´s hilarious, it´s about a family and their internal problems, all the kids are all grown up."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see. Who else is in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You have Diane Keaton, Sarah Jessica Parker, Dermot Mulroney, Claire Danes, Luke Wilson, Craig T. Nelson, etc."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow! no wonder it´s good, it has an all star cast!."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it does! Sarah Jessica Parker does a fantastic role in it. Would you like to watch it tomorrow with me?"
"__MOVIES__ You do not have to ask me twice. I´ll bring the popcorn."
