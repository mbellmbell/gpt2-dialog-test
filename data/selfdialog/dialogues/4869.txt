"__MUSIC__ I wonder what's so dfferent about the European culture that led to all these things."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard one theorist saying the Christianity and its inherent nature for the believers ruminate and think deeply on things."
"__MUSIC__ That's  kinda interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Indeed. Our religion forces us to ruminate on everything ioncluding science, knowledge, art and music."
"__MUSIC__ And when we think deeply about anything, it tends to develop fruther."
"__MUSIC__ it indeed does and music is no different, and the musical theories are present in virtually no other cultures. At least not the the extent found in Western art music."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds racist, almost."
"__MUSIC__ It's a fact. A fact is not racist."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, so medieval Europe is where it all began eh?"
"__MUSIC__ In my opinion, yes."
"__MUSIC__ I formed that opinion based on my studies."
"__MUSIC__ You're a mathmatician."
"__MUSIC__ What does that got to do with anything? I also studied music."
"__MUSIC__ and music and math has a lot in common."
"__MUSIC__ They're both rule based and very logical."
"__MUSIC__ Logical until you get to atonal music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, we can't win 'em all."
"__MUSIC__ Who's the most famous atonal music composer, I wonder?"
"__MUSIC__ There are quite a few. Schonberg comes to mind immediately. 5 little piano pieces"
"__MUSIC__ That's a beautiful piece of music. How do people write something like that out of a key? It's amazing to me"
