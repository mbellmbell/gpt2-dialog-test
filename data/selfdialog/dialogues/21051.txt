"__THRILLER__ I watched The Strangers again last night. Couldn't fall asleep for two hours afterward."
"__THRILLER__ Again? I thought that movie terrifies you."
"__THRILLER__ It does, but I love it. I love the whole genre."
"__THRILLER__ I haven't watched The Strangers yet. Should I?"
"__THRILLER__ It's one of the most terrifying movies, in my opinion."
"__THRILLER__ Really? What makes it so scary?"
"__THRILLER__ Because of how realistic it is. I don't have to worry about supernatural forces killing me, but I should worry about home invasions."
"__THRILLER__ That's a good point. Any other similar movies I should check out?"
"__THRILLER__ Funny Games is similar."
"__THRILLER__ I have seen that one. Makes you want to not be nice to strangers who show up at your door."
