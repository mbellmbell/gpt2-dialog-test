"__FASHION__ Ooh, I like your blouse. It's so soft and flowy. And that color is gorgeous on you."
"__FASHION__ Thank you. The blouse is polyester, and the color is Millennial pink."
"__FASHION__ Millennial pink? I think I've heard of that. But we're hardly Millenials, dear."
"__FASHION__ Anyone can wear it, darling. Even you."
"__FASHION__ Thanks, I guess. But it's not really a pink-y pink, is it? It's almost a beige."
"__FASHION__ But not quite. For your information, there are a whole range of Millennial pinks."
"__FASHION__ From sugar sweet to sticky?"
"__FASHION__ No, none  of them is sticky. And each is sweet in its own way."
"__FASHION__ Like you. Why is it called Milennial?"
"__FASHION__ Supposedly because the Millennials, those rising young twerps, prefer this pink to all other shades."
"__FASHION__ All others. Why?"
"__FASHION__ Because, my dear, it's all their own. Also it's grown-up, assertive, and unafraid of its own nature."
"__FASHION__ This color is unafraid?"
"__FASHION__ Well, perhaps those who wear it are. Or perhaps the color itself inspires audacity."
"__FASHION__ But you, sweetheart, are no Millennial. Why are you  wearing this subtle but engaging color?"
"__FASHION__ To show I know that's-what by keeping up with the times. In short, to be in fashion."
"__FASHION__ Being in fashion shows you know what's what?"
"__FASHION__ Yep. how else could I demonstrate that to a total stranger?"
"__FASHION__ Amazing. What a woman you are."
"__FASHION__ Yes I am. But I think this pink is fading. I'm going to get you a beautiful green tie."
