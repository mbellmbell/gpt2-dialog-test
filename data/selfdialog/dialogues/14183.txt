"__HORROR__ What do you think was the best zombie movie of all time?"
"__HORROR__ There's really only one choice.  Night of the Living Dead."
"__HORROR__ For sure.  Even if it's not THE BEST in terms of plot it's actually way up there."
"__HORROR__ It is, not only that it was ground breaking."
"__HORROR__ The way the zombies kept coming, we've never seen that before Night of the Living Dead."
"__HORROR__ And the famous line, they're coming to get you Barbara."
"__HORROR__ I love that line.  One of the best in movie history."
"__HORROR__ One criticism, the consistency could use some work.  Medium zombies, slow zombies, they were all over."
"__HORROR__ Yeah but the plot and acting were great, and give it some slack it was the first of it's kind."
"__HORROR__ Definitely one of the scariest movies ever made."
