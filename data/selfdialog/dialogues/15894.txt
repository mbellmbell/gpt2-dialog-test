"__ROCK__ How many songs can you name from the 1980's?"
"__ROCK__ Hmm, let's see. Well I was a huge Cyndi Lauper fan, so the first song that comes to mind is 'Girls Just Want To Have Fun'."
"__ROCK__ I almost forgot about the crazy costumes and hair do's."
"__ROCK__ Remember 'Boy George' what was the name of the band he was in?"
"__ROCK__ Culture Club, I used to go for walks singing Karma Chameleon."
"__ROCK__ Let's not forget Michael Jackson was breaking out on his own. He had Beat It and the moon walk. So amazing."
"__ROCK__ I never did master the moon walk but I did learn the Thriller dance."
"__ROCK__ That's not something I even want to see, but I could have watched him dance all day long."
"__ROCK__ He was the best. His song were so good. It's a shame he is not still here."
"__ROCK__ I would have loved to see what else he would have done with all of that talent."
