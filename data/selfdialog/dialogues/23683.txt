"__DISNEY__ The kids and I watched Moana today."
"__DISNEY__ How did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ It was really good.  I had no idea Dwayne Johnson sang that well."
"__DISNEY__ I remember he sang really well in The Mysterious Island."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah, with the ukulele!  I'd forgotten that."
"__DISNEY__ I can see why.  It's the berry scene that sticks in my memory."
"__DISNEY__ That's always what I think of first too."
"__DISNEY__ Was Moana worth seeing in the theater?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I think it was.  Even if you have a big television, you can see the artwork better on the movie screen."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe I'll take my kids next week."
