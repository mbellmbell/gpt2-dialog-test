"__MUSIC__ Hey man, what do you think of all these new rappers?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know man, I'm a fan of I guess 'classic' rap."
"__MUSIC__ So you don't listen to Lil Yachty or Kodak Black or X?"
"__MUSIC__ Dude, I almost didn't know you were saying names just now."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, they're really not bad man you should give them a listen."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I mean I'm into like Chance and Yung Thug and Vic Mensa, a bit of Travi$ Scott."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, yeah, I feel that I got them on rotation."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man, but I don't know about those other guys."
"__MUSIC__ Hey man they may dress different and have a slightly different sound than what you call classic rap, but they're good in their own rite, and even when compared."
"__MUSIC__ I don't not believe you man but I get uncomfortable when they dress all hella tight clothes."
"__MUSIC__ Naw, man, that doesn't matter that they dress with tight clothes, they got banging beats, top notch production, sound you haven't heard before."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe they do man, I don't know, I may give them a try."
"__MUSIC__ If you're willing I can put a couple song on right now?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean I guess, just don't put on that 'all my friends are dead song.'"
"__MUSIC__ Hahahaha, sure thing man. You listen to Migos?"
