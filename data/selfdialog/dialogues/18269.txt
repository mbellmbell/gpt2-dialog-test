"__MOVIES__ Did you watch a good movie last weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. I was able to convince my husband to watch Nocturnal Animals."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? I vaguely heard about it."
"__MOVIES__ It's really good. Even my husband actually loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Who made it?"
"__MOVIES__ Tom Ford."
"__MOVIES__ Tom Ford? Like, the fashion designer?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. The guy at some point decided he'd make movies, and he pulled it off."
"__MOVIES__ Really? He's good?"
"__MOVIES__ He's really good. And I saw that he also wrote the script for Nocturnal Animals. The guy is really talented."
"__MOVIES__ So what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a very simple story, really. About a woman who receives in the mail the manuscript of a novel written by her first husband."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? Doesn't sound like there is much in there to make a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's just the beginning, isn't it? It gets hairier because as she reads the novel, we get to see it unfolding onscreen."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a drama?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. Very much so. But the beauty of it is that it's so simple."
"__MOVIES__ Is it slow paced?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really. But it doesn't treat the viewer like a moron you know. It lets you figure things out."
"__MOVIES__ I like that. And who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Amy Adams, fantastic as usual. Jake Gyllenhall, fantastic as well. And a bunch of people I didn't know. but all very good."
