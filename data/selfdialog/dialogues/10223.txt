"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who is the biggest fake rap artist of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are you serious? The Van Winkle fellow Mr. Vanilla Ice."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's one heck of a contractor and carpenter though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You are right about that. I'm sure the dude always knew that he was going to need a plan B."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why did he tell everyone that he was from Miami? Did he think he was being cool?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know. The dude's from Lewisville, Tx........and no knock on Lewisville but there are lots of guys there that are just like him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He should have just rapped about Dallas. Dallas is a really cool town."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's what I'm saying, but I guess he thought Miami was a cooler look or something."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Was Ice Ice Baby his only hit?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Most definitely, and I guarantee you he has performed that song like at least 20,000 times."
