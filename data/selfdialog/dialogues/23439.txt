"__DISNEY__ I think Alice in Wonderland is probably my favourite Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you like Alice in Wonderland best?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I really enjoy all of the Disney movies, but the thing I like most about them is the music, and the songs in Alice in Wonderland are really beautiful."
"__DISNEY__ I think I know what you mean, they are quite simple songs, but they are very pretty."
"__DISNEY__ What is your favourite song from the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I think I like the song, 'All In The Golden Afternoon' best of all."
"__DISNEY__ I like that song best as well. I love how Alice is so tiny, and the flowers singing are giant."
"__DISNEY__ I would love to be like Alice, and shrink to a tiny size, and wander among the beautiful flowers."
"__DISNEY__ In the movie, after the flowers have sung their song, Alice meets the caterpillar."
"__DISNEY__ The caterpillar is very cute, I like his little shoes."
