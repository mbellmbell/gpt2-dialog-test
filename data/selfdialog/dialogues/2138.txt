"__MUSIC__ When do you think it changed?"
"__MUSIC__ Right about the time Garth Books hit it big."

"__MUSIC__ You don't think there are any genuine country artists out there?"
"__MUSIC__ There's a few. Toby Keith comes to mind."

"__MUSIC__ What about Eddie Rabbitt? My favorite song was I Love a Rainy Night."
"__MUSIC__ That was a good song. The one I remember the most was Driving My Life Away."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Toby Keith's cover of Gordon Lightfoot's song Sundown?"
