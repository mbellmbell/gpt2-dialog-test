"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey who is your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha.  They were big rivals in the 70s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  They have meant in 3 Super Bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah.  Steelers won two and the Cowboys won it in the late 90s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems your defense is getting in trouble off the field lately with 4 arrests."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, we keep beating ourselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Romo will come back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I think he is done now that he is in the CBS booth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think so too.  If Zak gets hurt, then they are screwed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, same with Rothlesburger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah hopefully he can stay healthy this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bell always seems to get beat up too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Our defense does too.  Harrison had to come out of retirement to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could out bench the rest of the team when he retired!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is now 39 years old and still playing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is more impressive than Brady being 40 and still playing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is, because he gets hit on every play as a defensive lineman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he is effective too, because I always see him rushing the passer from the outside."
