"__MUSIC__ Do you like the women's music groups from around the 80's?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, but I don't remember many of their names or their songs."
"__MUSIC__ They are my favorite type of music to listen to.  Remember the Bangles?"
"__MUSIC__ I have heard of them.  What songs did they have?"
"__MUSIC__ They had a bunch of hits, I guess the most famous was 'Walk Like an Egyptian'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I remember that song from seeing the video for it oh VH1."
"__MUSIC__ It's an OK song, but my favorite from them is 'Manic Monday'."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good one too, I used to think about that song every Monday when going back to work."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean.  I hate going back to work on Mondays, and that song sums it up nicely."
"__MUSIC__ It made me just now think of Madonna.  She had some songs that kind of had the same sound."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean.  'Into the Groove' and 'Vogue' come to mind!"
"__MUSIC__ She had so many different types of songs.  I like the 80's pop style that went with the songs too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my, like the big hair, and the over used makeup and the gaudy jewelry??"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and the colors of the outfits, and the ratty look of the clothes too.  It was way different."
"__MUSIC__ Madonna was right there as a trend setter for all of that.  Remember 'Like a Virgin'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I used to get embarrassed when that would play and my mom was in the same room."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but I loved dancing to that song."
"__MUSIC__ All of her songs were so good for dancing."
"__MUSIC__ I know, she was probably the best woman pop musician for dancing during the 80's"
"__MUSIC__ I sure can't think of anyone that was better than her.  Her music always had the best beats to them!"
