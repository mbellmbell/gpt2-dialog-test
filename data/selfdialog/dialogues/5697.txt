"__STAR_WARS__ Your dog reminds me of someone."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who?"
"__STAR_WARS__ JarJar Binks...an alien from one of thise Star Trek movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ 'Star Wars' movies. Not 'Star Trek'!"
"__STAR_WARS__ There's a difference?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course there's a difference! Star Trek is a fictional, futuristic space fantasy about the crew of the starship enterprise, the crew's adventures in space, the wild and wacky alien enemies, and saving the galaxy!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Are saying that Star Wars is not a futuristic fictional space adventure, that there's no space ship, no crew, no enemies or wacky villians, and no thrilling fantasy space adventures?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, it has all that too."
"__STAR_WARS__ So what's the differnce?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Different part of space..I think..."
