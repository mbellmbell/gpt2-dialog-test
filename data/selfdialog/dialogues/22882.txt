"__DISNEY__ Do you remember that Disney movie we went to see a couple years ago, Inside Out, about the little girl with the five emotions?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that was a pretty good movie."
"__DISNEY__ I just read a news article about how Disney is being sued for stealing someone elses idea for the movie."
"__DISNEY__ It's hard to believe Disney, which makes wholesome products, would be so unethical."
"__DISNEY__ I know, but this woman is a child development specialist, and she supposedly had several meetings with the Disney people about her idea, and then they stole it."
"__DISNEY__ Is it possible her idea was just something similar, but not like the movie they made?"
"__DISNEY__ No, her idea was called Moodsters, and was 5 characters who were different emotions and each a different color."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that is a lot like the movie, where the girl was dealing with 5 different emotions who appeared as characters in different colors."
"__DISNEY__ A couple months ago, a screenwriter filed a lawsuit saying Disney copied from his work when they made the Zootopia movie."
"__DISNEY__ What's up with that? Disney has plenty of money, why don't they just pay these people if they want to use their ideas?"
