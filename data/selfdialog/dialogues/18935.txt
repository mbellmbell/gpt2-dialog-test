"__MOVIES__ What do you think about movies that you can only watch once?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie that you can only watch once, silly."
"__MOVIES__ You can watch any movie more than once. It's really simple. Just watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ No, no. Sorry. A movie you can only enjoy once."
"__MOVIES__ In what way?"
"__MOVIES__ So, let's say there's a movie you really like, but if you watch it again, it's nowhere near as enjoyable?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, an opposite-easter-egg movie, where you can't enjoy it more?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup."
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say The Sixth Sense."
"__MOVIES__ Why did you only enjoy it once?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was fine the first time. But it's a movie with a twist. Any subsequent viewings will be diluted as you know what's happening."
"__MOVIES__ Ahh, I get it, like the Usual Suspects?"
"__MOVIES__ Sort of. You can watch that movie more than once, but not too many times."
"__MOVIES__ What makes them different?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, in The Usual Suspects, there is a lot of smart 'planting' of hints as to what's coming, and you can look for it each time."
"__MOVIES__ You can't do that in The Sixth Sense?"
"__MOVIES__ No, there all you can do is say 'Okay, he's dead, yup, makes sense.'"
"__MOVIES__ How's that different?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, in the Usual Suspects, there's actual evidence in writing all over the place you can see and put together. Each time you find something new."
