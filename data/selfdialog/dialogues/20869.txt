"__THRILLER__ I remember Silence of the Lambs and I thought it crazy at the time."
"__THRILLER__ Me too. Now it seems so mild in comparison to what is out there now."
"__THRILLER__ I know. I thought Anthony Hopkins was really good in it, but now now it feels over acted."
"__THRILLER__ I know what you mean. When you see Red Dawn and some of the others I have to agree."
"__THRILLER__ Which one was Edward Norton in? He was the detective. Red Dragon. You were almost right."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, then there was also Hannibal Rising."
"__THRILLER__ I don't remember that one. When did it come out? Did you see it?"
"__THRILLER__ I think it was 2007. It's about Hannibal's family being killed and what happened to him after."
"__THRILLER__ So it's the prequel telling you how he got to be the way he was."
"__THRILLER__ Interesting that might be worth checking out. All these movies out of sequence is so confusing."
