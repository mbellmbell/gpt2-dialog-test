"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think will be the surprise team this NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking that the Philadelphia Eagles will get some serious attention this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really think so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I do as they have several things going in their favor this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why do you think they are going to improve so much?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, last year they had a rookie quarterback and although he started off good, he faded late."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think he's going to improve enough to really help the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think he got overwhelmed with all of the publicity last year and choked, but this year will be different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so as I would like to see someone actually beat New England for the Super Bowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles can do it and they have the talent to pull it off. Who do you think will be the surprise team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Call me crazy, but I'm liking Tampa Bay to really turn some heads this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So Winston and the guys impressed you this off-season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't say that but I just think that they had so many injuries and close games last season, they will get better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to agree that they did have some bad breaks last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, if the ball bounces their way this season, they could make the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, as once a team is in the playoffs, you never know what will happen"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know as that's why they play the game on the field and not on paper."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Either way, there is no telling what will happen this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, only time will tell who makes it to the big game this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It should be a fun season regardless of who wins it all but I'm rooting for any team besides the Patriots."
