"__HORROR__ Do you have any horror movies you think are too scary to watch?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, the exorcist."
"__HORROR__ That one really isnt that scary any more. the special effects are almost laughable."
"__HORROR__ I just have a thing about possession. There isn't any avoiding it."
"__HORROR__ There are lots of horrors you can't avoid, though."
"__HORROR__ That's true, but you can fight them off."
"__HORROR__ I suppose so."
"__HORROR__ There is no fighting off possession. They have control over your body"
"__HORROR__ So you're afraid of being locked in your body with no control?"
"__HORROR__ I think that's a valid fear. Having your body taken over by a demon and forced to watch your limbs moving without your sayso. that's scary."
