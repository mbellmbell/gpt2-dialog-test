"__MOVIES__ I went to see the new Wonder Woman movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah?  Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was awesome! Have you seen it yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I was thinking of taking my kid to see it but I didn't know if it would be an age appropriate movie."
"__MOVIES__ There was some dialog that bordered on inappropriate but it wasn't any worse that what they would hear on TV."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite thing about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The fight scenes were amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard they were cool.  How was Gal Gadot as Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ She was perfect and Robin Wright Penn was a fierce warrior."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't realize she was in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ She played the Amazon queen's sister, Diana's aunt, who trains Diana to fight."
"__MOVIES__ How was Chris Pine in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ He was great.  He provided a little bit of comic relief but didn't detract at all from it being Wonder Woman's story."
"__MOVIES__ I heard it was the best of all the DC comics movies."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  It was smart, exciting, and appealing to a wide audience. I haven't seen anything like it from DC."
"__MOVIES__ I do think Gal Gadot's scenes in Batman Vs. Superman were the best things about that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely.  I wanted to see more of her after Batman vs Superman and I still want to see her in another solo Wonder Woman movie."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think Wonder Woman will have a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they would be crazy not to make another movie.  It is wildly popular, well reviewed, and has made them a ton of money."
"__MOVIES__ I am going to have to go see it.  It sounds like it's a movie not to be missed."
