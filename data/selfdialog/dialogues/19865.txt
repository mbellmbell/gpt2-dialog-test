"__MOVIES__ Are you excited to see the new Marvel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one? There's a few coming out."
"__MOVIES__ Spider-Man Homecoming is the one I was talking about"
"__MOVIES__ Oh! I thought you were thinking about Black Panther."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot that it's coming out actually."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's not till next year unfortunately."
"__MOVIES__ Well if your interested in seeing some Marvel movies would you want to see Spider-Man Homecoming with me?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Tom Holland, Robert Downey Jr., and Michael Keaton are the main actors."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know much about Tom Holland, has he been in anything big?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing huge, this is going to be his first big blockbuster."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that's great, I hope it goes well for him! I'm a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr. so I'll go for him alone."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Ever since Iron Man I've been following his work."
"__MOVIES__ I love Iron Man!"
"__MOVIES__ Ever Since Iron Man 2 I knew Marvel movies were going to be huge."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I agree, I'd even say it started with the first Iron Man."
"__MOVIES__ Possibly, it was definitely the movie that got superhero films into the spotlight."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I hope that Marvel keeps pumping out good movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me as well, I'm hoping that Spider-Man will be good."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure it will be, I'm excited to see it with you!"
