"__STAR_WARS__ What is your least favorite part of Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well I guess I could say that the prequel movies aren't as good as the original trilogy, but that's a bit obvious."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well yeah"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know. Maybe the Ewoks?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Ewoks? Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Just felt like they never really fit. Like George Lucas just injected some teddy bears into the series to sell more toys, or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ Now I kinda liked them. I wasn't obsessed with them or anything, but I liked some of their antics."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well you were a lot younger when that movie came out than I was."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess. I suppose they definitely have a different feel than the rest of the series up to that point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I never bothered checking out any of those Ewok spinoff movies. I had enough of them the first time."
