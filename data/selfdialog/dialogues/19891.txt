"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my goodness of course!  I absolutely love that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's one of my favorites too.  It was on television the other day."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it in awhile.  Remind me who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are some of the main characters.  It came out back in 1988."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I can't believe it's been almost thirty years."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, hard to believe.  I thought it was great the way they mixed cartoons and real people."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was so original and unique.  I've never seen that done before."
"__MOVIES__ Nope!  I don't think it's been done since."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen anything like it.  It had a great story line too."
"__MOVIES__ I know, it was hilarious.  The rabbit was so funny."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and Jessica Rabbit was great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they were all memorable.  It was neat that it had Looney Tunes in it, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know.  I can still remember watching it in the theatre."
"__MOVIES__ Me too!  It's crazy it was so long ago."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like they should've had a sequel to that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was definitely popular, I'm kinda surprised they didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  Who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe it was Robert Zemeckis."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't know that."
