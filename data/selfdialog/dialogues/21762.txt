"__DISNEY__ Is Toy Story considered a Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Kind of. Disney bought Pixar. So, they do own the characters."
"__DISNEY__ Toy Story is my favorite Disney movie. Lion King is my favorite too."
"__DISNEY__ You can't have two favorites of any same medium. You have to pick one."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. Frozen is my favorite Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Frozen? You didn't mention that one before."
"__DISNEY__ Sheesh! I have too many favorite Disney movies to count."
"__DISNEY__ All Disney movies can't be your favorites! Only one can be your favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Well Tom Hanks is Woody and Tim Allen is Buzz. Can't they just both be my favorites?"
"__DISNEY__ NO!"
