"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you seen all the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yea, I think so. Although some of the earlier movies kind of blend into one movie in my head."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know what you mean. The last two movies were so good though right?!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yea, I feel like now Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint grew up a bit that their acting was so much better and so much more enjoyable."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I agree. Even the storylines for the last few movies was a lot more grown up and a lot darker."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yea, you see certain characters that you've really grown attached to die in the final battle."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It was so sad when Fred Weasley died. And Dobby's death was super sad too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And Hedwig! For some reason that one hit me the hardest."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I totally cried during that scene."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too. She was with him since the beginning."
