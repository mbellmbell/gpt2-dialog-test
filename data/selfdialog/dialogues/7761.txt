"__POP__ Let's talk Bruno Mars. Do you think he is the best pop singer of our generation?"
"__POP__ He is definitely at the top, I don't know if he is the best."
"__POP__ He has had so many hits in the last few years though."
"__POP__ He has, but so have other pop singers."
"__POP__ Well who would you say is the best?"
"__POP__ I think the band Maroon 5 is up there."
"__POP__ Why them?"
"__POP__ They have been around for quite a while now and have had so many #1's."
"__POP__ Well, I would put them as #2 on my top pop singers chart."
"__POP__ Fair, I would put Bruno Mars as #2 on my pop chart."
