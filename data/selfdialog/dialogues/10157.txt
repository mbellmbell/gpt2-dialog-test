"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Did you hear that Snoop Dogg changed his name?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, to Snoop Lion right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, he changed it back."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you mean?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He was going by Snoop Lion, but then he changed it back to Snoop Dogg."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's the point of that?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know, I guess it's to represent a shift in his character or his music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It sounds more like a publicity stunt to me."
