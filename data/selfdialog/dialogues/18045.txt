"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see the latest Transformers movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure.  When did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ It came out yesterday.  We went to see it for my son's birthday/"
"__MOVIES__ Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It got really bad reviews, but it was OK for a movie about Transformers."
"__MOVIES__ Was Mark Walberg in this one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and Anthony Hopkins.  The girls were different though."
"__MOVIES__ What about Josh Dimel?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in it and a couple other soldiers and officers from the previous ones."
"__MOVIES__ Is it long like the other ones?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was 2 and a half hours long.  I suggest you see it in IMAX if you go."
"__MOVIES__ Why IMAX?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a bigger screen and the 3D is awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Do all the original Transformers show up?"
"__MOVIES__ Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Megatron for sure, but you would have to ask my son about the others."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe they've made 5 of those movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, but as kids grow up, they get more fans and sell more toys."
"__MOVIES__ Good point.  Hasbro loves it, I bet."
"__MOVIES__ I hear that this is Michael Bay's last Transformer movie, but they left the door open for another one at the end of this last movie."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder who will direct the next one."
