"__MUSIC__ Do you like country music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like some singers."
"__MUSIC__ August 17th through the 20th, there's a big country music festival in Brownsville, Oregon, called the Bi-Mart Williamette Country Music Festival."
"__MUSIC__ Who's playing at the festival?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people, but number one on my list is Keith Urban."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love Keith Urban."
"__MUSIC__ There's a bunch of people playing, Thomas Rhett, Dierks Bentley, Zac Brown Band, Parmalee, Billy Currington, and lots of others, but I'm a big fan of Keith Urban."
"__MUSIC__ Keith is the total package- he's got a great voice, he's super cute, and he seems so sweet and kind."
"__MUSIC__ There are still general admission tickets that are a four day pass for $155. General admission is a big empty grassy area behind the VIP chairs, and you have to bring your own chair."
"__MUSIC__ So it would basically really be 'going country' by being out in the grass."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, and if that isn't country enough for you, there's camping sites available. You get one vehicle pass, up to 6 adults, and 2 tents allowed for $200 for a four day pass."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, that's really not bad, $50 a day for lodging. It would be 3 times that if you had to get a hotel room. And you could split the cost with whoever goes."
"__MUSIC__ There are some add-on costs that are optional- $200 for a one day pit pass, $60 for a special entrance pass, $7 for each shower, and $25 for a special solar eclipse party."
"__MUSIC__ I think I would shell out the extra money for showers and the solar eclipse party."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that does sound fun. It's also $10 for a parking lot pass for the four days, and if you want to order it online, you have to order it by this Friday."
"__MUSIC__ So we'd have to check our schedules and decide soon if we wanted to go to this."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. But think how much fun it would be. The weather out in the West in August should be dry and warm. It would be a perfect camping trip because there would be entertainment every day."
"__MUSIC__ And we'd get to listen to Keith Urban singing live!"
"__MUSIC__ YES. Plus lots of others- RaeLynn, Amy Clawson, Kip Moore, Bailey Bryan, and lots of others. Four days of hanging out, singing country out in the country."
"__MUSIC__ All right, I have some vacation time. I'm in."
