"__MOVIES__ Leigh looks really old in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ She's 55 in real life, right?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, but she looked like she was 60 or so in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What I mean is that it''s only shocking because you're used to seeing her with makeup which makes her look younger."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but it is not just how old she looks- she is really rugged. I think she is playing some sort of frontier woman."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, looking old and looking rugged are two different things."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it did not help that she is constantly being punched in the face and assaulted during the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds really hideous. She is just abused constantly throughout the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think abused is the right word."
"__MOVIES__ But you said they are hitting her in the face consonantly, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but she is a murderer, and a vile person throughout the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I would not feel comfortable sitting in a theater watching people hit a woman over...wait, people? Multiple people are doing it?"
"__MOVIES__ I keep trying to tell you that she is a horrible person. Whoever she comes into contact with cannot stand her."
"__MOVIES__ And the people who are hitting her are the good guys?"
"__MOVIES__ That is why they call them protagonists and antagonists. But yeah, they are the 'good guys.' They are not murderers like her. They work to uphold the law."
"__MOVIES__ Would they be working to uphold the law if they were not getting paid for it?"
"__MOVIES__ I can say for a fact that the Hangman, Kurt Russel seems to enjoy brining people to justice and making them pay for their crimes."
"__MOVIES__ Beating a female prisoner does not sound like justice."
"__MOVIES__ I think the best I can say is that the movie was set in a different time period and that the Hangman could not show any sort of weakness. If she had been a man, he would have been hitting a man- the fact he treats a woman so bad is addressed a few times."
"__MOVIES__ But no one actually does anything about it, right?"
