"__MUSIC__ Out of 80s Metal Bands, who would be your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh it would be Metallica for sure."
"__MUSIC__ Really why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ They were one of the first trued metal bands. They started in 1981. I was in diapers!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow. I prefer AC/DC and of course we know they were first. 1973 is when they started."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess they were around longer, but I like the softer tones of Metallica."
"__MUSIC__ I find that AC/DC has a more edgy sound. Wouldn't you agree?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess. I found that Metallica changed a bit in the 90s and became more alternative."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they really did. AC/DC kept true to their edge."
"__MUSIC__ I know but 'Enter Sandman' has to be one of the best songs ever."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I can agree with that, but have you ever heard 'Back in Black' or 'Hells Bells?'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, those are both really good songs. How many people are in AC/DC?"
"__MUSIC__ They have seven all together."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. That is incredible. How many of them are singers?"
"__MUSIC__ Only 2 are vocals. Three are guitars, then one bass and one drums."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Still a lot of members. Metallica only has four."
"__MUSIC__ Really just four? I guess that is about average for a band. Who is your favorite member?"
"__MUSIC__ Lars. He is the drummer. What about you. Who is your favorite in AC/DC?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh that is easy. It would be Brian Johnson. He is vocalist."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah man. He sounds great."
