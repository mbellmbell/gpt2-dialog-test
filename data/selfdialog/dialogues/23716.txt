"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Good question- there are so many!  I think it is either Inside Out or Up."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I loved Up so much.  It was so funny but sweet, too."
"__DISNEY__ I think I cried a little at the beginning!   Have you seen Inside Out?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but I want to.  It looks great."
"__DISNEY__ It is cute and would be great for someone who teaches kids about feelings."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I will definitely look into that.  I bet a lot of my kids have seen it already."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, you could use the dolls or movie clips or something!"
"__DISNEY__ That's a great idea.  I will go see if it is on Netflix."
"__DISNEY__ Great.  Let me know if you like it as much as I do!"
