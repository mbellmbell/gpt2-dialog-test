"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was the worst play in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The worst play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the worst play!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what was the best play, but I don't know about the worst."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. What was the best play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Immaculate Reception."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Th immaculate what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Immaculate Reception, which is one of the most famous plays in the history of NFL football. It happened during the 1972 AFC divisional playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did that involve Mean Joe Green?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This was the play where Terry Bradshaw, with only seconds left in the game and down by less than seven points, threw a bomb to John Fuqua."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last minute plays happens all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not like this!  The intended receiver missed the ball, and it bounced off the defensive guy, only to be scooped up by the Stealer's fullback, Franco Harris, just before the ball hit the turf."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah!  And with only seconds remaining in the game, Harris takes this gift--this ball that bounced into his hands from nowhere---and strolls into the endzone to win the playoff game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds wild!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was!  But to this day, Raiders fans dispute the play, saying that the ball bounced off Fuqua, which means the catch was no good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then the Raiders would have won the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like one of Aesop's Fables..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well the moral of the story is this: 'That's just the way the ball bounces!'"
