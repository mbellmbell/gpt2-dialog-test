"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, are you pumped about Fournette coming in?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No why would I be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he's going to make the Jags a lot better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No he isn't, he's just a running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he is the best running back in the draft hands down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, running backs are the most dime a dozen commodity in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way, I'd trade half my team away for Peterson in his prime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bro, look at the best running backs in the NFL, many of them weren't even drafted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok what about some of the best? Like Peterson or Elliot?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's my point, it's a crapshoot.  They're only as good as their lines."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adrian Peterson would make any O-line look good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would disagree, there are very few rbs that could do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say Barry Sanders back in the day was one.  His line was terrible, but that guy just couldn't be corralled."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're just saying draft linemen and not running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I think some of them can offer a lot, like McCaffery  He might end up being really important."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes McCaffery different?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's just so versatile.  Kind of like a Curtis Martin, or LaDanian Tomlinson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he can run routes with the best of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, which I think is the direction the NFL is headed."
