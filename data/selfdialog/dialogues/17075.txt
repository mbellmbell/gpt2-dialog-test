"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about David Lynch?"
"__MOVIES__ A bit mixed."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, 'a bit' is just what it means...I like him mostly."
"__MOVIES__ What do you DISlike?"
"__MOVIES__ He'll throw in a bit of obscurantism and doesn't always finish what he started."
"__MOVIES__ Any examples?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Some of the stuff in Mulholland Drive didn't seem to have any real purpose. It's mostly funny, though."
"__MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MOVIES__ I never got what exactly had happened to the two girls."
"__MOVIES__ Was too much effort put into making it mysterious?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. He can lay it on thick. I'd have to see it again. Like I said, I'm a fan overall."
"__MOVIES__ I take it you feel similarly about Twin Peaks."
"__MOVIES__ Spot on. I'm a huge fan, but some things I just worry are never going to be resolved."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't help that a good chunk of the old cast won't be returning. How do you think it'll end?"
"__MOVIES__ No idea. That's both good and bad!"
"__MOVIES__ What if it turns out well?"
"__MOVIES__ Then I'll like him that much more."
"__MOVIES__ It'd be nice to see it end well."
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, if he knows what he's doing, I wouldn't mind the revival lasting longer. We'll see."
