"__DISNEY__ I just saw Wreck-It Ralph and it has to be my new favorite movie!"
"__DISNEY__ I saw it a few years ago when it came out and thought it was just okay."
"__DISNEY__ You only thought it was okay?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I just didn't really connect with the characters."
"__DISNEY__ I grew up playing video games, so this movie really hit home with me."
"__DISNEY__ I grew up with video games too, but I thought the plot wasn't that great."
"__DISNEY__ What was wrong with the plot?"
"__DISNEY__ I just didn't like the ending I suppose. Also, that one candy girl annoyed me."
"__DISNEY__ Her name was Vanellope!"
"__DISNEY__ See, it must not have been that great if I can't even remember the main character's name."
