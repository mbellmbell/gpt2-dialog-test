"__THRILLER__ What's your favorite thriller?"
"__THRILLER__ Actually, my favorite thriller is a series: the first three 'Bourne' movies."
"__THRILLER__ Why are those your favorite?"
"__THRILLER__ They're very economical and stylish - nothing is wasted, every scene is well constructed, and the action feels visceral"
"__THRILLER__ Did you see the fourth and fifth Bourne movies?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes - I was disappointed in both."
"__THRILLER__ I saw the fourth and thought that it was just average and generic."
"__THRILLER__ Exactly - it looked like every other thriller, and didn't continue the intensity and stylishness of the original series."
"__THRILLER__ What about the 5th Bourne film?"
"__THRILLER__ It seems like the franchise is played out.  Many of the locales and set pieces were the same, and both Bourne and Matt Damon look tired.  Time to retire the series."
