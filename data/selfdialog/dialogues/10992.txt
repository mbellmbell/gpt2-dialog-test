"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So then the wonderlic test is kinda useless"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh... why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because people who score very high like Fitzpartick isn't all that good. And Gore who scored the second lowest is very good"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or, you're not using the test results correctly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the NFl separates the positions and averages the scores out by the positions"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh. Then what happens?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well you get an average score for the each positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are the QBs highest?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Offensive tackles score the highest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's so weird."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tackles don't really need high IQs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh contraire.They DO need more intelligence than other positions. They have to make tackle, blocking decision."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There you go again with decision."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the decisions are pretty difficult to make under stress and ina blink of a second, if you miss the block, the ball carrier goes down"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the play is over..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. What's really surprising is that running backs have the lowest scores."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, well That DOES NOT suprise me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
