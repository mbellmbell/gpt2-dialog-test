"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what do you think about the NFC North race this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean it's probably going to be the Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was just listening to a podcast and they had Minnesota as 1?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? What did they think made Minnesota any better than last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really don't know. They got to a fast start last year at 6-0, I think, but then completely collapsed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and I think that collapsed part of the season is more indicative of their real team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. What's funny though, is I think the Teddy Bridgewater injury actualyl made them better?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm interesting. Not a fan of Bridgewater?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all. He had an incredibly weak arm and people assumed he was mobile, which he wasn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we may never know if he was any good now. He may never play again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In a way that kinda annoys me, because I kept on telling my friends about how I thought he was a lousy QB and they loved him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess it'll have to be a truce now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But not even, he's been lackluster in the games he's played so far. Saying he is good is like saying Brock Osweiler is elite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahahaha. Okay how about this. Who would you rather have...Alex Smith or a healthy Teddy Bridgewater."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh my god. Definitely Alex Smith. Not even close."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, well I agree with you on Alex Smith over Bridgewater. Let's be clear that Alex Smith is not elite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah I guess. But he can get the job done, he is just not agressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair enough. I think it is telling that the Chiefs traded up to take Mahomes this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that shows they are frustrated with how conservative Smith is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Andy Reid does have a good record and feel for QBs. It will be fun to watch the Chiefs this preseason."
