"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it last week."
"__MOVIES__ You're religious, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, even though you hate me for it."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, can I give a hypothetical for you?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, go for it."
"__MOVIES__ So, Wonder Woman takes place in a land where monotheism can be assumed to be a thing."
"__MOVIES__ Right..."
"__MOVIES__ But, they proved that the Greek mythology is the true origin, not monotheism."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it's fiction."
"__MOVIES__ What would you do?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, put yourself in that situation."
"__MOVIES__ Which?"
"__MOVIES__ You believe in one God, but that's been disproven. We know it's many gods. But they're all dead now."
"__MOVIES__ This isn't real."
"__MOVIES__ Just play along."
"__MOVIES__ Fine."
"__MOVIES__ What do you do: the gods are real but Wonder Woman is the only one left. Do you worship her? She's trigger-happy."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not in the mood for this right now, but I'll go ahead and say yes."
