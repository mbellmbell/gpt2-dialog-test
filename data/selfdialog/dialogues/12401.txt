"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who won the Superbowl last year again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh gosh, I think the Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons? I'm asking about the 2016 game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Patriots versus Falcons, wasn't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Patriots won that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, well why did you ask then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I guess your wrong answer fueled my memory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, well if it was the Patriots like you said they are unstoppable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, I mean I'm sure they've lost before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course they have, but they've won so much lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have like 5 titles, don't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Something like that, I know other teams have more though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know for certain the Packers have won the most titles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Since the NFL was created?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, they've won 13."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And how do you know that exactly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My family are huge Packers fans and bring it up every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha ha, well good on your family and the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they've won in a while though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not, but I'm sure they will again soon."
