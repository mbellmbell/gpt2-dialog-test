"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey did you watch the super bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure did watch it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was one of the greatest super bowls of all time. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought that it was the best example of a team never quitting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I would have to agree. Tom Brady has ice water veins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really does show what hard work and stone cold determination can do for a competitor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it was laughable that the Falcons actually lost"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea they played very cocky after getting a big lead early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. You can never stop playing when the stakes are that high."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think both teams will make it back there next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that the Patriots will make it back but I am not sure about the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have the same thinking. That was a mentally defeating loss that could spill over to the future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is really up in the air at the end of the day. I would hate to have to go through something like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean. I am super competitive and it hurt just to watch a team like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I tend to think you get what you put into it when it comes to football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can agree with that. Who do you think will make instead of the Falcons then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Packers will face off against the Pats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that is a good one. I can't wait to see it if it happens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea they are my favorite team so I always think they are gonna go and win it all."
