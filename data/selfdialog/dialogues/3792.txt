"__MUSIC__ Did you hear any rumors about the Spice Girls reuniting for a tour?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't. Did you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I heard they were getting back together."
"__MUSIC__ While that would be awesome, I'm sorry to inform you that is highly unlikely."
"__MUSIC__ I figured. I think at least two of them are judges on different shows now."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but how fun would that be. I loved them back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It was so corny, but their music was just so catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Of course everyone knows Wannabe, but I think my favorite song was actually Stop."
"__MUSIC__ Was that from their second album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, for as big as they were, I can't believe they only had three albums."
"__MUSIC__ I don't even remember the third."
"__MUSIC__ It was released after Geri left."
"__MUSIC__ Which one was she?"
"__MUSIC__ Ginger! How could you not know that?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I don't know. Didn't they do a song for her after she left."
"__MUSIC__ I think so. The four remaining recorded the song Goodbye, and I assume it was for her."
"__MUSIC__ Their music was just great to dance to and now if the song Wannabe comes on, everyone goes crazy."
"__MUSIC__ If you grew up in the 90s it's hard not to sing along to that!"
"__MUSIC__ I guess you are right."
"__MUSIC__ If only they would tour again!"
