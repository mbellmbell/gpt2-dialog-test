"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you like the Fast and Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Are you kidding? They are awesome!!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They really are! I loved the first two so much."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me too. I like the newer ones even more, though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Really? I like them, but not nearly as much."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Fast Five was just so awesome."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It kind of turned the franchise into a heist series, though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, but I love heist films!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me too, but it just wasn't what I expected from them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well I am glad they did it! They got even better with time!"
