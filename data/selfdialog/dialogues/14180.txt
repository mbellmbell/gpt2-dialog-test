"__HORROR__ How did you feel about the original Paranormal Activity?"
"__HORROR__ That was a fantastic concept.  It was one of the first crowd-funded movies."
"__HORROR__ I completely forgot about that.  My name is in the credits for contributing on the DVD."
"__HORROR__ Mine too!  The movie started a bit slower, but definitely got more intense."
"__HORROR__ Yes, I found I would think about the movie when trying to go to sleep."
"__HORROR__ I would get scared that my husband would start screaming in the kitchen or something."
"__HORROR__ At the end, when she popped up really close to the camera, I screamed."
"__HORROR__ Oh, I did too.  I was so embarrassed in the theater."
"__HORROR__ I will admit, I thought that maybe this was a real found footage movie by the end."
"__HORROR__ I did look up the characters and actors too to make sure it was just a movie."
