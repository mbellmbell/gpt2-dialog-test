"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite moment in all of 'Star Wars' history?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to say that my favorite, single shot has to be when Luke is standing at his Uncle's house, looking out into the horizon."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a really powerful scene.  Luke looking out into Tatooine's two suns, as John Williams' score started to play."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's impossible not to think about John Williams when thinking about Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ I couldn't agree more.  They go together so well."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite scene of all time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Mine was in 'A New Hope,' when Han flies in and saves Luke at the end."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was so excited when I first watched that scene.  Han's character evolved the most in the whole franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea.  He starts out a scoundrel, ends up becoming a true hero."
"__STAR_WARS__ That made his loss all the more depressing.  I was so sad when he died in 'The Force Awakens.'"
