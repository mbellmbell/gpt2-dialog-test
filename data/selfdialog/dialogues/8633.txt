"__BEATLES__ Don't The Beatles just make you want to curl up on the beach and take a nap?"
"__BEATLES__ Never thought about it like that, but I guess so."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah! The perfect chill music."
"__BEATLES__ They're so old, though."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah they're mostly dead, but that's not the point of music is it?"
"__BEATLES__ I guess not."
"__BEATLES__ If only they could have reunited first."
"__BEATLES__ That would have been pretty cool"
"__BEATLES__ I'd have some new chill music, at least!"
"__BEATLES__ Here Comes the Sun is pretty good"
