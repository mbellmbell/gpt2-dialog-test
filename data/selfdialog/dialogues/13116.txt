"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are your Bengals looking this season, man?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I think they could win it all!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Marvin Lewis better hurry up and produce some results, I know that much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I think it's time to move on after this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What sucks is that they almost ALWAYS make it to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I love Dalton. I think he's underrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, actually. Him and Stafford."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, definitely. Stafford has a cannon on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Lions will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they're in the same boat as the Bengals, as far as head coaches go. They need to start producing results."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. They need some good receivers too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With no Megatron, it's like... what's the point?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. And the Bengals need someone to supplement Green."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right!? We need someone who can be in the slot and create mismatches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like a Christian McCaffrey, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. Or like a Dion Lewis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bengals defense should still be decent, if not better, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. As long as we have a monster like Burfict, we should be decent at a minimum."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Well, I'll see you once the season starts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. I'm excited for some football!"
