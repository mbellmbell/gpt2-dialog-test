"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're a 49er fan.  Name some players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Steve Young, Ronnie Lott, Dwight Clark, Keena Turner, Bubba Paris..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa--current players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh, give me a moment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Living in the past like all 49er fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hold on, there's Navarro Bowman and Carlos Hyde and uh"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's the quarterback?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You don't know the quarterback of the team you root for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'm not sure they know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty sad--what's the problem with the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The ownership--who gets rid of Jim Harbaugh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he took them to two conference championships and one Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, oh well, let's get rid of the coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then you have a different coach every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't remind me--Singletary, Tomsula, Kelly, oh my gosh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably more the management's fault than the coach's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And now you have Kyle Shanahan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Other than the play call that probably blew the Super Bowl for Atlanta, I think he'll be o.k."
