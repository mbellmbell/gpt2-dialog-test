"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know during broadcast NFL games, cheerleaders are on TV for only about 3 seconds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? only 3 seconds? That doesn't seem like a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I heard they don't make very much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard NFL cheerleaders typically make $50–$75 a game. However, by the time they spend money on makeup, hair accessories, dance classes, etc., they end up losing money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eek, that's a shame. Do they all have cheerleaders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, actually 6 teams in the NFL don’t employ cheerleaders: the Bears, the Browns, the Lions, the Giants, the Steelers, and the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought all NFL teams had them. Like it was requirement."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. Super Bowl XLV was the first Super Bowl with no cheerleaders at the game because neither the Steelers and the Packers have cheerleaders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is crazy. I can't get enough NFL facts. I wonder what they did for half time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I don't remember. But the the most famous NFL cheerleading squad is the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders who was originally a male/female group called the CowBelles & Beaux."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I definitely don't remember that. I didn't know they even had mixed cheerleading squad in NFL. I thought that was college thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As of September 2012, the Dallas Cowboys were the highest-valued sports franchise in the history of the United States. You know they do things big in Texas!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they do! I've always been a big fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Dallas franchise to me is one of the best. They just go all out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. It's got to be your second fave if your team isn't playing well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and one of the most lucrative."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The wealthiest team in the NFL is the Dallas Cowboys who have an estimated value of approximately $2.1 billion and generate almost $269 million in annual revenue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Holy cow!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I imagine some big oil tycoon owning the team, sitting behind a big mahogany desk and wearing a 10 gallon hat!"
