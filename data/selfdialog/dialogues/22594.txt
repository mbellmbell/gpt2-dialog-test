"__DISNEY__ I better hurry and buy my kids tickets to see Cars 3 this weekend. They are so excited."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I forgot that was coming out. I need to get tickets for my daughter too."
"__DISNEY__ Is she a big fan of the movies?"
"__DISNEY__ She loves them! Mater is her favorite character."
"__DISNEY__ I like him too, but Lightning McQueen is my favorite. How about you?"
"__DISNEY__ I adore Sally, but that is probably because I love Bonnie Hunt so much. She is always so good in her roles."
"__DISNEY__ She really is. Did you know she is going to be in Toy Story 4?"
"__DISNEY__ I had heard that, but wasn't positive it was true. That's exciting."
"__DISNEY__ I know! All of these great Disney movies coming out around the same time. I better start planning our trips to the movie theater."
"__DISNEY__ Tell me about it. The kids are going to get spoiled going to the movies all of the time."
