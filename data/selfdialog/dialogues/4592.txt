"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I have two. It is a tie between country and hip-hop."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! Those two types of music are so drastically different from one another."
"__MUSIC__ I know they are but sometimes I am just in the mood for different things."
"__MUSIC__ I get that. When I am in the car I like to listen to slower songs and relaxing songs."
"__MUSIC__ I am the same way."
"__MUSIC__ So when do you listen to country music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like to listen to country music when I am having people over and we are just grilling in the back yard."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. When do you like to listen to hip-hop music?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly when I am out with friends at a bar or a club. Hip-hop music gets me in the mood to dance."
"__MUSIC__ I love to dance to hip-hop. What about rap?"
"__MUSIC__ I like rap but don't listen to it that much."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Because I cannot understand what they are saying most of the time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Sometimes it is very hard to understand rap music."
"__MUSIC__ Same goes for heavy metal music. I can never understand what they are saying."
"__MUSIC__ True! They scream so loud in their songs it gives me a headache."
"__MUSIC__ Oh me too. I think I hate heavy metal music more than any other genre."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I don't know one heavy metal bad because I never listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ I know of the band Metallica but I never listen to them."
