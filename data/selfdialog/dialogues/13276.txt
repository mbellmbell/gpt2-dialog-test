"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for 3 days of football a week!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know! Sunday, Monday and Thursday funday returns!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you decided if you are doing any fantasy teams this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely! Ever since the draft, I have been doing my research on the players, teams, and schedules to figure out who to draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will have a breakout season this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The hometown Philadelphia Eagles seem to be the best team out there in my mind. So much talent and youth to excel in this league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carson Wentz showed us he was the real deal last year. I am definitely onboard the Wentz Wagon!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would have thought that a kid from a small school in North Dakota would be the savior that the Eagles were looking for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Eagles may be a whole lot better this year, but they still need to go through Dallas to get to the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah talking about a good team, I can only see this team get better over time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely! As it hurts me to say this, but I really like the talent they have on the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dunno who is the better quarterback, Dak Prescott or Carson Wentz."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want to say Carson as he needed to work with less and seemed to be a better player in the long run last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not taking away from Carson's accomplishments, but Dak was definitely on fire more times than not last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I do think that whenever these teams play each other, it's gonna be a battle to the end each and every time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they match up very well and will be fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any feelings towards the other teams in the division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No not really. I think the Giants will be ok, but it is all dependent with Odell Beckham and how he pans out this season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can say that about Kirk Cousins on the Skins"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he is definitely hit or miss."
