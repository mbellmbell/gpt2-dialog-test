"__STAR_WARS__ Who was the guy who voiced Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh man, I think you mean James Earl Jones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's who I was thinking of.  Did he come back for Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I believe he did.  He'll always be the voice of Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ You can't fake him.  He'll never be replicated."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is possible they could just recreate his voice from computers."
"__STAR_WARS__ If they had to, sure, but hopefully nothing ever happens to James Earl Jones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Vader might be done anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they will probably move on from the character anyway."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's what I'm thinking as well."
