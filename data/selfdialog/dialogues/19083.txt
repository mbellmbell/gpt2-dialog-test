"__MOVIES__ It's that time of year again."
"__MOVIES__ What time of year?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Wizard of Oz' time of year!"
"__MOVIES__ That's right. I've gotta watch that!"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently, the TV networks think American viewers have an annual circadian rhythm."
"__MOVIES__ A what?"
"__MOVIES__ An annual circadian Rhythm. You know, like a body clock that says, 'It's time' to repeat something."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. Like chili."
"__MOVIES__ Nice try.  And soon it will be time again to watch, 'A Christmas Story.'"
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie. But it has been so long since I last saw it..."
"__MOVIES__ How long?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know. Almost a year I guess."
"__MOVIES__ A year?"
"__MOVIES__ A year."
"__MOVIES__ You think a year is a long time for movie watching?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely!"
"__MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MOVIES__ It's just long enough for me to forget what I watched. Then, I want to watch it all over again for all the same reasons I wanted to watch it the first time."
"__MOVIES__ I guess the networks are right. Annual circadian rhythms fit with the memory span of the average American."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. But, what's an annual circadian rhythm?"
