"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What in a game drives you crazy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Constant commercials and TV time-outs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, duh. Everyone hates that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ask a silly question, get a silly answer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fine, what about gameplay annoys you the most?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Icing the kicker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean when coaches call a timeout right as a field goal kicker attempts a kick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you hate it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes the game even longer, and it doesn't work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, statistics show that the kickers aren't affected."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't they panic and re-think the kick and then mess up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they get more time to re-think the angle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they try to make it even if they know it's coming?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. If they miss it, they make an adjustment. If they make it, they repeat it and they got a free practice kick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the percentage of icings that work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, but logic disproves it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If it works, it's chance. It can work sometimes and the coach is a genius; if it doesn't work he's an idiot."
