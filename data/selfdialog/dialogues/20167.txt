"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see Star Man?"
"__MOVIES__ Refresh my memory? It sounds familiar but it eludes me at the moment."
"__MOVIES__ Jeff Bridges plays an alien who comes to earth. Anything yet? I don't want to do a spoiler alert."
"__MOVIES__ It's okay just tell me so I will see if I want to watch it ."
"__MOVIES__ Ok it has Karen Allen you know from Indiana Jones movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I am starting to get a vague recollection of this movie."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway Jeff Bridges plays  the alien that falls in love with an earthling."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one where he changes his appearance to look like her dead husband so as not to frighten her?"
"__MOVIES__ It seems like that is in there. It's been a while since I have seen it and I could be confusing that part that could be from another movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think he searches her mind and chooses that image assuming that would be the good thing to do not considering it would scare the crap out of her."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously! He should have looked into human psyche 101 or  Understanding Earthlings for Dummies."
"__MOVIES__ John Carpenter did that movie in 1984"
"__MOVIES__ Yes the alien is answering  a 'call' from Nasa and when he gets here of course they shoot down his craft."
"__MOVIES__ Let me guess then they start trying to catch him."
"__MOVIES__ But of course isn't that we humans do catch, kill and ask questions later"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah when there isn't anyone left to ask because you killed him!!"
"__MOVIES__ Anyway they are running from the government thugs to a rendezous point with his people to get back home."
"__MOVIES__ Ah the old ET ' phone home 'play ."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly but it works for a low budget movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think I will have to watch that....maybe."
