"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You looking forward to the NFL season this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not really actually?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, you? You used to be such an avid fan and you used to go with your dad to see every single home game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, yeah, I guess I've soured a bit on the money aspect of the game. I was a pretty big St. Louis Rams fan as you know, and I just think that city got the shaft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can understand that you're upset. I suppose if you have an allegiance to a city that no longer has a team you might feel cheated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I sure do. I've analyzed what went down with the decision to move the NFL from St. Louis to L.A. and from every angle I think the city got screwed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you think San Diego and Oakland feel the same way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They may feel the same way, but the fact remains, particularly in the case of Oakland, the city offered no public money. St. Louis did ... big time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I forgot about that point. But I guess some people feel that going back to L.A. is sort of karma to St. Louis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have to draw the line somewhere. The Rams used to be somewhere else before L.A. and St. Louis - why not move that team back there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but haven't the last superbowls been exciting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure, but sometimes you have to put principal ahead of having fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. I know a lot of people agree with you - probably in St. Louis, San Diego and Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are particularly two incidents from the whole St. Louis to L.A. move that still bother me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, first is the owners vote. Originally, there weren't enough owners voting to move the group. Then, when they took a 'blind' vote where owners didn't have accountability to their vote, they voted to move the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In other words, if the owners didn't have to be wedded publicly to their vote, then they voted for the money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Precisely. Then, St. Louis also met every guideline presented by the NFL. According to Dave Peacock, the guy spearheading the Rams in St. Louis movement, the NFL were very, um, shady in their dealings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, look, from the perspective outside St. Louis, the headline was 'Rams back to L.A.' not 'St. Louis gets screwed'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. All of this is why I've cooled on the NFL."
