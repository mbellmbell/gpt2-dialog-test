"__DISNEY__ Who is your favorite Disney Princess?"
"__DISNEY__ Hm, I'd say it's a close call between Mulan and Pocahontas."
"__DISNEY__ Neither of those are princesses!"
"__DISNEY__ Pocahontas was a chief's daughter and Mulan can be a princess if she wanted to because she saved all of China."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that's true."
"__DISNEY__ I think I'm going to say Mulan, since most of Pocahontas' story isn't historically accurate."
"__DISNEY__ We're talking about historical accuracy in Disney Princesses?"
"__DISNEY__ Mulan was based off a Chinese poem, Pocahontas is an important historical character. There's more leeway for fiction than actual historic events!"
"__DISNEY__ Fine, fine, I almost regret I asked. My favorite is Rapunzel."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, is that because you're blonde like lizards?"
