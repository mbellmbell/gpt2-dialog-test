"__HARRY_POTTER__ Are you a fan of Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yes, I absolutely love those movies. I've read all of the books as well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I haven't had a chance to read them all yet. Is the movie following the story line given in the books well?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ More or less, even though there are some differences, and the book offers more details about the characters."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Which of the characters is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ My favorite is Hermione for sure. And Emma Watson does such an excellent job portraying her."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She is probably my favorite too, even though I love the character of Snape as well."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He's a very complex character for sure. It's interesting once you really get to learn a character's back story."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah it can change your whole perception of the character. That definitely happened with Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, the flash back scenes from his past revealed a lot about what kind of a man he actually was and explained a lot of his actions."
