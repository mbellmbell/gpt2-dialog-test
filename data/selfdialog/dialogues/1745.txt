"__MUSIC__ What musical group thats gone away or you never hear from anymore, would you like to see make a come back?"
"__MUSIC__ Well there's a few, but the one that really stands out would be En Vogue"

"__MUSIC__ Yeah I really like them too, I listen to a few of them when I am driving"
"__MUSIC__ What song do you listen to most?"
"__MUSIC__ I like 'Runaway Love' by En Vogue, I am jamming to that all the time when I drive on the highway"

"__MUSIC__ Yeah I like that one too"
"__MUSIC__ What group would you like to see come back."
