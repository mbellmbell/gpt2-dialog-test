"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wonder what happened to Iggy Azalea."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ She just released a couple of singles."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you heard them?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I heard Mo Bounce and Switch. They aren't half bad."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The last I heard from her was that guest verse on the Britney track."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Pretty Girls? That was a bit of a mess."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Agreed. Are her new singles better?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Switch is really hard for Iggy, and Mo Bounce is more easy going."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Would you say they're worth the bucks on iTunes?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Maybe listen on Spotify first."
