"__MUSIC__ So what have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of different stuff. I was on this Bon Iver, Mumford Brothers thing for a while."
"__MUSIC__ I like them. I was listening to Ben Harper and Jack Johnson."
"__MUSIC__ I do them too. I was thinking I miss the Counting Crows. I loved them."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. You must be feeling nostalgic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, August and Everything After, 1993...best album ever."
"__MUSIC__ I love that album. 'Round Here' is my song."
"__MUSIC__ 'Time and Time Again'"
"__MUSIC__ I also like instrumental music. Love the cello. You ever listen to any of that stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Olafur Arnalds is so good. Of course."
"__MUSIC__ I like Zoe Keating also. Did you know Olafur was once in punk band?"
"__MUSIC__ Get out...his music is now so relaxing. I like to have it on when I'm working or cooking in the background."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I have it on when people come over."
"__MUSIC__ I leave it on for the cat. I think it mellows her out."
"__MUSIC__ You should check out Julia Kent too. She sounds a lot like Zoe Keating."
"__MUSIC__ Cellos music is so mellow. Can't believe I used to play the violin."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That's crazy. I never played anything."
"__MUSIC__ I always imagined learning to play the guitar so I play some of that Jack Johnson music."
"__MUSIC__ That would be cool. You should do."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'll add it to list while I'm listening to Olafur!"
