"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think has the best and worst uniforms in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Best uniforms? I would have to say the Lions do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lions? That's an obscure choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Blue and Silver combination and their new logo is classic with a slight design change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That upgrade in logo was hardly noticeable. Sometimes those are the best upgrades."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For certain. When a team goes crazy with a totally new logo, it sometimes loses it's feel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think is the worst uniforms in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ An obvious answer would be the Browns, because of the colors. However, I would say the Tampa Bay Buccaneers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they don't have those old creamsicle orange uniforms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I disagree. Those uniforms were awesome. They were outrageous but they worked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you like the old logo with the Buccaneer and the sword in his mouth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually did. It wasn't intimidating at all and he winked, but it was detailed and unique and separated itself in that category."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's surprising because most people hated their old logo and uniforms. Why do you hate their new uniforms?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't care for their new logo and their logo is oversized on the helmet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it oversized. I didn't even notice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is. Take a look next time they are on television. I also hate the color pewter or whatever they call that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is an ugly color. What else don't you like about their uniforms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The numbers look like they belong on an old 1980's microwave."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that. They have that microwave or even alarm clock feel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to go back old school and bring back the old uniforms."
