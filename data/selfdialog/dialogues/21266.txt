"__THRILLER__ So Joe, did you ever see the first film Clint Eastwood directed, Play Misty for Me?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes I did. It's a strange one for a thriller, but it does draw you in."
"__THRILLER__ It's not that strange, it's a psychological thriller, like Shutter Island or Silence of the Lambs."
"__THRILLER__ In this case, Marsha, it's the deranged fan who needs psychological help. She's sooo demented."
"__THRILLER__ But the hero wasn't thinking straight either. Why did he sleep with her if he didn't want her around?"
"__THRILLER__ Do I really have to explain that to you?"
"__THRILLER__ Uh, no, thanks, but remember Fatal Attraction? Straying is dangerous in movies, and in real life, too, believe me."
"__THRILLER__ So the movie really doesn't have a hero. He's not heroic, for sure."
"__THRILLER__ Well he does try to let her down gently."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, but she ends up taking a hard fall. Of course, it could just as easily have been him."
