"__DISNEY__ Did you like the Toy Story movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I actually didn't mind them."
"__DISNEY__ Does your kid ever watch them?"
"__DISNEY__ No, all she ever wants to watch is Frozen."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I bet you'd rather her watch Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, just overall more fun.  And nostalgic with the toys."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I'm sure.  Did you see all three of the Toy Story movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I've seen them all.  I've probably seen the last one more than the others."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that means you like the last one the best."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe a little."
