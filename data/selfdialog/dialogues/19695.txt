"__MOVIES__ Do you want to rent a movie tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure what type, a comedy or maybe an action film?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I was actually thinking about watching a horror movie, perhaps a classic."
"__MOVIES__ A classic horror movie huh? Which one?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, what about Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a big horror movie buff. I actually haven't seen either."
"__MOVIES__ The bad guy in Nightmare on Elm Street is Freddy Krueger."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right, that was directed by Wes Craven right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he's a great horror film director."
"__MOVIES__ That is the movie where Freddy Krueger haunts dreams right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he haunts the dreams of teenagers. It's terrifying."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds a little too scary for me. What about a comedy instead?"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, what is your favorite comedy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I love comedies so I have a bunch. What About Bob is one of the best comedies of all time!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Bill Murray was hilarious in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was one of his best roles.  I also like some newer comedies. We could see the movie, Central Intelligence."
"__MOVIES__ Is Kevin Hart in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and the movie is so funny. It's also fast paced so you won't get bored."
"__MOVIES__ Kevin Hart is a good actor. Let's get a comedy so we can laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I'll rent Central Intelligence tonight then."
