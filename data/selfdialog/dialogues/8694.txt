"__BEATLES__ Who's your favorite Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ That's a hard one - I know most people would say John or Paul, but I like George"
"__BEATLES__ Really? why George? He didnt really get to do many songs with the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ But the ones he did get to make were my favorites especially 'Something'"
"__BEATLES__ 'Something' is a great song for sure. I like stuff like 'Revolution #9'"
"__BEATLES__ Well which album is your favorite? I like 'Rubber Soul'"
"__BEATLES__ Mine would be the White Album or Sgt. Pepper. - those are great albums."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah they are really good but you can't be Rubber Soul - its the transition album that made the Beatles more experimental."
"__BEATLES__ True. Its quite different from those early records."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, thats why it's my favorite - you can really measure the growth in songwriting with this album."
