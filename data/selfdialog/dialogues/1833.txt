"__MUSIC__ Hey what is going on with you today?"
"__MUSIC__ Not much, just been trying to make me a new CD to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of CD are you trying to make?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm wanting to do a CD dedicated to older female country music artists."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool! What are some of the people that you have listen so far?"
"__MUSIC__ Right now I am searching for some good Faith Hill songs. Do you know her greatest ones?"
"__MUSIC__ There You'll Be, The Kiss, Breathe, It Matters To Me, Piece of My Heart, and The Way You Love Me always stand out to me."
"__MUSIC__ Oh is There You'll Be the one that she did for the movie Pearl Harbor?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!"
"__MUSIC__ I love that song. I will definitely have to add that one."
"__MUSIC__ Who else are you looking for?"
"__MUSIC__ I am also wanting some good Shania Twain songs."
"__MUSIC__ You're Still the One, From This Moment On, Any Man of Mine, That Don't Impress Me Much, and of course there is Man I Feel Like A Woman."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, those are some awesome songs! I can't believe I have forgotten about so many of them."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah her and Faith Hill are definitely two of the greats from a while back."
"__MUSIC__ I would probably have to add Reba McEntire in that category as well."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, I definitely agree with you on that one! She is really the only one of them who still does songs today."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of her newer ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Going Out Like That, Just Like Them Horses, and Somebody's Chelsea."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to give them a listen and maybe add some of the newer stuff as well."
