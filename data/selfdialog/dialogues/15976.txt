"__ROCK__ Do you think the idea of the 'rock star' is still relevant?"
"__ROCK__ Well sure, why wouldn't it be?"
"__ROCK__ Well, rock is no longer the genre of youth - most popular rock is classic rock these days."
"__ROCK__ I suppose that's true. Still, what define a rock star?"
"__ROCK__ I'd define rock star as an iconoclast, in the vein of cobain and osbourne. It's hard to find figures like that in music these days."
"__ROCK__ Why do you think that is?"
"__ROCK__ Well, the changing music industry is forcing bands to be more self-sufficient and promote themselves."
"__ROCK__ True, it's hard to imagine drug-addled early Ozzy also serving as his own accountant"
"__ROCK__ Exactly - I think that level of self sufficient responsibility being necessary has stifled music and modern creativity in general"
"__ROCK__ If that's true, yeah, I can see why that would kill off the viability of the 'rock star'. Too much social responsibility is required nowadays for people to be throwing TVs out of hotel windows."
