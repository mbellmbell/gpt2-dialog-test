"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So give me your favorite NFL memory."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I'd say The Catch.  When Frisco scored on the Cowboys in the NFC Title."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah.  Montana to Clark.  Great one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How bout you.  What's your favorite NFL memory?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm.  The Fogbowl at Soldier Stadium with the Bears against the Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that was a weird game.  You could hardly see the game as it was being played."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then there was the Icebowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was that the Thanksgiving game between Dallas and the Eagles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, it was Green bay against Dallas to see who was going to go to the first Superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right and GB went on to beat the Colts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Baltimore Colts back then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see that one I was talking about on Thanksgiving where there was ice on the field at Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, against the Dolphins.  I think they call that the snowbowl. It was snow on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right and Leon Lett did the 'Lett factor' again and Dallas lost the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also loved the Superbowl moment when John Elway flung himself sideways over the endzone line for a TD."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a pretty good run those last two seasons to end his carrier that's for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure did.  I wish that Manning had gone out that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was kind of like Montana in that he should have retired a year earlier."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Never want to see the legends decline."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope.  Rather see them go out on top like Elway did."
