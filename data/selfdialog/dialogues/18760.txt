"__MOVIES__ Is Ryan Reynolds a good actor?"
"__MOVIES__ This is a great question."
"__MOVIES__ He did a great job with Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ Then he follows it up with some clunkers."
"__MOVIES__ Its a very strange career path he has taken."
"__MOVIES__ I just think he takes whatever work is offered to him."
"__MOVIES__ You could say that and I would not argue."
"__MOVIES__ But some of the stuff he does is pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ I dont know the Green Lantern movies were terrible."
"__MOVIES__ They werent that bad but they didnt have the allure of some other superhero movies."
"__MOVIES__ DC made it so thats probably why."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Deadpool was going to be terrible if you based it on that."
"__MOVIES__ He probably should stick to that role."
"__MOVIES__ It might get old pretty quick."
"__MOVIES__ I dont think so, especially since its a rated R character."
"__MOVIES__ Could they integrate him into a movie like Infinity Wars?"
"__MOVIES__ They havent really meshed those worlds together just yet."
"__MOVIES__ How long before they do so?"
"__MOVIES__ They dont really need to, those characters can stand on their own"
"__MOVIES__ As a last ditch effort, I could see them doing so"
