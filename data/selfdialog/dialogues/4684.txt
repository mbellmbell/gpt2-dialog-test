"__MUSIC__ So have you been listening to any good music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, though recently I've been on a bit of a 2010s kick."
"__MUSIC__ Feeling nostalgic?"
"__MUSIC__ Hey, in my defense, those years have some great pieces!"
"__MUSIC__ Such as?"
"__MUSIC__ I was listening to Titanium by Guetta and Sia yesterday, that one's pretty great."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, was that really seven years ago?"
"__MUSIC__ Technically it came out in 2011, but yeah, it's pretty old now."
"__MUSIC__ I never would have guessed that. I loved that song!"
"__MUSIC__ It's interesting to see how much Sia's voice has changed since then as well."
"__MUSIC__ True, true. Did Guetta do 'Without You' as well?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep! That's actually the song that got me started on the 2010s kick."
"__MUSIC__ I loved that song, though I didn't actually hear it from Guetta at first."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I originally heard it as a cover by Cimorelli."
"__MUSIC__ The YouTube band with all the sisters?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, that's the one."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, interesting. I prefer the original myself."
"__MUSIC__ Guetta's music is great. When was the last time he released a song?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he's mostly a dj/producer, so last I heard he was doing some music with Justin Bieber."
