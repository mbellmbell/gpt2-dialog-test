"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that Leveon Bell will stay healthy this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure do hope so. He is my favorite running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You like him more than Adrian Peterson?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I do. I like and respect Adrian Peterson though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would really like to know who is faster between Leveon Bell and Antonio Brown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My money would be on Antonio Brown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to give it to Leveon Bell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In my eyes, running backs always seem to be faster than wide receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That may be true. It is their job to run after all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That and the fact that wide receivers are agile when it comes to cutting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder who some of the best downhill running backs in the NFL are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here, I don't really pay too much attention to running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither, except for the new boss Ezekiel Elliott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Ezekiel Elliott is awesome both athletic and personality wise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you seen his hit on Kam Chancellor after Kam Chancellor blindsided him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I haven't what happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After Chancellor hit him, after a play, Elliott was running the ball and dropped a shoulder into Chancellor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet that hurt, Chancellor is the bigger guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but Elliott sent him a pretty good distance backwards."
