"__SUPERHERO__ If you had to choose between batman and superman who would you choose?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Thats a tough one but i think i am going to go with batman"
"__SUPERHERO__ I asked you that because of the movie 'batman vs superman: dawn of justice' where the world had to decide what type of hero they needed"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh i see i didnt really like the movie even though i am a batman fan"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea i agree, it was too much killing in it but i like how they had a cameo with wonder woman in it"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea i was really disappointed in the fight scene where batman and superman go at each other"
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree i felt like the whole movie they just complained about each other, i even felt that batman came off as a big bully the entire film"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea i agree they did make his character unengaged"
"__SUPERHERO__ i really didnt like the way they left people thinking that superman was dead!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea we all know superman is not dead especially with the movie 'Justice League' coming out theres no jusitce league without superman!"
