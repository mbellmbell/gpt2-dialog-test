"__ACTION__ Can't believe Terminator 2 came out 25 years ago."
"__ACTION__ It's crazy, isn't it?  Still one of the better action movies I've ever seen."
"__ACTION__ The whole Terminator series was awesome, but T2 brought it to a whole another level."
"__ACTION__ Arnold was a complete boss in that movie."
"__ACTION__ He was overwhelmed.  The T1000 was the superior machine."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, but the T800 is no slouch.  Plus he looks like Arnold."
"__ACTION__ The rest of the series got pretty bad though."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, once James Cameron left the director's chair, it ran off the rails."
"__ACTION__ Think he'll ever get back in it?"
"__ACTION__ I doubt it.  Doesn't change the fact they were great movies."
