"__MOVIES__ What were your favorite movies as a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ I was always really into Disney movies."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I liked Ghibli a lot better."
"__MOVIES__ Which are those?"
"__MOVIES__ The Miyazaki movies. Like, My Neighbor Totoro. Or Spirited Away."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I never really got into those as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ I can't believe that! They're great."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the one about the fish and didn't really care for it."
"__MOVIES__ You mean Ponyo?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Ponyo."
"__MOVIES__ That's not really my favorite of them. The better ones have more complicated themes."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. Well, it didn't do it for me."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad. I loved them as a kid. And Milo and Otis!"
"__MOVIES__ I also had Milo and Otis! I watched it over and over again."
"__MOVIES__ We never had a copy of it. But I rented it a lot."
"__MOVIES__ We had a copy until my mom got so tired of it that she threw it away."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. That makes sense though."
"__MOVIES__ If you're a parent you have to watch the same movies over and over if your kid is in love with it."
"__MOVIES__ That would drive me crazy."
"__MOVIES__ Me too."
