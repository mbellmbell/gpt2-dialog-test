"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you catch the latest Fast and Furious, The Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I caught it last night!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's great, I caught it a few weeks ago. What were your impressions of it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I really enjoyed it. I liked Charlize Theron as the villain. She is so smooth."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ She's definitely one of my favorites and it was fun to see her in the Fast and the Furious universe now. Cypher!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was hoping to see more action sequences from her because you know she can do some really cool stunts. They kept her as more of the intellectual villain."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I loved her interactions with Dom and how she was manipulating his motivations to turn against his family and team."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The whole movie I was trying to figure out what exactly did she have on him to make him turn considering he's probably the most loyal character in the series."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know! I was guessing the whole way. I really enjoyed that mystery aspect of it, but let's not forget about the crazy action sequences!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I can't forget about that! That's why we go watch the Fast and the Furious!"
