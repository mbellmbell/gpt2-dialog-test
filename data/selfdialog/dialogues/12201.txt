"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! The NFL season starts in September!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait! Who are you following this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm  a lifelong Browns fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aww man they never perform well! Why are you a fan of them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like to stay loyal to the home team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they have any good players this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. They have a couple. What about Joe Thomas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He goes to the Pro Bowl every year. He's gotta be good to make it there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else do they have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well there's also Joe Haden."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How far do you expect them to go this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll admit they would be lucky to win five games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think they may win against?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It depends which team shows up to play. Possibly the Bengals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, the Bengals. Ohio really doesn't have much for a football team. Do they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No we're not known for good NFL football. Who do you follow?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I tend to follow a couple teams. One is the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why because they won the Super Bowl?"
