"__HORROR__ Have you seen The Evil Dead?"
"__HORROR__ The original one or the rebooted version?"
"__HORROR__ The original of course. The new one was good but I don't really count it."
"__HORROR__ Yes I love Evil Dead but I liked part II better."
"__HORROR__ Part II was definitely better with the inanimate objects coming to life and taunting Ash."
"__HORROR__ Oh that was hilarious and frightening at the same time. Is that your favorite scene?"
"__HORROR__ No my favorite scene is when he had to saw off his hand to get the demon out of it."
"__HORROR__ Oh that was horrifying! I don't know if I could have brought myself to do that!"
"__HORROR__ I know I couldn't have. That was very brave of him."
"__HORROR__ He put in so much physicality throughout that entire movie. That's why Bruce Campbell is a cult legend to this day."
