"__DISNEY__ I watched Monsters University finally!"
"__DISNEY__ It took you long enough!"
"__DISNEY__ I think it was even better than the first one! Mike as a child was so cute!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know, he was the cutest little monster. I loved seeing younger Sulley too!"
"__DISNEY__ His hair was so great in it!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and Randall with his glasses!"
"__DISNEY__ I did like all the games, but I have to say I really did miss Boo."
"__DISNEY__ Boo was a great character and it was sad not to see her!"
"__DISNEY__ I think it was interesting they went to the past for the sequel instead of the future."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but this prequel gave us such new information!"
