"__FASHION__ If you could have only one outfit, what would it be?"
"__FASHION__ What do you mean?"
"__FASHION__ I mean if you threw out all your clothes, but could only keep one outfit, what would you keep?"
"__FASHION__ Ahh, right. That's a challenge. I need a moment to think about it."
"__FASHION__ No problem. For me, though, I think I'd keep my shirt, jeans, and also one coat."
"__FASHION__ Which coat?"
"__FASHION__ Probably my trench coat. I think I can get away with wearing that in any weather."
"__FASHION__ Ahhh, right. Outerwear is often more flexible."
"__FASHION__ For shoes, I think I'd have to pick boots. You can also wear those in any weather."
"__FASHION__ But is it really a good idea to walk around in boots all the time?"
"__FASHION__ No. But you CAN walk around in boots all the time. That's the point."
"__FASHION__ Ahh right. For me, I'd probably choose this shirt, jeans, and a coat."
"__FASHION__ What coat?"
"__FASHION__ Well, probably a peacoat."
"__FASHION__ But wouldn't you get hot?"
"__FASHION__ Huh? I don't have to wear the this outfit all the time, do I?"
"__FASHION__ Ahhh, you're right. You don't."
"__FASHION__ For shoes, I feel like normal tennis shoes are pretty flexible."
"__FASHION__ Really?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I wear those during the winter even. They're great."
