"__DISNEY__ Hey mom, what is a good movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Honey, I'm busy. Go watch Alice Through the Looking Glass."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, the movie with Johnny Depp? I heard it was a flop."
"__DISNEY__ No honey, it was good, okay? The time guy was very cool looking."
"__DISNEY__ Wow Mom, do you have a crush on him?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, if I was Alice I would steal the time orb, and try to get the time man to marry me."
"__DISNEY__ I like the mad hatter."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, because you are a little bit mental."
"__DISNEY__ Do you still love me?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I guess so...Go watch the red queen, that's my mood right now."
