"__SUPERHERO__ Are you a fan of the Superman movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Not really, I think I like Spiderman more."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why Spiderman?  He's just a scrawny kid."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, that's probably why."
"__SUPERHERO__ What do you mean?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I mean, he's more relatable.  Superman is an alien."
"__SUPERHERO__ They both have super powers.  You can't really relate to either one."
"__SUPERHERO__ I know, but out of the two, I have more in common with Peter Parker."
"__SUPERHERO__ I guess I see what you are saying."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, he's just a common guy that can kick butt."
