"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of Darth Vadar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought he was a very interesting character. I liked seeing the progression he made."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya it was interesting seeing the first three movies and seeing him a boy knowing he would become Darth Vadar."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked how at the end he came back to the light."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya I really liked that also. I wonder if Luke struggled with Darth Vadar being his father."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he probably did. I'm curious to see what happens with Luke in the new film."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree do you think he is related to Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know. I could see her being related to Obi Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a good guess they do both sound the same and there is a lot about Obi Wan we don't know."
"__STAR_WARS__ I felt the same way about Obi Wan. I want to learn more about him."
