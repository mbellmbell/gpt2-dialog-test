"__MUSIC__ Who's your favorite band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ The only band that matters."
"__MUSIC__ No, multiple bands can matter. Who is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! 'The only band that matters' is another name for The Clash."
"__MUSIC__ I see, I see. What's the deal with The Clash."
"__MUSIC__ They were labeled as 'punk,' but in my opinion, they only put out one true punk album, the rest of the stuff isn't neatly categorized."
"__MUSIC__ Why is it hard to categorize?"
"__MUSIC__ It spanned so many genres: rockabilly, soul, punk, rock, pop, reggae, dub, electronic, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that certainly sounds much more complicated than simply punk."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame that some people don't check them out because they don't like punk."
"__MUSIC__ I never thought of that. How labels influence what bands get listened to."
"__MUSIC__ Right, labels are useful and harmful in all aspects of life, but especially music."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. Kendrick Lamar, to some, is a rapper from the hood, but that's super simplistic, he's also the best storyteller in the past thirty years."
"__MUSIC__ That's a bold claim, but I get what you're saying, genre labels can limit and define."
"__MUSIC__ Back to The Clash, they're your favorite, so probably a difficult question, but what is their seminal album."
"__MUSIC__ London Calling is not just their seminal album. It's the best album of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Another huge claim from you. Why do you think this?"
"__MUSIC__ It's self-assured, it's experimental, it's got a meaningful worldview, and it's still fresh almost thirty years later."
"__MUSIC__ Those are some pretty good criteria. What's the catchiest song on London Calling."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm...Train in Vain for sure, that's a classic pop rock song."
