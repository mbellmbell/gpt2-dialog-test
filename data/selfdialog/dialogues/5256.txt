"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you think there will be another Fast and the Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I just watched the current one and it really seems like there is opportunity for another one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How did you like it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It was pretty good. I didn't think it would be but it was full of great actors."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I really love Jason Statham. He was supposed to be a bad guy but I kind of cried when I thought he died."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was horrible. I thought Dom had turned to the bad side and Jason Statham was becoming a good guy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I thought it was so cute the way Jason Statham rescued Dom's baby."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That baby was adorable. He was right on cue with whatever was said."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, and then Letty was so accepting of the baby."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I can't wait to see what happens in the next movie if they make another one."
