"__STAR_WARS__ I read an interesting fact about Liam Neeson today."
"__STAR_WARS__ Go on, I'm listening."
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently, he's pretty tall, like 76 inches or so I think."
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, where's this going?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Apparently, he was so tall they had to redo the sets for him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  Did they not make them big enough?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess the door frames were too small for him so they had to raise them up."
"__STAR_WARS__ That seems like a pretty big mixup between the designers and casting."
"__STAR_WARS__ It apparently cost them $150,000 to make them bigger."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a lot of cash spent on simple timber!"
