"__MOVIES__ Dude, have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't like science fiction."
"__MOVIES__ That's great because it ain't science fiction, it's fantasy. You like fantasy, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Who doesn't like half-naked people bashing each other with swords? But it takes place in space."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you uneducated worm. Science fiction is based on physical laws, fantasy is anything goes."
"__MOVIES__ I don't get it. There's laws in space. And I'm not a worm."
"__MOVIES__ In science fiction, the writer must establish that the action or plot is able to take place following the physical laws established by the writer. The laws don't have to be the same as in the real world; the author can create alternative laws. Fantasy, in the other hand, requires no physical laws."
"__MOVIES__ I don't get it. What about Star Wars?"
"__MOVIES__ Star Wars is the worst example. Please explain to me how starships can teleport across the galaxy in a matter of minutes? In the last movie, a villain teleported across the galaxy during a conversation."
"__MOVIES__ The ships have special engines."
"__MOVIES__ Did Lucas make any attempt to explain what those engines were?"
"__MOVIES__ They went through hyperspace."
"__MOVIES__ Did he make any attempt to explain hyperspace?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, no."
"__MOVIES__ Lucas totally ignored the fact that it is impossible for vehicles to cross millions of light years of distance in a handful of minutes. At no point did he establish that this was going to be possible in his movies. He left the viewers believing that the action was going to act according to our physical laws."
"__MOVIES__ What if he did address it?"
"__MOVIES__ Then Lucas would have been establishing that the action was taking place in a universe of different laws, which would have been fine."
"__MOVIES__ So, establishing place first can make a book or movie science fiction; not establishing place can make it fantasy?"
"__MOVIES__ That's it buddy."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks, you just ruined movies for me, jerk."
