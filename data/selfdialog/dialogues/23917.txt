"__SUPERHERO__ Hey, did you see the movie Logan with Hugh Jackman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh yes, I seen it the day it came out!"
"__SUPERHERO__ What did you think from one to ten?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I give it an eleven! It was by far the best movie this year in my opinion."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh wow that is saying a lot that makes me wanna take my kids and see it!"
"__SUPERHERO__ The premise is interesting because the Mutants are gone so Logan is isolated in this one."
"__SUPERHERO__ Is Patrick Stewart still in it though?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, he is still there and a few other actors but it starts with Logan all alone."
"__SUPERHERO__ My curiosity is peaked and I am ready for a great thriller movie this summer!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Go see it and you won't be sorry!"
