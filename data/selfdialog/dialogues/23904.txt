"__SUPERHERO__ Who is your favorite catwoman in movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I have to go with the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer."
"__SUPERHERO__ I am torn between her or julie newmar.both were great as catwoman."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree they both were iconic in the role."
"__SUPERHERO__ I think Pfeiffer  may have a slight edge , in that her performance as serena/catwoman was edgier and maybe even sexier too."
"__SUPERHERO__ No need to convince me of her merits, I think she is the ultimate catwoman. I loved batman returns in general though."
"__SUPERHERO__ So you may just be biased to that film?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I still think Pfeiffer deserve top catwoman rank but i am partial to all those actors in the roles. devito is the best as penguin."
"__SUPERHERO__ I believe he is the only penguin on film."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well maybe not in the older batman series/ films.. I believe they featured the penguin but i am not sure, I know they had the joker and catwoman."
