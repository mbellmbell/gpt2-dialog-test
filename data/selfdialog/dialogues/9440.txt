"__BASEBALL__ Did you see that no hitter last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ I quit watching in the 8th, thought for sure he'd blow it."
"__BASEBALL__ Was crazy he actually was perfect through 7 but that one close pitch and he walked the pitcher of all people."
"__BASEBALL__ So what happened past the 8th?"
"__BASEBALL__ The first batter up in the 9th, he actually hit  up on the shoulder...looked like he was done for...was his 111th pitch btw."
"__BASEBALL__ They left him in because of the no hitter?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah so then, like he walked two more batters AND THEY STILL left him in with only a 1 run lead with the bases loaded."
"__BASEBALL__ Man thats crazy...seems like it wouldnt happen in modern era baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ The crazy thing was...the next batter..."
"__BASEBALL__ yeah?"
"__BASEBALL__ He had him in the hole at 3-1 and he got him to bite an up and a away fastball."
"__BASEBALL__ Lol, who swings there?"
"__BASEBALL__ I know...then the next pitch was dead on the corner...I thought it was a ball til the replay with that plate thing."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah?"
"__BASEBALL__ Caught the corner just BARELY."
"__BASEBALL__ So then what?"
"__BASEBALL__ It was all smooth sailing from there...he faced 7 and 8 from there, and they were being fanned all night."
"__BASEBALL__ So much for the ruined no hitter"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah...I was happy though...first one in months, and for once it was for my favorite team.."
"__BASEBALL__ We'll give you that one *laughs*"
