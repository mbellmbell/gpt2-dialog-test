"__STAR_WARS__ Did anyone really think Luke was a little short to be a stormtrooper?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah... I know!  No, he could have decently passed for a storm trooper!"
"__STAR_WARS__ In fact, he had!  Or so I thought.  He was traipsing around the Death Star with Han Solo in storm trooper gear for a while before they managed to make it--basically un-harrassed--to the detention level.  So I would say he DIDN'T draw attention to himself for being short."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe the purpose of that line Princess Leia used, 'Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?' was in there to draw attention to, or further emphasize, the fact that Luke was basically still a teenager...a kid.  Lots of references to this throughout the film.  For example, Han Solo regularly refers to Luke as 'kid...'"
"__STAR_WARS__ You're probably right.  I just can't help but think Leia's line there could have been so much more dramatic--even humorous..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, the banter between Obi Wan Kenobi, too, could have used some serious tinkering, too"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess, overall, at the end of the day--while the original Star Wars trilogy had it's 'meh' dialogue moments and lackluster acting-- it STILL, by far, outshines the later prequels George Lucas decided to crank out"
"__STAR_WARS__ Still nauseated at the over-complicated, boring, political plots and sub-plots that just made most Star Wars' fans miserable...the original trilogy had light-saber-induced limb amputations and surprise familial twists, etc.  The prequels had...what..votes of no confidence in the freakin' senate, and toddler-Vader pod racing and yee-hawing in the desert?  It...there just is no....I mean...is NOTHING sacred?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar action figures and lunch boxes...the HUMANITY!!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know!  Let's hope that DIsney makes it stop....please no more Star Wars abominations and atrocities...!!"
