"__DISNEY__ When i was at the movie theater the other day I saw a trailer for a new Disney movie called Coco. It looks interesting."
"__DISNEY__ I haven't seen any trailers yet. what is it about?"
"__DISNEY__ Its about this boy that learns to play guitar by watching old movies of a famous singer and guitar player."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, that is interesting."
"__DISNEY__ He later goes to where the man is burried and holds his guitar that is on display, and then something happens..."
"__DISNEY__ What happens?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know if he turns into a ghost or he just starts seeing dead people. That happens to his dog too.  It's kind of confusing."
"__DISNEY__ I'm intrigued. So what happens next?"
"__DISNEY__ He finds like a secret town. And then the trailer ends. Its' coming out Thanksgiving weekend of this year."
"__DISNEY__ It's vague but interesting at the same time. Will definitely have to see it."
