"__HARRY_POTTER__ What are you thoughts on harry potter films?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love them like most people."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Do you have a favorite or most disliked character?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I admired Hermione Granger most.  I disliked malfoy most until he somewhat redeemed himself by the last film."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ya then Malfoy's father was really the one to dislike. Hermione was a great character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess they had a big open casting call and emma watson went and won the part."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ya it would not have been the same without her."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Also saw an interview with Emma, they had a clip of ron, harry and hermione scene and she is mouthing the other's lines."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That is really funny. Must have been the first film."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It may have been a test schot even. But ya I guess Emma was just so excited to be in and knew all the lines for everyone!"
