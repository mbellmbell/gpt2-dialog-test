"__THRILLER__ Have you watched Room yet?"
"__THRILLER__ The movie with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay where Brie won an Oscar for best actress?"
"__THRILLER__ That's the one. I watched it last night and it was so good."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah I caught it when it released and was really happy to see Brie get the award for Best Actress. She was so good in her role."
"__THRILLER__ I mean for a movie that had her as a captive for years in an enclosed space with her young son it was so warm and touching. When he escapes to experience life in the outside world for the first time was so touching."
"__THRILLER__ I know what you mean. I was on the edge of my seat when their plan to escape was set into motion and he was in the back of the kidnappers pickup truck."
"__THRILLER__ I was rooting for him to get away. It was one of the most suspenseful moments in a movie I've seen in a long time."
"__THRILLER__ I kept on thinking the kidnapper would come back for them. He was a creepy guy."
"__THRILLER__ I did too. There was such an unsettling feeling and also the tension of the separation from the room for both Brie and Jacob was so heartbreaking."
"__THRILLER__ It was almost like they suffered some sort of Stockholm Syndrome. I really enjoyed Room, such a suspenseful thriller."
