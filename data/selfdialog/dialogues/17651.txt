"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Back to the beach?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. Is it new?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's from the 80's."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't remember ever hearing about it."
"__MOVIES__ It stares Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. And Becky from Full House."
"__MOVIES__ Is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It's one of my favorite 80's movies. I just found it online and was so happy."
"__MOVIES__ What's it like?"
"__MOVIES__ It's typical 80's with beach music and corny outlines, but totally worth it."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a musical?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it's not, but there are some songs and singing in it."
"__MOVIES__ I may have to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ It's so good. Peewee Herman has a small cameo in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no way! That's funny."
"__MOVIES__ He sings The Bird to a group of beach party goers."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Of you can get past the cheesy factor, I think you'd like it."
"__MOVIES__ I love those movies from back then, so I'm sure I will like it."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen it so much I can recite the entire movie."
"__MOVIES__ Then I definitely have to see it."
