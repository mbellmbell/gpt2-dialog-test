"__HORROR__ Were you ever into the Halloween movies?"
"__HORROR__ Yes but I only like part 1. They get kind of repetitive and silly after that."
"__HORROR__ I agree with you. Jamie Lee Curtis did a fantastic job as the Scream Queen in all her horror roles?"
"__HORROR__ Which one was it where she was finally killed by Michael Myers?"
"__HORROR__ I believe that was in Halloween: Resurrection."
"__HORROR__ Right, the one with Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. Even though it was silly I kind of liked it."
"__HORROR__ I liked it too. I also liked Halloween:H20 when she was the dean of the school and Josh Hartnett was her son."
"__HORROR__ That was well done too. I loved the part where she sent her son and girlfriend off and battled Michael by herself."
"__HORROR__ That scene really showed that she'd had enough."
"__HORROR__ It was just a shame that she was killed off in the next one. I would have loved to see her survive the series."
