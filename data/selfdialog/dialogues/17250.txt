"__MOVIES__ Such a shame the movies i loved were never that good"
"__MOVIES__ I mean is that mostly the case"
"__MOVIES__ Huh"
"__MOVIES__ Well we always recall things better than they were"
"__MOVIES__ I guess possibly"
"__MOVIES__ Just gotta take them for face value"
"__MOVIES__ How"
"__MOVIES__ Like enjoy it for what it is"
"__MOVIES__ I know just let down is all"
"__MOVIES__ How are you let down"
"__MOVIES__ Well the spy kids movies arent as good as i thought they were as a kid"
"__MOVIES__ That is part of life"
"__MOVIES__ I guess"
"__MOVIES__ Nah it is"
"__MOVIES__ I tried watching them and well"
"__MOVIES__ Well?"
"__MOVIES__ The acting was stilted and the effects"
"__MOVIES__ Were they bad"
"__MOVIES__ The effects looked so fake"
"__MOVIES__ But that does not make it bad"
