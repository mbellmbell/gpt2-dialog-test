"__MOVIES__ My boyfriend and I recently saw The Fate of the Furious. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I can't recall if I know which movie you are talking about, who are some of the actors in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Girl, you have to know which movie, it's very popular with the guys. It has Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I know which one you are talking about now, I did see it. Did you like the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I actually thought it was one of the best out of the The Fast and the Furious movies. It had a lot of action and was pretty funny too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I liked it too. I don't usually like 'guy' movies, but I thought all of the actors really integrated well and connected."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. My boyfriend really enjoyed it, as you know how men are with action-packed movies, especially with fast cars!"
"__MOVIES__ That's so true, but it's nice when us girls actually get to like it too! Sometimes, I'm ready to fall asleep with some movies."
"__MOVIES__ I thought that is how I would be, but I was totally involved with the movie, from beginning to end."
"__MOVIES__ The actors in the movie really fit the roles they had in the movie, I thought. What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I thought Charlize Theron was really good too, I loved her dreadlocks in it!"
"__MOVIES__ She actually could pull that hairstyle off! Did you like Kurt Russell in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I realized that he has aged more than I realized though. I bet he is in his 70s?"
"__MOVIES__ I think you are right? He has been with Goldie Hawne for about 30 years or so, did you know that?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I didn't realize they had been together that long!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but never married."
"__MOVIES__ Well, after so many years, what's the point?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, why ruin it, if it works."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I would definitely recommend the movie to my friends."
"__MOVIES__ Me too!"
