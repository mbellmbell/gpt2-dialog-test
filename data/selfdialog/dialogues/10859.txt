"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, do you follow football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lucky you, still enjoying the trophy?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah right, that game was really crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate the Patriots but even I have to admit that was insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah man, I will never forget that win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ About the Patriots? They will probably go deep into the playoffs but I don't know about the Superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just think Brady is getting a little old, and he can still play well but I don't know about another Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are the best team in the league right now aren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All-around, coaching included, probably yes, but the Falcons are going to be hot with revenge, man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True that Atlanta coach is probably still fuming."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plotting ways of revenge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hahaha, anyway, I think if the Patriots aren't the best team in the league the Seahawks are because of defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots have a nasty defense though too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but they are all getting older and the rest of the league is figuring them out now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can study Tom Brady for years and still not have him 'figured out'. Look at the last Superbowl as an example."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good luck this year man, try not to deflate any balls this time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very funny."
