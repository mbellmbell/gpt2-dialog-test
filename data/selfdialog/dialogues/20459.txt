"__MOVIES__ So, what would you say is one of your all time favorite horror films?"
"__MOVIES__ Shoot.. I think it'd be a tie between Evil Dead 2 and Nightmare on Elm Street 3."
"__MOVIES__ What do you like about those movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well, Evil Dead 2 is one of the few movies I've ever seen that could combine horror and comedy os successfully without being too ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that did a pretty of it."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, the way Ash throws off those one liners 'Swallow this' was just awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Course, you know my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, 'Groovy!'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__MOVIES__ And let's not forgot one of the coolest things of all time, The chainsaw hand!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that is a classic!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know!  He has to cut off his own hand when it gets possessed, so, he's just, 'Well, let's replace this with something.'"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and he puts a chainsaw on it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and speaking of possessed hands, the scene where his hand goes crazy and starts smashing plats over his head is funny as well."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, that's a classic moment of cinema."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah.  You put this film on and you have an instant party movie."
"__MOVIES__ I have to admit though, I didn't really like the ending at the time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, I was like, 'Ahh, we went through all that, just for THAT to happen?'"
"__MOVIES__ You know, it's funny, I actually felt the same way about the first movie.."
