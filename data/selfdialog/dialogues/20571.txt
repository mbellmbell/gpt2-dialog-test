"__MOVIES__ What do you think the best movie lastyear was?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd have to say it was Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't gotten to see it yet."
"__MOVIES__ You have to see it, he is an evolution of super hero."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't he just a mercenary?"
"__MOVIES__ He's so much more that that, but yes he kills a LOT of people."
"__MOVIES__ Whats so great about it though?"
"__MOVIES__ It's just how he acts; there are so many 4th wall breaks it's like you're actually in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Ryan Reynolds, nude for most of it."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of superhero movie is this?"
"__MOVIES__ The kind that is awesome."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't seem like a kids movie though."
"__MOVIES__ That is absolutely true, but it's great that there is finally a hero that gets things done."
"__MOVIES__ So it's basically one long snuff film?"
"__MOVIES__ It is so much more than that, he is very quick with a weapon, but he is much quicker with a quip."
"__MOVIES__ I still don't see the appeal."
"__MOVIES__ Trust me you would love this movie; it's the funniest thing you will see for a long time."
"__MOVIES__ Until Deadpool 2 comes out I assume?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely; you can come if you want, but I'm gonna watch the blue-ray right now."
