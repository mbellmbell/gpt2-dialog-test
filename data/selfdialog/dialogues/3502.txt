"__MUSIC__ What is the one song that takes you back to the past?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that is easy 'Stand Strong' by Burton Cummings."
"__MUSIC__ Why does that song take you back."
"__MUSIC__ It came out in 1976, I was in college and my boyfriend had broken up with me. He was my first love and broke my heart."
"__MUSIC__ What is it about the song you like?"
"__MUSIC__ It says, 'stand strong, don't you fall, don't you go do something foolish, all you are feeling right now is silly human pride'."
"__MUSIC__ Was you thinking about doing something foolish?"
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking about dropping out of school so I would not have to run into him."
"__MUSIC__ Did you run into him? Did he start dating someone else?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes on both questions but I would go back to my dorm, play that song and cry."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever get over him?"
"__MUSIC__ It is a funny thing, I never think about him until I hear that song."
"__MUSIC__ Well, look at the man you have now. I am sure you are better off."
"__MUSIC__ So much better off. My grand-daughter recently had her heart broken, I looked it up on youtube and played it for her."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, how sweet what did she think?"
"__MUSIC__ She thought it was stupid. I said, listen to the words and played it again."
"__MUSIC__ After listening to it again, did she understand the song."
"__MUSIC__ No, she said, why would anyone do something foolish when there are so many more boys to choice from."
"__MUSIC__ This generation are so use to instant fixes they barely have time to feel anything."
"__MUSIC__ I guess but when you are going through it a good song can always help."
