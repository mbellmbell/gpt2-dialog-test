"__STAR_WARS__ I like Yoda from the movie EMPIRE STRIKES BACK."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda was funny with that Grover voice."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the way he talked."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. He would say things a lot different."
"__STAR_WARS__ He reminds me of like an old wise man."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Yoda was like 700 years old or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ He looked old but used his light saber in that other movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was really short."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and he had the wobble when he walked."
"__STAR_WARS__ I miss Yoda."
