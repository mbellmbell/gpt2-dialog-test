"__POP__ Do you like Maroon 5?"
"__POP__ Absolutely.  They are one of my favorite bands."
"__POP__ Every album has such great songs.  'Songs about Jane' was one of my favorite albums."
"__POP__ I think one thing that I wish they didn't do was collaborate with so many hip-hop artists."
"__POP__ I like those collaborations.  'Don't Wanna Know' featuring Kendrick was so good."
"__POP__ That one I didn't mind, but 'Cold' featuring Future was weak in my opinion."
"__POP__ I have mixed feelings about that one."
"__POP__ I think overall, Maroon 5's sound is already good as is, and the majority of rappers they featured have not added value to the song."
"__POP__ Who do you think is the biggest culprit of this?"
"__POP__ I severely disliked Wiz Khalifa's feature in 'Stereo Hearts' because not only was the rapping underwhelming, but the language and tempo just didn't fit."
