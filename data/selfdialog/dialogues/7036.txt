"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hey Tom, did you see the big game last night?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think so. You mean the hockey game right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah it was the Pittsburgh Penguins against the Chicago Blackhawks."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I was glued to that game from start to finish."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Same here! So many shots were fired just in the first period."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Not only were they fired, but they were scored goals too!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah by the second period both teams were already up 3 points, which is crazy for a normal hockey game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No doubt! Did you see how Smith from the Blackhawks completely knocked out Barry on the Penguins?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Of course! They only replayed the highlights of that all game long!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It was honestly one of the most brutal hockey clashes I have ever seen."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Same here man, I just wish I could have been there to see it in person."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Right? That would have been incredible! Have you ever been to a hockey game yourself?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ My father actually took me once when I was about 8 years old, we saw the Kings going against the Bruins!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That must have been amazing! Were you hooked from then on?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Definitely, I had never been at such an exciting event in my life; needless to say I was a fan for life from then on."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That is great dude! So...you were obviously rooting for the Penguins last night, right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Not just rooting for the Penguins, I cheered, screamed and ran around the house for the Penguins. They had to win!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I was probably not as hyped up as you, but I was extremely excited to see the Penguins take a 4 point lead in the final period."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It seemed like after the second period ended, the Blackhawks were tired and falling apart."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Definitely! That is why the Penguins started mopping the floors as soon as they took that one point lead!"
