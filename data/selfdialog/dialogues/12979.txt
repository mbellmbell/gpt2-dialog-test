"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the Packers secondary?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, its weird. I think they have good players and talent, but they dont seem to produce."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that's Dom Capers fault?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dont know. But when you look at the roster, they should be better. Haha Clinton Dix and Burnett are solid safeties. And Demarious Randall has talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but in today's NFL, corners are sooo important."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and I think the Sam Shields injury really hurt the Packers secondary last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah you may have a point there. In the playoff game they had Gunter covering Julio Jones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. You can't expect much success in that situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Gunter was probably the best corner on the Packers last year. But on most teams, and in the Packers ideal world, he would be a nickel back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. I think that shows how damaging the injury bug is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In today's NFL secondary. Depth is key."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, these days you need three or four good corners to cover whatever the NFL throws at you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the base defense has become the nickel. You need three corners on the field all day, and if you have injury problems, pretty soon you're going to have some bad players out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this is precisely what happened to the Packers defense last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they did add a few corners in the draft I believe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they took Washington's Kevin King early in the second round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm excited to see him play. He looks very talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, scouts said he was a first round talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read he has freakish athletic ability, is that true?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't seen him play before but I heard his arms are crazy long."
