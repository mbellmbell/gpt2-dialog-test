"__MOVIES__ I just feel like asking, but are you a fan of the Friday film series?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean Friday the 13th, like with Jason Voorhees?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I mean the Friday films, with Ice Cube."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I'm not sure I've seen those before."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well I guess there's no point in me asking."
"__MOVIES__ It's fine. You can tell me about them if you'd like."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, then. Basically it's about a guy living in a ghetto neighborhood in Southern California that experiences conflicts particularly on Friday."
"__MOVIES__ The series, or just one movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Basically the whole series. The first one revolves around Ice Cube and Chris Tucker's characters of Craig and Smokey dealing with a neighborhood bully named Deebo, who's played by Tommy Lister Jr."
"__MOVIES__ Is it funny at all?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is. the whole series is of comedy movies."
"__MOVIES__ Alright then. Tell me more."
"__MOVIES__ The second one takes place some time later, and revolves around Craig and his cousin Day Day, who's played by Mike Epps, dealing with a family of thugs that live across the street from them."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds pretty similar to the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the three of them are pretty similar. The third and last one is about Craig and Day Day trying to collect rent money after being robbed by 'Santa Claus' on Christmas Eve."
"__MOVIES__ Now that just sounds silly."
"__MOVIES__ It is, but trust me. They're pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any other actors in those movies that I might recognize."
"__MOVIES__ Off the top of my head, I know that John Witherspoon, Terry Crews, Nia Long, and Clifton Powell have all starred in at least one of the movies in the series."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if I find one of those movies on Netflix or anywhere for streaming, I'll give it a watch."
