"__DISNEY__ What's the name of the Warthog from the Lion King again."
"__DISNEY__ Simba?"
"__DISNEY__ No, that's the lion. The main character. The warthog."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure. I know the meerkat is Timon, if that helps."
"__DISNEY__ It doesn't. This has been driving me nuts all day."
"__DISNEY__ Why don't you just google it?"
"__DISNEY__ I would, but my phone is out of battery."
"__DISNEY__ Why don't you just use mine?"
"__DISNEY__ Thanks. It looks like it's Pumbaa."
"__DISNEY__ Of course! Pumbaa!"
