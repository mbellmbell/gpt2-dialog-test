"__LADY_GAGA__ So Lady Gaga is a great pianist."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She does seem to have many talents."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like her singing too but only sometimes."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you mean?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Sometimes she has a more manly voice. It's deeper."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, I see. Yes, that is true."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Like the voice she uses on Poker Face is deeper."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Right, and she sings better on You and I."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, exactly."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I prefer the You and I voice."
