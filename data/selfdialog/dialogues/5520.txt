"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is really cool.  That fight with him and Count Dooku was so awesome because you finally see how powerful he is."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish there were more characters like him in the Star Wars universe. It seems like a lot of the characters are humanoid and not enough aliens."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true.  You'd think in the whole big galaxy humans would be kind of a blip in the radar but Lucas had mostly humans."
"__STAR_WARS__ He used a lot of great practical effects though in 4,5, and 6 I heard."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard he gave kept his franchising rights like for the toys and stuff and everyone thought he was crazy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet they don't think that now do they?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he made millions from all that stuff then sold it to Disney for even more money."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope Disney keeps on making good Star Wars movies."
