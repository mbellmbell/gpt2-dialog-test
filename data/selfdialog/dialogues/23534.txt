"__DISNEY__ What is your all time favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ That's a tough one. Of the older ones, I'd have to say the Aristocats."
"__DISNEY__ I loved that one too, but I'd pick The Jungle Book."
"__DISNEY__ Both of those have great music. What about more recent movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I love all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and Frozen and Moana were both must sees too."
"__DISNEY__ And Finding Dory. I was surprised by that one."
"__DISNEY__ I was too! I really didn't expect to like it."
"__DISNEY__ Ellen DeGeneres is great."
"__DISNEY__ And the plot was good too. I was really afraid it was going to be a bad knockoff, but it was fresh."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. I'd even watch it again."
