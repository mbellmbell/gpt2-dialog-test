"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the last Star Trek movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Into Darkness?"
"__MOVIES__ Umm....I think there was another one, but I did see Into Darkness the other night"
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it. I thought Chris Pine did a really good job again as Capt Kirk"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I like Chris Pine's performance. What did you think of Benedict Cumberbatch?"
"__MOVIES__ He played Khan, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought he was really good, but it's hard to beat Ricardo Montalban's potrayal"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that guy was great. Wasn't he on Fantasy Island as well?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one. Man that was a crazy show"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, anyway...do you still like the Star Trek franchise?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I guess you could say so, but part me wonders if it's getting overused"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I was thinking the same thing"
"__MOVIES__ There are good actors in it, but sometimes the actors don't like sticking around for too long"
"__MOVIES__ True. Kind of like all the super hero series"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, exactly"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think you'll still watch the new Star Trek movies in the theater"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, what about you?"
"__MOVIES__ For sure."
