"__MUSIC__ What did you think of the finale?"
"__MUSIC__ Well if TSoul wasn't in it, I'm definitely glad Chris Blue won!"

"__MUSIC__ I'm really glad a soul musician won."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, soul music really needs to have a renaissance!"
"__MUSIC__ What did you think of the other finalists?"

"__MUSIC__ Yeah same. I'm not a huge fan of country, but love folk Americana."
"__MUSIC__ I liked Jesse a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that guy has some talent. He makes the guitars he plays too!"
"__MUSIC__ No way!?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, really. I know its crazy sounding."
"__MUSIC__ That girl Aaliyah was amazing too, especially given her age."
