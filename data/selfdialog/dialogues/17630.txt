"__MOVIES__ I still haven't seen the last Hobbit movie, should I?"
"__MOVIES__ Depends, did you like the first two?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but not as much Lord of the Rings."
"__MOVIES__ You are not alone in that sentiment."
"__MOVIES__ There was just a sort of magic lost using so much CGI."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, but I still think they're good films overall."
"__MOVIES__ True but you can't help but compare the two series."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not, especially since they're both done by Peter Jackson."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll watch it, can't lose much by doing so."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's just such a committment to sit down for three hours."
"__MOVIES__ That's why I haven't gotten around to it yet."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I remember you falling asleep in theaters during the second one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but I was just super tired that day, the movie didn't help."
"__MOVIES__ I felt the urge to nod off but Smaug was too cool to sleep on."
"__MOVIES__ I'm so bummed out I missed the Smaug scene."
"__MOVIES__ You missed great stuff, you haven't gone back to watch it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope because if I fell asleep once maybe I'll do it again."
"__MOVIES__ Guess that's true, the movie as a whole doesn't get any better."
"__MOVIES__ But I feel out of respect for Tolkien I should give them another shot."
"__MOVIES__ If you do I'll gladly come over for a viewing party."
