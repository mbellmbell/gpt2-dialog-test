"__MUSIC__ Hey, you know I've been wanting to learn how to play guitar lately."
"__MUSIC__ At this stage of your life?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I've been hearing this kid that my daughter listens to lately called Ed Sheeran."
"__MUSIC__ And what? You like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he sound great. But what I like is how simple every song is."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it is simple for him since he is a musician."
"__MUSIC__ No, but I mean that this kid gets up on stage by himself just using a guitar and entertains crowds."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I think you are a bit to old for this."
"__MUSIC__ You're not getting the point. I want to make music in a simple way too, like I've always wanted."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, ok. So you want to become a pop star on your own."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! That's going a bit too far."
"__MUSIC__ What is it then?"
"__MUSIC__ Just jam and express my self. I mean, it can't be that hard."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you'll need at least a year of practice first. Do you have the time?"
"__MUSIC__ I'll make the time. And then we can sing some songs together."
"__MUSIC__ Kareoke style, and impress our wives!"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I'm talking about."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'll learn some bongo to accompany you."
"__MUSIC__ That Ed Sheeran kid will copy us and start bringing a bongo man to the stage with him."
"__MUSIC__ I have no doubt about that."
