"__MUSIC__ Hey what are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Hi.  I'm listening to 'Despacito,' by Luis Fonsi."
"__MUSIC__ I love that song!"
"__MUSIC__ It is unbelievably catchy.  And I love reggaeton and other Latin music."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that about you.  Also, didn't Justin Bieber sing that song?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  Originally, it was by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, but Justin did a cover with them in English."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I see.  It's cool that they did that."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  The collaboration definitely boosted the popularity of the song even more than before."
"__MUSIC__ Bieber's influence, whether you like him or not, seems to be quite far-reaching."
"__MUSIC__ That is an understatement.  Did you know by the way this was the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard 100 since 'Macarena?'"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that.  I can't believe it has been that long since a Spanish language song got on Billboard."
"__MUSIC__ I'm really happy about it.  It's a great genre that more people should appreciate."
"__MUSIC__ What other songs or artists do you listen to in the genre?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the featured artist in 'Despacito,' Daddy Yankee, I really like.  His song 'Senorita' with Reykon is one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ I think I've heard of Reykon before."
"__MUSIC__ He's very popular so you probably have.  That song I just mentioned is another example of Reggaeton."
"__MUSIC__ Is that different from something like 'Danza Kuduro?'  That song I really liked."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's very different.  I think they're both technically reggaeton, but 'Danza Kuduro' almost had elements of meregue in it."
"__MUSIC__ What are other examples of Merengue?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Si Te Vas' by Omega might fall under that category too."
