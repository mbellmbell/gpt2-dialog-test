"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what will the Patriots do to cheat this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who knows...it's something every single year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely...I call them the Cheatriots and their coach is Bill Belicheat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love that...and couldn't agree more. Every one of their super bowl wins is tainted in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And people who think Belichick is great are kidding themselves...he stinks without Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh definitely. He was nothing with the Jets and nothing with the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only player on that team that I like is Gronk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like him too...pains me to say I like a Patriot though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Edleman isn't bad either...I don't know how they always find these little receivers with talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know...him, Welker, Amendola...same types."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm personally hoping that someone...anyone...wins the AFC East but the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do to...same old same old every season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Brady claims he's going to play until he's 50."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He'll probably find  way to cheat his way into doing it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That 4th quarter in the super bowl last season was amazing though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll have to admit, it was. But I think the Falcons gave it away more than the Patriots won it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe the Jets will surprise everyone in the East this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right...maybe I'll grow 3 feet by tomorrow!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, probably have about the same chance!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly... but I do love the Jets so I hope they just don't embarrass themselves this year."
