"__STAR_WARS__ Did you watch the scene after the credits in The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course I did!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't believe Luke Skywalker is just hiding on an island."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me either! It's so funny!"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's funny that they went through all the trouble to find the map piece."
"__STAR_WARS__ It made for a fun movie though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it did!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke Skywalker's and Rey's stand off was everything to me!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved that part!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can only hope that they are somehow related."
