"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks confuse me in general. Last year you guys beat the Patriots in an amazing game, but then you also had that 6-6 game against the Cardinals and then a 9-3 game against the Rams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any team with a good DLine or some sort of elite pass rusher can give Seattle a ton of difficulties."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like against those teams Wilson is under pressure for a good majority of all drop backs and it just throws off the offense completely."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's because they haven't had any quality OL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Rams had decided to go with the super athletic, high ceiling players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ well, tom cable also does not care about pass protection."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rams are 4-2 in the last 6 meetings. I don't know how to explain it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jeff Fisher's superbowl was the good team(s) in the NFC West."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder how Browns fans immediately reacted after that fake fumble in the Skins game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude we were all so mad. Cost us the game, that and the pseudo unsportsmanlike conduct call on Pryor. Infuriating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We're the only team besides the Packers that Rodgers hasn't beat yet"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just need to play them in the Superbowl and its a guaranteed win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Colts man. We're like 3-18 in our last 21 matchups."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ how did you manage to win 3 games? asking for a friend"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There it is Titans. If you want to break the streak just get you a Von Miller. Easy peasy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If we're like 14-0 going in, sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Philip Rivers always beats us. Doesn't matter how. Doesn't matter when. He could literally beat us with half his starters on IR."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I was going to mention this. He seems to carve up those Seattle cover 3 defenses"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pats are the Bills kryptonite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bills fans know how to talk a big game, but secretly in week 4 last year we were all terrified that the Bills would find a way to lose to Julian Edelman at QB."
