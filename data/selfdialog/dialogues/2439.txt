"__MUSIC__ So I was listening to Amber Run the other day"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've ever heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ They're an Indie pop band from the UK, they've had a few singles in the US recently."
"__MUSIC__ Weird, I normally consider myself up on the indie scene. Any songs I might know?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, to tell the truth, I only just started listening to them--the one I like is called 'I Found.'"
"__MUSIC__ Hm, that actually sounds familiar. Is it a cappella?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but they did do a cover with the London voice singers or something."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's it! That's a great song, I loved it!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh awesome! I just discovered it last week."
"__MUSIC__ I wish songs like that made the top 40 more often, more people should hear about it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I only heard about it because my sister's dancing to it."
"__MUSIC__ Ballet?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it's a contemporary or lyrical piece, I think. I heard it and loved it."
"__MUSIC__ Very cool; I stumbled upon the a cappella version on YouTube."
"__MUSIC__ YouTube recommendations can have some great songs."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed, sometimes I like the covers even more than the originals."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. Anyway, Amber Run's cool, they have a few albums now."
"__MUSIC__ Do you recommend any in particular?"
"__MUSIC__ 5am is the only one I've heard songs from so far, and it's great."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll check it out!"
