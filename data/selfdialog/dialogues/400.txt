"__MUSIC__ Do you like to talk about music?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes.  Lately, when I work out, I listen to ABBA."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I would not have thought that that would be a good band to listen to while working out."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  Something about the pop-nature of it and the beats makes it good."
"__MUSIC__ I think ABBA is from Sweden."
"__MUSIC__ When I went to Sweden my friends told me that there was an ABBA museum."
"__MUSIC__ Did you go to the museum?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I'm not that big of a fan of ABBA."
"__MUSIC__ But I thought you said that you liked listening to their music."
"__MUSIC__ I do, but I don't really want to know all about their lives."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  I like listening to songs but I don't need to know everything about their personal life.  The fan culture these days is really excessive."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there are a lot of crazy fans."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  Some artists have been stalked or even killed by their so-called fans."
"__MUSIC__ That's terrible.  There is a lot of mental health problems these days."
"__MUSIC__ I think sometimes, some people are so disconnected from reality, they think that they know the singers."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  And it seems that artists have to give more and more of their personal life to fans to satisfy their desire to feel close to them."
"__MUSIC__ Some people don't seem to mind, but others seem very private."
"__MUSIC__ You could wear a wig like Sia."
"__MUSIC__ I like Sia.  I think she is very talented."
"__MUSIC__ She is, both as a singer and songwriter."
