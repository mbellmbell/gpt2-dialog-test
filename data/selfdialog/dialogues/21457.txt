"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I love Mulan. It's so full of girl power!"
"__DISNEY__ I've never watched it before. What's it about?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, the main girl, Mulan, takes her father's place to train and fight in the Chinese army. She pretends to be a man the entire time, while learning how to fight."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds exciting and frightening at the same time! She got caught eventually, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh definitely. But the general didn't have her killed since she previously saved his life."
"__DISNEY__ So what happens next?"
"__DISNEY__ Mulan saves the day by defeating her enemies all by herself and becomes a respected member in her family."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, sounds like I definitely have to watch this. I can't believe I haven't heard of Mulan until you told me."
"__DISNEY__ You will not regret watching it. After the end of the movie, I bet that you'll want to sign up for martial arts lessons!"
