"__BASEBALL__ Well I guess the Astros are for real. They now have the best record in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ They have been impressive the past two nights beating the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ They won't get a chance for a third straight win until tomorrow."
"__BASEBALL__ Why's that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Game just got rained out I saw. Yankees are probably relieved."
"__BASEBALL__ Who's been the Astros best hitter this year? Don't hear much about them."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess Altuve, they've been pretty balanced."
"__BASEBALL__ Are they going to play a doubleheader tomorrow?"
"__BASEBALL__ I doubt it, will probably make it up later in the year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, doubleheaders usually seem to be later in the summer."
"__BASEBALL__ Plus tomorrow is Jeter night on ESPN and they wouldn't want to have the first game run late."
"__BASEBALL__ That's true, I forgot about that."
"__BASEBALL__ The Cardinals are suddenly in first place now. How did that happen?"
"__BASEBALL__ Are they? Jeez, didn't they start like 4-10."
"__BASEBALL__ Something like that, although they did lose last night to the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ That whole division is close, I think the Cubs are near the bottom."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, for now, I don't see it lasting though."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, no way the Cubs are going to finish below the Reds."
"__BASEBALL__ Well at this rate...they don't seem to have their heads in the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Still 100+ games to go though."
