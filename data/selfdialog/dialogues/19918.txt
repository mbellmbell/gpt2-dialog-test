"__MOVIES__ So at the weekend I was trying to find a film to watch with all the family, and I settled on 'The Best of Laurel and Hardy'."
"__MOVIES__ You can't beat the classics! How did the family find it?"
"__MOVIES__ The children giggled from start to end. It was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ That's really good to hear! You always worry slightly when introducing them to something you love yourself."
"__MOVIES__ They still stand the test of time. The pacing is slower than we're used to these days but the gags and the slapstick are just as good."
"__MOVIES__ Is the film a collection of clips?"
"__MOVIES__ Not quite - more a collection of scenes. They've all been hand-colored too."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What was their favourite scene?"
"__MOVIES__ It's hard to choose just one. The one where they break into the police commissioners house probably."
"__MOVIES__ I like the piano moving scene myself."
"__MOVIES__ Now you're talking! Lots of scenes that had to be filmed in just one take too!"
"__MOVIES__ Imagine that? Getting it right first time, every time..."
"__MOVIES__ Laurel and Hardy get the credit, and that's only right, but a lot of praise has to go to the bald guy too."
"__MOVIES__ The one with the funny eye and mustache?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, him. See, we don't even know his name."
"__MOVIES__ I do. James Finlayson."
"__MOVIES__ How did you know that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm a bit of a film buff aren't I?"
"__MOVIES__ OK, so tell me something else I don't know about Laurel and Hardy."
"__MOVIES__ Oliver Hardy's real name was Norvell Hardy."
