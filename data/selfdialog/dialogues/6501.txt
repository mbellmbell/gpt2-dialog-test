"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think it's weird that a lightsaber training device just happened to aboard the Millennium Falcon in Ep. 4?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That floating orb that popped Luke a couple of times?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah man, Han says that he doesn't believe in the force yet this device just happens to be on the ship."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it was a leftover relic from a smuggling operation."
"__STAR_WARS__ You know that could be. I never thought about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is there a mandatory sentence minimum for Star Wars smugglers?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I bet it depends on the cargo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is there an Imperial jail somewhere? Now that is something I would like to see."
"__STAR_WARS__ If you think about it the Death Star is like a flying jail. I mean where are you going to go?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess Vader was the first Imperial jail warden."
