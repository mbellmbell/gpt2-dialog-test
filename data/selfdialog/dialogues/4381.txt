"__MUSIC__ I've really been wanting to get into jazz, but I'm not sure where to start."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm. Well, why do you want to listen to it?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the jazz I've heard in snippets, but I don't know very much about it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm not an expert, but I have some artists I like."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm pretty big on Duke Ellington. I especially like 'Star Crossed Lovers.'"
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of that, but I could give it a try."
"__MUSIC__ Then, I feel like Nat King Cole is a must."
"__MUSIC__ That's a name I recognize, at least!"
"__MUSIC__ Also Miles Davis. Maybe starting with 'Blue in Green.'"
"__MUSIC__ You said you didn't know much about Jazz, but it seems like you know a lot."
"__MUSIC__ I'm actually surprised at myself, I didn't think I did!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I appreciate it."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you usually listen to, if it's not jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm actually very big into classical music."
"__MUSIC__ Could you give me any recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I really like Liszt's piano concertos."
"__MUSIC__ Could you lend me a CD?"
"__MUSIC__ Only if you lend me some of the jazz you like."
"__MUSIC__ It's a deal!"
