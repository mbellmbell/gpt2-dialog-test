"__POP__ What do you think about pop music?"
"__POP__ I really don't."
"__POP__ Well, okay, I'm asking you to think about it."
"__POP__ I guess I'd say that it all sounds the same to me."
"__POP__ All about meeting someone you'd like to hook up with?"
"__POP__ Yeah! And you know I can't relate to that."
"__POP__ Yeah. My own pet peeve about it is the vast number of times they throw 'yeah' and 'tonight' into a song."
"__POP__ I know what you mean! It's like they're not even trying."
"__POP__ Yeah, there have been some really well written pop songs in the past though."
"__POP__ I kinda like Fun's song I Wanna Be The One."
