"__STAR_WARS__ How do you feel about episodes 1-3 of Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hated those movies, they were the worst."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they have the worst characters, like Jar Jar Binks."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar Binks was so annoying and he didn't do anything to help move the plot."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was only there for comic relief and even then he was horrible."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think R2-D2 was better at creating laughs."
"__STAR_WARS__ The droid who doesn't talk gets the most laughs!"
"__STAR_WARS__ R2 was always so sassy."
"__STAR_WARS__ We need him to make up for C3PO's stuffiness."
