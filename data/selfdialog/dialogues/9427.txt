"__BASEBALL__ Did you catch the Phillies game yesterday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Against the Rangers?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, man. Can't believe they blew it again."
"__BASEBALL__ Seriously. Their bullpen is terrible."
"__BASEBALL__ I really thought they would be better this year too."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too man, Joely gave up 6 runs in one inning!"
"__BASEBALL__ It's crazy. They have nobody they can turn to in the pen right now."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, even Neris and Benoit are throwing awful. They have one of the worst pens in the league."
"__BASEBALL__ For sure, at least their hitters are turning it around though."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that's true. I saw Franco hit another dinger."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he's starting to hit a bit better. I think his batting average is up a bit..."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and Tommy Joseph too."
"__BASEBALL__ True. Although Odubel is really slumping."
"__BASEBALL__ Seriously, what's up with that? Of an all stay year too."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know, I'm worried that extension is going to his head..."
"__BASEBALL__ Man, I hope not. They really need a couple of these guys to stick."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, Altherr looks legit"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he might be the real deal. Luckily they have a good minors system"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah - if only the bullpen wasn't awful right?"
"__BASEBALL__ True that! They need to make a trade, I think"
