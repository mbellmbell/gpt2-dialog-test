"__MUSIC__ Did you ever listen to Nirvana and Pearl Jam when we were younger?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I loved that Grunge rock stuff.  It was my favorite in the nineties."
"__MUSIC__ Mine, too!  I even learned to play the guitar so I could play along."
"__MUSIC__ I remember the night Kurt Cobain died.  I was watching MTv and they had nonstop coverage."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was really tragic.  Pearl Jam had great music, though."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what happened to them."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  All those bands seemed to kinda disappear."
"__MUSIC__ I loved the Smashing Pumpkins, too.  A lot of people thought they were weird but I liked them."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't the singer Billy Corbin or something like that?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I just listened to their music.  But it had a unique, electronic sound."
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was strange.  I do remember that one song 'Today' that was a little catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was one of their bigger hits but their lesser known songs were great."
"__MUSIC__ I never bought any of their albums."
"__MUSIC__ You were missing out.  What about Soundgarden?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to like them, too.  And Candlebox!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I had their album but they were more of a one hit wonder."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you could call them that.  Did you ever listen to Rage Against the Machine?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't really call them grunge."
"__MUSIC__ No, but they were from the same era."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I didn't like their sound.  It didn't have a beat."
