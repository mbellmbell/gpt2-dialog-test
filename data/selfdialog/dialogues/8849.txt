"__BEATLES__ Hi, there. Are you a Beatles fan?"
"__BEATLES__ Not really, although I do like some of their songs."
"__BEATLES__ Which songs do you like?"
"__BEATLES__ I like the earlier songs, like I Want to Hold Your Hand and She Loves You."
"__BEATLES__ I like all of their different phases. Have you listened to the Sgt. Pepper album?"
"__BEATLES__ I know a couple songs from it, like Help From My Friends, but I like Joe Cocker's version better."
"__BEATLES__ No offense, but I think he ruined it. I don't like Beatles covers. Why mess with perfection?"
"__BEATLES__ Wow, you must be a die-hard Beatles fan."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I am. I've loved them since February, 1964 when I saw them on Ed Sullivan."
"__BEATLES__ That's cool. They were a really big deal for your generation."
