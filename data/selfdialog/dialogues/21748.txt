"__DISNEY__ What was the last Disney movie you saw?"
"__DISNEY__ Does Star Wars count?"
"__DISNEY__ Nah, let's say classic Disney animated movies only."
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm, Frozen if you're going by the strict definition."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean by strict definition?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, if I google a list, Wikipedia gives me all sorts of Disney and Disney affiliated movies."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, there's Zootopia, which was Disney but no princess. Plus Disney acquired Pixar so there's Finding Dory and the like."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, and they own Marvel now too!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, hopefully we'll have some better female centric Marvel movies now that DC has raised the bar with Wonder Woman."
