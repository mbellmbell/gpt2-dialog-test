"__SUPERHERO__ Do you think Marvel will continue making super hero films?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes they are funded by Disney."
"__SUPERHERO__ I forgot about that."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah so they only have phases but I cannot see them actually stopping."
"__SUPERHERO__ Have they announced phases going forward?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Not after the third one."
"__SUPERHERO__ So maybe the 4th they have new actors take over the characters?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think that could be a possibility"
"__SUPERHERO__ It would be weird to see a new Captain America"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah I think so too"
