"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like Princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about her particularly interested you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, she is as much of a Jedi as Luke, for starters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Despite that potential, Leia stayed pretty traditional though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Perhaps, but we do not know what happened before the new trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, and the gold bikini changed everybody's lives to some extent!"
"__STAR_WARS__ True.     Leia was not only a sex-object, but a tremendous General and warrior!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think was the bravest thing Leis did?"
"__STAR_WARS__ By far, her trip to save Han Solo has to be viewed as the highlight."
