"__DISNEY__ Well you know of my fear of Ursula from 'The Little Mermaid' and Chernabog from 'Fantasia.' What was the creepiest thing you saw in a Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I think that would have to be Cruella De Ville from '100 Dalmations.'"
"__DISNEY__ Why Cruella? Sure she seems crazy but what about her?"
"__DISNEY__ Well she wanted to make clothes out of those puppies!"
"__DISNEY__ I think the fact that she wanted to kidnap puppies in general is pretty terrifying."
"__DISNEY__ Monster of a feat by the way, kidnapping that many puppies."
"__DISNEY__ I know right, she had to have known it wasn't going to work out."
"__DISNEY__ Exactly, there are 100 of them and one of her?"
"__DISNEY__ Well no, I think she had henchman."
"__DISNEY__ I think you're right, she had two from what I can remember."
