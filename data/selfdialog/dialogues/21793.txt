"__DISNEY__ That new person at work is going to end up with a nose like Pinocchio!"
"__DISNEY__ What? Made of wood?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I mean if he doesn't stop lying his nose will grow like Pinocchio's did."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I follow you now!"
"__DISNEY__ He had a tough time poor old Pinocchio.  He was led astray!"
"__DISNEY__ Remember Candlewick when Pinocchio goes to Pleasure Island?"
"__DISNEY__ I do, he was the guy who turned in to a donkey?"
"__DISNEY__ That's the one, I though he deserved it."
"__DISNEY__ I wasn't a massive fan of Mangiafuoco either."
"__DISNEY__ No but the scene with the dancing puppets was great!"
