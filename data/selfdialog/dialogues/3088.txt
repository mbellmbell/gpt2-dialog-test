"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Schenkerian Analysis?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a love-hate relationship with it."
"__MUSIC__ What do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's very musical in how it interprets pieces. It shows a clear forward momentum to big moments."
"__MUSIC__ It works really well with phrase rhythm, too."
"__MUSIC__ But, I hate it at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ It's so limited in its use: German pieces, 1650-1850, and that's about it."
"__MUSIC__ Why not other musics?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Schenker himself refused as he is racist."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he wouldn't touch French music."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, That's not cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, also German music is pretty simple from the background while being super complicated up front."
"__MUSIC__ So?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Russian, French, American, South American, Asian, African musics...none of this applies unless they directly studied with a long chain of Germans."
"__MUSIC__ So, it's useful but only sometimes?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it shouldn't be the main focus. It should show voice-leading patterns but not be the center point."
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking of using it on Shostakovich."
"__MUSIC__ Dude...no."
