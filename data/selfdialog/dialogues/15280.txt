"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just went back and rewatched the first couple of Harry Potter movies, and... you know, they're... kind of not good."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You just noticed that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know; they seemed great at the time. But they don't really... work as movies, at all."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No, they don't. It's not until the third movie, when they get in a real director, that they start to stand alone."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Stand alone -- yeah. I kinda feel like they expected me to have the book open in my lap while I was watching."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think Chris Columbus was just scared of taking any liberties, so instead of making a coherent movie he just adapted a series of memorable scenes, verbatim, with little in the way of connective tissue."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think it's safe to say those two are total write-offs. When does the new Dumbledore come in, anyway?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Gambon started in the third one, yeah, Azkaban. So you can kinda pretend that's a soft reboot, I guess."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That works for me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ From here on, the kids actually try to act, also. Before, you get the sense that Columbus just propped them in the right positions and told them what face to pull."
