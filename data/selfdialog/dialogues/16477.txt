"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good documentary films lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Documentary? Didn't those go out of style years ago?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think so, I just thought that interesting ones wheren't being made."
"__MOVIES__ To be honest with you I think the only documentaries I've heard of that are recent are about crime."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Last year they made one about O.J Simpson."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the title of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was O.J : Made in America."
"__MOVIES__ Did they just cover the crime?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh no. They covered his early life, career, and then got into the dark areas of his life."
"__MOVIES__ Oh so it was more of a biography then?"
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't go that far. I mean yeah they talked about his early life and stuff but the main focus was the crime aspect."
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure they did that on purpose."
"__MOVIES__ Of course they did. I'm not even sure what sparked the idea to revisit this event."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure money was pretty much the goal of it."
"__MOVIES__ You are probably right on that note."
"__MOVIES__ Was the film at least interesting?"
"__MOVIES__ It had it's moments, I mean I knew everything there was to know about the crime, but his early life was all new to me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm sure it was new to all the viewers."
"__MOVIES__ At least it wasn't some kind of short segment, they were pretty detailed about his early life."
