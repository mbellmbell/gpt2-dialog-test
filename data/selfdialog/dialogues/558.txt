"__MUSIC__ Would you say that Reba McEntire is the queen of country music?"
"__MUSIC__ She is a legend in the country genre, but there is way to much competition to call her that."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean exactly?"
"__MUSIC__ I just feel like it would be hard to call her that over a few other singers so easily."
"__MUSIC__ She has so many awesome songs though! Have you ever heard of Fancy or Consider Me Gone?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and I agree that she is great, but there are a lot of other great ones!"
"__MUSIC__ Who else would you put on her level?"
"__MUSIC__ Well just to name a few, Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, or how about Faith Hill?"
"__MUSIC__ Those three are awesome and all, but I do not think they compare with Reba!"
"__MUSIC__ We will just have to agree to disagree on this issue then."
"__MUSIC__ Can you even name any major hits from the other three?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I can! They all had several big hits, but you want me to just name one from each of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, because I do not think that their hits are as popular as Reba's."
"__MUSIC__ Wrong again! Dolly had a little song called I Will Always Love You."
"__MUSIC__ I forgot that she actually sang that before Whitney Houston."
"__MUSIC__ Loretta Lynn had Coal miner's daughter. That was a major hit that came out in 1970."
"__MUSIC__ Yea I will concede that that is a popular song. Can not argue on that one."
"__MUSIC__ Faith Hill has a song called This Kiss that you may also recognize."
"__MUSIC__ I see what you are saying now, there are a lot of great women country music stars."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! That is why I say it would be so hard to simply name one of them the queen of country."
