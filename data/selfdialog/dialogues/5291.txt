"__STAR_WARS__ If you had to pick a Star Wars film to remove from the genre, what would it be?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is hard, I would have to say episode one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why is that? I like that one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I did not like the character, ahem, Jar Jar Binks ring any bells?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he is underrated, he provided comic relief."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was funny sure, but did he have to be in the movie for the plot to progress?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He did to go see the under water group."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, Jar Jar was an outcast. They would have seen them either way."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, you are right. Well, any other issues."
"__STAR_WARS__ They focused on  a child too much, made it seem like a kid's film."
