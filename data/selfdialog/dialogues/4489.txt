"__MUSIC__ Where do you think music is headed in the future?"
"__MUSIC__ That's an interesting question, since music has changed so much lately."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, with the digital age we've gone through a lot of weird music."
"__MUSIC__ I bet there's a lot of parallels with art. Rapid onset of musical genres. Jazz to hip hop to R&B to rap to elecronic, to trap."
"__MUSIC__ to dubstep, to EDM, to progressive, to house."
"__MUSIC__ You think there's always been this many genres?"
"__MUSIC__ No way. Before There was more of a normalization. Everyone listened to rock. Everyone listened to disco."
"__MUSIC__ Makes sense, since everybody had to listen to the radio for music."
"__MUSIC__ Then there were ipods, then there were free music streaming sites."
"__MUSIC__ So I guess this burst of music is a reflection of the tastes of different people."
"__MUSIC__ Blends of different cultures too, as the world becomes more multicultural."
"__MUSIC__ So it's safe to say that this explosion is still happening and will only expand?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wonder what other kind of genres there will be."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's like art. There is so many different kinds of historical art. In the modern movement it just exploded."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the movement just broke, to the point that that art became just about challenging previous movements."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if that'll happen to music"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe when there stops being new genres for music, and music will be forced to reinvent previous genres."
"__MUSIC__ Dada music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah dada music ."
