"__DISNEY__ Which did you like better, the live action Jungle Book or the original animated version?"
"__DISNEY__ I would say the original animated version, but I did enjoy the live action as well."
"__DISNEY__ I thought Bill Murray was hysterial as Baloo."
"__DISNEY__ Agree, he was the perfect choice.  All the real animals were amazing."
"__DISNEY__ I read that the boy who played Mowgli was never actually with the animals."
"__DISNEY__ It mush have been tricky for him to film his scenes, but it makes sense.  It would have been pretty dangerous."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was neat how the live action movie gave more information about how it was the Mowgli ended up in the jungle."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that wasn't something I had expected."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if Disney will make more of the animated classics into live action films."
"__DISNEY__ There are quite a few that would be good candidates, I think."
