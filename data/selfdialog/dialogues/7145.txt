"__LADY_GAGA__ What did you think about Lady Gaga's concert last night?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It was better than I thought it would be. I must admit that I had some reservations before going to the concert."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you mean? You never told me you had any reservations!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, you know how theatrical she can be."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That is true which is why I knew she would give a great concert!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I figured the concert would be more of a production rather than her singing."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know what you mean. Lady Gaga is quite a character."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, after going to her concert, I can say that I love everything about her character!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree. I think her character makes her unique from other musical artists."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Especially with the lack of talent from most musical artists today!"
