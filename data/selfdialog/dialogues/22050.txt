"__DISNEY__ How many times have you seen Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ My goodness, it's my daughter's favorite movie. I think I've seen it over 10 times!"
"__DISNEY__ My son loves singing 'Let It Go'! I'm going crazy!"
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean. The soundtrack is playing nonstop in my car. My daughter won't let me play anything else."
"__DISNEY__ I'm trying to get him to watch some of the more classic Disney movies, like Snow White or Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ We've watched the live-action Cinderella, which my daughter really liked."
"__DISNEY__ It just seems like every classic Disney movie has a really scary part that my son won't watch."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, either someone's parent dies like Bambi or there's a really scary monster like in Sleeping Beauty."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite Disney movie is The Little Mermaid. Great songs and so colorful!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree, that's a great movie but Ursula is just too scary for my daughter so we haven't watched past the beginning of that movie."
