"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you heard any of Lady Gaga's new album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I've heard a couple of the singles - 'Million Reasons' and 'The Cure'."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's okay. I'm disappointed, to be honest."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh really? Why?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It just isn't as catchy and poppy as I expected from Lady Gaga."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She did a whole swing album, didn't she?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, with Tony Bennett. She's really branching out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She seemed kind of the same as always at the Super Bowl performance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She only performed the big hits, most of which are quite old."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She was so huge a few years - her music was EVERYWHERE."
