"__MUSIC__ Did you ever go through a Justin Bieber phase?"
"__MUSIC__ Surprisingly, I did not."
"__MUSIC__ Really? You're the only girl I know who wasn't obsessed with him in middle school."
"__MUSIC__ I just never cared for him all that much."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like 'Love Yourself' at least?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'll admit I really like that song. It's relatively new, right?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm pretty sure it came out sometime last year."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite line of it is 'My mama don't like you and she likes everyone.'"
"__MUSIC__ I agree 100%. It's so true too."
"__MUSIC__ Right? My mom has the best perception on all of the guys I date."
"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with his older music at all?"
"__MUSIC__ I know like 'Baby' but I just really don't like it."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It just sounds super auto-tuned and I feel as though the lyrics are super uncreative."
"__MUSIC__ I could see how you feel that way."
"__MUSIC__ There doesn't appear to be any sort of originality to it and it's basically the chorus over and over."
"__MUSIC__ You still like, though?"
"__MUSIC__ I really do. I wouldn't say it's quality music or anything but it definitely puts me in a great mood."
"__MUSIC__ I understand. That's kind of how I feel about Miley Cyrus."
"__MUSIC__ That's exactly what I would relate my opinion too."
