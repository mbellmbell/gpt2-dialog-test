"__MUSIC__ You listen to any good music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I go through phases where I listen to a bunch of one kind of music all the time for a couple months or so."
"__MUSIC__ So what is it now?"
"__MUSIC__ Mainly Haggard."
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, well do you like neo-medeival music?"
"__MUSIC__ I... don't really know what that is."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. It's like medeival music redone in a fresh way."
"__MUSIC__ Well I probably would like it."
"__MUSIC__ Haggard is my favourite in the genre."
"__MUSIC__ We should listen to them together!"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. If you like metal, or if you like classical music, or both, you'd probably find at least some of their stuff enjoyable."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have any particular song that's really good?"
"__MUSIC__ To me personally, maybe Per Aspera Ad Astra."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds olde."
"__MUSIC__ It really is a modern sound though."
"__MUSIC__ I'll take your word for it."
"__MUSIC__ It's striking how something can sound both so old and new at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ Well that is rather intriguing."
"__MUSIC__ I'll write down the name for you so you remember to listen to it."
