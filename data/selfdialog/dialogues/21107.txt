"__THRILLER__ I saw 'Sanctum' recently. It's a thriller movie about an underwater cave diving expedition."
"__THRILLER__ What did you think of it?"
"__THRILLER__ First of all, it was surprisingly realistic. I actually learned a little bit about scuba diving."
"__THRILLER__ Does most of the film take place underwater?"
"__THRILLER__ Most of the film takes place in the cave the characters are exploring. The visuals in this film are just amazing."
"__THRILLER__ I'm guessing there's more to the movie than just beautiful scenery."
"__THRILLER__ Definitely. Not only does the tense and claustrophobic atmosphere immerse you in the movie, but so does the struggle for the characters' survival when disaster strikes."
"__THRILLER__ I imagine the fact that something like that could happen in real life adds to the experience."
"__THRILLER__ The movie is actually inspired by a real life cave diving expedition gone wrong."
"__THRILLER__ I heard one of the stunt divers in the film died while cave diving."
