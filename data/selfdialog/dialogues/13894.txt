"__BASKETBALL__ Wow! The NBA playoffs are sure strange this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, I know. There have been so many blowouts."
"__BASKETBALL__ Right.  How about the way the Celtics were demolished by the Cavaliers the other night.  Man, that was ugly."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Celtics are definitely done.  They might have had a slight chance against the Cavs but now that they've lost Thomas there's no way."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. And the Warriers sure are hammering the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I have a little sympathy for the Spurs.  Popovich is a great coach and I like his willingness to speak out about Trump."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea. And they've had so many injuries.  Losing Tony Parker was horrible and now they've lost another player.  Not even Pop can work miracles."
"__BASKETBALL__ True.  And even the Warriors have had a major loss -  their coach!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed.  Steve Kerr is one of the best in the business and its too bad his perrenial back problems are keeping him on the sidelines.  I hope the Warriors can overcome his absence.  I think they will."
"__BASKETBALL__ Steve Kerr was having a great career in Tucson as a player at Arizona when I lived there.  Sometimes I used the research library at the U of A and I would occasionally see him there taking care of classwork.  He was a quality person."
"__BASKETBALL__ Steve is a good man.  He would make a great President, unlike that clown we have now."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's nice to have basketball and other sports as a distraction when the country is falling apart."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hey, what about a pick-up game this afternoon. Are you up for that?  I need some exercise."
"__BASKETBALL__ You know I am!  Can we wait until late afternoon when it's a bit cooler? You know how I sweat like crazy when I play basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I remember.  I'll bring a cooler full of ice and drinks.  You bring what's left of your corner jump shot - otherwise you'll get destroyed."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, okay.  I get the message.  I am slowing down a bit with my advancing age.  I'm almost twenty-five!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Thinking about retiring, are you?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No way.  I wanna be playing basketball on the day I die."
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay.  See you at five or so.  I'll take it easy on you to keep you alive for one more day, at least."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hey, remember how we used to shoot hoops nonstop for hours in your driveway when we were in junior high?"
