"__MUSIC__ Why dont more female fronted bands exist?"
"__MUSIC__ Tough question to be honest"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think they all sound the same?"
"__MUSIC__ I could get into trouble answering that one."
"__MUSIC__ I believe there is a sort of generic sound they emit."
"__MUSIC__ I dont believe thats entirely true but I can see where you would think that."
"__MUSIC__ If I had to pick my druthers I would say they sound too close to one another."
"__MUSIC__ I agree there is a lack of variety in most of the music they create."
"__MUSIC__ If some female artists end up succeeding they make them solo artists."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds bizarre."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I know but they have the sex appeal in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I guess I can hanker on that one."
"__MUSIC__ Paramore was or is a great band."
"__MUSIC__ I dont know if they still make music."
"__MUSIC__ They definitely do I think their time passed though a bit while back."
"__MUSIC__ So they have short shelf lives?"
"__MUSIC__ It appears to be the answer."
"__MUSIC__ Geez that doesnt bode well for the up and coming acts."
"__MUSIC__ Its just the nature of the music industry."
"__MUSIC__ But chewing out and spitting out stinks no matter male or female"
