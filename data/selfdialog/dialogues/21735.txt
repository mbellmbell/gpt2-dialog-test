"__DISNEY__ Did you get to see the new Disney movie 'Cars 3' that came out this year?"
"__DISNEY__ I totally did I thought it was awesome!"
"__DISNEY__ So did I. I love the message that is was sending about having a strong sens of community and also that winning is not everything if it is at the expense of someone else's well being."
"__DISNEY__ Totally! It really honed in on the whole deal of moral values. We sure need a big dose of that these days."
"__DISNEY__ Indeed. These are the kids of messages I think that really need to be instilled in our kids."
"__DISNEY__ Hey I'm a big kid too (chuckles) but you're absolutely right. That's why I'll take a Disney Movie any day."
"__DISNEY__ I loved how they showed that sometimes you really have to loose to win."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah and sometimes based on what you do to win you end up being a Looser!!"
"__DISNEY__ They really stressed the need and the value in a strong sense of community which I think is lacking today, in a world that is so self oriented."
"__DISNEY__ Totally, we need each other and it is when we have a sense of community we could build something awesome. Yay Cars!!"
