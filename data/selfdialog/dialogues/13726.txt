"__BASKETBALL__ Do you see any possible Finals that wouldn't be Cavs-Warriors at this point?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It would shock me if it was anything else."
"__BASKETBALL__ I just can't see either of those teams losing four times in a series to anyone else."
"__BASKETBALL__ If it's Boston I guess they have a chance, since they have home advantage."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but Cleveland went in there last month and beat them by 25."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, and San Antonio doesn't seem healthy in the West."
"__BASKETBALL__ Boston at least may get the No.1 pick the draft."
"__BASKETBALL__ How would that work?"
"__BASKETBALL__ They have someone's pick through a trade in the past, I want to say New Jersey"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm hoping the Suns get the top pick. A 55-win team doesn't deserve to also get the top pick."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you take if you are Phoenix and you get the top one?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe Fultz from Washington..who else is there, Ball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, Ball or maybe Jackson from Kansas."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wonder about all of them. If Fultz is so great, how did Washington go 2-16 in league play?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well then there is the headache of getting Ball, or should I say his dad."
"__BASKETBALL__ And Jackson just doesn't seem like a franchise player...I guess I would take Fultz."
"__BASKETBALL__ Trading down would also be a possibility. Plus Ball said he would only play for Lakers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did he say that or his dad?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't remember, but he just seems like he would fit in L.A."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well Phoenix is fairly close to Los Angeles at least."
