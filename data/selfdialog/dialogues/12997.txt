"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite football team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In college or the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, the Denver Broncos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  Why?  You're from South Carolina."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I was little, I had an aunt who lived in Colorado and she sent me a Broncos shirt as a birthday present.  I didn't know it was a football team but I liked the little horsie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  That's why you like the team?  Because of a shirt when you were little?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You fell for the marketing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did.  But, that's why team merchandising is so important."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what's your second-favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding?  There's no such thing as a second-favorite team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what it if the Broncos are terrible?  Who do you support then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos!  They've been terrible before and probably will be again at some point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots have never been terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is this a joke?  Prior to Tom Brady, the Patriots were awful for virtually all of their entire existence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  I had no idea.  I'm super young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you support in the Super Bowl if the Broncos aren't in it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whichever team I hate the least."
