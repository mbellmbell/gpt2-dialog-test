"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen Rogue One: A Star Wars Story?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw it when it came out in theaters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked K-2SO best!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought he was great, especially since Alan Tudyk was his voice actor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think he is going to be in more Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think he would fit in the sequel to The Force Awakens since it is so far in the future."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Force Awakens has BB-8 though, and he is an awesome little droid."
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved when BB-8 got away with the map, like R2-D2 escaping with Leia's recording in A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a great throwback to the first movie!"
