"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen Ender's Game?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I've read the book. Have you seen the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm not sure what I think."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's too bad! I was thinking of going to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they have a great cast and the special effects are fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it does. Unfortunately, they did not utilize the cast until Ben Kingsley came into the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ They tried to cram too much into one movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad! There is a lot to the book."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, apparently it took many years to finally finish this movie. I guess there were a lot of disruptions."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad. Well, I might still go see it."
"__MOVIES__ The last quarter of the movie is great in my opinion. I felt like I finally got to know Ender better."
"__MOVIES__ What about the first three quarters?"
"__MOVIES__ They literally flew through the characters."
"__MOVIES__ You mean there's no character development?"
"__MOVIES__ No, hardly any, even though they had great actors for the parts. They just hardly gave them any lines or airtime."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll wait for it to come out on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the special effects make it worthwhile for the big screen. The battle room is awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'm going to go look up theaters that are still playing it. Thanks!"
