"__DISNEY__ You know I think that makes sense as a reason for Rapunzel's hair being gold..."
"__DISNEY__ So that there would be a color scheme?"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, I think disney does that a lot."
"__DISNEY__ I think so too."
"__DISNEY__ Like in 'Brave,' it is turquoise and orange with maybe some greens."
"__DISNEY__ In 'The Princess and the Frog,' the color scheme is greens, blues golds and maybe purples and browns for Facillier."
"__DISNEY__ With villains, I think you know something truely evil is happening based on how much green is in the frame."
"__DISNEY__ I've read an article about that."
"__DISNEY__ Apparently, the most evil scenes in Disney movies are the greenest."
"__DISNEY__ Like 'Be Prepared' in 'The Lion King.'"
