"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, I can't wait for football season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too! Its going to be a great year for receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems that offense has been ruling the NFL the past few seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  Who do you think has the best group of receivers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants, for sure!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! Look at the Patriots this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, they are only good because of Brady!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! Edelman would hold his own on any team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, he is shifty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brandon Cooks is a beast! He broke 1000 yards and 8 touchdowns in both of the last two seasons!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that really is impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it is! and on top of that they have Hogan and Mitchell, both of which have proven they can play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah maybe you are right, that is a pretty good receiver corps."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Giants only have Odell anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Brandon Marshall?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is to old now, maybe five years ago he would have made them better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Jets made him look bad last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they really did! The Jets made everyone look bad last year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, everybody on their team. They made their opponents look great!"
