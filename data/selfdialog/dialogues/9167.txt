"__BASEBALL__ Did you see that Giants game yesterday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah.  Happy flight home after that one."
"__BASEBALL__ It's about time!  They've been terrible on the road this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Not much better at home.  What do you think of that kid, Arroyo?"
"__BASEBALL__ Kid can hit!  He needs practice at third, though."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, Crawford will be back any day now.  He'll show him the ropes."
"__BASEBALL__ If he can learn 3rd as well as Duffy did, we'll have the best fielding infield in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Now if Belt will just start hitting . . ."
"__BASEBALL__ Dude, if he can keep getting on base by taking walks, I don't care if he never gets another home run."
"__BASEBALL__ A walk's as good as a single.  I'll take it."
"__BASEBALL__ You hate to see all that power go to waste, though."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah.  Maybe Bonds could work with him.  Give him some pointers."
"__BASEBALL__ Looks like Posey's all recovered from his concussion."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah baby!  3 homers in 3 days!"
"__BASEBALL__ Pence is even getting in on the action.  They won that game in the 9th, just like they used to."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah looks like they're finally feeling like a team.  Working together."
"__BASEBALL__ Gotta do something about the bullpen, though. Keep Kontos and Law, put Melancon on notice, and ship the rest of them out."
"__BASEBALL__ With Samardjia right behind them."
"__BASEBALL__ Amen to that."
"__BASEBALL__ Hope Bumgarner heals up soon.  Really miss his pitching and his bat"
