"__MOVIES__ Did you see another Top Gun may be made?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, thats absolutely disgraceful."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that?"
"__MOVIES__ Some movies should not be touched."
"__MOVIES__ I dont think Top Gun has that status."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it does not."
"__MOVIES__ So why would you make that assertion?"
"__MOVIES__ Its been far too long since the last one."
"__MOVIES__ And thats why they revive it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but for who?"
"__MOVIES__ The audience that watched it last time."
"__MOVIES__ That was almost 30 years ago!"
"__MOVIES__ And now you can introduce to the plot to a new audience."
"__MOVIES__ Tom Cruise is just too strange nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ People do not remember him as the normal Tom Cruise."
"__MOVIES__ Thats why they need to walk away."
"__MOVIES__ The Jack Reacher franchise has done well."
"__MOVIES__ OK and so did the Mission Impossible as well."
"__MOVIES__ I still think you leave well enough alone."
"__MOVIES__ Well thats Hollywood always repeating what works"
