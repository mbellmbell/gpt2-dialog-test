"__MOVIES__ What do you think about the latest blockbuster films?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you have any specific examples in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmm.. How about Guardians of the Galaxy 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, that film made a whopping 844.4 million dollars at the box office."
"__MOVIES__ Thats such a huge amount of money for one film to make."
"__MOVIES__ It sure is, I rather enjoyed that movie. I think it can be very easy to over do it with visual effects."
"__MOVIES__ I think it struck a good medium where despite relying entirely on computer generated images it still felt relate-able and real."
"__MOVIES__ That's no easy task when you consider how outlandish that film was."
"__MOVIES__ Some of the environments like the space scenes or the various alien planets were absolultey beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ What they are able to accomplish with computers now is incredible."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. It really is like a work of art. Those planets and scenes were images created from a blank slate."
"__MOVIES__ Its incredible what the human imagination can come up with."
"__MOVIES__ That's why although I think films rely too much on visual effects it doesn't doom them to failure."
"__MOVIES__ There is a certain amount of creativity that it takes to make something amazing and its no small amount."
"__MOVIES__ I think on average most movies that are almost entirely computer generated miss their mark."
"__MOVIES__ Some are good though, Avatar is a great example."
"__MOVIES__ Oh for sure some are really good, Star Wars comes to mind as well."
"__MOVIES__ Definetly, Star Wars might be the best space Odyssey of all time which by definition is composed almost entirely of computer generated images since we obviously can't film in space."
"__MOVIES__ The amount of money to make the spaceships alone would be far out of this world."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you did there."
