"__THRILLER__ Hey, are you familiar with the film The Losers."
"__THRILLER__ A little, I know it based on a comic series, but not much more than that."
"__THRILLER__ Well, the Losers are a CIA Black Ops team."
"__THRILLER__ Okay, the name is explained, but what about the plot?"
"__THRILLER__ The Losers are sent on a search and destroy mission to eliminate a Bolivian drug kingpin, but things go wrong."
"__THRILLER__ How so?"
"__THRILLER__ It turns out the kingpin uses child labor and that puts kids at ground zero for the airstrike they just called in."
"__THRILLER__ So I take it they try to help save the kids."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, but that ends with them disavowed and legally dead, while their sinister superior, called Max, works a bloody plot to make the US number one no matter how many innocent people have to die."
"__THRILLER__ Okay, sounds like a interesting fillm, I'll have to check it out."
