"__DISNEY__ Have you seem Bambi before?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, my mom took me when I was really little."
"__DISNEY__ I saw it on video."
"__DISNEY__ I was really young and got so upset about the fire and Bambi's mother getting killed."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that was pretty bad at that age."
"__DISNEY__ I also had a record LP that came with a book and when you heard a tinkling sound you were supposed to turn the page."
"__DISNEY__ What was the point of that?"
"__DISNEY__ It was as if the record was telling you the story and the tinkling sound had you follow along with the pictures."
"__DISNEY__ I'll bet that would be a collector's item now."
"__DISNEY__ No doubt, but we sold it at a garage sale years ago."
