"__MOVIES__ Have you seen all the trailers for the new Mummy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, the one with Tom Cruise?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, the trailers actually make it look alright, even though I know it will be terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see that accidentally released trailer where the sound was messed up."
"__MOVIES__ I do not think so."
"__MOVIES__ The studio messed up and uploaded an unfinished trailer for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Unfinished in what way?"
"__MOVIES__ There was no sound for a lot of it and random voices and noises."
"__MOVIES__ Like they messed up the audio track for it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, the video was edited fine, in fact most of it is what you see on TV now."
"__MOVIES__ That is pretty funny, someone probably got fired for that."
"__MOVIES__ You should check it out, the sounds make it so funny."
"__MOVIES__ I will, did you ever watch the original?"
"__MOVIES__ The Mummy with Brendan Fraser?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, from around 2000 or so."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I have seen it, it was terrible."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you won't be watching the new one then?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not, it's not for me."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, I was going to see if you wanted to come watch it but I guess not."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, thanks for the invite though."
