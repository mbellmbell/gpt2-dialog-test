"__STAR_WARS__ Are you a Star Wars fan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sort of, I like the three that were released first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's easy, The Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, Luke finding out Darth Vader is his father is hard to beat."
"__STAR_WARS__ Return of the Jedi runs a close second though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have always been a big fan of Jabba the Hut."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a rare one, you don't find too many Jabba fans out there."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, I don't think I have ever met another Jabba fan myself."
