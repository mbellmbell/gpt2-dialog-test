"__BEATLES__ Do you like the Beatles much?"
"__BEATLES__ I guess so, I mean they're pretty old aren't they? I do like Hey Jude, though."
"__BEATLES__ It's funny that I'm not that old, but they're such a part of my childhood anyway. I mean I wasn't even alive in the sixties."
"__BEATLES__ When was the first time you heard them?"
"__BEATLES__ Actually, we sung Octopus's Garden when I was in third grade for an elementary school performance."
"__BEATLES__ Cute!"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, and when I was in high school I played Eleanor Rigby for the orchestra."
"__BEATLES__ Does it translate well into classical music?"
"__BEATLES__ You wouldn't think so, but it does. It sounds gentler and very symphonic."
"__BEATLES__ I guess that's why their music endures--it's so versatile, and so mold-able."
