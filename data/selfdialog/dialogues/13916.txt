"__BASKETBALL__ So are you following the NBA playoffs this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I've caught several of the Spurs vs. Warriors games."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ooh, I hope you're not a Spurs fan."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean, I was, until these last three games."
"__BASKETBALL__ Just a fair weather fan?"
"__BASKETBALL__ When you're getting beat that badly, yeah."
"__BASKETBALL__ To be fair, y'all had a lot of injuries this season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh I have some choice words for Zaza."
"__BASKETBALL__ Him taking out Kawhi in game 1 like that was pretty brutal."
"__BASKETBALL__ Brutal? It was completely uncalled for and Zaza should be taken out."
"__BASKETBALL__ Taken out of the game, I hope you mean. His family received death threats over it."
"__BASKETBALL__ For real? Look, I'm mad at Zaza but don't take it out on his family."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. Him missing games two and three pretty much wrecked the Spurs chances."
"__BASKETBALL__ Warriors would have to mess up pretty badly at this point, they utterly wrecked us in game three."
"__BASKETBALL__ They looked pretty chill on the bench at the end there."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean, give us a break. They've got three of the top players in the conference, and we're down one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you hear that Zaza's likely to be out for game four?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Seriously? We're definitely not winning any games then."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. I think they figured there were no chances of the Spurs winning the match up so they might as well not risk injuring him more."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's fair I guess. Safety and health first, even if it means losing games."
