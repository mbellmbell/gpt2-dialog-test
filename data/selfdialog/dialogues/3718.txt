"__MUSIC__ I just heard Yuja Wang in concert."
"__MUSIC__ I wanted to go to that! How was she?"
"__MUSIC__ She's incredible. She sounds like someone 20 years older."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she can play anything, and learn anything super fast."
"__MUSIC__ Why didn't you go?"
"__MUSIC__ Her concerts are expensive like crazy. And for piano recitals, the seats to the left of the stage sell out instantly"
"__MUSIC__ Why the left and not the center, with the best acoustics?"
"__MUSIC__ For piano recitals, you sit on the left to watch the performer's hands go crazy."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ So, uncomfortable question."
"__MUSIC__ Go ahead."
"__MUSIC__ What was Yuja wearing?"
"__MUSIC__ You're asking what a classically-trained pianist was wearing to a concert? That's kind of rude."
"__MUSIC__ I'm only asking because she actually gets heavily criticized for it."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she's gorgeous and shows it. She typically wears low-cut dresses with high slits in the thigh."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I see what you mean. She wore a black skirt. I think I heard people wondering how she was able to sit and play the pedals the way she did."
"__MUSIC__ I feel bad for her that people actually bring that up, but they do."
"__MUSIC__ Either way, I had a blast."
"__MUSIC__ I subscribe to her YouTube channel. I actually know someone who met her!"
