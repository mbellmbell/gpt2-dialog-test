"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the band Tancred?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't, actually. Who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're sort of like an indie rock type band."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. What type of indie-rock music do they make? Do you think I'd like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think you would. Some of the music is really 90's girl-punk sounding. I love it."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! Sounds like something I'd like, definitely!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Actually, the band is technically just one girl."
"__MUSIC__ Anyone I'd know from another band or something."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe! Tancred is technically a 'solo project', I guess, by Jess Abbott from the band Now, Now."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I know them! They're the band that toured with Paramore a while back, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's them! Actually, I think some of the songs on Tancred's new album sound a little bit like Paramore."
"__MUSIC__ I still really love Paramore, so that sounds awesome."
"__MUSIC__ You should definitely check out their new album."
"__MUSIC__ I will. What's it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Out of the Garden."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. What song do you suggest I look up first?"
"__MUSIC__ My favorite song, by far, is Bed Case."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome. Looking that one up on Spotify right now. How'd you hear about Tancred?"
"__MUSIC__ I heard the song Bed Case, actually, on the NPR podcast All Songs Considered."
"__MUSIC__ I should keep up with newer music more by listening to podcasts like that too. Just started listening to the song. I love it!"
