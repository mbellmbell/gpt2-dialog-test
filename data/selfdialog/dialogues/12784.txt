"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So are you ready for NFL to start up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa, is it already that time of the year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, not until September, but that's pretty close now!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Huh, I honestly hadn't been keeping track. Not after my team's performance last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Carolina Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh. Ouch. Yeah, they haven't played well since they were in the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam's still quite the rookie; he's either good or he's just bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. And he's basically the only star player, I can't think of anyone else on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we got Julius Peppers on our defensive end. He's good in a pinch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot about him. Funny name, but a good player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to think that this is the year we get our act together, but I won't hold my breath."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the meantime, I can always count on my team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, please tell me you're not a Patriots fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it! Tom Brady is the man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm so ready for him to retire already."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're just jelly because we win all the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And cheat, Mr. DeflateGate! And get away with it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, I will admit that his punishment was a little light."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If a little light means they didn't even barely slap him on the hand, then yes."
