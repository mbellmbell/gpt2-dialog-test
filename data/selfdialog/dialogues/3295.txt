"__MUSIC__ You're a musician, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Duh."
"__MUSIC__ Are the stories about instruments being destroyed true?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Like, airlines breaking violins."
"__MUSIC__ Holy crap, yes. It's a nightmare."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, people who have expensive instruments on planes sometimes are forced to check them but they refuse because they'll be smashed."
"__MUSIC__ Are they?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, imagine a $15,000 violin for your concert that you're flying to being completely smashed because you can't protect it because they won't let you fly with it."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds horrible."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they don't respect musicians at all."
"__MUSIC__ Did it happen to you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup."
"__MUSIC__ What happened?"
"__MUSIC__ I was flying home with my undergrad band."
"__MUSIC__ What instrument?"
"__MUSIC__ Tuba."
"__MUSIC__ So, how'd it break?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw them THROW it in the plane and others on top of it. My valves were completely destroyed and they refused to pay for it."
