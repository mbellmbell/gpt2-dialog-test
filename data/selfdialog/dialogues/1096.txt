"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite movie?"
"__MUSIC__ Sound of Music, hands down."
"__MUSIC__ Wow there's an oldie but a goodie!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and I lived in Munich for a while. Used to take my visiting family to Salzburg. We'd sing all the songs on the train."
"__MUSIC__ Haha Lonely Goat Herd must have gone over big with the commuters."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I kind of hid under my seat for that one. My father is funny and bolder than I am."
"__MUSIC__ So much great music in that film. Was it Rodgers and Hammerstein?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! They did so many great film scores."
"__MUSIC__ Carousel and South Pacific!"
"__MUSIC__ King and I and Oklahoma!"
"__MUSIC__ But you always ridicule 'show tunes'..."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I don't know why, but there is a certain pageantry about Broadway shows that turns me off."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's so, 'trained', so theater school."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. The old movies, the musicals, they have more of a real feel."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, because it's 'real' to be walking down the street and break into song?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha you know what I meant. Can't explain it. Music Man Robert Preston yes, Music Man in front of Macy's parade no."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha I get that. School play lands somewhere in between."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. We had a smashing production of Brigadoon at my school when I was a kid."
"__MUSIC__ Ahh another great movie version - Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse!"
"__MUSIC__ The Heather on the Hill is a fave!"
