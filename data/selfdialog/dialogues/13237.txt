"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, do you know if Carson Palmer is playing another season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm pretty sure he is. I think he really wants the ring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Him and Fitzgerald both I guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think this may be their last season, though..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They they'd better get some young players and start grooming them for later"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really should get a few prospects now anyway. But I thought the back up QB was pretty good last season..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't think of his name though..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Stanton? I think that was his name.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Stanton. He did good though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was decent but we need another really strong starting quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And receivers, too. So, we basically need more offensive players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least we have a good running back. David Johnson is pretty impressive!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and he is young! Hopefully he will play for us for a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's hope so. We can't afford to lose him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait till they have the draft!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me, too, but it's always a bit nerve wracking..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right? I don't want teams like Cowboys getting good players!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh, I can't believe how good they were last season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! And how bad the Browns were...ha ha ha!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh my gosh! I'd hate to be a Browns fan!"
