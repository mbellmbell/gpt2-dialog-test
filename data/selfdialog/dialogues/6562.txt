"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the Jedi in Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they're awesome. And you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. Its interesting how some of their customs come from Eastern traditions."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess those customs were an influence on George Lucas at one point."
"__STAR_WARS__ So the Jedi had their own style of martial arts."
"__STAR_WARS__ Very cool right? And low-key at the same time."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Jedi are supposed to fashion their own lightsabers."
"__STAR_WARS__ Using a crystal, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the khyber crystal I think I heard."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that accounts for the different colors of light coming off individual lightsabers."
