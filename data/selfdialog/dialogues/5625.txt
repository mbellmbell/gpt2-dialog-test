"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of The Phantom Menace?"
"__STAR_WARS__ As a movie?  Pretty average, but the weak point of the franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know what you mean too much politics."
"__STAR_WARS__ At least we got Darth Maul though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, plus a young Obi Wan was pretty cool"
"__STAR_WARS__ And Liam Neison brought depth to the Jedi Order."
"__STAR_WARS__ The age difference between Anikan and Padme was a little creepy though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it was, and the part about him making C3PO."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, it didn't fit with the original movies very well."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, not really.  But again, at least we got Darth Maul."
