"__BEATLES__ Who were the original members of the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ The original band members were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best."
"__BEATLES__ When did Ringo Starr join the band?"
"__BEATLES__ Ringo replaced Pete Best as drummer in 1962."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's interesting. And when did Stuart Sutcliffe leave?"
"__BEATLES__ He left a few months before Pete Best because he decided to return to university."
"__BEATLES__ That's interesting. You never really hear about the other two in the band before Ringo."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, none of their really big hit songs were made during that time so maybe that's why."
"__BEATLES__ That makes sense. Either way, I'm glad they ended up with the members they did."
"__BEATLES__ Me too. Those four were all very talented."
