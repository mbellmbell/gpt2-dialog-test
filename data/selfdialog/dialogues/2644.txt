"__MUSIC__ What do you prefer: brass quintet, woodwind quintet, vocal quartet, or string quartet?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, definitely not the woodwinds, as I hate the squeaking."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, I used to play clarinet."
"__MUSIC__ And... you all squeak a lot."
"__MUSIC__ True. So which do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't like vocal quartets because they put me to sleep, sadly. Either brass or strings."
"__MUSIC__ I like strings the best."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because they can play two or more notes at once and are able to use a massive amount of range, there's so much more you can do."
"__MUSIC__ It's also a lot harder to write for them. Lots of young composers write literally impossible things."
"__MUSIC__ Really, like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Like moves that require you to move between the strings in very odd, uncomfortable ways. Or doing trills between two strings."
"__MUSIC__ What about brass?"
"__MUSIC__ I love them, but I'm biased."
"__MUSIC__ What do you love about them so much?"
"__MUSIC__ Big, rich, bold, full. Massive dynamics. Strength."
"__MUSIC__ Also known as 'loud.'"
"__MUSIC__ Ha, it can be. One trumpet can be louder than an entire string orchestra."
"__MUSIC__ really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but that's just how physics works. I like them too because of their timbres."
