"__DISNEY__ Did you know they're making a toy story 4?"
"__DISNEY__ I didn't, I loved the first 3."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, the new one comes out in 2019."
"__DISNEY__ It'll definitely be worth the wait for that."
"__DISNEY__ I think so too, I'm going to buy a Woody or Buzz Light Year doll for my cousin's birthday."
"__DISNEY__ I used to have a Woody toy of those as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I used to play with it all the time but I kind of wish it had been a Buzz Light Year toy."
"__DISNEY__ I'll end up buying him a Buzz toy instead then."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure he'll like it as much as I would have."
