"__HORROR__ Did you watch that scary movie with Jennifer Love Hewitt in it?"
"__HORROR__ The one from the 90s?  Was it called I Know What You Did Last Summer?"
"__HORROR__ Ah, yes, that is the one.  They ran over a guy on the road while drinking."
"__HORROR__ Freddie Prinze Jr is in it with Sarah Michelle Gellar too."
"__HORROR__ I always liked the fact that they are now married.  Still sad that Sarah died in the movie though."
"__HORROR__ She could have made it too if she just ran a little faster to the parade."
"__HORROR__ What about the death of her sister and the character Johnny Galecki played?"
"__HORROR__ I was confused about them dying since they had nothing to do with the accident."
"__HORROR__ I suppose the killer doesn't have to have a moral compass."
"__HORROR__ True.  Had some great jump scares without too more gore."
