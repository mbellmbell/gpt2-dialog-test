"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. That's a good question. I can definitely say that it won't be the Patriots again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not? They still have Tom Brady as quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there are a lot of other good up and coming teams this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you are right. I think the Cowboys look promising."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! I think Dak Prescott is going to have a great season this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm more excited about watching Ezekiel Elliot. I think he might break the all time rushing record one day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, he is a great player. But one thing about the Cowboys is that their defense isn't very good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right about that too. What team do you think will have a good defense this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers, of course, but they always have a good defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They drafted TJ Watt. Do you think he will be anything like his brother?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard he was even better, but only time will tell I suppose. I'm not sure about the Steelers offense though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you think Roethlisberger can win again this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has won some pretty impossible games, but overall he is inconsistent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Steelers can win their division again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they can as long as they can beat the Ravens, and as long as they can still get two free wins with the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this is the year for the Browns. They made a great draft choice with Myles Garrett."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm actually surprised they went with a defensive end and not another quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's probably because they already have a locker room of quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is really funny, but I think you're right. But I agree, I think they will definitely win more than one game this season."
