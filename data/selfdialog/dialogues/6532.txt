"__STAR_WARS__ The one where Luke and Ben meet Han and Chewie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was really neat when I was younger, but now not so much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, some of the costumes haven't aged very well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, some really ridiculous looking aliens"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked when Obi Wan chopped off the guy's arm though"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah that was cool. One of the first time seeing a lightsaber in action."
