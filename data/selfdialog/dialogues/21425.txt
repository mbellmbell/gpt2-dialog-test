"__DISNEY__ Hey, do you remember Toy Story?"
"__DISNEY__ I love that movie! My favorite character is Woody! 'Buzz, you're just a toy!'"
"__DISNEY__ I laughed so hard during the scene where all the toys confront Sid."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that was pretty funny. Kinda spooks me out thinking about my own toys though."
"__DISNEY__ Did you see Toy Story 3?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! I loved how it was based around Andy going to college, I could relate."
"__DISNEY__ The Toy Story movies sure have followed us throughout our lives."
"__DISNEY__ Lotso-Huggin bear was pretty conniving, but his story was sad. I could see why he was so cold-hearted."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and the scene at the end of the movie where the toys get rescued by their fellow toys was incredibly heartwarming."
"__DISNEY__ The whole Toy Story series was pretty much perfect."
