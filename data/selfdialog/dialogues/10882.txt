"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So pumped for the NFL coming back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After last season I can't wait for a new champion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you tired of the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't get me wrong, they are a good team, but I rather someone else win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean like your Rams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, that would be the day, but that is not happening any time soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I know, well they will have a bright future."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully, I just hope that Goff can become an NFL level quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am sure he will do good, he should have learned a lot while sitting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I kind of wish we took Carson Wentz, he looks like he will be legit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's good, but who knows, Goff hasn't had a real chance to shine yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is what I worry about, he hasn't beat out the current quarterback ahead of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well some players need more time to be ready."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess so, I just don't think he is the second coming of Aaron Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that is a tough model to live up to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well all I can do is hope for the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm rooting for you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Say, do you want to go to a Rams game this season? I can get tickets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would totally be down for it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cool, I will let you know once I get the tickets."
