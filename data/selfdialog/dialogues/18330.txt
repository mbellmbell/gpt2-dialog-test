"__MOVIES__ Have you seen many Stanley Kubrick movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw 'A Clockwork Orange' in college, but I'm not sure of any others he did."
"__MOVIES__ His most famous other than that is probably 'The Shining'."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes I have seen that creepy movie. What else did he direct?"
"__MOVIES__ He did '2001: A Space Odyssey', as well. The one with HAL, the computer."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that movie but I feel like I've heard a lot about it."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty groundbreaking when it came out, in terms of set design."
"__MOVIES__ It's from the 1960s, isn't it? It doesn't look it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was released in the 60s. But as you say, it stands up to the test of time."
"__MOVIES__ It's easy for old technology movies to look outdated very quick, but '2001' doesn't at all."
"__MOVIES__ 'Eyes Wide Shut' is another one of Kubrick's, with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise."
"__MOVIES__ I heard about that but never saw it - it was quite controversial."
"__MOVIES__ Most of Kubrick's films were. He himself actually banned 'A Clockwork Orange'."
"__MOVIES__ He banned it himself? Why?"
"__MOVIES__ He and his family were getting death threats after it came out because of the violence."
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of ironic, given the story of that film."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! So he banned it for him and his family's safety. It wasn't released again until his death."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, that's fascinating. I had no idea."
"__MOVIES__ There was quite a market for bootleg copies of 'A Clockwork Orange' before he died."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I can imagine. A story around it like that only fuels interest."
