"__DISNEY__ Where do you think the writers came up with the idea of 101 Dalmations?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know. Maybe it was a book or something."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe it was, but what about that author?"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe that author loved dalmations."
"__DISNEY__ Well you would have to love dalmations a lot if you wanted to have 101 of them."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah 101 is overkill, but 100 is just right."
"__DISNEY__ Haha what a joke!"
"__DISNEY__ I can't even begin to imagine having 102, like in the next movie."
"__DISNEY__ Don't even get me started."
"__DISNEY__ How about 101 Beagles?"
