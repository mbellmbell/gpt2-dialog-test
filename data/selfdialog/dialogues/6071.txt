"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder what it means by the last jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the jedi will try to unify themselves and not worry about light side and dark"
"__STAR_WARS__ In Rogue One there was the force user, should have been trained"
"__STAR_WARS__ There was no one to train him"
"__STAR_WARS__ It looks like Luke is in charge of them now"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Jedi don't get as much training as they used to"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe the Jedi and the Sith will join together to fight a common enemy"
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like Luke will have a son or daughter, they have to continue the family theme"
"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think the last jedi is, maybe Rey?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it just means Luke, since Rey and Finn aren't Jedi yet."
