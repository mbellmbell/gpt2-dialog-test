"__MOVIES__ I want to see the movie, Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I forgot that movie was coming out soon."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they don't make it all over the top and so far away from what I remember it being."
"__MOVIES__ Its the movie theater so it may be a bit over the top."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, maybe you are right."
"__MOVIES__ But the sounds and the effects will be good."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, certain lky they will not let Wonder Woman be bad."
"__MOVIES__ When you go let me know"
"__MOVIES__ I will. I don't know anyone in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I believe it is not the usual A list of actors, but I am not certain either."
"__MOVIES__ Or, should I just wait until I can see it online?"
"__MOVIES__ No, definitely go to the movies. That's where the experience is had."
"__MOVIES__ This is true, but they charge so much for movies."
"__MOVIES__ Treat yourself and go - there is nothing like the movie experience."
"__MOVIES__ I guess when you say it that way, its true"
"__MOVIES__ At the movies you can leave the mess to someone else to clean up and fix the sound for you"
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
"__MOVIES__ At the movies there are different flavors of butter gfor your popcorn too"
"__MOVIES__ OK, I am going to the movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Great! Let me know when"
