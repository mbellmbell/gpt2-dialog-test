"__MOVIES__ Hey, I was going to check out a movie and wondered if you could recommend one to me?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you like Johnny Depp in movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, most of his movies I really enjoy. I think he is a very good actor."
"__MOVIES__ Have you watched the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I am pretty sure I have seen them all, except the latest one. They are a big hit with my husband."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I went to the movies and watched the latest, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales"
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I did like it, but you know, it is very similar to the other movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well, I guess that is to be expected in sequels. Anything new?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, we watched it in 3D so I really enjoyed that."
"__MOVIES__ Cool! It's been a long time since I watched a movie in 3D. Was there many 3D effects?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, actually there were quite a few. Since it's a movie about pirates, you can imagine there were many water effects."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yes, I imagine. So, were there ever any sharks or anything scary that looked like they got you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I actually jumped a few times! There were a few scenes were it was so realistic!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I think that would be fun. Is it appropriate for younger children?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, but I guess it would depend on how strict you are with your child's movie viewing."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just don't like extremely graphic language or sexual content. Would it be safe in those areas?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, there might have been a few mild curse words, and maybe some language that was a bit sexual, but nothing really bad."
"__MOVIES__ So, would you take your younger children to see it?"
"__MOVIES__ I would, I think it would be a great family movie for your bunch!"
