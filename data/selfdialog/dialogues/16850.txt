"__MOVIES__ So what kind of shows have you been watching lately."
"__MOVIES__ I like to watch Survivor."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What do you like about Survivor?"
"__MOVIES__ Its a really interesting show about human reactions. I like watching how people behave in difficult situations like that; its the ultimate study on human behavior."
"__MOVIES__ Cool! I saw a show this last Spring called Hunted."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Its about pairs of people -- couples, friends, siblings -- and they have to evade FBI agents for forty days. If they can they get a quarter-of-a-million bucks!"
"__MOVIES__ What is the geographical region that they have available to them?"
"__MOVIES__ The have all of Georgia and some space in ajoining states, also."
"__MOVIES__ That's a huge amount of territory to hide out in!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, and yet, I was amazed how often the pairs of people got caught."
"__MOVIES__ What kinds of tactics did the pairs use to evade the FBI?"
"__MOVIES__ They drove around, hid in the woods; sometimes they woudl hide at a friend's house or at the house of a friend of their friend, so it would be harder to find them."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like it would be easy to hid out for fourty days!"
"__MOVIES__ It does, but some of these people woudl go on social media, make phone calls, and the FBI would know exactly where they were."
"__MOVIES__ Dude, we should totally do that!"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ We should go on that show, hide out in the woods, eat berries and stuff, live off the land; it'll be awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure that we're really that rugged. I'm gonna go to Starbucks; wanna come?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, why not!"
