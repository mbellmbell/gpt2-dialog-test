"__BEATLES__ I completely agree.  What was your favorite album"
"__BEATLES__ Hands down Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  What about you?"
"__BEATLES__ I'd say Yellow Submarine.  Just so many hits on that album"
"__BEATLES__ I think all of their albums had a ton of hits"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah that's true. I would love to have seen them live just once."
