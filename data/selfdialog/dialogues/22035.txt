"__DISNEY__ I watched National Treasure the other night."
"__DISNEY__ Why?"
"__DISNEY__ My daughter never saw the movie. It's pretty good."
"__DISNEY__ Weird that Nick Cage is in it."
"__DISNEY__ He's a goofy actor. It was sort of an action type movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I guess so."
"__DISNEY__ Well maybe more of an adventure."
"__DISNEY__ Thats pretty old isn't it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes from 2004 I think."
"__DISNEY__ Well considering Disney did it, I guess it couldn't have been boring for her."
