"__MOVIES__ I had a romantic date with Mike on Saturday."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Did you go out somewhere nice?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, no, we stayed home at his place."
"__MOVIES__ Did you make dinner?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he ordered in. We had a ton of Chinese food, and he bought two bouquets of flowers for the living room, and we watched a movie on dvd."
"__MOVIES__ What movie did you watch?"
"__MOVIES__ 'Titanic'. He said I'm his Rose, and he's my Jack, only he would never let go of me."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my, that does sound romantic. That movie was so sad at the end when Rose had to let go of Jack's dead hand and watch him slip into the water so she could blow the whistle for help."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I couldn't believe he had 'Titanic' on dvd. He said he's always loved boats, and wanted to know if I would like to go on a cruise with him someday."
"__MOVIES__ What did you say?"
"__MOVIES__ I said yes, but we would wear our life jackets the whole time!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh how funny. I don't know if I would want to go on a crusie after watching 'Titanic.'"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Rose did survive. Kate Winslet was so captivating in that role as Rose."
"__MOVIES__ Leonardo DiCaprio was so cute as Jack that lots of fans fell in love with him."
"__MOVIES__ The movie really stirred a lot of emotion in me when the life boats wouldn't turn back to help others because they didn't want to become too overloaded."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I felt like that one woman who was arguing with them and was so upset."
"__MOVIES__ That movie really made people feel and picture what it must have been like for al those poor people."
"__MOVIES__ You like to think it couldn't happen now, because boats are safer. But there have been some terrible ferries sinking, and there was that one big cruise ship that wrecked."
"__MOVIES__ I know, so 'Titanic' is just as relevant today about what could happen and what it's like."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe you should suggest to Mike instead of a cruise, you just take a beach holiday and watch the boats out on the water!"
