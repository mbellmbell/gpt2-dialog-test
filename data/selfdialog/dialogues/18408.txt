"__MOVIES__ What do you prefer dramatic or comedy movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I say Drama is an overall stronger category of movie."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. But one cannot discount comedy."
"__MOVIES__ I have actually heard it can be harder to do comedy well than a dramatic role."
"__MOVIES__ Well dramatic situation usually have so much emotion involved, leads to a good moving performance."
"__MOVIES__ Ya it plays on people's emotion like sympathy."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Where to be good in a comedy, you really have to be on in your timing and delivery."
"__MOVIES__ True, Timing is everything in comedies."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes I feel good comedic timing is a skill you are born with or not."
"__MOVIES__ I think it can be learnt."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe but some have it naturally."
"__MOVIES__ I think it is more of an instinct in actors than a skill per say."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough, but an actor like Goldie Hawn to me is just born a comedic genius."
"__MOVIES__ I do think she is great. A natural clown to some degree."
"__MOVIES__ I heard she was in a fairly dramatic stage role and yet the audience laughed at her."
"__MOVIES__ I had heard that as well. That was when she realized she was funny."
"__MOVIES__ Ya just something natural in her delivery and timing is pure comedic genius."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen her new film with amy schumer?"
"__MOVIES__ I have not yet seen it , but plan to soon."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet, heard not great reviews."
