"__MOVIES__ I watched It's A Wonderful Life last night for the first time."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool what did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it overall but I just can't get into old movies for some reason."
"__MOVIES__ What's the problem?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure if it's the way people acted back then or if I just can't get into black and white film."
"__MOVIES__ Stories are stories no matter what."
"__MOVIES__ While that's true the way they are presented can still get to me, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Without being confrontational yeah I know what you're saying."
"__MOVIES__ For example I don't read a lot because I can't use my imagination as well, so I turn to movies."
"__MOVIES__ But It's A Wonderful Life is a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and a really good one, but it was an example based around how things are presented."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you're saying, though I have some recommendations of older films you might like."
"__MOVIES__ I'd rather you not because I likely won't get to them."
"__MOVIES__ Well back to It's A Wonderful Life, what did you think of the story?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved the idea of it and it's an absolute classic."
"__MOVIES__ I am glad you agree with that at least."
"__MOVIES__ But again I just can't get into black and white."
"__MOVIES__ Everyone is different I suppose."
"__MOVIES__ And the way everyone talks like they're trying to sleuth a case."
"__MOVIES__ Okay now you're just being funny."
