"__STAR_WARS__ Did you enjoy the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I did, made me cry though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, when Han died?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the whole scene. Him meeting his son again."
"__STAR_WARS__ And then boom, he died. It was really anticlimatic."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that was the point. That death was easy for Kylo Ren, even patricide."
"__STAR_WARS__ I cried when the Wookie wailed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Chewie? That was the saddest part, he did not want to leave his friend."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was sad Rey did not get to know him better, she admired him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was glad she did a little bit, she got to meet and know him."
