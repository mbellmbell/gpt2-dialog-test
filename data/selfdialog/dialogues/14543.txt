"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi there! How are you doing today?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Fine, thanks, how about you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm good, thanks. I just finished watching 'Fury', have you ever seen that movie?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Is that the one with Brad Pitt in it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, it was a long movie, but probably one of the best war movies I've seen in awhile."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's funny, because last week-end, my boyfriend really wanted me to watch it with him, but it was so long, I fell asleep!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You'll have to watch it again sometime, it's really good. But of course, anything with Brad Pitt in it has to be good!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not necessarily.....he's had some bombs!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's true. I recently saw the trailer for 'Berlin Syndrome'; the leading actress is Teresa Palmer."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not sure I've heard of that movie or the actress."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The movie is a thriller and looks really good. Teresa Palmer was also in 'The Choice' and a lot of other good movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah, gotcha, now I know who you mean. I'll have to watch the trailer to that, I like her too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sometimes I can't figure out if I like the actual movie better, or the songs that they play in the movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I was going to say the same thing, when you mentioned the movie 'The Choice'!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, I love that kind of music!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have the soundtrack from the movie 'The Choice'! There's a lot of classical music on there by Marcelo Zarvos."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Now you have me wanting to go watch it again, to listen to them more closely."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Do it! The songs are quite relaxing and take you to places that one can only dream of!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm going to the Video store later today to pick up a copy of it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Better yet, just go out and buy the soundtrack; you won't be disappointed!"
