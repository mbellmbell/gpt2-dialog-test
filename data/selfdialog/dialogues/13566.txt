"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey there! I am trying to decide who is a better football player, Eli or Peyton Manning. What do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will always like Peyton Manning better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean come on. He is a for sure Hall of Famer and a 5 time NFL MVP. He was unbelievable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but Eli Manning is a 2 time Super Bowl MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton has won that award too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli Manning is going to the Hall of Fame too. I mean you can't use that as a comparison."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is tough to compare the two. They are both so good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also both have 2 super bowl rings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but when Peyton was on his game, he was so accurate with the ball. He had better location than anyone in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes but Eli can beat defense on his feet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true but Peyton doesn't need to beat defense on his feet because he knows the game so well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does that mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton beats defense with his brain. He knows more about the defense of the other team than the other team knows about themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess Peyton is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He completely is! And look at the record of them playing against each other in the NFL. Peyton's teams have gone undefeated versus Eli."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true too. Well maybe you have me on this one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, so Peyton Manning is the better quarterback. You win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! I knew I was right!"
