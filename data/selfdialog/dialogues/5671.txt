"__STAR_WARS__ Did you hear there's going to be a Boba Fett movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard about it. Then I heard it was cancelled!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard it's back in on again! I'm excited about it. Boba Fett has been one of my favorite characters in the Star Wars universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's definitely a big fan favorite, and it's funny if you think about it because he doesn't say much. If they're planning on it again that's great news!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think he's ever uttered a word! His first appearance was in Return of the Jedi right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was in the whole original Trilogy! George Lucas later added him into Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't realize it! It must have been the new remastered digital releases."
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes a lot of sense, since Boba Fett was really a branch or character that was connected to Han Solo's background."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, originally he was in Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi but on the remastered Star Wars, Lucas brought him in."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's so good, I'll have to watch for him when I watch the Star Wars Trilogy again this weekend!"
