"__STAR_WARS__ I wish 'Rogue One' was more Jedi stuff in it."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it just felt different than the other Star Wars movies to me. It was more battle stuff and not enough Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but it made sense for the overall plot that it played out like it did. It was about regular people doing what needed to be done."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I guess you're right. I did like that aspect of it though. The rebels being just soldiers, doing their duty, at all costs, to get the plans to the Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would have been a totally different movie if it had been Obi Wan and Yoda and all the other Jedi in that battle."
"__STAR_WARS__ True. The ultimate sacrifice of Jynn, Cassian, K2-SO and the rest of the rebel group made the victory that much richer."
"__STAR_WARS__ But don't worry, you'll get your Jedi fix soon. The next movie is called 'The Last Jedi' after all!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Woohoo! I can't wait. Want to go see it together?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I wouldn't miss it!"
