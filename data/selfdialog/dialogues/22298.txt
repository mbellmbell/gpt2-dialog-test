"__DISNEY__ Did you like the recent Beauty and the Beast movie or did you like Cinderella more?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked Cinderella more. I felt there was more heart."
"__DISNEY__ I thought both were realy fun entertaining movies. Beauty and the Beast starred Emma Watson and had really good musical pieces."
"__DISNEY__ I enjoyed them both but I felt Cinderella had more heart. I also really enjoyed Cate Blanchett's performance as the wicked step mother."
"__DISNEY__ I'm a huge Lily James fan now because of Cinderella, but Emma Watson will always be my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ I know you're a huge Emma fan, but Lily James gave a more sympathetic performance."
"__DISNEY__ I think that has more to do with the character of Cinderella. She's just more sympathetic as a whole."
"__DISNEY__ She did lose her parents and had to succumb to such wickedness from her step mother and step sisters."
"__DISNEY__ Right, while Belle was kind of snobby being intellectually superior to her village. The CGI in Beauty and the Beast was definitely fantastic."
"__DISNEY__ I thought both did a wonderful job. Don't forget about Fairy God Mother's transformations of the farm items into the carriage and all the magic she used!"
