"__MOVIES__ What do you think of Blade Runner: 2049?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh, that Johann Johannson score in the trailer is amazing!"
"__MOVIES__ For sure, it hits all the right Vangelis notes while remaining its own thing."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear his score for Arrival?"
"__MOVIES__ For sure, it was ridiculously beautiful and downright chilling at times."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it, all those wordless melodies and experimental percussion."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, I saw the trailer and have to say I'm getting a sweet The Martian vibe."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, looks like Ridley Scott must have shared his production notes from that movie with the Blade Runner director."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know the Blade Runner director is actually the same guy who did Arrival?"
"__MOVIES__ Denis Villeneuve? I had no idea!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm happy to see Scott handed off the reins after messing up Alien Covenant and Prometheus so badly!"
"__MOVIES__ Whoof, those were some hard to watch movies."
"__MOVIES__ Then again, Prometheus had one hell of a trailer."
"__MOVIES__ Just like Blade Runner 2049, uh oh."
"__MOVIES__ While we're on the topic of dark sci-fi, what do you think of the eventual Matrix reboot?"
"__MOVIES__ Possibly a terrible idea, but maybe not if they get Jordan Peele to do it."
"__MOVIES__ Is that possible?"
"__MOVIES__ It's certainly in the realm, because Warner Bros wants him for the White Akira movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh god that would be awful!"
"__MOVIES__ Give him the Matrix instead, he showed how to do mind-benders with Get Out."
